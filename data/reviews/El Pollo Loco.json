{"text":"Love The chicken flavor.  The chicken and shrimp  to stadia under 500 calories is great.  Not very many parking spaces but worth the walk."}
{"text":"where the heck are they getting their chickens?

8 pieces of chicken barely filled half of my foam tray.  the other half had bean & mashed potatoes cup.  their chicken is the smaller, smallest of the town.  they are chicks, not chickens.


hey, the owner of this dump.

i will never come to your place again.   and i will be the voice of consumers who are sick of getting ripped off by people or group like you.!!

People...  PLEASE stop patronizing places like this!!"}
{"text":"I could give his place a long horrible review but instead, I'm just gonna give it 1 star and leave it at that. My kids quesadillas didn't have any cheese (as you can see in my pics) please do not eat here! This is gonna be one of my shorter reviews, my pics do the review"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE'!!!!!!!!!!! We always get the best service and most delicious food, my fav thing is their chicken taco salad with the cilantro lime dressing!!!!!! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I've been here enough times to know that they may occasionally make a mistake, but they're always quick to fix it. Great food, great employees."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place. their creamy celantro dressing is sooo good."}
{"text":"Extremely concerned about this place. First they had no chicken ready at 6:00. The height of the dinner rush. In their hast I observed multiple health code violations. When I called corporate to voice my concerns the woman did everything she could to get me off the phone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. I dig half chicken meal. Staff was cool. The salsa bar was clean with all fresh salsa. Their bacon is so good and the chicken reminds me of the awesome chicken I had in Puerto Rico a long time ago. Flavor all the way down in the meat not just on the outside like some places. I'll be back here often."}
{"text":"Never again will I return.  The culture of this location is anti-white people.  Get treated bad every time I go here. I'm done.  I will wait for the Popeyes to open across the street or hit up the KFC."}
{"text":"Worst place to grab a late dinner. I showed up at around 11:45pm on 8/31/12 to grab a last minute dinner not knowing they closed at 11pm and nobody even cared to assist me or tell me that they closed down the register. Tell me something instead of having me wait while half your staff sits on their butts by the trash cans. Acknowledge your guest and show some respect."}
{"text":"Not bad food but not for me. Too one dimensional unless all you really want is average chicken in a tortilla."}
{"text":"Would give this place less then one star. Went today on my lunch and waited in the drive through for 15 mins. Finally get back to work and the chicken is burnt, the tortilla is as hard as rock. So that went into the garbage. I wouldn't go there again!"}
{"text":"Although I absolutely love the chicken and great taste of everything at el pollo loco... This particular location is ALWAYS.... Out of stuff! Everything from.... Cilantro dressing to marinade for chicken to sides to actual CHICKEN!!!! How do u run out of chicken!!?!? And that has happened to me twice! The manager and owner really need to get ahold of the demand for service if they want to raise revenue... Or maybe they are ok... Just serving who they can with WHAT they have. Plus service is a joke! Most employees think it's funny that they are out of supplies! I don't ! Especially when u have already waited in their drive thru for over 20 mins to only hear.... \"Sorry ..we r out of chicken AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"The food smells a lot better that it tastes. This is my first time here maybe they were having a bad night. I will try them again in the future."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ever at this location. I had the unfortunate event of ordering my food and getting home to find that my order was wrong!!! I ordered TWO chicken bowls , one for me and one for my husband. Along with 2 chicken legs for my 2 small kids,,, well not to mention that not only did I have to miss out on dinner with my family and drive back 15MINUTES , but I also got such a disapontment with the managers way of \"fixing\" things. Since they did not get my order right and failed to add a second chicken bowl to my order the \"kind\" store manager was going to give me 2 free chicken bowls ( I would get home and have 3 chicken bowls) ,,, I said no , I don't need 3  chicken bowls I only need what I ordered 2 chicken bowls. I said I wanted my order refund since I had to drive back and miss dinner with my family and my time and gas is not free , and giving me a 3rd bowl would not work since we are only two at home. The assistant manager Guillermo said no, his boss the store manager told him I get 2 bowls and that's it!! When I asked him what he wanted me to do with the third extra bowl that I didn't need, he shrug his shoulders and said that's all you get. He got his store manager on the phone and I got the same attitude from him. I'm not pleased that they tried solving the problem by being wasteful with food after I told them it was no good since no one would eat it and would just be WASTED FOOD. They could of just refunded my order of only $20, APPOLIGIZED for their mistake instead of giving me attitude  , saved a paying  coustomer, and NOT HELD UP THEIR DRIVE THRU LINE for another 15 minutes and piss off even more customers. As a business owner my self, I would rather lose $20 and keep my coustomer happy and coming back ,,,than to anger them by \"fixing\" my mistake with what I THINK is right even after the fact they just told me it would be wasteful. As I was leaving with my one chicken bowl the asistant Guillermo was so apologetic and said if it was up to him it would have been a different story. I wonder if he really sympathized to see me so irritated or if he just said that since I asked for regional managers information. Sooo what did I leave with after that? Just the 1 chicken bowl that was missing to begin with ,,, AND STILL WRONG!!! I asked for no tomatoes or pico de gallo,,,and yes sir, sure enough my food had pico de gallo on it when I got home. I even double checked that the only tomatoes on it was the one from the pico and the lady said yes. It's sad since I'm pregnant and have been having cravings of their pollo bowl and I had been there 3 TIMES THIS WEEK. Still have proof of my receipts that I plan on e -mailing their regional manager Jose Camarena.  Shame on me for not reading their reviews before going to this location. Sad to read so many people are dissatisfied as well with this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service in the drive thru.  Waited 15 minutes for a family meal, and they failed to include salsas requested or tortillas.  Food not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Service was rude. All the tables and floors were so dirty. We asked for something to clean a table and the person had to ask the manager. They finally cleaned our table and left all the other ones dirty. There was food and paper and lids on the floor. Makes you wonder how dirty the area is where they prepare the food. There was only one other person who came in after us so they were not busy, but by the time we got our food it was cold. They had to remake some of it.  Last time we went there they had run out of chicken. Probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"This must be the worst restaurant food I've ever had. I tried Pollo Loco in Tempe and liked it. It offered healthy options at reasonable prices, well-seasoned grilled chicken and fresh veggies.

This location is horrible though. My bean chicken salad had almost no veggies other than iceberg lettuce. The few veggies it did have and the veggies they offer as free sides were *spoiled*. Cilantro leaves were black, tomato was sour and everything was soggy and tasted old, if not rotten.

The staff was nice and helpful, but the food was terrible. I can buy a chicken salad at McDonalds for the same price and get way better quality food and more veggies.

Not ok. I'm surprised they get away with this."}
{"text":"The chicken was so dry and crusty,  I've eaten at other el pollos loco they were fine this one has had a lot of complaints similar to mine.  Would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love El Pollo!  I had ignored it until recently when ads drew me back!  The new items especially ones with chicken and avocado are great...fresh ingredients and very flavorful....my new go-to place once or twice a week!!"}
{"text":"Went back there yesterday and the experience was so so much better. I'm glad I gave it another chance. Also my order was correct unlike the previous time I went there."}
{"text":"Reading thru the latest entries, it's no surprise that my visit here was unmemorable bordering on tragic.  The cashier was rude, and kept looking at me with that \"hurry up\", eyes-open-wide gesture that infuriates me.  Sorry, Madame...it's my first time at this dump, forgive me if I don't have the menu memorized or know what's included in each dish.  If I could use one word to describe the dining area, it would be \"sticky\".  The floors, tables and chairs all needed a good cleaning.  The food I received was not great either.  The chicken chipotle burrito had way too much cilantro in it.  A little of that stuff goes a long way, and I had to (discreetly) keep picking cilantro stems out of my mouth and out of the burrito.  For a burrito that was completely standard in every respect, some cold tortilla chips and a small drink, the total came to $8.xx.  The only reason I stopped here was because it's on the way from Phoenix to MCC, but from now on I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just sat down and had the chicken and Baka shrimp bowl. It was delicious but they only gave me four shrimp. The tables needed to be wiped down as well."}
{"text":"Good thing I stacked up at the sauce bar because they forgot my salad dressing. An \"advocado mango salad\" with one slice of advocado? So I asked for more and he grabs it with a napkin.... Also, the description said nothing about cheese so why was there cheese... No emotion from the cashier. Smiling makes the time go faster just so you know sir! 
But seriously the cashier was touching everyone's food without washing his hand it was one step away from being gross. Restaraunt needs more energy, better service. but chicken was perfect!"}
{"text":"Always a bad attitude at the window and my order is always wrong. Yesterday's salad was very dirty. The extra dressing I asked for, was \"one\" good size container, but it was only half filled. I will not return."}
{"text":"The food is always warm, fresh, & delicious. However, this location always messes up the order. A forgotten side, no dressing for salad, no condiments for soup, etc. Check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. Service is fast and workers are friendly. Ordered the Grandes Tacos with guacamole and it was only $6."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a El Pollo Loco. So I've been going to this one on N Durango in Centennial Hills area.  I've been here twice and I've been disappointed.  The chicken takes a little old, I can't quite put my finger on it.  I can only say that the flavor of the chicken is not what I was use to when El Pollo Loco first came to Vegas.  I'd rather buy a roasted chicken at Sam's club or the super market."}
{"text":"great chicken!  i dont do the sides. i try to just eat the chicken, peel the skin, salsa, and sneak a small pce of tortilla. 

i'm getttin this tonight. 

i forget about this place sometimes, and i dont know why. the service is always great, and the food is hot. Contrary to the name, the chicken hasnt made me crazy......well crazIER."}
{"text":"Chicken here IS pretty dry sometimes, like the other guy said, but overall I haven't had any bad experiences at this one."}
{"text":"This place is alway busy! I always get the salads, they are so yummy. It's a hit or miss with the staff, some nice some rude."}
{"text":"Very disappointed !
I have been eating at El Pollo Loco  for years but last night I was so disappointed the food that i ate it tasted so bad I won't come back here for a long long time."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the double chicken avocado bowl. Chicken was nice and tender with a slight delicious char to it. Salsa bar was good, love the different types they offer some have a good kick to it. Everything mixed well together especially with the hot tortilla that's included with the meal. Staff was very friendly !"}
{"text":"For fast food it's pretty yummy! I love the house salsa and the staff is always quick and pleasant :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, no issues whatsoever. Even if I had bad service I wouldn't complain out of fear for boogers and cum."}
{"text":"Awful Pollo Loco in phoenix. The few times I have visited this location they always get my order wrong. I order salad and they give me a different type of salad. Recently I tried to give this location another chance so I ordered tacos al carbon and they gave me a different kind of meat. They ask me what kind of salsa I want and they give me something different.  I should just tell them to give me whatever they want and I'll pay for it. I feel that its not difficult for them to put chicken on a tortilla when someone orders a taco. I have talked to managers in past and all they do is apologize. I will never visit this location EVER again because they obviously do not care about getting orders right."}
{"text":"We  looked forward to trying the new El Pollo Loco by our house and unfortunately we're very disappointed. Got the family meal, some of the chicken was bloody, the churros  were soggy with grease, the salad was wilted. I paid extra for 4 breasts and they gave me me 3 and a wing and it cost me 28.00"}
{"text":"I got the avocado chicken bowl.  It was good except for the fact it only had 1/2 slice of avocado........."}
{"text":"Service is great the shrimp tacos are delicious super nice folks and the food is real!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late Snack about 9pm Ordered taco platter and double ck salad! As I'm pulling up I see the China cook yelling at the other employees! Like really buddy ! They should be yelling at him for running out of rice 1 hour before close and for being lazy and not making more because it only takes about 20 min to cook but he rather us sub our sides ! No Rice and I got burned Chicken ! It looked like it had been sitting and when ordered The china Cook just threw it on the grill and attempted to reheat it but failed because it was just Luke Warm because when I pulled up at home it's was all cold  and Tortillas for tacos weren't even heated up properly. I haven't  been to that pollo since about early may and same thing happened ! This place needs some attention! I called and Gal who answered was rude and not wanting to really help offered me more food like yea I'm gonna drive back for more old food and just hung up on me ! Didn't even apologize! sad! I think she forgot we pay her Paycheck!"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed yet again by this location. I was probably the last customer of the night, ordering through the drive thru at 1040 PM, which is plenty of time for a fast food restaurant that closes at 11 to serve guests. The crew member tells me they are out of crunchy chicken tacos, which I am totally okay with, except for the fact this seemingly always happens later in the night. I order a double chicken bowl, as that would be my next choice. I return home (i live one block away) to discover my food is ice cold, working in food service, I'm sure they took their station apart early in hopes of getting to leave on 11 at the dot. I call the location at 11:05, knowing there is still crew there. First attempt to call, the phone rings and rings and rings, no answer. Second attempt, someone answers, I begin to speak, and am hung up on seconds later. I will return tomorrow morning to speak to the management, this is ludicrous and a terrible example of customer service. I patronize this restaurant frequently, but maybe I can look to spend my money elsewhere as I was totally disregarded as a guest. Terrible terrible experience"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken meal here and all I got was small over cooked pieces of chicken.  Called back and complained to the manager and he said he would give me a free meal which I thought was great!  But when going there a week later to get the free meal...the manager had a rude attitude and treated me like I was lying about my complaint.  When he looks at by receipt he asked if something was wrong then why did I do the survey on the bottom of the receipt and as I'm explaining what I put in the survey...he just walks off mumbling something.  As a manager, he definitely needs better customer service and I'm definitely not going back here again."}
{"text":"New product, Shredded beef !! It comes in tacos, stuffed quesadilla and beef bowl it is really good kinda pricey but to me it's worth it. My favorite is the shredded beef tacos it has a chipotle sauce (not spicy) lettuce,jack cheese and pico de gallo. Should try before its gone !"}
{"text":"If anybody gives this location anymore than one star that person has not been coming to El polo loco for very long. I've been coming to el pollo loco for over 30 years and every other location I've been to has been consistent in flavor and quality but not this place. I tried this location when they first opened and was so disappointed the chicken was dry and the rice was a pink color not the normal brownish color  it was also sticky and tasteless.      I decided to give them a second chance today and tried the new Barbacoa tacos,  boy what a mistake there was barley a sign of meat and they were cold.  Now on to the salsas they might look the same but they're not they lack in the usual flavor.  I had the salsa Roja and salsa Avocado boy what a let down I usually enjoy these 2 salsa. It's a shame because I was so exited to see this place being built in Ahwatukee especially after the one near Home Depot closed. I hope they get some support from their regional office to retrain them, but I don't know if I'll be back. I've lived in Ahwatukee for 20 years and I'll take the extra drive to the one at the corner of Arizona mills"}
{"text":"This place is great.   After driving on I15, we stop here every time we visit Las Vegas.   I love the grilled chicken because the spices are just right.   I especially like the tortilla soup and the citrus marinated chicken."}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied! Walked in during lunch hour with my family, not to mention, they were extremely busy, they still managed to offer excellent service. Ordered my family (5 of us) food and was done in just a few minutes. Food was amazing, great customer service, very fast food service, what else can we ask for? Definitely bringing my family and myself again!"}
{"text":"Really bad services they don't even know what their talking about. I ask if they had onions guy was rude said NO never coming to this location"}
{"text":"Great chicken very flavorful! One of the best El Pollo Loco I've been to ever."}
{"text":"Everything from El Polo Loco is not very tasteful to me. Food you can make your own at home. #Basic"}
{"text":"Awful service all 3 times, twice driving thru and once as a walk-in; items left off order all 3 times; rude employees."}
{"text":"This review is about the terrible service at this location, not the food.  I enjoy the food at EPL but I will not patronize this location in the future because of their terrible customer service.  Here are some examples:

A few days ago I went to get dinner at this location at around 6 pm.  There were 7 people in line and one cashier - that's right one cashier.  I waited in line for about 10 minutes and then decided to leave -- I was 3 customers back from getting served.  This is the third time such a situation has happened to me at this EPL location.  How can a \"fast food\" restaurant have only one cashier working during dinner hours?

Another problem is the drive through.  I have used the drive though on two occasions hoping that this might be faster than going into the restaurant.  Of course I was wrong.  Both times my wait to get a very simple order of 2-3 items was over 20 minutes.  How can a drive through at any fast food restaurant take over 20 minutes?  And when I got home my order was incorrect.  Ridiculous.

There are several EPLs in Henderson which I have patronized.  None of them have these customer service issues.  Obviously this location is poorly managed and customer service is not a priority.  I will not eat at this EPL ever again and I will take my business to similar restaurants in the area such as Robertos, Rubios, or Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Have been a customer for over 25 years. Today made me an ex-customer and I am really sad about it. I went in a little after 2 pm, the place had about 5 other customers and the lobby was a mess. Tables were dirty with crumbs, trash and food on the floor, under tables. It was bad. I ordered a combo #2, breast and wing with corn cake, corn cobbette, flour torts and salsa. The cashier was friendly and efficient. My 10 minute wait for my food had me wiping the table with napkins (I had to ask for them as the napkin holders were empty) I shoved the food and napkins that were scattered under the table, under the opposite bench where I sat. I got my tray of food and asked for butter and salt for my corn, noticing as I waited, that I got a leg instead of a wing. Why? Anyway, I sat at my table and started with the corn cake, it was pretty good, however, several bites in, I noticed discoloration, it was darker and it tasted \"old\". So, I put that aside and got to my corn cobbette. Looking at it, I should have listened to my instincts and left it alone. All the kernels were flat and punctured. It was a sad looking cobbette, probably from the bottom of the freezer bag. I buttered and salted it because it was corn and usually corn tastes like...corn. Well, not this one. It tasted like dirty dishwater. Maybe, sometime in my past, I had the unfortunate event of tasting dirty dishwater, I really don't know how I knew this tasted like that, but that is the first thing that popped into my head when I took that bite. Corn out. Onto the chicken. It was fine. Usually is. But when I put the chicken pieces into the tort, added salsa and took a bite there was NO FLAVOR! I usually have to use up to 5 napkins to wipe my nose as I eat the chicken and salsa combo! Today, nothing! UGH!! What happened to El Pollo Loco? I left unhappy, unsatisfied and really bugged that I wasted money here.
 Should have gone to Tommy's, but it's kinda far."}
{"text":"Great place for grilled chicken cravings. I love their food, however the two times I've ordered through the drive through my order was always wrong. The first time I ordered I ordered a the 2 chicken combo and my husband ordered some shrimp burrito. What did we get? 2 chicken salads... woops my bad for not checking before we left. The second time we went there we ordered the same thing, the guy repeated our order. And we got our meal, I checked to see if we got our meal right... especially my grilled chicken. The chicken was there so I was happy and didn't bother to check the sides... When we got home my sides were Completely wrong.... but it's alright.. and that is why I gave em 4 stars.."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time because of a commercial I saw about their new stuffed quesadilla and it was awesome! Had the enchilada one, very tasty. The chicken was spectacular, the tortilla was fresh, the cheese was generous and they had some kind of cabbage in it that really brought all the flavors together very nicely! Only problem was the lobby was smokey. I understand that it was because they were in the process of making their awesome fresh grilled chicken, but it made my eyes watery and cough a little. But overall! It was very good!"}
{"text":"Service is bad. I felt rushed and they got my order wrong even though my recipe said what I ordered. I love el pollo loco chicken but I would like better service"}
{"text":"They just opened this store I come to get my favorite thing on the menu and they say it's frozen and not ready. What is the point of opening a new location if the food is not ready to serve?!?! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"\"We're out of legs & thighs, but I'll give you a discount.\" Get to window, no discount. The customer should not be punished because of the managers inability to keep chicken in stock. This happens quite frequently at this location, which is why I go in frequently. Additionally I waited about two minutes before someone finally answered drive-through box. This is why no one wants to give which were $15 an hour. I was going to spend about $30 today but not here."}
{"text":"I spent the night VOMITING after eating lunch here yesterday.  I thought that it was strange that they gave me the tiniest chicken legs and thighs, but now i think that they were probably sitting in the back GROWING BACTERIA!  People around us had normal sized pieces of chicken. I wasn't rude or anything but it did take me a litlle while to figure out what to order... i used to love el pollo loco, I'm sad."}
{"text":"The last 3 visits through the drive through they have forgotten my tortillas. I know I should have probably checked but I rarely come here and I forget. I won't be going to this location again. It was $18 for 2 chicken meals which isn't cheap for fast food and I at least expect them to give me my 2 tortillas....."}
{"text":"This location has always been hit and miss with me. Sometimes the service is good, other times we've waited 20 minutes to get our food. The last time I was here, the salsa bar was empty, napkins were nonexistent, service was severely slow, and it wasn't like they had a long line of customers. They really need to reorganize their priorities and take care of their customers better. Seem to be understaffed. The food has always been good, the service seems to be the only problem."}
{"text":"The food was good but customer service really sucked the female cashier was rude and obnoxious I'd probably never go back"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed!! Went through drive thru picked an 8piece meal of charcoaled chicken. Completely burnt. I do not reccomend and will not return."}
{"text":"Our chicken was so over cooked we could not eat most of it.  Our enchiladas were stone cold.  The  place was filthy,  greasy!  I was shocked , my Dad would not eat any of it.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Drive thru with no cars in line. Ordered 2 items then asked a question which was answered with silence for 2 minutes. Kept saying \"hello\" with no answer. Got to the window and to informed the girl/woman that we had more. Her attitude was horrible, unapologetic and as though we inconvenienced her. The food was still wrong after multiple explanations and she charged us for food that we did not order or receive. NEVER GO TO RESTAURANTS THAT HIRE PEOPLE LIKE THIS AND MAKE THEM CUSTOMER FACING. ALL IT SAYS IS WE DON'T CARE.
I will NEVER go to any of your locations ever after this.

We want $15 an hour. Then try doing your job."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  I haven't had El Pollo Loco in a very long time. We were visiting from out-of town and decided to eat here tonight.  We walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit.  We didn't mind about that too much because we were placing an order to go. We walk up and wait a bit in line, no big deal. This girl comes to the register to help us.  She was very new and after every item we ordered, she had to ask a guy to help her enter it.  I am not really complaining about this but if someone is that new, maybe this person helping should have stayed with her to follow through the complete order. We finally completed the order which took about 5 minutes.  

After we ordered we waited and a couple guys ordered after us. The guy who was leaving the girl hanging, decided to help them the whole time. They ordered the large family meal. Keep in mind, we ordered a considerable amount less than them.  After about 10 minutes of waiting the ,\"trainer\", we shall call him, called me over and said that they were out of chicken breast.  Really???? WTF?  THAT'S LIKE SUBWAY BEING OUT OF BREAD.  So he offered to replace the 3 piece white with 3 dark meat choices.  Which is less than we paid for by the way.  I told him fine..I don't care. I'm a patient person and probably deal with more crap than I should but whatever, it's just food.  

The plot thickens, the two guys who ordered the family meal leave with there order and got THEIR white meat.  We ordered first!! WTF??  I was done after that. We ended up waiting for another 10 minutes to get chicken they already had ready.  The guy said sorry for the wait but he didn't mean it.  Do they ever mean it?? He sure as hell didnt.

We get back home and the order was wrong. All the sides were wrong.  

Seriously, GO somewhere else.  I should.have went.to the carneseria across the street and got food there.

SKIP SKIP SKIP IT.  

If the manager or owner is reading this. Revamp your crew or get your crap together.  From other reviews I am reading, looks like you won't be open much longer"}
{"text":"this place was ridiculous. I showed up at around 7:30 they said since they are closing at 8 ( on a Saturday night) they were out of , get this, chicken. I thought the name of this place was el POLLO loco. this young staff seemed more interested in going out and partying then serving customers everybody I saw that walked into that place immediately turned around and walked out disappointed when I told the potential customers walking in that they were out of chicken they laugh or smirk and couldn't believe it. neither could I"}
{"text":"Visited 20mins before they close today, the managers name is Tilde, she has to manner and was a rude bitch, yelling at me has no patient! We ordered Togo, has no forks and napkins! I tried to talk to her that you need to change your attitude to customer, we pay here to eat we don't deserve any bad service like this! They need to change the manager and should fire her, I was talking to her and she just walked away! Tilde hats her name, will call to corporate about this bad manager for sure tomorrow! Won't come back!"}
{"text":"Are you really crazy for some chicken? Save yourself some time and a couple of bucks by going to a CostCo to buy one of those rotisserie chickens.

What sucks: Customer service, wait time, chicken. 

First, let me tell you about the drive-thru. We probably waited 10-15 minutes to receive our food. I don't know why it takes so long to make a salad, put some chicken in a box, scoop some sides into styrofoam containers, and call it a night. 

Even waiting in line indoors takes a long ass time. Waited around for a guy to figure out what he wanted -- I don't know, guy, they serve grilled chicken. Maybe you might wanna get some of those? The lady taking orders didn't even bother to call anyone to help her; she just allowed the line to grow longer by the minute.

Real efficient procedures taking place here.

How about the food? MEH.The chicken that I had during the both times I came here was dry and not good."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the accuracy of orders.
This will be the 3rd time at this location I didnt get what I ordered. 1st time: didn't give us our drink we ordered with our meal and also put a different salsa in the bag. 2nd time: Ordered the bowl without sour cream and pico..... except we got exactly both put in the bowl. 3rd time: wrong salsa again, plus I paid for extra cheese @ .40c per burrito and didnt find any cheese in the whole burrito. I will not be frequenting this place anymore. Someone needs to address the staff and ensure better accuracy."}
{"text":"Wow, ordered the Ultimate DOUBLE chicken bowl, the words ultimate and double.  I got, quickly so quick they apparently forgot the \"DOUBLE \" part.  The amount of chicken this is laughable.  Looks like they took one spoon and split on each side.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mayyyybe 3stars. I'm reviewing the last three times I've picked up dinner in drive thru, usually hit this place once a week. First time, the sprite was flat, obviously they didn't know the machine needed maintenance. Thankfully I was eating when I got home, pulled a sprite from there. Still doesn't make it better knowing I paid for a rotten drink. 2nd time. Order was completely wrong, wrong chicken parts, wrong sides, wrong tortillas and NO avocado sauce even asking three times. Money thrown away yet again, always a disappointment when you're craving a certain meal. Yesterday, ordered the new Avocado salad plus a 2pc dinner. The 2pc meal was correct...YAY! Now the photo of the salad on the board shows like 10 slices or more of avocado. MINE, ONE brown slice!?!?!. Oh come on! Now you owe me three free dinners as far as I'm concerned. Money is tight, time is even more precious. I choose this place because it's one of the healthier fast foods. But now, the service is terrible, they normally have amazing drive thru staff, so polite & accommodating, especially for fast food. On a good note, the salad was a good salad- black beans, cabbage...fresh and nice for a 100 degree day. The dressing is amazing. But one slice of brown avocado doesn't make me very happy. I'm hoping they get their act back together there. I don't mind paying their higher prices for their menu, but they need to get on top of their soda machines, double check the orders so they are correct & get some customer service back to this crew. It was my favorite place for a while now...not sure what has been happening, but quality in every aspect has been ruined. Too bad."}
{"text":"I really like el pollo loco but some things not right at this location. The last 2 times I've been, the chicken looks like it came from a small bird then cooked and left under a heat lamp for a few hours. I really hope not all locations have gone to this meat."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is a chain restaurant specializing is Mexican fast food. I've only had the roasted chicken combo, and it's great.  There are several sides you can get with the grilled chicken. If you go, ask for a coupon. Currently, they have a coupon deal with discounts starting at $1 all the way up to $3 off.  They punch the coupon after each visit, so as you return, the discounts get higher. First visit, $1 off, second $1.25 all the up to $3. Staff at the N 56th Street location are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the Loco. I really do. We come here several times a month. It's so yummy. 

The chicken is always hot, and it's so tasty. I swear I could swim in the green salsa. It's sooooooo good.

The chicken is very flavorful and you always see it cooking on the back grill. It's not \"cheap\" fast food, but you get what you pay for. It's moderate in price, but I think it's well worth it. 

The churros (2 for 99 cents) are like sticks of heaven.

I'm loca for the Loco. :)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the flavor of El Pollo Loco's chicken. I have eaten here several times and I was never disappointed! El Pollo Loco has great food compared to many other fast food restaurants. Personally, I would recommend the classic chicken burrito and the verde quesadilla, but must of the items on the menu are good. The staff is solid and usually gets the food out fairly quickly. They provide good food for a really good price. Parking can be a problem, not too many spaces for the restaurant. However, it is always a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Manager is rude has attitude and I am surprised she hasn't been assaulted....gets real brave but not brave enough to give her name which is on the receipt. ..sorry if your life is miserable don't take it out on the customers...called corporate and will be doing the survey online also....had to give 1 store to post comment I threw my food away"}
{"text":"Service is okay but the food is by far below-average. the chicken thigh is smaller than an actual chicken size thigh.  Unless el polo loco have started using free range chicken.
This isn't the first time I can here. Almost every el polo loco I've been too have reduced their chicken sizes from the actual sizes!
I wish there's a law out there that also watches out for these things. I'm sure there is, I just don't know if they're out there, if they are then they really aren't doing their rounds!
It is the same as stealing a penny here and there in broad day light!

The only el polo loco that impressed me is the one in Carson, California. 

Maybe I'll come back to El polo loco one day once their chicken is back to the size that I'm actually paying for!

2 pieces of chicken thigh for $3.00!?? I could get more at Von's or albertson a better deal!!!"}
{"text":"So i went there tonight and after waiting forever in the drive thru, i ordered crunchy chicken tacos and some mashed potatoes. After spending 15+ mins in the drive thru, i was handed a bag and made the mistake of driving away. 

First, i was handed two chicken meals. I decide to pull around and go in because the drive thru line was still long. As im walking in the drive thru girl says \"oh the drive thru lady is here\". i replied \"yeah...this definitely is not what i ordered\" and set the food on the counter. She comes and grabs the bag from me and walks away, no word at all. 

After five additional minutes of waiting with nobody telling me whats going on, i asked for the manager because it had been a ridiculous amount of time to wait. He comes over and tells me that they DONT HAVE ANY CRUNCHY TACOS!! I ask why in the heck i was sold something they didnt have for one, mention the fact that not only did she not apologize, she never told me i would be recieving my order, and nobody had told me anything since. He apologizes and tries to talk me into something else. I told him that was what I had come there for and asked if he was going to make this right. He told me he could offer me a refund and that was it. I said he should be offering me free food and a refund since this was their mistake and i have now wasted a half hour total and he absolutely refuses.

CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT EXIST HERE!!! and I watched them re-serve the bag i brought in. NASTY i could have touched it!!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars or negative stars I would. Asked for a chicken quesadilla not a crunch wrap with tomato and onion my two most hated things. Was so hungry and so ready for a chicken quesadilla and soup and everything was wrong ended up eating kale for the night"}
{"text":"Instead of our usual family meal we opted to try two ultimate double chicken bowls. The bowls look similar to the photo but lacked cabbage, shredded jack cheese, and the pico de gallo salsa. One we \"upgraded\" for shrimp. The upgrade cost yielded six shrimp in a separate cup. Handed the cashier a $5 off flyer coupon but she and the manager were not able to make the register take that amount off. They gave up trying and deducted only $2.99. Staff seem indifferent in their work. The \"tell us about us\" survey resulted in no feedback. The lesson for this location seems to be check your order and receipt before leaving or try another location."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!!! I got 2 chicken avocado burritos and when i got home as soon as i started to eat them, i realized the chicken had gone bad. 

Took a 2nd bite and same thing. It was so disgusting and foul. I was so hungry i still at the bread and beans on the burrito.  I should of gonna back to make a scene but it was the day of new yrs and i had plans. 

They know when the meat goes bad. They simply try to save money. How absurd!!! Stepping over a dollar to pick up a penny is what comes to mind.  Disgusted! !!!"}
{"text":"$2 for a small extra side of pinto beans? Are you serious? Are these chicken or bat wings. Literally no meat.  Wth??? Let me guess... el pollo waits for the chicken to die and then buys for cheap and marinates it well enough to the point that people dont know.  Genius!!

Service is fast and fairly polite.  Prices... eh... had better.  The mac  and cheese is good. 

The chicken is really low quality tbh. Sides are decent."}
{"text":"First of all: I review this place as a fast food place. Of course you can't expect the same for less then $ 10 as you can for $ 200+ in a nice restaurant.

When that's said: This is the place I have eaten most of my lunches for the last couple of years. I always get the grilled 3 piece chicken. As side orders I pick cole slaw and pinto beans (they took out the grilled corn that I had from time to time).

The chicken here is in fact better then what you get in most fine restaurants. The side orders are okay, but nothing special. The price for food with drinks is less then $ 10, so you get a really tasty lunch for a cheap price here!

If you have a choice for when to go here I would recommend going outside the busiest lunch hour (Noon-1 PM), but before 6. After 6 I have had a couple of experiences with a bit dry of a chicken.

You might ask how I can give a place 5* with not everything perfect in my review. Compared to almost all other fast food places it's in another league. And I love chicken :)"}
{"text":"I'm feeling a little frustrated after dining here this evening. I come here quite a bit because the chicken is tasty. 
I get my tray of food and sit down. I quickly realize I was given two spoons and a knife. It's kind of hard to eat the side salad with a spoon. I went to the counter and no one even acknowledged I was standing there. I waived at a couple of folks looking in my direction, nope. No response. I finally yelled \"excuse me\" and got their attention to request a fork. 
The salsa bar and drink dispenser were a mess. The floor in front of them was a mess. A gentleman came by to refill the salsas. I figured he would clean up the counter by the drinks or even tend to the floor. No. 
No one was out in the dining area cleaning off tables, sweeping the floor, etc and the restaurant was getting busy. 
The food was good but I'm hoping I don't end up getting sick from the lack of attention to a clean restaurant. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular store before and have had decent service and food, but I will NOT go here again. 

 After a long day of errands I stopped here on my way home.  First off the speaker system was so bad the lady inside had a hard time understanding what I wanted and I had to repeat things 2 or more times.  Then once I got home I found that half of my order was missing and the part that was there was burnt beyond being edible.  The chicken was so burnt and dry I can't imagine why anyone would serve it, the fries looked like they had been in the fryer for way too long and then had been sitting out for hours.  The only thing I was able to eat out of the whole thing was the tortillas and even they were cold by time I got home.  I would have gone back to complain and get my money back but didn't want to waste my time on a lousy fast food place."}
{"text":"We went to El Pollo Loco on Friday for their soft opening and were greeted at the door by the manager. He explained that the staff was new and that it was a \"practice\" night before the Grand Opening.

But we met Jo Jo at the counter and she really took care of us.  She was knowledgeable about the menu and helped us place our order. She was friendly and very professional.

Our order came up quick and it was delicious.  No need for practice here! Time to open for real.  Looking forward to many good meals at this location."}
{"text":"This place sucks they don't do any request that you ask they just say ok and never do it and there salsa sucks there cilantro is all stems I even had chicken that was red and that's not the first time so I would not recommend this location at all and it's always very dirty from the floors to the tables and the so called salsa bar is just gross,gross,gross how do people just not care how has the health department not closed them down"}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times, first time was a couple months ago and service and food were good, but the restaurant was kind of slow at the time. Last night, as the summer months have kicked in, the restaurant was really busy. Problem is they couldn't keep up with the crowds. We ordered salads and chips, but if we had wanted whole chicken pieces, the wait was 30 minutes. Our salads took about 10 minutes to get and they ran out of both chips and their creamy cilantro salad dressing, which we were told they wouldn't be making any for awhile, this was only 7:15 p.m. Then we went to the salsa bar and found it was half empty, no onions, no jalapenos, few lemons, no avocado salsa and it was a complete mess. Having lots of customers is the goal of a restaurant, but they couldn't handle it."}
{"text":"The Assistant Manager was super nice and great customer service, will come again! The Shrimp avocado salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just opened in April and always busy.

We used El Pollo to supplement our backyard party - large sides of rice and BRCs. We were able to order ahead of time and the food was ready for pick up and well prepared."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I ate here almost once a week. But as time went on the service got a little sloppy and slow. But it's still a go to establishment.  But just make sure you check your order."}
{"text":"This is the best El Pollo Loco that I have ever been in. It's clean and the food comes out looking great. Plus La'trel is the most knowledgeable and custumer friendly employee I have ever come across. I will be returning to this restaurant for sure."}

{"text":"Best service I've ever had at a fast food place. Thanks Jordan! And of course the food is great as always."}

{"text":"wow, the worst meal ever and i will never eat at another el pollo loco again. i ordered the skinny chicken quesadilla because it looked like a new item i had never seen before and the picture looked delish. wow, what very little cheese that was on it wasn't even melted. it was gross, it wasn't even hot, it was falling apart. the wet chicken burrito my friend ordered said the sauce on top was cold an the chicken seemed old and wasn't even hot. for $15.00 total waste of money and the location was filthy. this was the worst experience i have ever had and i will never eat at an epl again.

gross..... waste of money and horrible cold, old, stale food."}
{"text":"I was charged twice, and when I contacted them to let them know(within hour) I was offered no apologies. I was told instead that banks are not perfect and that I should check with the bank in regards to why they let the double charge happen?"}
{"text":"This location has the be the worst! This is my 3rd time hear and they have yet to surprise me when I go to order.... There is never any chicken ready there is always a 15min wait then when I received my order the chicken is dry? The lemons were mixed with salsa and the salsa area was a mess! Yuck! I would not recommend going to this location"}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. I ordered the taco combo with chicken. When I got my order both Tacos were heaped with lettuce but no chicken. When I brought them back they replaced them with one that had chicken and one that had just lettuce on it. the taco shells were greasy and cracked on the bottom making it impossible to eat. The staff were not very helpful and they acted like they could care less. I did not expect a gourmet meal but I did expect chicken in my chicken tacos. The only positive thing I can say was the place was clean."}
{"text":"This locations food is so gross. I thought they all had to be the same but the quality at this one is horrible. Guac is always brown and soggy. More like a paste. Chips are always stale and they never get my order right. Probably because they are to busy talking to each other and not paying attention"}
{"text":"The food was not what you order. As my sister put it, \"the tacos weren't tacos, they were soggy burritoes.\" Also bathrooms did not provide soap which worries me that staff may have not been washing their hands before working.

-AWMRA"}
{"text":"NEVER have any white meat available.  ALWAYS out and tell you it will be 30 mins to an hour before they will have any ready.  That IS NOT fast food.  Very poorly run location.  Will not waste any more time with this location.  Too bad, because food (when they have it) is great.

{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on July 7.  It had been several months since we stopped in.  We always enjoy their food.  It's the service that continues to lack and disappoint.  We asked one of the employees to clean some tables for us as the tables that were in the shade were all dirty and had old food on them.  She said \"ok\" but never came out to clean them.  We barely found a small 2 person table that was semi clean.  We will probably be back but not for a little while."}
{"text":"Is there anything better than El Pollo loco as far as fast food restaurants go - I think not! I love the cilantro dressing."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Waited over 30 min only for them to get my order wrong. Customers ahead of me were agitated as well because of the long wait. To top it off, half the employees were not apologetic at all. A simple solution to preventing the backup would've been to stop taking orders for a bit so it doesn't pile up or at least notify the customers of the wait time. Sadly, I will not be returning until this place is managed properly."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant asked for a simple classic burrito no beans,so I should of got chicken cheese and rice. Well there was no cheese in it that I could find, chicken was no where to be found so I ended up with a rice burrito for $4.86. I wondered why the place was empty! Now I know. And the place was just generally dirty. My shoes were sticking to the floor as I walked. Sorry to say I won't be back. Sorry el pollo loco I won't be back"}
{"text":"We have come to this location for about five years.For us this food has gotten terrible over the last six months.Have  always looked forward to going at least once a week, as a family, we considered it healthy and good.To day was my last time, I ordered an avocado chicken whole wheat wrap. Looking at this meal threw the clear plastic made me want to throw up,. the  wrap was burnt the small salad was wilted. Upon opening the lid the chicken was burnt also.My husbands double chicken tostada was burnt too. I CANNOT BELIEVE that the cooks would serve that crap to a customer.The whole meal was 24.00 and we could not eat it.To DRIVE AND return it,was to far other wise I WOULD TAKE IT BACK AND ASK THE HELP TO EAT IT WHILE WE WATCHED!!! GROSS!!"}
{"text":"This location gets a boo for booty.
This means the service is B for BAD meaning BAD.
Used to be as my previous review stated good but iffy on cleanliness- now a remodel & again 2 more new \"managers\" & really if Denny's training program sucks this bad they need to pay more per hour to get back the managers from like 10 yrs ago who gave a f.
Check your order & double check your drive thru order b4 driving thru.

Ps I really really wanted to eat this f'n chicken - I LOVE THIS CHICKEN- but on principle for shitty service I could not EAT the Chicken"}
{"text":"The only reason why i give a 2 star is because the girl that took my order was very friendly and so helpful. Great attitude. I think her name was christine. (I could be wrong tho) if it wasn't for her. I wouldn't give any star!   I was half way thru my salad and notice that the chicken was raw in the middle.  Completely raw in the middle! So i went to the lady in the counter that looked like a manger and showed it to her. She looked at me and said: \"wow, i hope you dont get sick!\" And turned around and left me there.  Very disrespectful! Unprofessional and just plain wrong!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious.  They took the hard tacos away then brought them back which was a good move.  The green salsa is VERY good.  Perfect combination of creamy(avocado?), spicy, salty.  Not too pricey."}

Read other reviews and same thing has happened before.   Management should read these reviews and do something.  Never has McDonald's or Burger King tell me they didn't have burgers!!!!   Figure it out or close the damn restaurant"}
{"text":"I know this is not standard for all locations but, one of my Employees found a cap in their burrito. Thanks but no thanks."}

My food is always tasty. Not a fan of the flame roasted corn but thats personal preference. 

Staff is typical fast food staff. Unfriendly, short fused teenagers but hey what ya gonna do, ya don't go there for the service."}
{"text":"Horrible. I was so excited to learn they just opened next to my house but so far I am so upset. 
I have been through the drive thru 3 times so far in the last 30 days and 2 out of 3 times my order is missing avocado! 
First time I ordered a chicken avocado salad.....they forgot the avocado.
Second time i didnt order anything with avocado and my order was fine. 
Third time I ordered a chicken avocado burrito....they forgot the avocado. 
For a place that uses avocado in half of the menu...why am I paying for it and never getting it!? 
Super disappointed 

Also, the people working the drive through are very green, you can tell."}

I've had a few issues with the evening staff, which includes forgetting to put part of my order in my bag and having to drive all the way back and get it as well as not being overly helpful with the salsa bar, but all in all, this is one of the best El Pollo Loco's I've been to here in the PHX area."}
{"text":"These guys make the best chicken, bar none.  And that includes much pricier and higher-end restaurants.  I'm a particular fan of their rice bowl (which KFC tried to imitate with little success) and find that its mix of chicken, pico di gallo, onion, cilantro, beans and Spanish rice make for a very tasty concoction.

When they first came out with their Sirloin, I was skeptical, but the lime marinade they use on their chicken tastes even better on the steak.

So it was high on my list to try their new fish tacos when they started advertising them a few weeks back.  I finally got there to try them both (Original Baja & Spicy Avocado) last night.

I can't say I was blown away.  First, no lime marinade.  Instead the plain foil wrapper included a wedge of lime and it was my job to squirt lime on my fish (not nearly enough lime for my taste).  The soft tacos are really very small (especially when compared with Taco Bell or Del Taco) and for some reason, they use two of them.  Not a particular fan of too much carbs, I abandoned the outer soft taco and ate just the inner one.  And figured out that they use two because on is not quite strong enough to hold the stuff inside.  

I was not impressed by the tacos and I'll probably head back to Rubio's the next time I want a fish taco fix.  Still, this will remain my first choice for chicken and for the Pollo Chicken Bowl.

The subtraction of one star is more because of the very spotty drive thru service, the horrible speaker they have out there, and the long waits that are often the norm (their average serve time per customer is in excess of 3 minutes I would guess).

One final pet peeve - they frequently leave all their signage lights on well after the restaurant has closed.  Which means I have to drive through to find out that they're actually closed.  (Yes, I admit I'm not bright enough to remember their drive thru hours.)"}
{"text":"Terrible service and quality. I love El Pollo Loco but this one is horrible. The churros were undercooked and they didn't have enough sugar on them."}
{"text":"Thanks for the raw chicken. We ordered dinner to go and the chicken in our burrito was raw, we didn't know until we got home. Right in the trash it went."}
{"text":"Super speedy lunch service when you're in a pinch! Definitely try the chicken avocado quesadilla...it's the best and most flavorful item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Waiting 20 minutes for soup and they keep telling me 5 more minutes. Everyone here seems so confused.  Not worth coming here anymore."}
{"text":"The bad reviews are piling up now.  I went in and was stuck waiting to get salsa by a woman who appeared to be a relative or friend of the cashier.  She had 16 salsa cups (I counted as I waited) and was going for more when I finally asked could I get just one.  Lady got rude saying I need more and I snapped back no need to be selfish and she yelled to the cashier and told her I was threatening her.  Cashier told me to leave in a raised voice.  I said give me a refund and I would be glad to as I didn't have my food yet.  She refused saying I was causing trouble and kept telling me she would call the police. After a few minutes sitting and waiting the customer's husband came in and made a verbal threat which people at a table next to us heard. Not wanting to escalate this anymore I left and just resolved to challenge the charge on my card and send a scathing email to corporate telling them they have a hostile environment for customers.  

Local area manager called me two days later and claimed he reviewed video and said my actions were threatening based on the face the customer made.  He further claimed the husband was calm and shook my hand which is an outrageous lie, the guy told me he was so angry he didn't know what would happen to me when I walked outside.  All from what his lying wife told him.  

I told the manager once I get my money back I promise never to set foot again in your property.  The manager then in a vicious tone called me a trouble maker and said they would legally make sure I didn't get a charge back and said if I did this again I would be arrested. I mockingly asked him did they own the police and he responded with we have the footage now,  I can call them and they will investigate and I don't like your chances if that happens. I mean really bizarre,  almost felt like I must have upset El Pollo Loco royalty.   I finally gave up and said good luck keeping customers and hung up on him.   He called back twice and I didn't pick it up.  I really wanted to get some good evidence on voice mail but unfortunately he didn't bite. 

Great customer service eh?  If you aren't a family member of an employee I suggest you stay out of their stores. Too bad really I have been a customer of theirs for 30 years back to their days in East LA and really do like the food."}
{"text":"I normally love El Pollo Loco but tonight was not one of those nights. One of my favorite reasons for going there other than being fresh and delicious is The creamy cilantro sauce that I love with everything. I ordered a Pollo Bowl combo which I have been excited about all day, yes excited about fast food lol. When I got to the window I asked for cilantro sauce and the packets of jalapeño got sauce with my order. Of course the cashier said no problem. Keep in mind I already placed my order at the microphone menu and decided to wait to get to the window to ask for sauce so out couldn't slip her mind and could just grab or as she hands the bag through the window. When I got my bag I saw green sauce inside but no packets so I got her attention back and asked for the sauce I requested previously. She apologized and have me the missing packets. Upon getting home and ready to eat, it comes to be the green sauce I was given was tomatillo salsa and not the cilantro sauce at all. So basically, she forgot both sauces and when asked again for them gave me one and an incorrect one instead of the one that makes me go there to begin with. Not a big deal, just makes my food alot less satisfying and too much of a hassle to go back."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time because it is so convenient for me.  

I love the chicken here beacuse the skin is so flavorful and very inexpensive for a quick meal near my house.

Staff here is really nice."}

{"text":"Was so disappointed. Normally love their food, this particular place what a let down. Traveled here for business, was excited to eat some El Pollo Loco after a seven hour drive only to be disappointed by dried up chicken, tortillas were so hard my teeth could not penetrate them. I ordered the two piece chicken, breast & wing, the wing was so dried up that it was meatless. The Mac & Cheese was so old that it was discolored and looked funny. 
If you eat here, good luck.
The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today around 11:30 am. Wife had a hard time finding a clean table. I was in line 15 minutes to place order. Total confusion behind counter. We had the 3 piece tenders that came out cold. I asked for ranch dipping sauce and was told they are out of all sauces except for cilantro sauce which was disgusting. Then I asked for ketchup for my fries and they were out of that. The salsa bar was filthy. The floors were dirty as were the windows. Should have sent it back, but there were a couple ahead of us that were also not happy. I do not recommend. This is the dirtiest fast food place I have been in. Not going back."}
{"text":"I have heard of this place a few times, and always thought it was fried chicken. I was wrong, and it was good!
I came right at close, (Sorry guys, I know you all hate that.) going using the drive-thru. The woman was polite and courteous. 
The chicken tasted like regular rotisserie chicken, no mexican flavor. The mashed potatoes were creamy as well as the gravy. (Reminded me of Church's Chicken mashed potatoes.) Corn on the cobb was good."}
{"text":"Do not go to this el pollo loco! They rude as fuck and forever getting your order wrong"}
{"text":"Beware of the inattentive cashier that will stick her finger in your cup. She also went from handling cash to serving food without washing her hands!
And of course my order was wrong since she wasn't paying attention. 
Sorry Pollo, you are off my lunch list!"}
{"text":"Look what advertising accomplished. My wife saw a commercial on tv today and told me she wants me to take her there for dinner tonight. We've driven by this restaurant for about 20 years and never stopped in. It was a very pleasant surprise. The restaurant staff was very friendly, the food fresh and hot, the restaurant was very clean, and the service amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. The food is very flavorful. Great grilled chicken plus salsa bar and drink combo for around $5-$6. I would definitely keep coming."}
{"text":"The hubs & I love El Pollo Loco! It's a quick drive from our house, so I'd say about once a month we get a craving for it. Their chicken is the bomb & smells delicious as you pull up to the drive thru window. Our fav side has to be the mac & cheese, weird I know considering this is a mexican food joint, but man that stuff is good. We also enjoy their flour tortillas. They usually have a meal deal that includes a free cake but we aren't cake people so I always bring it to work. But we do love their flan & the churros are pretty good too. There can be a lil bit of a wait sometimes at the drive thru but trust me, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food of all time!  I just spent several months away from my Arizona home in a northern state that knows nothing of Mexican food. My first stop when I returned to Arizona?  You got it! El Pollo Loco!!!  Authentic, fast, cheap, and oh so yummy."}
{"text":"Great service, food fresh, fast and cheap! I'm a health nut and a foodie and I still recommend this for a quick lunch."}

{"text":"We were first timers to El Pollo Loco. It was actually really good for a fast food place. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was the amount of shrimp on the Chicken Shrimp peas and sausage bowl my husband ordered. There were 4 small shrimp. I would've given it 5 stars for mine. I ordered the mexican cob salad, the dressing alone was great; but the difference salsas they have on their bar were all good. :-) The staff were all really friendly! It was a great change of pace!"}
{"text":"Will never go to this pollo locco again. This is definitely the worst. How do you serve someone burnt rice. Really??? Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Omg. Orrible macarroni me dieron ayer  8/12/16  por la tarde, llegando a casa lo mire inmediatamente  regrese para cambiarlo. Y la persona q me atendio con la actitud terrible. Enrealidad nose q fue peor si el trato q me brindaron o el macarroni."}
{"text":"They are understaffed and the service was terrible. Went on a Saturday night. The teenage kid running the register had way too much on his plate and did not know how to handle the fast paced volume of the restaurant. They seemed very understaffed. After 15 mins, I finally got my food. I went to get salsa and the spicy guacamole and cilantro was completely gone. The salsa bar had not been cleaned in a very long time as there were spills all over. I asked the kid to replace the salsa which was never done or cleaned the entire time I ate. The kid needed help however no manager assisted him even though the line was very long. The people in line after me still had not been served by the time I left and several people were served the wrong food. Not sure how the service is any other night but do not go on a Saturday night, the food was good but the service was terrible. Save your money."}
{"text":"I liked this place until I ordered a spicy chipotle burrito and found out that there was literally a raw piece of chicken in it; which is totally unsatisfactory.

I'm Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Decent food, however ruined all chance of my returning due to the absence of management. Poor service with miss communication and negative attitude from the \"manager\" shows this place doesn't deserve our families business. First and last time we will go to El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"The Manager and staff of this location went above and beyond to meet our last minute needs to provide 60 tacos for our group. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Apparently asking for a tostada salad without cheese is to much to ask for. I asked for one without any dairy for a lactose intolerant person in the drive through. The top had no cheese but once they digged into the salad it had cheese. This is the second time this happened at this location. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"I absolutely love El Pollo Loco. I absolutely hate *this* El Pollo Loco. Here's why:

I have been there three times. The last two times, they've gotten something wrong with my order. One time, they didn't give me any cilantro dressing. This time, they gave me half the normal amount of dressing, and they didn't give me the cheesecake chimichanga I ordered. 

Not only this, but the drive-thru is very, very slow. Each time I've gone, it's taken quite a long time to get my food, and each person at the window has to sit for one to two minutes on average (or longer).

Finally, the quality of the food I do get is subpar when compared to other EPL's standards. The chicken is overcooked and stringy, and the tortilla strips in my salad were soggy. Keep in mind that I got home within 4 minutes and the strips were still soggy even before putting the small amount of cilantro dressing I got into the salad. 

All-in-all, I was really excited for this location to open, but I'm horribly disappointed."}
{"text":"This location can't get orders right to save their lives. They are incompetent and liars!"}
{"text":"Most recent visit was Saturday 2/18 around 5:00 pm. Have no complaints about this visit. Food was good, service was good, everything seemed fine. Only observation I would make was about cleanliness. Floors could use a good steam cleaning. My wife visited the rest room, and refused to use it. She said it was filthy and the toilet clogged. 
This location we have found to be inconsistent in the past, but this time was generally a good experience. But cleanliness is an issue, maybe I should dock them an additional star due to that, but I guess I'm feeling generous today."}
{"text":"Dropped by El Pollo Loco on 12-16-17, 45 minutes before closing. The entire restaurant was ready for closing. Very little food was available except 4 overcooked pieces of chicken on a small corner of the grill (the rest of the grill had been cleaned ready for closing). We left. Clearly El Pollo Loco closes at 9:00 p.m. on Saturdays, not 10:00 p.m."}
{"text":"The crazy chicken ! For a cheap quick meal. The chicken  was fresh , flavorful , moist and delicious . We had the Cole slaw , mayo based , pretty good.  With the salsa /condiment bar and hot tortillas , it was a tasty meal"}
{"text":"I ordered the baja shrimp tacos and they were COLD, what a joke! I will never come back here!"}
{"text":"I come here at least 2 a month everytime i go my food is great! Freshly made and warm. The cashiers and staff are welcoming. Never had a problem with this location. Thanks."}
{"text":"Hungry and didn't want to cook, the wife was perusing the menu and wanted their Pablano Avocado Burrito with no rice and an extra side of Pablano cream.  I picked the avocado chicken bowl.  My wife's burrito was ho hum to say the least.  The beans and corn made up almost all of the burrito, there were two small thin slices of avocado, about a tablespoon of chopped chicken, no shredded cheese, and if I had not ordered extra pico  there would have been none.  My bowl was 1/3 rice, 1/3 cabbage, 1/6 beans and again about a tablespoon of chopped chicken and a little sour cream and pico.  Once again if I had not ordered extra condiments and sauces it would have been very bland and disappointing.  As it was with the extra sauce and pico it was palatable, but not what we are used to from this establishment.  Don't know why this is going on but they need to live up to the products they display."}
{"text":"Ordered online, and tried out the new El Pollo Loco.  We used to eat when we lived in California, and although I know they were in places like Tempe, we never had one close by until recently.  I have good memories of it, so ordered a 12 piece family meal.  I opted for the more expensive \"mixed pieces\" package to get some breasts in there.  We got two breasts, four thighs, two drumsticks, and four wings.  Big mistake, this chicken is TINY, so things like the wings are SUPER TINY.  All 12 pieces fit into a foam takeout container like you get at Panda Express....and it wasn't full.  We ordered all corn tortillas, and when I took them out of the bag, they all broke down the middle (like they were creased or something.  It was a big let down.  I tried making some to go salsa's and none of the lids even would seal the little plastic cups - after fiddling for five minutes I just gave up leaving a whole bunch of filled containers.  Everyone likes the flavor, but really, I think we will just get a costco chicken, tortillas, corn and beans - the side dishes just taste like the canned variety, so why I paid nearly $27 for this (with a $5 off coupon code), I don't know.  The odd thing is, on the grill are big leg/thigh quarters that looked huge compared to what we got - do they have two different sized chickens?  Live and Learn...."}
{"text":"Don't recommend this pollo loco, the manager Roberto is SUPER rude, he over charged me, I had to open a complain to get my money back waited for 2 weeks. They don't even apologized to me."}
{"text":"Food is good prices are good and service was good. I think the family meals prices were very reasonable. For only 25 bucks you get 12 priece leg and thighs 2 large sides churros and enchiladas. I would have to say the churros were the best part of this meal lol but over all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Indifferent inefficient uncaring employees
Needs new manager
Worst El Pollo in Nevada"}
{"text":"I spent some time in AZ over the last few weeks and I must say that I am definitely a fan. When I walked in I didn't really expect much but after ordering the chicken I was convinced that they honestly have some of the tastiest chicken I have ever had at a fast food joint. An A Plus for a quick and healthy meal."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times in the last 4 weeks and the food never fails and the manager always says hi thanks for coming even if it's busy. The restrooms are clean and to me that means the kitchen is too. Great job guys see you soon"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco - Chicken, Gooooooood. Ate El Pollo for lunch today after not having it for a while and it was great!"}
{"text":"My first time going to pollo loco. I was impressed with this particular branch but the menu as a whole. Lots of fresh salad options and the ingredients all seem fresh. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wilted gross salad greens and they left out the most important green salsa.super disappointed. The one on baseline at McClintock is consistently good tho"}
{"text":"i love el pollo loco, but the chicken has been dry the 2 times I attempted this store.  I am afraid to try a third time."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders and the fries were horrible. Don't advertise something new if you can't make it taste better then your competition or at least taste good. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I paid for a large mashed potato and I might as well have gotten a small because that's what they gave me ."}
{"text":"So aggravating when they get your order wrong in the drive through! We ordered the 8 piece family meal with mixed chicken which means we are supposed to get some white meat. We got 4 legs and 3 thighs so 7 pieces instead of 8 and no white meat. At least we paid $4 extra for their mistake just to make sure the experience was truly memorable! For the sides we ordered the salad and the pinto beans. We got a super dry mix of lettuce and a few straps of red cabbage and pinto beans that was half liquid and half beans. This place used to be my favorite but on superbowl Sunday we tried to get chicken there at 11:30 am and they didn't have any cooked yet...at lunch time...on superbowl sunday! They said we'd have to wait for 25 minutes!"}
{"text":"Oh..the chicken and pinto beans of El Pollo Loco! 
Now, my foodie friends may make fun of me...but I am a regular. To me it is just a bit like sitting in my grandma's dining room on a Sunday when there was always a pot of beans and a roasted chicken. 
My midwestern self needs some of the simple things of home to keep me in balance with my \"wild Vegas\" life style---yeah...those who know me can atest to how not wild my lifestyle is ever!
My only experience with El Pollo has been here in Vegas...and all I want to say is...Oh El Pollo...how have you not been a part of my life for ever!"}
{"text":"Sad to say that we didn't have a great experience. The wife's meal (chicken enchilada meal) wasn't very hot. Border line cold. 
My meal was okay,  but not outstanding (2 piece combo). Not as flavorful as in the past. 
But when we entered the establishment, we were greeted by a very large  black beatle crawling on the floor as we were ordering our food. Also, the drink area had some kind of plumbing problem. There was even a mop there as the staff would sweep the wet floor occasionally. 
Notice other comments about cleanness but not sure anyone is listening."}
{"text":"Great Chicken everytime. Make sure u ask for no burnt chicken to ensure perfectly browned delicious well seasoned chicken. I love the Mexican Cobb with chicken and shrimp. Shrimp is an add on but it's worth it! Healthy choice when u need food fast!"}
{"text":"Occasionally we get a taste for seasoned chicken. Several months ago, we had a good experience at Pollo Loco. Not so this time. The specials coupon we received was confusing and misinterpreted. After we ordered, the cashier closed the cash drawer without providing our change. Overall, the food tasted good. But, the rice was dry and too brittle to eat. A family at the next table had their baby sitting on the table - a reminder not to eat any dropped food. After washing my \"finger food\" hands, there were no towels in the rest room. 

Overall, not pleasant. The location still has potential, but they need more attention to detail."}
{"text":"Well, I've just watched this particular El Pollo Loco (#6043) run right through the Restaurant Life-Cycle (TM).  A little over two years ago (I think), when this location opened, I was in hog heaven.  I loved the place:  convenient, fast, clean, and good.  Fast forward to today, and I'm not going to eat at this particular location any more.  The last three times I've been here, the chicken has been over-cooked (dry), the service has been slow, and the store has been dirty.  This last time, the place was so dirty I had to go up to the counter and ask for a wet cloth to clean off the tables.  It took a while to get the attention of the manager, and when I did, she said she'd send someone out to clean the tables in a bit.  When that person did come out, I asked her to clean the table and watched as she sullenly made some half-hearted swipes with the cloth.  Sigh.  If they had just given me the cloth, I would have rather cleaned the place myself and done a better and faster job without the attitude.  If the management and staff of a restaurant can't be bothered to keep the place clean for their customers, then I can't be bothered to eat there.  I'm switching to another location which, though further away and more crowded, I've never had a problem with."}
{"text":"In general, I like El Pollo Loco.  This location, though, is brand new and appears to have some minor growing pains to work through.  First, I think they need to hire more help.  We were there at about noon and just about every table was dirty.  The whole time we were there, no one came out to clean.  I can't guarantee it, but looking behind the counter, it appeared that only two people were working.  And, second, the music is overly loud and pretty awful.  I'm getting tired of going into restaurants and being blasted with bubblegum pop (especially when the average age of the clientele is probably about 40).  Plus, this is a Mexican-ish restaurant.  Something a little more ethnic might be nice (I'm NOT talking mariachi bands here).  While we were there, only one of the songs played was in Spanish.

Neutrally, the food seems to be about the same as any other El Pollo Loco location (though our cilantro dressing was a bit thin, today).

On the positive side, I'd like to say that this particular location is very nice looking.  It's got floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, so it has a very open feeling.

I also have a suggestion for all El Pollo Locos:  instead of microwaving your tortillas (which are just bland, commercial things), how about tossing them onto your grill.  You might have to watch the timing, but it might add some much-needed flavor to them."}

{"text":"I visited El Pollo Loco on 43rd.Ave & Cactus Location, the  the service was great from Sylvia from the very first impression to the last impression. i noticed she was going around the lobby asking customers if they were happy with the service or if there was anything she could do for them to make their visit more enjoyable. When she came around to my table she asked the same.She was also cleaning all tables,chairs, salad bar, fountain drink station , taking trash out and while doing all these different tasks still providing excellent customer service. In my opinion she's definitely the Wow Factor in this restaurant. she's also very energetic & customer friendly, she deserves recognition!!! 
I will recommend this restaurant to my friends, neighbors, relatives and coworkers. Kudos to Sylvia......"}

{"text":"The crunchy chicken taco sucks there is hardly any meat and a ton of lettuce. Do not eat here the taco on Sahara is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Pulled into drive thru at 955pm on Saturday 9/26/15. Guy looked at us, locked the drive thru Window and went back to cleaning. Never bothered to tell us they were closing,  just let us sit there."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go to. Cashier rang up our order incorrectly. He itemized our order instead of using the coupon code.  Because of that mistake, that did not show up on the screen for the other workers to prepare the food. So we waited more than 10 mins for our order.  We get our food and guess what.  My order was wrong.  These people do not know how to read the order.  They should have made my food right when they knew they made a mistake. Managers are no where to be found. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience every time I have been to the location. They have not once gotten my order correct. Service is always much slower than other locations, as well."}
{"text":"they have decent chicken taco here but I normally get the chicken quesadilla since it is so damn tasty! The tacos are a bit salty so if you like salt you should get them. The drinks are free refills which is nice so you can have plenty to drink. We really enjoy their tostada as well since they pile it high with lots of lettuce."}

{"text":"Great chicken avocado taco platter and great service. They are so nice I enjoy going just for good service. Great food is a perk"}
{"text":"Food was not good, tortilla was burnt. Customer service on drive thru needs to be better. Need to follow ChikfilA's lead with customer service, and take some notes."}
{"text":"The chicken and salsa are great but they appear to have downsized the size of the chickens pieces the last year or so. I would rather they raise the prices a little as opposed to this tact."}
{"text":"I have gone to this El Pollo Loco off and on for 8 years.  I at one point had gotten so fed up with the awful service that i stopped going, even though I really love the chicken.  Recently, we started going back, and we are glad we did.  The service has dramatically improved.  Also, there have been some positive changes to the menu that have made it even better, such as adding broccoli as one of the sides.  The only problem that I run into now is that they often dont keep up with demand in their cooking of the chicken, and will not have leg and thigh meal available.  Your choice is to either wait 15 minutes or pay more for the breast and wings.  This, however is a corporate policy, so I cant fault the individual restaurant for that.  It does warrant dropping a star though."}
{"text":"This place has great, tasty and healthy food at very reasonable prices.  Love the chicken avocado salad and all the choices for pico/sauces.  Will go back soon."}
{"text":"First the food is outstanding and very reasonably priced. I am a disabled USMC Vietnam veteran, confined to an electric wheelchair. The staff could not have been more accommodating. They held the door for me both entering and leaving. They also made a plate of the free condiments for me, without their help I would have had to skip. Several of them thanked me for my service, quite a change from 1968 when I returned to a population that cursed me and my brother Marines. People have to understand that the military didn't invade Vietnam of their own volition, we were ordered there by President Johnson. If politicians had let the military prosecute the war by military doctrine, we could have won the war in one year, easily.  But I digress from the intent of this App.  My final word is this restaurant has the business paradigm to succeed in getting and keeping customers. A pleasurable dining experience for this old mud Marine. I'll be back as often as I'm financially able on my disability pay."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience. Food was fresh and service prompt through drive through. Had a little difficult hearing employee through intercom in drive thru."}
{"text":"The chicken was good but got a feeling that they buy their chicken from Frye's when its about to expire and at a cheap price,  cause now I'm sitting on the toilet repeatedly,  I will never ever go eat at this place ever again, u done a lot of damage to my butthole!!!!"}
{"text":"These people who believe this place is reasonable in price is nuts. You get salty chicken and greasy fat for $20 definitely not worth a trip back?  
I remember El Pollo loco being tasty and healthy with lots of wonderful fresh salsa to choose from. Now the salsa is watered down and the guacamole taste like crsp.
Hope they lower the price and stop ripping people off."}
{"text":"They remove everthing on the salsa bar before they close."}
{"text":"Today's experience was a 5 star - it was dinner time, so they were busy. The guy who helped us was super friendly and even gave us a free drink while we waited. The food was good (as always) and filling (I got the double chicken avocado salad). Sometimes the salsa bar can run low, but they're newly opened, so I'm sure they're still working out the kinks :)"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  The young lady at the drive through made us feel unwelcome.  When we received our food there were no napkins nor utensils in the bag.  I'd think twice about coming to this El Pollo Loco again."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is almost without exception 5 star delicious and great. Was like others thrilled to no longer need to drive across the valley for their chicken. That said.....This store is a dumpster fire and a disgrace to the franchise. Not sure if they opened too soon but it's clear my experiences here have not been unique. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"Went here again after a month. First, I had 4 meals to order and after every one I ordered the guy ask, \"is that all\" If you hush & listen I'll let you know when I'm done. Your so busy asking am I finished that you didnt even put my sauces in the bag that I asked for after ordering that specific meal. This location is just so disappointing in so many ways. Since they've been open it has seriously been nothing but problems. The location off Tropicana and Fort Apache are so much better. I'll most likely never return to this location, I've given too many chances."}
{"text":"The service sucked. Managers were outside on break or smoking when the restaurant was packed. Always out of something on the menu, like taquitos. I like el pollo loco food and will have to drive further to get better food and service then this location!"}

{"text":"This has to be the best El Pollo Loco in the city.  Okay, it's not Joel Robuchon but, for what they do, and for fast food, they're great.  And, despite my love for Popeyes, this is healthy and (almost) just as tasty.

What distinguishes them from the pack is that their chicken always seems to be either fresh off the grill or at least moist.  Off topic, I hate the word \"moist,\" but will use it because it fits.   Spices, size, whatever, does not matter if the chicken is overcooked.  So, this El Pollo Loco already won the battle.  

Their service, however, can be spotty.  I did once witness a cashier having a meltdown but, generally, they are okay and tantrum-free.  Just yesterday I received a discount without asking.  That kind of generosity can't help but make me a fan.

Cleanliness...ehh.... Just walk in and then walk out.

Did I mention their food is generally good?  I always order the generic meal: mixed chicken (breasts, leg, etc), mashed potatoes, coleslaw, corn, tortillas, etc.  However, skip the potatoes unless you really love that instant mashed potato taste (which I oddly find comforting).  The corn can also be kind of shriveled, so, I'd shoot for the other sides (my family always wants the corn for some reason!).  Choose El Pollo Loco over KFC, this stuff destroys that gross KFC grilled crap."}
{"text":"I frequent this location every week and have never been disappointed.... I love the chicken, salads and burritos....this location is always fast, friendly and clean !  See you all next week ...if not sooner."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is my favorite fast food restaurant! I eat it at least four time a month and the service and food is usually top notch. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this particular location! My 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter planned to go there since earlier in the morning. We went in on Tuesday, November 4, 2014 at around 2:00PM - a busy time, but no excuse for what we went through. I was fifth in line, but our turn came up fairly fast. We ordered the new family meal for $20, which includes their new version of manicotti; four corn tortillas rolled up into the shape of cigars, filled with melted cheese and topped with a slightly spicy red sauce! 

It took a good 15 minutes for the food to be ready and when we received it, the first thing we noticed was that the 8-pieces of chicken were so over-cooked that they were completely dry and some parts were so tough that they were completely inedible! But we were so hungry, we let it go and began to eat. Anyway, I was so looking forward to trying the new manicotti! It looked great and I went ahead to cut one in half with my fork to see how much melted cheese would be oozing out like in the picture, but....are you ready for this?!....all that was inside was a bunch of shredded cheese, not melted at all! And when I decided to touch it ever so gently to avoid burning my finger, it was ice-cold, literally! They forgot to cook it and served it raw! Now, I'm not one to complain too much, but this was rediculous! I took it back to the counter and showed it to the manager. Although they immediately began preparing a new order, there were no \"we're sorry,\" or any form of disciplinary action, like it was no big deal! Ten minutes later they brought out a new order to our table. But they replaced the four uncooked ones with only two new ones! Again, I went back to the counter, but this time the manager rolled his eyes at me like it was my fault! That pissed me off. By the time we sat down to eat, all the employees would eye us weird! You could tell that the word spread throughout and now I was a trouble customer to them. I will never go back to this location again and I urge corporate to make staff changes immediately!"}

{"text":"I come to this El Pollo Loco every Friday night and every time we come here something is not right from being out of \"white\" meat chicken, to out of chips.  They are never prepared to serve guests.  The cashier is running back and forth to put chicken on the grill with 7 guests lined up.  I hear they are closing Monday, December 11th to remodel.  Forget about the remodel, bring in more staff that can bring great customer service.  The service is terrible.  We love El Pollo Loco but this location has never given us a good experience.  As we are all standing in line, the complaints are not just ours."}

I love that everything is warm and melty and fresh. I love this place so much that I've had the hubby walk/drive at all hours of the day and evening to get me some (granted I was a crazy pregnant woman, but still...)"}
{"text":"I would have put one star, but as the service has always been very friendly and prompt, I added one more. The last time I ate here the chicken tasted raw and undercooked, and this is not the first time. I used to love their chicken burrito, but the serving of chicken in it dropped until you were lucky to get one bite with chicken out of three bites. The prices are not cheap, but they would be worth it if the food quality was there. And the place itself is always dirty and unkempt, isn't there somebody who is employed here who empties out the overflowing garbage cans, wipes down the dirty tables, and cleans the bathroom? I chalk it up to management, they need to step it up."}
{"text":"Good food every time !! I go there specifically for the tostadas ...their Pico de Gallo is to die for .... Wait time is average ...tortilla soup is delitious a bit pricey but is worth it ... I could eat pollo loco 2 o 3 times a week"}

The chicken is great..
I like the steak buritto too."}

{"text":"The BF, daughter and I ate here this evening around 7:30PM.  What a mistake!  

Here's the Cliff's Notes version:  Absolute worst employees and service.  Loud, obnoxious, vibrating buzzers they refuse to turn off so they let them go off on top of the countertop all night so the whole restaurant has to hear it.  Food wrong, and absolutely disgusting.  

Details:  When we first entered, there were 2 small families in front of us.  The cashier looked either very much on drugs, or like she would have rather been in the depths of hell, rather than at work.  She was very rude and not helpful toward what the first (senior) couple.  They were asking a lot of questions, as they couldn't see the menu.  She was very snappy at them and had to ask someone else for almost all of their answers.  She took a ridiculously long time ringing them up.  Next family: mom, dad, kid (I'm assuming).  We had already been standing in line for over 5 minutes waiting for her to ring up the first couple, and this family took her about 3 or 4 minutes.  

I already researched the online menu of what my daughter and I wanted because I'm a vegetarian and she's indecisive, so I was ready to go!  As the people in front of us walk away, i look at her as I'm moving up and she doesn't say \"hi\", \"can I help you\", \"kiss my ass\", or anything.  Doesn't even smile, just stares at me..  So, I just start ordering and tell her I want the kid's meal with 2 chicken legs.  She asks me what side.  I tell her flour tortillas.  She then says, \"you need to pick one of these\", and points to a sign of the side options on the counter.  I tell her mashed potatoes.  Then she asks do i want chips or tortillas.. Wth, I seriously just freaking told her!  Then she even asks again if i want flour or corn! By this point, I'm sure its the drugs..  I order the Grande Avocado Bowl, she rings something in, and then I tell her that I want shrimp on the side (I'm a vegetarian, so it goes to the BF).  She says \"oh, you want shrimp?\" (it comes with a choice of shrimp or chicken, and she automatically rang me up for chicken) So, I'm like \"oh dear Lord, here we go with having to wait another 5 minutes just for her to fix her mistake\".  I emphasize AGAIN for the shrimp on the side, since she was having trouble even forming sentences. BF orders a large cup of chicken tortilla soup.  Painful ordering experience..

While you're waiting for your order, they give a buzzer.  Well, when they call your order, they don't bother turning them off, they just let them sit on the counter top, vibrating wildly, extremely loud, for at least a minute, PER ORDER!  This happened throughout our entire meal.  Extremely annoying.

Food comes up a short while later and the BF's soup is in a small bowl when he ordered large, and she (different lady) says \"are you sure??\".  Wow!!  So she walks over to the chick that rang us up and asked her, instead of just giving him a larger bowl!!  She comes back and says \"my bad, it was my mistake\".  (Screening process for employees must not be too extensive here...) My food was totally wrong, it was extremely sloppily put together and it had chicken ON IT.  I tell her it was shrimp instead of chicken and on the side, and I thought her head was gonna start spinning around; I had definitely confused her to the point of no return.. So I wait about 5 minutes and she gives me my order which strikingly resembles slop you would give a pig from a bucket.  It tasted worse.  80 percent of the entire thing were super-runny pinto beans, which overshadowed everything else since everything was drenched in the soup.  Bland slop.  I forced down about a quarter of it because I was hungry, but threw the rest away.  BF's soup was fine (but how hard is it to mess up soup??) We've been here a couple times and its not normally this bad, but we will NOT be returning. (At least to this location)"}
{"text":"The Crazy Chicken is correct!  I usually hit up the drive-thru where I intent to try something different but always end up ordering the Pollo Bowl with flour tortillas.  You can't go wrong with chicken breast, pinto beans, rice, cilantro, onion, and Pico de Gallo all thrown together in one plastic bowl.  Mixed with their fabulous Spicy Avocado sauce it's true satisfaction.  

The few times I have ventured into The Crazy Chicken it has been a people watchers delight!  From the 8 employees they have sitting at tables talking numbers and signage to the guy I saw sipping on a helping of the Spicy Avocado sauce.  If you are going to dine in I would recommend holding that last hit in for awhile just so you can enjoy the craziness of the El Pollo Loco customers rather than be annoyed by their existence.   Be warned that weekends seem to be the time for families to head on over to El Pollo Loco for a family night out!!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this El Pollo LocoI stopped because they did not given any meat. thought I'd try it again on September 3rd 2015 and they still give no meat. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Now I love El Pollo Loco. But this location  is not a good representation of the brand. They close early whenever they want and shut the grills down early. I came on a Sunday around 9, lights on but no one in sight or came to the speaker. Then yesterday they shut the grills down early. I mean come on!!! 2 times in a row and a couple weeks apart?!!! No bueno! Bad business. Operations manager is slacking big time"}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant was filthy. The trash was overflowing and the bathrooms were filthy. There were plenty of employees but no one was keeping the place clean. We have been here a lot. I don't think we are going back. It makes me wonder how clean the whole restraint is."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind with all the rave my friends have been giving this place, I thought that the food would be amazing... much to my disappointment, the food was pretty bland and soggy -minus the fact that I did love their Mac-n-Cheese!!. On top of this, the woman who helped us in the drive thru was pretty rude and snippy... However, the food was pretty reasonable priced. All in all, I don't think that I would be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in a greasy, fast food town so this is a nice change for me! Probably the \"healthiest\" fast food I've ever had which is great! Although, I am giving this location 4 stars because every time I come here my food is very cold in the middle, almost inedible."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to bash someones way of making a living. My wife and I went in there Sat nite. We both ordered a BRC buritto and I also got 3 taquitos and she also got 2 drumsticks. Her drumsticks were burned and asked to get others. My taquitos were undercooked but edible. Sun morning I woke up to really bad stomach isssues and my wife threw up. I'm still not feeling well after 2 days and neither is she. I'm really pissed off and feel bad for anyone else that received the same unwanted gift."}
{"text":"Was out last night at a mixer at PT's pub... I pretty much go every friday night. 
It was late and after a couple of cocktails and no food ... it was time for food .. .seriously! 
El Pollo Loco is in the same parking lot so me and my friend Hoss headed over and got some chicken. 
I have typically had hit and miss meals with el pollo loco , sometimes I will get chicken and it will be raw in the middle ... that or just over cooked. 
Last night it was perfect. I love how they marinate this chicken it just tastes so stinkin good.  So I pretty much devoured it like a wild animal (not eating since 9 am will do that to a girl and it was 1030pm) 
I have to say I am not crazy about their mac n cheese... and their potatoes are a little funky ... but the chicken was a double plus good. 
I might have to remember to do this again next week."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco, the green avocado salsa is the best."}
{"text":"Shredded beef quesadilla...not your average, chain restaurant quesadilla.  If you're looking for bland, this is not for you.  Grab some tissue 'cause the spices in this are going to make your nose run!  You can just feel the weight of the beef they pack into this when they hand you the tinfoil package.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Whole wheat avocado burrito is .com! Close, convenient, and they have an under 500 calorie menu that doesn't skimp on flavor a good post work out bite if your too lazy to go home n cook"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, wonderful time and the employees made all the difference they were so friendly. Ishmael was so nice and bussed our tray after we were finished and did so with a smile. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So maybe I just have crappy luck with this place but every time I go in, which isn't often, they run out of chicken. Ugh. How does a chicken place repeatedly run out of chicken? And every time I go in I wait forever and a day for my order. The two stars are because the food is decent and the cashier was friendly.

I'd like to say I wont be back but...."}
{"text":"Love their food! Their salads are great & their tacos are fantastic!!! A little pricey but for healthier fast food it's going to be."}
{"text":"I know it's just a fast food service, but these people just look through u like invisible. They will forget ur utensils and ignore u when asked. Family  meal without plates nor forks. Not to mention there's no soap in the bathroom, no AC in the middle of the day. It's 90' inside. Apparently this place is ran by lazy people and they don't want to be there. Food? Just meh."}
{"text":"Me and my mother went for lunch at this location. i ordered and they gave me the wrong order so i aknowledged to them that it was wrong and they looked at me like i was in the wrong. like i was stupid. especially the manager i believe her name was Ana. i wasnt upset about the order being wrong only the fact that they dis not apologize for giving wrong order. they did exchange it for the right one. and then they also forgot to give me my drink cup and when i went back to counter the employee just looked at me and smirked and told me to wait. i waited and she just ignored me until i had to tell
her again to give me my cup. this was the worste customer service ever. the workers act like they dnt understand. then i talk to manager Ana and she still did not apologize for the bad service. she gave me a comp for next visit. that was not what i was looking for. i was looking for at least were sorry for the inconvenience. i work in cutomer service and this is the worste ive experienced at this location. workers there need to leaen to speak some customer skills they definitely do not have it."}
{"text":"Maybe someone needs to remind these guys that the tortilla for the burritos should not be crunchy and fall apart all over your lap. And quesadillas, the cheese should be melted and not cold and fall apart, unless it's a take home deal where you're expected to cook in the oven yourself. Anyways, the chicken is good and maybe I'll stick with that on my next visit....surely beats KFC chicken."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chain restaurants, because their food all tastes the same (at least it should), but my experience at this El Pollo Loco has been horrible. Every time I have gone to this location, the food has been good (or as expected) but the service is horrible. So bad that each time I leave I ask myself why I go back. I like El Pollo Loco's food, and this one is close to my house. I just have never had a pleasant experience at this location. Either they get my order wrong, don't have what I want to order, or their service is horrible. This time I went the cashier trashed me behind my back in Spanish. What kind of service is that?"}
{"text":"I came here about 15 minutes before they were closing, the lady at the drive thru knew I was there, asked what I wanted and just ignored me after that.. I waited there in silence asking if anyone was there for about 5 minutes, so I rolled up to the window, and they didn't acknowledge me. GREAT SERVICE."}
{"text":"Went to eat during my lunch. I finally got my coworker to accept eating fast food and she received the worst experience. I ordered the mexican cesar bowl and she got the chicken avocado wrap. Usually the bowls have the avocado and you get to see it be fresh. This was not the case. I forgot to ask for no corn and told her she would have to remove it herself.  When she did she found to dark brown slices of avocado. Its not alot to ask but seriously.... I went back in to ask for cilantro dressing the shift leader did not even smile or greet me. He said I will be right with you and I was like ok. Luckily he turned around and gave it to me, but if your having a bad day don't take it out on your customer, we are paying for food and service."}
{"text":"I just give up! I really hate that this is the only El Pollo Loco in the area. It's the simple things. I get all the way home and realize I have no cilantro dressing in my bag. The whole point of me ordering the loco salad is for the dressing. I am just going to stop going all together."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have ever had at a fast food restaurant. The few times I have been here the food has always been hot and looks great as well as tastes great. The staff really shines as well. Compared to other locations I would prefer to come here. They are polite and keep this location clean."}
{"text":"I lived in the area now for about 5 years and this location never fails to disappoint! The dining area is always dirty. Tables don't ever seem to get wiped off. While the people who work there are friendly,  it seems to take a very long time to get your order. The food quality is usually ok, but tonight the tortillas were very old or dried up. Im surprised they were able to wrap my burrito! I've been to other locations and don't encounter the same issues, which is a reflection on the management....it'll probably be another 6 months or more before I come back here:("}
{"text":"The chicken is alright. The commercial is very misleading because my chicken did not look like the one on TV. The sides were alright and the salsa bar was good until I witnessed a 3 year old girl slobbering all over the spoon and vigorously dipping her infested hands in to the sauce/salsa containers. Very unappealing to say the least. I told the child's mother and the store manager about the blatant condiment violation and they both looked at me with the intent to trick me that they did not speak English. They succeeded because the little girl was still using the salsa bar as her private playground. No salsa for me!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place - sometimes. 
I go here because it is close to home and I usually love their food.

Sometimes the chicken is old, or they give me 2 pieces instead of 3, sometimes they forget my straw.... and sometimes they give me flour tortillas instead of corn. 

But when they get it right - it makes me forget about the last few times and makes me want it again. Addicting food."}
{"text":"I love the variety of options here - burritos, bowls, salads, and more! They have a \"healthy\" menu and also a $5 menu. However, I was disappointed at how fiery hot my side salad was! Where did that spice come from?"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customers service. While ordering I asked if the salsa comes inside the burrito and the cashier just looks over at the salsa bar. I got the hint but she was still incredibly arrogant. Finished ordering and went outside to wait for our food. It was freezing inside so we decided outside would be best. When the food was ready I asked for our drink cups and the cashier says \"I put them here didn't you grab them?\" Of course I replied no. She proceeded to check outside to make sure we weren't lying - really strange. 
Then I started to eat my uncooked quesadilla- I would assume the cheese should be melted... The cheese was also uncooked in the tortilla roll. 
I didn't complain and ate what I could then went inside to refill my drink. On my way out I said thank you and again the snooty cashier was too rude to even speak a word. (I was like 5 feet away) 

Horrible food and even worst customer service. I love El Pollo Loco but will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Keep driving to the next el Pollo Loco.  Filthy restaurant serving less meat than I've ever seen!  
Soup had NO chicken in it and was bland as can be.  They took forever and the whole place needs cleaning!  As the slogan goes, where's the meat? 
We eat at lots of El Pollo Loco restaurants Nd this is the worst I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service!!  Bad attitude to start with..  We asked for extra green salsa and hot sauce twice but did not see anything when we got home, not even regular salsa.  Basically no sauces, no spoon, no napkin, nothing...  We even asked for it again after the girl gave us the bag of food and she said its all in the bag...  Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a 4 piece meal and I got 3 pieces and this thing on the side. I ordered corn and I got flour. There was no line and I can see why now."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with El Pollo Loco. The service is good, the food is good, the place is a little bit dirty, other than that, it would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty impatient people. I asked for a chicken bowl without rice and they gave it to me anyways. Took up half the bowl. My grandmother asked for a fork and knife and they gave her a spoon. Flies and bar aren't very fresh"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I came here for lunch. We ordered the chicken nachos and found two long hairs in them. It was totally gross. Other than that the food is ok."}
{"text":"All I can say about this location is that Customer Service is not good!!!! Most of them are rude and NOT at all friendly! I love Pollo Loco food but the customer service at this location puts Pollo Loco to shame. I avoid this one whenever I can."}
{"text":"Had their new black bean chicken bowl, yummy, filling and way to much food for one person to eat and I was really hungry too! I really recommend trying this new dish. I will order this again."}
{"text":"Went in to dine in twice now, chicken is overly cooked, black, I would prefer the condiment station to be covered and chilled better. It leaves a lot of bacteria to fly in from everyone and everything. Overall, I like the crazy chicken. Drive through is fast and efficient, love the guacamole sauce."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for those nights when you don't want to cook but don't want to go to a restaurant. Very reasonably priced and the food is very good. Love the green guacamole salsa. They will also give you a bag of fresh serrano's if you ask."}
{"text":"WARNING:  Do not eat at this EPL.  They suck big time because of the FAT ass manager.  She's a bitch to customers.  All she knows how to say is no to everything.  Poor, lousy customer service.  The subordinates are too weak to say anything back to her.  Employees including the manager are so incompetent and rude.  They could not get a gift card to work and asked if I had cash instead.  Seriously?!"}
{"text":"I went through the the drive through and paid with a $20 bill. The cashier rang it us as a $10 bill and gave me change for $10 and not $20. I tried to get her attention right away but she shut the drive through window and turned away from me and left the window. She came back with my order and I asked her for the rest of my change. She insisted I had given her a $10 bill and I insisted it was a $20 bill. She refused to budge so the manager came over and said he would have to count the cash in the drawer to see if it balanced. He assured me it balanced and I must have given the cashier a $10 and not a $20. I reinforced that I was certain I had handed her a $20 bill and not a $10. Since the line of cars was backing up and I had to get back to work I left disgruntled and without my change. After I got back to work I called the restaurant and insisted it was a $20 and they owed me the $10. I know exact what I had in my wallet and I know I gave a $20 for the food. I asked the manager (Andy) to take my number and call me after he balanced the cash drawer at the end of the day. He called and admitted the drawer was over by $10 and he would give me the money back. I had to go into the store the next day and ask for him. I went in the next day and he gave me back the $10 and then I left. What bothered me so much about this is the lack of customer service. The cashier should never have said I was wrong about the denomination I gave her. She should have left the $20 on the register and had it there to confirm the correct change. The manager should not have wasted my time by disputing the $10. We all make mistakes. He did the right thing by calling me and having me pick up the $10 owed me. If the manager were in top of his game he would have bent over backwards to make it right and offered me some kind of compensation for having to come back and pick up my change. He didn't offer me anything but the $10. This is terrible customer service. Had I been offered some compensation for my time and energy for being inconvenienced I would not be writing this review. Good good!!  Really??  Was it worth the $10 for calling a customer wrong and even after admitting fault and paying the customer back, the damage is done. I'll never go back. I don't care how good the food might be, if the management is quibbling over $10 and not trying to go out of their way to make it right then this place needs some education in customer service and public relations. Sorry El Pollo Loco, don't think I'll be back when there are other options. Thanks for realizing your mistake and paying me back what was mine. The old saying \"the customer is always right\" should be taught to your employees and management. My degree is in Hospitality Management and I know I could teach the management and employees something about customer relations. Funny how a simple little \"coupon\" or \"free dish\" would have prevented this review. I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is extremely filthy! Nearly every table had food on it, and the floors looks as if they haven't been swept or mopped in days.
With the state of chaos that restaurant had in the dining room, really makes you wonder what the conditions the food was cooked in.
Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is terrible , takes 30 min to get a $5 bowel ! Tons of people Complaining about the wait time."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the cleverly timed coupons that arrive with my mail, I wouldn't come here nearly as often as I do. (read: never)  Not that I'm here so much anyway, but enough. 

The regular prices are just high enough to exclude Pollo Loco from my normal rotation, but with those coupons, it's better than an even bet that they'll get me in the door.

Today's Carne Asada tostada and free taco were truly exceptional in flavor and value @$5.42 all in, and hit all the (appropriate) pleasure points. The well seasoned meat was a bit more than a tad past the perfect cook, yet eminently edible, including the well thought out ingredients for this very tasty \"salad in an edible basket\".
 With a delicious creamy cilantro dressing, a couple salsas and fresh lemon from the condiment bar, all is well in my world .

Service was, as usual for me here, pleasant and efficient, with only the most minor complaint over housekeeping. When the cashier came out to clean tables, she passed the salsa bar twice without giving it the quick wipe it could have used.

Other than that, Thumbs Up, Chicken- Pushers!"}
{"text":"Im not sure what the deal is with this location. On one occasion, our food had a 'chemical' type taste to it. Had to throw it away. It wasn't cheap. Today we went and got 10 pieces of dark meat chicken and it was sooooo over cooked and dried out. The skin was practically burnt. And the churros were stale and dried out. They do one thing: chicken; so it should be done right."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars , I would . 
Went in tonight , ordered a burrito and chicken combo . Got home and no burrito in my bag and no sides for my chicken combo went back extremely upset and all the girl (alondra was her name ) did was laugh and go hide . Gladly there was a young man I believe his name was rodrigo who helped me out with no problem . If it wasn't for him my night would had been completely ruined . Went home and the burrito was the worse burrito I've ever tasted . This location is right near my house but I think I'll be making the drive down to lake mead and jones than to ever deal with this problem again ."}
{"text":"Really I'll wait 25 minutes for my food 
This is terrible place don't even go three
The food was good at least"}
{"text":"A young female employee with straight dark brown hair did not wash her hands when leaving the restroom when I visited on Saturday, March 25.  She had plastic food handling gloves on which she removed when exiting the bathroom, but still gross."}
{"text":"I assume most people have been to a Pollo Loco and know the deal. This place is completely typical when it comes to their food. This is a review about customer service only. Read Mamie P's review if you want to know about the food.

I was at first CONFUSED and then AMAZED by the service at this location. 

CONFUSION: There were at least 7 people waiting for their food when I arrived. I have seen those kinds of lines (and much worse) at busy McDonalds near highways, but never at a Pollo Loco in the middle of town. No one was waiting to order, so I was able to step right up to the counter. The place was packed, so I chalked up the long line to the busy time of day. And oddly the people in line did not seem annoyed (as I would have been waiting for some simple grilled Pollo). After ordering I stood and watched the most AMAZING customer service I have ever seen at a fast food restaurant.

AMAZED: I was greeted sincerely and warmly by the employee who was mopping the floor. She was so genuine in her greeting, that it took me a few seconds to register that she had spoken to me. I later observed an employee placing a red cell phone on the counter and then announcing she had discovered it while cleaning up. Minutes later, a woman was walking toward the counter looking frantically about and talking about a lost cell phone. The employee who had found the phone, told the customer where it had been located and what steps she had taken to keep if safe. The customer was extremely grateful (as anyone would be) and both were smiling as they walked toward the phone. As a group of regulars (Is there a such thing in a Pollo Loco) were leaving, they were all cracking jokes with the employees cleaning up the seating areas. The women all seemed to know each other and as the customers left smiling, the employee said something POSITIVE about them to another worker. Next, I watched the manager check each and every container to be sure that the items contained therein were correct. When my food was ready, the manager greeted me with a warm smile, opened up the box to show me my order and asked if everything looked OK. And he seemed interested in my answer. I was so busy enjoying the atmosphere in the busy place, I was not even slightly annoyed with the wait time. 

I think I see why this place is packed. They clearly care about the people who come and spend their hard earned money on their Pollo.

Could this have been anomaly? Sure. 

And I don't plan to make a special trip find out. 

But if I am in the area looking for some crazy Pollo, I will absolutely return to this location. I have NEVER seen such fantastic service at a chain food food restaurant in this city. I am a huge fan of the Pollo Loco on Stephanie."}
{"text":"MUy poquita comida !!!! Pedí un Chichen bowl y solamente venían 4 pedacitos de los q vienen en una ensalada!!! Pague $6 lo que me cuesta un pollo entero ya cocido en la tienda ... Que vergüenza , que decepción  !!!"}
{"text":"Pollo Loco is one of my favorite fast food places.although its always busy at this location I must say the food is delicious! Yum!their chicken with two sides is a great deal,but my favorite has to be their chicken salads with the creamy cilantro dressing and for dessert a flan.Anyone craving some healthy delicious food should definitely stop by at the crazy chicken;)"}
{"text":"I went there after work because I was hungry, I order my meal and my chicken was over cooked. I was like really! Ugh good customer service but burned chicken. It was prob just the location. So I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Visited this chain for the first time on my trip to Las Vegas, l had the Fajita burrito with salsa and I don't say this too often but it was the best burrito I have ever had! The meat was very flavorful and the veggies were all fresh. I live in the Midwest and sadly we don't have this chain or food that good from a drive thru, hopefully that changes soon because Minnesota could definitely use this gem, also the staff at this El Pollo Loco are really friendly and will make recommendations. I highly recommend trying this place if you're in town."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews but stepped in here because this location is under rated.  I have eaten here as often as 3-4 times a week when busy and working late.  My favorite bowl is the Ultimate Chicken with side of guac.  Is everything always perfect, no but what in life is perfect all the time?  But on those days when the guac is especially fresh and the chicken is especially juicy, it all makes up for the very rare mistakes. I was there when they had some register issues, so what?  They fixed it fast!  Considering the price you pay, the team behind the counter is amazing and especially at the drive-thru window.  For all these reasons plus the convenience of the drive-thru this El Pollo Loco is my trusted go-to food stop."}
{"text":"The food is good and so far I have not yet had an employee with an attitude yet but I'm so tired of being told that you can't order the wing lovers plate because its a managers special only and this location is not the only location that I was told this I like chicken but I like wings and the breast only also I was at this location the other day and Iv seen two other customers who wanted wings too but could not get them either and both were pretty upset about that other then that Ill still eat here its just once I like to get my wings"}
{"text":"Always a go to place if you are in a hurry for good chicken. Place was clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"I can't believe all the poor reviews.  This is, after all, a fast food restaurant.  I have been there 10  or 12 times and the employees have always been friendly.  They have a decent selection of sides and the chicken is far better, and healthier,  than any of the KFCs or Churches I have tried in the area.  Always like picking up a to go order there when the grand kids are in town."}
{"text":"It's not fancy food, but I always like their chicken. It has a good flavor and is cooked right. I'm not a big salad eater, but I love their grilled chicken salad and can eat that all the time. I miss their side of sweet corn cake, which was discontinued. That's something I always liked from other places (and I made it myself) and would usually get that there. I have also enjoyed both their chicken avocado & chicken bacon stuffed quesadillas, which I found fairly unique. I finally tried their tostadas, both chicken and  pork, and they were delicious. Their tres leche cake is tasty but a bit pricey for such a small piece."}
{"text":"Drive thru order. Sarah was nice, but got home and found BURNT AF chicken! Super disappointing. I tried to call right away and the phone number is a California area code that DOES NOT ANSWER. 

Probably would just go somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"Came in today to pick up dinner for the family. I ordered a family meal and the price was great as well as the fast friendly service. This will be my new Pollo Loco go to spot."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Was excited to see this new location opening, but the excitenent didn't last long.

Rude cashier, who has no business interacting with customers.   They ran out of broccoli, which was included on my chicken bowl, and no substitution or credit was offered (just lots of eye-rolling from the cashier). Fine that they ran out, not that they couldn't quickly get more from any the many grocery stores in the area, but how they treat customers is just wrong.

Food was just ok, except chicken was dry. Wanted to love it here but didn't."}
{"text":"It's been over 1 year since I visited this location of El Pollo Loco and I was hoping that it had improved after my last visit. It has not. Still the same shitty service, in particular from their manager, Cora. I ordered a family meal with breast and thighs only which the cashier Jessica assured me was possible. When my order was ready, it did not contain only the breast and thighs. I reminded them of my order and Cora informed me that she had refused to fill my order. I reminded her that I paid extra for this order but continued to refuse to fill it. I refused to accept her refusal and she finally relented and charged me even more. Cora was rude and nasty. Jessica also became rude and nasty. I reported both of them to their corporate office. This El Pollo Loco is a joke."}
{"text":"Great local spot for drinks and food.  Nice outdoor area with couches and fireplaces."}
{"text":"These people gave me someones,leftovers thinking I wouldn't notice then when I took it back Tahj accused me of eating the food. \"Looks like you ate it n returned it\". Then gave me a new one and it was missing sour cream. They have some nerve to say that to me, like I have time for their childish behavior. Then closed the window on me while I was talking . I'm taking this up with corporate."}
{"text":"Firstly my boyfriend and I wanted fast food and decided to go to this restaurant because we wanted to eat grilled chicken.
The cashier was not friendly at all and she had an unpleasant look the whole time. I wanted chicken wings but the cashier said they didn't have any and it would take 15 minutes to make more.
The place has bright colors minimal design and it looks dirty and the trash cans were overflowing with garbage. It took us a minute to find a clean table. Most of the tables had old food on it. 
The first thing that you will notice, which made us disappointed was trash near the counter that the employees kept walking past.
The service was absolutely disappointing. In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something. I asked the manager to clean the restaurant lobby where customers were eating and she said, \"okay, thank you.\" I asked the cashier for more salad dressing, it took some time to get her attention.
In conclusion the whole experience was not good, I would never go back to this place again for any reason and I don't recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy.

In a few words...you are better off trying McDonalds on the Rainbow and Sahara. That bad!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Bacon Avocado quesadilla... Chicken inside was half Raw, cheese wasn't melted... Not warm at all. Chips were stale. 

Brought it up to an Employee who just giggled and apparently thought it was funny. 

Won't be returning to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ from CA, was in the mood for EPL, so I came to this location since it was closest. I ordered a poblano burrito, it was very bland, not much flavor at all. The salsa bar salsas all looked watered down and the cilantro looked old and wilted. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgeable, fast service.  Delicious food.  Four stars instead of five because the tables and floor could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"Alright since I live in Arizona I have always passed by this place on my way to Harkins in Mesa, so I decided a pre Jurassic World meal at this location would be worth a try. I was greeted by a welcoming service but the food paled in comparison. I ordered the 2 piece thigh and wing combo with mac and cheese. Sadly, the mac and cheese was the best part of the meal. The chicken was dry and had no classic el pollo loco taste to it for a good kick to the meal. I had doubts unfortunately whether the meat was well cooked during my experience. Additionally, the portion was extremely small for a hefty $7 within a fast food setting and I was left famished after my meal. Based on the crowd within the restaurant consisting of me, myself and I, I understood the paucity of individuals at this restaurant. 

In the future, I hope the quality of food within this establishment is vastly improved, otherwise I'm afraid my sentiments will be echoed in similar fashion."}
{"text":"Wow. Just pretty bad . I was running errands and I stopped in since I was in that area, just because I had a coupon for a nice new salad. Well I pull in heading towards the driveway and there were cones blocking the entrance. Ok. I'll get out and go in to order my avocado salad with the coupon . The girl screams \" we can't take credit cards or coupons our system is down \" Ok . Mientras todos los empleados estan hablando en Español tan ruidoso de frente de los clientes que no son hispanohablantes. This can be perceived by non speaking clients as rude, I speak and understand Spanish. This isn't a legit Mexican place , Not a local place that caters to a Latino clientele . I know that being in the service industry myself, corporate at that, it is a No-No. English should be spoken up in the front and Spanish in the back. So anyways, the girl tells me no credit. I nodded. Then I pull out the coupon to show her the new salad I wanted, and before I can finish , she says \" No coupons \" I said \"I heard you the first time\", I am just showing you the salad I wanted. I never received a receipt. Even though she should have hand written one . There was no apology, or offer of a soda or something for their inconvenience. I really like their food, even though it is fast food, but I will never go to this location again. Whoever is the manager should have been on the line where all these issues were happening. I did see a note on the way out on the door that wasn't up when I arrived, \"Cash Only \" in pen writing, but again NO APOLOGY. I understand things go wrong, because I'm in hospitality , but seriously ??? Corporate please take note !!!!! It was not right what happened today. Issues happen , but with no apologies or making up for a mistake as such as this is where you dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Wife and I had lunch recently.  Price was right, and food was good."}
{"text":"My son ordered the shrimp tacos they currently have on the menu yesterday for lunch. Today however, he's thrown up twice, both times the shrimp tacos have made a dominant appearance. Will not be getting those tacos again. :("}
{"text":"I have had decent experiences at most El Pollo Loco locations, however this was not one of them.  The chicken I was served was clearly from the day before.  In addition the portions were tiny.  Shriveled, dry and small for $9.  I will not return.  I would recommend not showing up until late lunch or after lunch time to ensure the meat is from today."}
{"text":"I ordered through the drive thru, ordered a family meal with dessert cake. When i was giving my order i noticed my order was missing the cake. When ask what i was missing the manager started talking to her associate in spanish her thinking i didn't speak spanish and started insulting me. Then i approached her in spanish and she just said sorry gave me my cake and charged me the difference but didn't gjve me a receipt. Horrible customer service from the manager."}
{"text":"Food is super fresh they grill everything right in front of u and don't make it til you order it :)"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful birthday lunch with my cousin courtesy of this location!  Food was delicious, prepared exactly as ordered, served promptly and with a congratulatory smile.   This restaurant, management and servers rock!  Thanks for making my birthday fun."}
{"text":"Please advise why they remodeled the building and must have replaced management and now everyone there seems like they hate life and hate their customers.  And why is it 8:30 and somehow they ran out of tortillas?"}
{"text":"I used to love this place until today. I just got off work and was craving a delicious meal. And I thought I would grab some El Pollo Loco. I also had some coupons that I received in the mail. However, I waited in the drive thru line forever, to come to find I got corn on the cobb instead of corn in a cup(which I was craving so badly). The lady asked me what sauces and salsa I wanted and had nothing inside the bag when I checked. But did not want the hassle of going in to grab some sauces. I was not satisfied with my food.I usually never complain about fast food, but really horrible job"}
{"text":"This was the most horrible experience EVER. I ordered a Double Chicken Fit Bowl. I asked the cashier to remove 1 of the chicken and add a side of brown rice. When I got my food it had NO chicken on it at all. I took it back to the same girl behind the salsa bar...I said excuse me this was suppose to have 1 side of chicken on it. The rude ass girl didn't even look me in the eye and said to me \" No, YOU said no chicken add rice.\" She snatched the bowl out of my hand without gloves took it to her manager raising her voice. The gentleman beside me as upset because he ws so rude and my boyfriend asked why she was being so rude because the order wasn't wrong just misunderstood and the manger did not say word...no apology and the cashier rolled her eyes at us. WORST CUSTOMER SERVOCE EVER!"}
{"text":"ft Apache is the closest location to my home but I will never go again 
every single time my order is always wrong I don't understand how they can make a mistake every time! 
I order the simplest chipotle chicken burrito (now w avocado)
I mean how hard can that be? 
horrible and very disappointing to get home and open another wrong order!
I can't even open the burrito to check if they got it right bc it'll fall apart"}
{"text":"They're really friendly and took our order with no attitude has a friendly atmosphere
I love places like this especially Hispanic places it nice quiet yet busy and I will come back some time"}
{"text":"First off, food quality was ok.  However, given the rudeness of staff, I don think think I would go back. Lady at Smith's said she stopped going to El pollo loco because five years she went and the food made her sick and thought people were rude and hadn't been back since."}
{"text":"It was not that difficult. I asked for a salad with TWO adjustments. 

1. Black beans instead of pinto. 
2. Fine chop the chicken. 

I am blown away at how many times the young lady at the cashier had to confirm my order with me, (2 times at the order window and again when I pulled up. I even made sure to speak clearly.) and they STILL GOT IT WRONG. I wish this was the first time this happened at this location."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet, I don't understand the negative reviews here. It is an EL POLLO LOCO if you were expecting more, that's kind of on you. The service here is very fast, the food, especially the chicken is fresh and hot off the grill. The prices are really fair and the menus is expansive. I feel like if El Pollo Loco would have recognized the healthy eating train early and had branded differently they could have been Chipotle. I greatly prefer this place to Chipotle or Cafe Rio. Get the Double Chicken Bowl for less than $7 and I think you'll agree."}
{"text":"I am quite surprised at all the low reviews here. There is lots of parking in the lot.      I decided to stop here one day after visiting the great Bookmans.  It is very fresh food, and not at all over priced.  There is an entire little salsa bar that has cool to go cups with nice tight lids( a major plus).   The food is excellent! no red meat just fish and chicken. Lots of fresh limes.  Every one there were very pleasant and though i took it to go. I could of eaten there because it was nice and clean. They even had a drive thru. I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"It was well before ten minutes before close and they had already locked doors and closed the drive thru. When we pulled up to the window they said they already put away their food and they \"had\" to close early. Wow. Way to follow your business hours."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco, but this location by my work sucks! I have gone here a couple times to see if it would be better, and it has sucked every time time! I am on my lunch break, so I go through the drive thru. I order a double chicken tostado with no sour cream. 9/10 times I get my order back with sour cream.. I have to give it back to them, and wait longer for the correct order. When I get my drink back, it ALWAYS has soda on the side of the cup dripping down. I literally have to tell the employee holding it out the window, and all she did was hand me some napkins, and didn't apologize. This has happened to me three times! I will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"After receiving our order I was shocked on how horrible it was! Chicken was dry and tasteless, salsas were watered down and coleslaw was just shredded cabbage more like a salad. I am giving it 1 star because dining room was clean and very pleasant, can't say the same about their restrooms."}
{"text":"So excited for a location in West Valley other than Buckeye. Lots of staff working but poorly trained cashiers. We had to repeat our order several times and didn't even get a receipt. The shift leader was spinning our take out bag like a pendulum as he called our number. The two stars is for the customer service."}
{"text":"Went in there about 9 P.M, forget about, if you like stale rice and chicken then you'll this place, not to mention the empty salsa bar. I will never eat here again, it seems like no one cared about the quality of the food here. Oh well next time, I'll go across the street and get a fresh Dback dog. Get your stuff together El Pollo Loco, your losing customers."}
{"text":"The food was good.  It took about 13 min. to get the other half of our order and then it was wrong so had had to wait another 3 min.  It was pretty busy but there was 2 mistakes on my order.  One from the cashier and one from the cook.  Will I come back?  Probably so because I like their chicken and coupons!"}
{"text":"I'm at training for work and went for a quick lunch. I was in the drive thru for 15+ minutes. I ordered the avocado chicken salad, which is my usual meal I order. The lettuce was old and chewy. Sad!!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night at 7pm & again they were out of chicken breast. This time I knew to ask since last time they were out I didn't know until I got home with my order. They gave me legs & thighs only. If there business is selling chicken you would think they could figure out how to have what there selling. This was the 5th time this has happened. To think you pay 500k plus for a franchise & you can't figure out how to not run out of chicken.
That was the last time I will go there."}
{"text":"We weren't  able to eat here but it says they close at 11pm. We were there by 10 pm and they turn as away.. 

Seems like employees there dont want to work. Come on close at your closing time!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my last visit at this location. The drive thru line was incredibly backed up and the service was running so slow. They forgot my scrawny dry chicken (what's up with that? The chicken used to be quality juicy chicken) so I had to go through the drive thru again AND they got rid of the BBQ black beans. I did not enjoy my BRC with the new black beans. Overall my meal was not something worth coming back for."}
{"text":"It's not called \" el salad loco\", \"el burrito loco\", nor is it called \"el quesadilla loco\"!

El pollo loco, I come here for the crazy good chicken. I would not order anything else. 

Here's how I do it:
Order chicken only
Get salsa from the salsa bar. My favorite is the green avocado sauce. Pro-tip: ask for a large Dixie cup at the counter. They only have Dixie cups for ants at the salad bar."}
{"text":"Delicious clean fast food! I ordered the Double Chicken bowl and my husband the Three Piece dark combo and we shared the guacamole and chips. Our dinners were delicious and service was fast and friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is great can't complain.. The only thing is the manager is very greedy with the salsas!!  This is the Pollo Loco near  7st and bell rd."}
{"text":"Took my 7 year old here for a snack after school, she loves the chicken legs here. Unbeknownst to me, they told me they stopped selling individual chicken legs...really?! A chicken fast food restaurant that doesn't sell a leg for a kid? Ok...so I went to the one one warm springs and guess who sells individual chicken legs...this location was always mediocre but after that I'm just not going here anymore"}
{"text":"This place is normally pretty goodBut after having almost 80% of my lettuce yellow and sour then after having gravy that was more like soup I start to question the freshness of the food I'll bet they probably take the black beans and dump them right out of the can not sure if I will go back after this experience"}
{"text":"Rude customer service. Gave burnt chicken they had an attitude when I asked for a different piece. The nerve  I just paid damn near $10 for this salad you gone replace this burnt ass chicken smh. Not the first time the service was bad"}
{"text":"This place is tragic.   Ordered/paid @ 6:48. Now 7:17 still no food. Cashier said cook was busy & so was the manager.  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Visited a few days ago. Expressed that I had very dry chicken twice before. Jennifer said sorry and made sure by showing me my order was good. Jennifer the dinner was excellent, our family enjoyed eating the very moist and delicious El Polo Loco. We will be back. Great job Jennifer.  Mike"}
{"text":"I love the food. But the employees keep folding my corn tortillas and it is always a ripped up mess when I try to eat with it. One employee told me they never fold it. That it is always laid flat on top. Lies. This is the 6th time this month. They need a better system for salsa too. I never get what I asked for."}
{"text":"The worst location in Vegas. Been burned by them three times, there won't be a fourth. Order comes out incorrect, price incorrect (maybe I shoulda tried to pay with pesos)..... this place is a train wreck and gives all el Pollo locos a bad name."}
{"text":"Really love some of the food (especially the tortillas and the chicken)--however: 20 min wait just to be told 20 more minutes until they will have dark meat chicken? That is about 10 more min then I would wait at a real restaurant."}
{"text":"If anyone is looking to have great customer service and prompt service, don't go to this location. They have hired kids to run this restaurant. They are in there playing, joking around and not taking their duties seriously. I live around the corner from this one so I go to this one at least once a week. The store hours on google says that they are open until 11pm every night, but I don't think the young adults that work there know that. They literally start shutting down at around 9:30/10. One night around 9:45p I waited 5 minutes (and yes I was watching my clock) before someone came on to say, \"how may I help you\". I was saying \"hello\" into the speaker the entire time. The girl was laughing when she finally cane on. I was actually about to just drive up to the window before they came on. 

Last night 4/22 at 10:20p (looking at my receipt) it took about 3-4 minutes for a young man to come on the speaker and when he did he was laughing. Another time at night also I did indeed have to drive up to the actual window due to no one coming on the speaker, and when i did a young man told me that they've already started cleaning up (yet it was not 11p). From what I can see there are literally no adults (anyone qualified enough to be in charge) that works there. This is just a few of my experiences, but again I go there once a week so I have a lot more. I have literally never gotten quick service or excellent customer service here. It's always subpar, kind of like you ruined the fun they were having. When people are coming to my house and ask \"what do you want me to pick up to eat\" I have stopped saying El Pollo Loco. We as adults complain about Millennials, but yet we allow them to run our businesses without proper training nor do we go and do check-in's on them and see how they are really doing. We allow them to run stores without supervision. So who's fault is it really that these young adults/kids are running a muck at this store? It's sad and unfortunate bcus I work late and this is the only health appt close to my house opened as late as they are, but I refuse to keep getting bad service."}
{"text":"For a quick healthy meal for $5 bucks you can't beat the three chicken tacos al carbon.  If you want to splurge add a side of sliced avocado.  

This is not super clean eating but in a pinch, for those working out, this definitely gets you out of a jam."}
{"text":"this location is new so I wanted to try it out and this place sucks. I ordered churros And they usually come with 2 per order they only gave me 1. so I was like ok then. the churro is burnt and it has no cinnamon and sugar on it. the burrito isn't that great either it's dry and they overcooked the chicken. if u want good tasting food that is correctly cooked don't come here."}
{"text":"on saturday october 3 i went to eat there and found a hair in my  food  yuk!!!!

wednesday october 7 i went through the drive thru and i ordered a double  chicken avocado salad!
well they really  chopped up the chicken as if it was the last piece! oh! let's not forget the 3 small pieces of chicken cut thinly and just half of slices!!!  the girl at the drive  thru had such a bitter unhappy way of dealing with the customers i felt bad! i waited 13 minutes!!!!  never again will we go there!!!!
i hope they close the place!!!  i was literally ripped off!!! $7.02 for a small piece of chicken and a brow salad with 1 teaspoon of pico for 7.02!!!!  please folks don't go there twice have i had hair in my food  there and the service sucks!!! i saw the guy take hi cap off and clean his face then started putting more chicken on the grill i didn't  eat and i threw it away and walked out!!!!  so disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"What a difference new management makes! The new manager, Maria, seems to be taking the reins and handling issues. My family regularly orders here. It's a quick, delicious and healthy option for when you don't want to cook. 

I just can't say enough about their grilled chicken. Absolutely delicious!! I've tried some of their salads and they're not bad either. Soups are okay as well. Sides are a good compliment and also good. Churros can go either way. Sometimes nice and crunchy and sometimes not really. I don't eat them but my kid orders them every now and then. 

The salsa bar has some great options. Mild, medium, avocado and hot sauces are always available. Lemons, cilantro and onions are also included in the salsa bar. 

Now, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the tables are always dirty! And tonight was no exception.At different times during lunch, early afternoon, and evening visits I've found that most of the tables are not wiped down regularly. If I eat there I continuously have to ask that a table be cleaned. I am sure Maria is going to make that an issue to tackle and earn this location it's 5th star from me."}
{"text":"Short and sweet..... you would have to be loco to eat here. Should have known because the kitchen is open and visible. That is a good thing. However, the old food and trash strewn all over the kitchen floor was nauseating. But what the heck... we will give it a try. Dining room... equally a dump. Not a clean table in the place. Now, I know why Polo Loco was so empty. The food is was fairly decent for taste and about what one would expect for food wrapped in aluminum foil. If your starving and don't care about the filth and whatever gets stuck to your shoe.... it's okay.  However, there are many choices so close.  So don't run for the border..... run for the door."}
{"text":"Now you know I did a review on the Scottsdale Store. Wasn't a good one... however, I thought it might be the location. Subsequently, I did try another location. Yes, the one at 5810 W. Bell Road. 
What a magnificently wonderful surprise. So good that I am writing this after my second visit to that location. 
First you walk in the door and it is very clean and wonderfully neat. At the counter you are greeted by a smiling and helpful face. Is this a fast food restaurant? Huummm... they say i s is but they don't act like one. Definitely a cut above. They staff was very eager to help and the food... excellent and hot. This does not taste like fast food rather it the taste is that of a good  restaurant. Very pleasantly surprised again! Well done El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"The way they handle the food is unsanitary and gross. First, they don't use gloves or anything. Second, the lady, might be the manager, named Christina I think, was using the thongs for everything. She uses it to throw the chicken around, to open lids, etc. Then as she was walking up to take someone's order (bc they are understaffed), she checks her phone first before taking my order. Phones are so dirty. People take phones in the bathroom. Then after taking my order, she goes back to cut up some chicken without washing her hands. Avoid this place!!! Nasty. I felt sick trying to eat my food. I threw it away."}
{"text":"I love coming to this pollo loco the gentleman at the drive thru with the name tag Alvarez always takes our order with such a positive attitude! Our order is always on point and thanks to Mr Alvarez I will be visiting, again!"}
{"text":"What...the.....hell.......these girls messed up my order when all i asked was for no pico, the portions of chicken were absurd like there was barely any chicken and I ironically ordered the double chicken bowl, the avocado was brown like seriously? And to top it all of I was the only one there. Trust me I've worked in the food industry and I know its sucks but damn those girls are lazy af. Last time I ever come here"}
{"text":"People are so ridiculously ridiculous. Of course they are going to be out of chicken at eight at night or a little bit of a wait. Why? The location is a busy location for one, and for two they just went through a huge rush during that time. It's something to expect. Also the store off of the 215 is slow as fuck and very dirty. No one washes their hands there and of course you would think it's a great store because you can't see from the window. Fort Apache and Tropicana you guys are doing a tremendous job!!!!! Keep up the hard work and don't worry about difficult customers if they don't like it they can go elsewhere!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Clean everytime i go. Hot salsa YUMMY!!!! I eat a salad with double chicken. The family eats burger king next door. No burger king for me. Thanks crazy chicken"}
{"text":"Have the chicken avocado burrito. It was great."}
{"text":"Wow, I feel bad for giving low ratings to my last 3 reviews, but this place is seriously garbage.  No one asked me if I wanted salsa (drive through), my chicken was chewy, the lettuce tacos were soggy, the avocado had hella manchas, the chips I got instead of tortillas was a tiny little bag of 5 chips.  What a disgusting waste of money.  Do these guys realize that nacho daddy, chipotle, apache taco, cafe Rio, and rubios are not a mile away?  Wtf?  DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS CHAIN WITH UNDERPAID EMPLOYEES.  Also,  too much ice in the soda."}
{"text":"This place consistently has old food, rude service, and I have recently decided that I'm not going to go here anymore:/."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3piece combo for take out. Got the two sides and the fluor tortilla. Food was hot when arrived at home because the container kept it from getting cold. The taste of chicken was good. I personally prefer El pollo loco instead of KFC Chicken."}
{"text":"I enjoy the freshness of the food; however the customer service here is seriously lacking. There is one lady (Lucy) that we always get and she is rude and does not listen and appears as if she does not like her job. She has always given attitude when we have ordered. It has now gotten to the point where the good tasting food is not enough for me to keep coming back because the customer service has deterred me."}
{"text":"Came to this place around 10pm and ordered two piece combo (white meat) w corn and side salad. I came home w my side salad missing and the breast part looked it was cut in half. Such a waste of $7."}
{"text":"We were here about 4 days ago. We are very hungry and the guy told us the chicken will be 40 more mins. WTF?!"}
{"text":"My parents & I went to this location twice now since it opened. Each time we were greeted by Johnathan. He is a treasure! I watch him smile through each order. He joked with me each time I was there. The last time we were there the manager was frazzled. I had the buzzer which says our order #. I went up for my order & he said he'd get it ready although it was sitting there. He read out order & order #. Then he took another customer & took care of her order before handling my order. He came back to me as if it was first time he saw me & asked my order# again! I informed him he took it. I went back to the table to retrieve my receipt & was met by Johnathan who related he would handle it & personally brought us our order to the table. He is definitely manager material. I like this location & have been to other on Dysart. I will continue to come to location with my elderly parents as long as they continue to have personnel like Johnathan with a friendly smile & concern for customers."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced.  The chicken is awesome, enchiladas are my favorite.  The dinner plates are a very good value."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a few other locations in the past and never thought that is was great food. This location pops up and out of convenience for a quick salad I stop by. 

I will tell you one thing about going here...Check Your Order before you go. I don't even bother with drive thru anymore. The two times that I did I had to go back because my order was missing an item and my order was wrong and just plain awful. 

When going inside be prepared to be there a good 15 min no matter what. Service is slow and I'm not sure they have a groove yet being that they are only a couple months in. The staff discord is almost embarrassing at times. They argue with each other(it happened last night) and they seem lost when I've asked questions regarding their products. 

Like I said, I go for a salad and it's super close when I don't want to cook. The store is clean because it's brand new. We will see if that stays as a standard."}
{"text":"Let me make this short and sweet. I wish I could give zero stars. 

Corporate was called from this visit couple weeks ago. I never do that. Ever. 

I witnessed staff calling a customer names such as liar, a bitch, and an asshole. The staff, including the manager, was yelling at this gentleman, pointing their finger at his face, and laughing. The man was asking for something in his order they forgot. Whether they really did or not is not the point. Their unprofessional attitudes took it to a whole new level. People were leaving the restaurant because of staff's reaction. The manager ended up wearing the rest of the mans order...that's how far they pushed him...over an item that was $2.50. Hhhmmm

My turn...they wouldn't let me use my rewards coupon and I'm not sure if it was because they were now upset they had to clean up a mess or what but the same staff kept loudly telling me I couldn't use my free coupon. The email CLEARLY states the codes to enter to use it. At one point the manager asked me if I was a boy because they email from ThEIR headquarters had a mans name on it. (It was an example on the coupon.)She said since I wasn't a boy that email wasn't mine. Omg. The combined IQ was about 4...no wonder they couldn't figure out the coupon. 

I have never seen such disrespect in my life in a business. Corporate offered me a free $5.00 coupon for my trouble. Are you kidding me? Another coupon to try and use with rude and incompetent staff...yeah right."}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff.... I always use the drive thru and they are speedy and get everything correct. The grilled corn is yumm-o  the BRC Burrito is a good choice as well.... Guacamole is very good."}
{"text":"I really like the people they are very nice and make me feel welcome.  The food is so fresh the whole family likes it.. and its a good value"}
{"text":"Enter this restaurant yesterday morning Saturday 12,2016 cashier Beatrice RUDE she didn't give me a chance to see what I wanted to order want to up grade my drink see had a problem with that. After getting my drink my food was ready didn't feel the buzzer. She took my food put it in the bag shoved it into my hand. Not one time I walked out your restaurant without seeing my food on the plate. If employees have attitude they don't need to work speaking and treating customers that way. and the other employees talking about a African young lady who can back for a churro. They whole crew need a class talking about customers and treating them disrespectful the way your cashier Beatrice did. I ask for her name and cooperate number she laugh. I'm guess she miss treat customers that way and know managers speaks to her about her attitude. I hope action is taking begin treat the way I was are I shall take further actions. What upset me the most she laugh as if nothing will happen to her I'm waste my time send this complaint."}
{"text":"Just went in the first time and the food was good.  The service was friendly and did not mind me asking questions about the menu. I will go back"}
{"text":"Really great service especially from Joe the general manager. Food came out quick. Clean restaurant. Got a greeting as soon as I came in.  I compare chain restaurants to each other and I was very satisfied with their food and service. I was sad to see bad reviews of this place and was compelled to write a good one. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch for 10 people shortly after they opened.  Everyone loved the chicken, sides and tortillas.  Order was fresh and the employees worked together to get the order done quickly. 
Good to know that larger orders can be called in the day before to arrange for delivery. Might plan ahead next time."}
{"text":"For some reason this location doesn't want to put avocado in their avocado dishes. It happened tonight and has happened before."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month a quick go to family meal that is healthier than KFC. I always use a coupon when I go because it is overpriced otherwise. They almost always run out breasts. Nothing special about this place but sometimes it is the best option when you are short on time."}
{"text":"Ok so I go through the drive thru since there were only 2 cars in front of me . I order two shrimp and chicken tostada salad bowls . I waited in line 33 min before I was at the front ??. I couldn't leave because cars were behind me and I was boxed in . When I get to front to pay , the worker tells me they ran out of chicken breast..... and that they only had thigh meat for the salad . They could have told me they didn't have what I wanted during the 33 minute wait !!!! No discount, no apology just a take what we have or pull off Smh . I love this place but I'm never coming to this location again . Nothings worse than a chicken restaurant running out of chicken."}
{"text":"I bought a chipotle burrito, to my surprise it was huge but as I was eating it.I didn't get any chicken until I was almost done with my burrito,got a little chunk of chicken. That's so ridiculous... Should be called a bean,rice and avocado burrito with a hint of chipotle chicken!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try to the Mexican Caesar Bowl as a healthy dinner option, but was very disappointed the bowl was missing half the ingredients -- no dressing, cojita cheese, or cilantro. They also forgot to give me the side of chips that comes with the bowl, and were unable to print a receipt. I generally like El Pollo Loco but will avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been to el pollo loco since i lived in california.  Service was fast and friendly.  I got the chipotle burrito with a side of pico de gallo sauce and man o' man.  The burrito was so good and flavorful.

There was a great balance of chicken, beans, and rice and a hint of cilantro and cheese.  absolutely delicious and this will be my to go place for lunchtime.  

So so good!  So for a quick good hot lunch just stop by it's truly worth it."}
{"text":"Fyi, the drive thru closes at 10p, apparently.  Not sure if they serve walk-ins, but the sticker on the window said they close at 10p on Friday.  Bummer.  Tempe needs more 24 hr drive thrus!"}
{"text":"Came in for a simple dinner got a two-piece meal three-piece meal and shrimp dinner, the shrimp is a little bit spicy but it is good for the person that can take a little bit more spice, we did order two more pieces of legs but they look like frog legs good food was good"}
{"text":"Wow.  Sorry. Really bad! Went there around 3pm to pick up an 8 piece with sides for my wife and I to start off a nice long weekend. Only later to find out the chicken was jerky dry. Such a disappointment! We were looking forward to picking up nice easy healthy meals from here on a regular basis. At $23 for me and the wifey for subpar food I'd be loco to go there again. I know the location is new but the company should have specs and standards. I will try you again. But a stop at frys foods for a better chicken and store bought tortillas for a 1/3 of the price would be better at this point."}
{"text":"This is a new location next to Pecolle so i thought i would give it a try- Good food & Great customer service so far...
I've been back a few times since and their food has gone downhill quite a bit. The manager acted like I was trying to steal food when I complained about the chicken. He said he needed my drivers license to make a copy..."}
{"text":"OH My so tried giving them a 2nd chance called in a catering order just now with Ariana ordering 60 dinners  and 27 salads I asked her for 1 wing lovers and she says she can't because I was ordering all white meat. So I tell her to mix them dark and light to get 1 wing lovers for the President of the company she still says no. My order would have been more then 400 dollars plus and your telling me you can't make it happen. They should be closed or restaffed they're not interested in making money. WORST El POLLO LOCO EVER. And I've ordered from lots doing catering never had this issue"}
{"text":"Service is very good.  Food is great.  Prices fair.  I've already been back."}
{"text":"I have to say that I didn't order anything from this place I was with two of my friends and they were really hungry because they just flew in from Texas. 
It was 10 AM and the business was an open. We went to the drive-through and nobody answered. We went to the doors around 10:05 and everyone ignored us. once we got in our car and was about to drive away then they unlock the doors. That was about 10:08. We went back and I'm sure they have a lot of preparation bright n early in the morning but they should change the time if they aren't going to open up at that time. My friends later food I'm sure it was good..they finished it. The only thing I used to ever eat here was the barbecue black beans and they don't have them anymore. So I didn't order anything. :("}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot. Manager super cool, can't beat the food. So good. When you're sick there's nothing like the tortilla chicken soup to make you feel better"}
{"text":"After driving past this location maybe a thousand times in the past 5 years, I finally caved. The commercials on TV always made El Pollo Loco chicken look amazing, but my star rating clearly says otherwise. I ordered to take-out the 8 mixed pieces (chicken only).

Good: 
The girl taking our order was really nice and patient as we were trying to figure out what to order. The place looked clean and there was an ample amount of space to sit in. They have a small salsa bar with three options: Spicy Avocado/Guac, Pico De Gallo, and House Salsa. 

Not so good: 
Well, I thought it was a little on the pricier side since I paid $15+ total for 8 pieces of chicken only. That's really sad for fast food. But to give an idea of how big the pieces were, all 8 of them fit in one of those square Styrofoam boxes that is often used for taking home remaining food at a restaurant. We opted to try the salsa bar so we took home at least one of each kind. The pico de gallo and the regular salsa tasted horrible. The tomatoes tasted rotten..awful. You know it's bad when a young boy who loves salsa spits it out and says it tastes gross. Also, the chicken was pretty bland, and they had told us they don't have spicy or any other. I totally understand the lack of customers at the location considering there were only a couple and another person, besides myself."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco but this location SUCKS!! The guy in front of me was ordering catering and the girl was rude and said for him to hold on. She went to the back and came back up front taking crap about the girl she just went to the back to talk to. When we got up to the counter a new girl was taking our order. Her name was Cecy. She had her phone on the counter and was checking her Facebook as we were giving her our order. I caught her eye and gave her a \"seriously?\" look but that didn't stop her from cruising along her social media quest. She called our name for food and informed us that what I ordered they didn't have. She asked me what else I want. I ordered what I didn't want. We finally got our order. The food was terrible. The tortillas were really stale. Nasty! I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Time and time again I've tried to give this location second chances due to convenience but I will never eat here again. They always get the order wrong, the food quality is horrible. Such a waste of my time and money. I'm better off just going to panera bread next door...same price and higher quality salads just not mexican style."}
{"text":"I really like eating at El Pollo Loco but I will never come to this store again. The chicken was under cooked and the restaurant was dirty. Most the tables were un-cleaned and the salsa bar was disgusting. After I finished eating I went into the restroom to wash my hands and was disgusted by how filthy it was as well. I am surprised the health department hasn't dinged them. That said I will still be going to the El Pollo Loco on Cheyenne as it is always clean, the chicken is cooked properly and the services is good. I'm giving it two stars only because I know other stores are better."}
{"text":"I love the chicken here but my last few visits have been horrible. Always get food to go and always shorted and right now I just got a double shrimp mango salsa bowl and it barely had any shrimp and the rice was SO RIDICULOUSLY HARD. It was so hard it hurt my teeth. Last time before this visit today they forgot all our sides and churros."}
{"text":"Last time eating at any el pollo loco - this one sucks even more than the others in Vegas. Food cold small the place is dirty and salsa empty."}
{"text":"I've been eating chicken at el poll loco since 1986 and the Flavor has decayed over time. It's a shame, because it used to be so good. Same is happening to the rice and beens. I also had a mango avocado salad, it was plain. It had only a few minuscule pieces of mango, half an avocado, broken tortilla chips strip and no dressing."}
{"text":"Not only is this the dirtiest El Pollo Loco I have ever see, their customer service is as bad or worse than I have ever experienced! The condiment bar is a complete mess and empty every time I have been here.  The  Beverage bar is just as bad with liquid all over the place. You'd think an employee could take two mins to go wipe down the area and clean up the mess. 
  The Manager Roberto Lemus needs a class in Customer service. He thinks it's amusing talking about a customer in Spanish not knowing that they can understand him. Appalling! 
 I would not recommend this shit hole to anyone. I have been here 3 times, while thinking it was unusually dirty but giving them the benefit of the doubt. Last time I will be going here. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Came in right before they closed.  Did not notice that my 3 tacos al carbon were now 3 street tacos that were not to my liking.  Just did not taste like I was expecting.  The staff was super friendly and did not mind us sitting there chatting while they were closing up."}
{"text":"I have to say I haven't been to an El Pollo Loco in YEARS! I was in a ginormous hurry & my healthy fast food choices were limited to um one. So I did it. I pulled in & the menu didn't look anything like I remembered & the food was better than I remembered. I really liked the chicken & avocado burrito I had. It was too big to eat all in one sitting but I did demolish it in a couple of separate sittings & heated up really nicely. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I don't even remember when was the last time I had El Pollo Loco so on my way back from Cali I decided to stop by and get something. I was starving so I ended up getting the 12 piece meal with a side of Mac n cheese, cole slaw and mashed potatoes, ALL to myself . The drive thru was fast, efficient and super friendly. My only complaint is that they are not very generous on their condiments."}
{"text":"The lady at the cash register took forever to take my order. Didn't know where anything was. The tables were filthy. And the clean table that I did find had bugs crawling on it. The food was good. But because this place was bug infested and employees by sloths, this place gets one star from me"}
{"text":"I only get the carmel flan...they hit the spot but I've had better...for the $2 price, you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Good food, healthier options are nice.  Restaurant is always clean and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Came to this store at 11:41 AM.  Tried to order a 3 piece combo with all white meat.  They didn't have it.  It's almost the lunch hour and they couldn't sell me white meat!

The pinto beans were just beans in juice.  No other seasonings that I could see (or taste.)

Unfortunately,  it just wasn't a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this El Pollo Loco ever since they opened back in 2008. I like this location much better than the one that is off Thomas Rd (4102 E. Thomas Rd) . The Mesa location is much bigger and newer which means it is cleaner. The staff during the day is friendly and your food order is called out within 10 minutes or less after you order. I enjoy a restaurant that serves up fresh bbq chicken that is not fried. I recommend the avocado salsa which is mild in heat but is packed full of flavor. It adds a nice touch to the charbroiled chicken!"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken and great salsa. I love the avacado salsa with chicken tacos al carbon. Their chicken salads are great with the cilantro dressing.  I love pulling the chicken apart and making mini burritos with the rice and beans and the Pico salsa"}
{"text":"Went to this location a few weeks ago and ordered a 4 piece meal with cole slaw and rice with extra avocado salsa. Got charged for a 4 piece meal. Got home and had a 3 piece meal with rice and beans NO AVOCADO SALSA.. Annoying? Yes? Life changing? No.. Notified corporate of my little problem got a free $5 meal voucher (which I haven't used).. Went back today and ordered a 4 piece meal with cole slaw and rice. Received a ONE PIECE SKINLESS BREAST!!!??? Went back and spoke to the Manager Janette and advised of her of the error. The first words out of her mouth was \"did you touch the chicken?\" I said I had gotten home, opened the box and immediately returned. She said that it was my fault as I had obviously ordered a #4. I advised her that a single piece of skinless chicken probably wasn't worth the $7 and I would like the 4 piece that I had ordered. What did she do?? SHE CHARGED ME AN EXTRA $2.70 FOR THE ADDED CHICKEN THEN SIMPLY ADDED 3 PIECES OF CHICKEN TO THE BOX!!!??!! 
WTF happened to customer service!!?? I am going to completely avoid this location from now on. That $5 voucher will go in the trash and I will advise anyone who cares to avoid this place at all costs!!! 
I uploaded pictures of this ridiculously insulting meal and receipt!!"}
{"text":"This food is so delicious.  Especially their salads and tortilla soup!  Use the coupons when they get delivered to your mail.  Only makes the experience even better."}
{"text":"I tried and tried and tried but I can never go back to this location they have the worst crew and they selectively serve you or not. it's almost racial what they're doing,  I'll never find out - never going back,  you can keep your chicken and your attitude. If this is a franchise location,  Shut it down and take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really like this El Pollo Location. There's always some on going promotion or coupons in circulation. The service is fast and friendly even throughout lunch rush. The last time I went here it was going to take a long time for them to cook my taquito so the manager gave me a free taco so I could start eating while I waited. I love the side selection variety and the salsa bar. This place makes it easy to eat relatively healthy for cheap. Although this is a chain I would gladly welcome them into my neighborhood over a Del Taco any day."}
{"text":"If you want to get sick, eat here!  My family got food poisoning after enjoying a meal from this.  That was after my truck got stuck through the drive-thru, due to the very tight turn they have. Who did they hire to build this place? Is it the same contractor cooking the food?  I will never go back to this place again. I have had so much better service at other locations.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"The drive thru service at this location is ridiculous. Took a while till they asked us for our order.. they waited for the person in front of us to get her order before attending us. Even the lady in front complained because they wanted her to wait some more before she got her total for her order and she said she would drive up to the window instead since there was no cars in front of her. Not sure what they are doing inside since the drive thru is not busy at all and it seems that having a drive thru is useless what's the point? maybe they are understaffed or need to redo their training for drive thru customer service! My family comes to this location 3-4 a month and we are going to look for another location or other eatery because they have been doing unsatisfactory service in the drive thru for a while now. When we arrived home my tostada salad was broken in all places and our wrapped looked messy."}
{"text":"I sat in the drive through literally for 30 minutes! It took them at least 5 minutes to ask me what I wanted once I got to the speaker and then when I finally got to the window I waited another 5-10 minute to just get my food! This location needs to get it together or at least hire experienced people!"}
{"text":"I went here once while I agree that the chicken is good, I easily get turned off eating when the dining area is a mess while the store is not busy. I would understand that if it was busy, but it was 4pm on a Sunday and total of 3 people dining in.
I try to keep my reviews professional, but it's not great seeing napkins on the floor and some sticky stuff on a table. Ugh,
The staff here are friendly and nice, but  seriously speaking, someone take time with the dining room!"}
{"text":"My mom has always raved about El Pollo Loco since I was young. Now I can see why. I ordered the avocado chicken burrito and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Super rude everytime I go shut window while your still talking ask for stuff on side they never do it just wish I could walk in and get treated like they want my money food is good but you have to deal with the rude workers and maybe get your food wrong"}
{"text":"I love grilled chicken as much as the next finger lickin' chick, but man- the execution here is somehow worse than most other locations I've been to, to the extent that I'll go out of my way (or flat out elsewhere) rather than deal with it.

If you use the drive-thru, regardless of what time of day it is, expect about a 10 minute wait. \"But this is fresh, delicious grilled chicken!\", you say. Well, if I can see through the window that they don't even start making my order until my card has been processed and I've been waiting a few minutes, I'm not thrilled.

Also, this location in particular has repeatedly gouged me on little things: chips and guac order is only half-full and chips are stale, ask and double-check for cilantro sauce and still don't receive it without going in and asking a third time, torn corn tortillas, and tortilla soup that is 80% broth and corn.

Somehow I still find myself giving them a chance every few months, and their chicken is good- but not enough to make up for half-assing my order each time."}
{"text":"Update.. 2/9/18...so thought we would give this place another try after years of not coming here given that they did a remodel of the restaurant. Nothing has changed dining room is still filthy salsa bar low or out of sauces"}
{"text":"Great food,always love eating here especially bowls. Unfortunately your help at this location has a lot to be desired. Maybe some Human Resources can do some training. Cashier acted not happy to be there not one smile never told me how much the bill was just told me to slide card but it really needed the chip. It was a Togo order said on the ticket and my copy to go but put it all on a tray. So attentive help helps too . Salsa bar had 3 salsas completely out during lunch hour 12:30. Crazy!"}
{"text":"Good food but dining area always dirty.  Cannot return.  Is cleaning the restaurant too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Terrible. This is my second time going to tge drive thru and being told there's a 10 to 15 minute wait. At 6 in the evening a chicken place doesn't have chicken. They need new management or something, can't even handle dinner time."}
{"text":"This location is probably the worst El Pollo Loco I've been to in the city. The chicken was a bit cold when we got it and the tortillas tasted stale. The lady at the drive thru rushed us to make our order. When we pulled up, she grabbed my card without saying a word and never once asked us if we needed sauce or other condiments. I told her I wanted both corn and flour tortillas and apparently that was enough to spark her bratty attitude. She slammed the window in my face after she handed us our order. Of course we still needed sauce so we tried to get her attention multiple times. She rolled her eyes at me over and over again and made it VERY apparent that she did not want to be at work that day. The manager was next to her when I asked for more sauce, so again we got a window slammed with an added rude remark to the manager before basically throwing a bag of sauce in my face. I suggest El Pollo Loco hire people with manners and decent customer service who actually want to be at work... Not some teenage brat who isn't even smart enough to put napkins in the bag. I'll drive the extra seven miles to the next location just to avoid this one."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken salad and a side of macaroni. The salad looked like it was old. It had a lot of nasty yellowish/brown lettuce pieces, the salsa looked to be old, the chicken didnt taste like it was just cooked. 

The macaroni cheese looked greasy and clumpy, was not edible. Huge waste of $."}
{"text":"It's the same as any other El Pollo Loco I've been to anywhere.  The food is okay, and it's consistent.  I like that they play Spanish music here, and that most of the clientele speaks Spanish.  I'm trying to learn Spanish, but I'm not trying very hard.  Still, every time I come I end up with one more word or phrase in my vocabulary."}
{"text":"I have to give them three stars because the food looked wonderful and fresh. I have had their food before a while ago.   But then I saw the prices.  Who spends almost $9 for lunch.  With drink and all, that's what you would pay.  Too expensive for what it is.  I can go to a place where they serve you and it would not be much more.  I hope I am not being too cheap.  But think about it.  If you are a working person and you spend $9 for lunch, multiply that by 20 working days in a month and you've got $180.  That's a car note.  That's why so many people file for bankruptcy these days.  .....   Just a thought.   I know the chicken and accompaniments were probably delicious but ...... you know."}
{"text":"We both had a delicious double chicken salad with advocado.  We could see the fresh chicken on the grill cooking. The toppings bar was great too. Salsa, pico, cilantro, and  more advocado sauce. Fresh and delicious. Would go there all the time if we lived here."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but El Pollo Loco sucks. Every commercial and sign they have makes their food appear to be so delicious with hearty, fresh avacados and nice portion sizes. However, I am regretful every time I go spend my money there. When I ordered a taco salad once, I could barely even find an avacado with the little tiny slivers of them that were in my salad and it's funny how the commercials show the salad as having all these fresh slices of avacados and a large portion size. I am always disappointed when I eat there...and the food is never nearly as good as the signs and commercials make it look. I don't know how they get such great business and customer reviews."}
{"text":"Customer service was good here, especially from Issac and it's the reason why I can't give this place less than three stars. The food on the other hand was not. I come in around 9:00pm and I was just going to get the three piece combo, but it was going to be a 30 minute wait and I didn't mind yet I didn't want to wait so I got a chicken avocado quesadilla. The quesadilla didn't even taste like a quesadilla...the cheese wasn't melted, the chicken was cold, has way too much cabbage. It was my mistake for not returning it, but next time I will because I'm not going to pay $10+ for an item that is far too stale and cold for my liking."}
{"text":"My first visit was Superbowl Sunday, and, was pleasantly surprised how good everything was. I have seen their commercials for years, but, never had one close to home. We ordered two soft tacos, two hard shell tacos and a chicken quesadilla. All were chicken, which was very moist and fresh. They offer several sauces, from chili, tomatilla, jalapeno sauces. All were good. I will definitely be back...p.s.-the staff were very polite and helpful to a newbie."}
{"text":"If I have to do fasr food it's usually Carls Jr, Del Taco or The Crazy Chicken. This location is right next to Home Depot making it a convenient stop when I have to hot The 'Pot and I'm in a hunger pinch. It's a clean establishment. I tried the chicken avocado quesadilla thing. It was actually rather tasty. Better tasting than anticipated although a little on the salty side. I added their avocado salsa and that was tasty too. The drive through is pretty fast and the attendant was at least pleasant to deal w/. 

They only get 3 stars b/c they're typical fast food but they have good chicken. I can't see giving a fast food joint more than 3 stars due to its lack of originality."}
{"text":"I love going to el pollo loco but made the mistake of trying this one for the first time. Smh. I ordered 3 wings a crunchy taco and 2 churros. Needless to say all I could eat was the taco. The chicken was over cooked making it hard and the churros were the same. This was a waste of money. Will never go again to this one."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for grilled chicken. I wish they would be open 24hrs for my late night cravings. I like that the service is very no nonsense and straight forward, not any of that overly friendly stuff. I mention this because my wife and I have very different views on what good service is. This time we got the 10 piece family meal with 2 sides for 3 dollars more, the two sides we got were black beans & rice. Now if you order from the drive-thru they don't give you the condiments, so we always go in and order to also get things such as salsa, cilantro, etc. The service was fast, the chicken nicely done, and the black beans & rice flavorful. All in all another good experience at this location."}
{"text":"This is a bad El Pollo Loco location. I have been a few times on a lunch break and my food was messed up each time and I had to go back and have it corrected. I said I didn't want any guacamole or avocado yet it was on and in my food. I said I wanted a bean and cheese burrito and they put rice in it. I ordered a carnitas taco and got a chicken taco. The wait in drive thru or inside is ridiculous and waiting a long time and not even getting the right order only to have it done again just isn't right. I had a chocolate churro and it actually tasted burnt and nasty. Like a crushed up oreo cookie gone wrong. Definitely not one of the better locations."}
{"text":"Yikes!! 25 minute wait in the drive thru at 8:30 at night?  The food pretty good,  but maybe it's faster to go inside :("}
{"text":"My experience today out did any previous experience. Usually when I come in here, the managers (usually 3 of them) are intense and so focused on the employees that the personality of the store is missed. Today was quite different. Service was friendly, the employees seemed relaxed, no managers hovering, chicken was hot, flavorful and fresh.  The restaurant was clean, salsa bar was stocked, and everything was running smoothly. (I hope the managers noticed this)"}
{"text":"I come to this place almost every day.  I came here the last time around 8pm ordered my usual and when I got home I noticed that they made a mistake on the order.  I normally order 3 piece, 2 breast and a wing for 2 people.  When we got home that night, they gave us 1 breast and a wing.  I called and they were like that's what they took as an order but asked me to come back.  I told the lady, it's been a long day and I am hungry and do not have the energy to drive just for a piece of chicken.  Lady apologized and said come back.  Today I came back and talked to a cashier name Jonathan and told him that I spoke to a lady and he's like I need that receipt.  I told him the lady took my name and that I don't have the receipt.  He's like I see you come all the time but still need a receipt.  Who the heck keeps a receipt after a week?  As much as I like this place, KFC has grilled chicken so from now on I am going over there."}
{"text":"Line out the door, only one cashier. Really?!! they can't forecast lunch rush hour?!!!"}
{"text":"I love this El Pollo Loco.
I have to apologize for accidentally stealing a few of their pens when leaving the drive-thru, though. Eep!

I was always wondering what the heck a carnitas taco was doing here. But it was their version, I suppose. It's SUPER TINY, but the marinade they use is amazing and the chicken used in it is super tender.

The FRIES are better than most fast food places. The only fries that top theirs are Jack-in-the-Box curly fries and Whataburger's fries on a good day.

Their crunchy chicken taco is to die for.
The value cilantro salads are awesome.
And I always see the same lady working the drive-thru and she's probably the nicest lady at any window. She always smiles, nods and says, \"Have a nice day, ma'am!\"

I think I might get a chicken taco tonight.
And probably a free pen."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this location ever again.. Lettuce not fresh, avocado not fresh = health hazard!!! I also asked for no meat in my salad and found several pieces hidden under the not so fresh lettuce. I would personally like a refund, however that wouldn't even began to pay for any of my medical bills. Had I gotten sick from eating this nasty rotten slop. Please 'EL POLLO LOCO' be very mindful of the freshness of your food. Before serving to the general public. If I didn't have to give 1 star in order to write this review. This location would get 0 stars from me. The health department should change your A grade to a very low D grade. Before someone gets really sick from eating here."}
{"text":"Love the tortilla chicken roll. Just has chicken and cheese in a tortilla that I dip in the avocado sauce. So good and keeps my glucose blood level down!"}
{"text":"things have been approved here. I actually got chicken with skin on it, and napkins. but sumthing is up with El Pollo - every 10 years or so..they decrease on their weight/size on their chicken ..... i really like flam-broiled chicken... but #dang?"}
{"text":"I seriously don't know why we continuously punish ourselves and keep returning to this location. The food is decent for fast food and it beats super greasy food for a quick dinner if we are running late... But seriously, 1 star for the fact that EVERY SINGLE TIME we are always missing something from our order. It doesn't matter if we are dining in (rare) or in the drive thru (99% of the time). We literally have to check the bag for everything and when we ask them for the missing item, they look at us like we are crazy?! It already took 20 minutes to get the food, and now our missing Mac n cheese takes 10 minutes more! 

This place is terrible and it's our own fault for doing this. Never.again!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we really like El Pollo Loco and go here often. However, I'm tired of dealing with the same issue at this location and if the owner doesn't fix it I'm going to quit going here. Also, witnessed another disgusting issue here last night that others should be aware of.

First, the issue that I experience every time we go here for dinner. We arrive around 6pm which is prime time dinner time. EVERY TIME the largest portion of the seating area is blocked off and everyone is jammed in the little section over by the drinks. There were so many people last night that customers were bypassing the blockade they put up so they would have a place to sit. I've never been in this location when they don't have the largest side blocked off. Why would they close off the largest section of seating area at dinner time with 5 hours until they close? They also turn around the garbage cans and only leave one usable at the front door so you have to carry your garbage through the entire restaurant to throw it away. This is just laziness so the employees don't have to clean the entire place at closing.

The second issue, which appeared to be done by the manager (heavy-set Mexican woman in red shirt), needs to be addressed immediately. A customer ordered a family meal that came with tortillas, the customer took their meal to the table and started eating their meal for about five minutes and then noticed they were given the wrong tortillas. They took the tortillas back up to the counter and asked for the correct tortillas. The manger got the correct tortillas and gave them to the customer and took the returned tortillas that had already been handled by the customer and his wife at their table and set them down on the back counter where they assemble the meals. She passed a trash can where she could have thrown them away but made a conscience decision to reuse the returned tortillas. I was standing there waiting on my meal and watched the entire thing. The manager then was assembling a to go meal and picked up the returned tortillas, looked to see how many were in there and then put the returned tortillas in the to go order and walked the order out to a car waiting in the parking lot that had been told to pull around from the drive through window.

This really needs to be addressed by the owners and until it is I'll not return to this location."}
{"text":"Food was super great. Will come back here definitely to try their other menu. Four stars because the lady at front, I asked if I can have a flour tortilla for my taco platter instead of their corn tortilla they usually put and she's like \"it's too big\" says by the kitchen guy, and I'm like how are they too big lol it's not a burrito. But anyway dining area was clean and nice and everything else"}
{"text":"I never have such of grate service in a fast food place , Specially in all pollo loco locations I been eating here in The Valley, Selena did an excepcional job suggesting people what to get , very polite and great personality, that's why I give 5stars to this location"}
{"text":"By far my fav fast food joint in any state! But this specific location surpasses great customer service. Always so friendly and polite!"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is OK. Sometimes I just need something quick, and they fit the bill. Their food is basic and predictable, which is what I need when I am in a hurry.  Plus the chicken is not fried which is a bonus in my book. I also like getting the tortillas with my chicken. I am not crazy about the fact that their black beans are refried though...they just don't taste good. What is wrong with just giving me black beans? 

Anyway, for a quick, cheap meal on the run....I do a little El Pollo Loco AKA the Crazy Chicken from time to time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they only have 2 stars. Every time I've come here the chicken is always freshly grilled and tortillas are soft and fluffy. 

My dad always orders the chicken thighs with the tail on and he goes there so much the staff knows his order by heart. My dad is a difficult person to please. 

I always come here when I want fast food that is somewhat healthy!"}
{"text":"After reading other yelp reviews i thought I would be better off going inside to order. It was very obvious that the staff didn't want to be there. Obvious management problem. Young people standing around with no motivation. Had the two piece chicken meal. Flavor was good but very dry. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"So...I'm not a complete genius, but I thought fast food establishments worked like this: Give me your food, I'll give you my money, and no one gets hurt.

I had just came from the gym and I wanted a two piece, with a side salad and sweet potato fries. (DON'T JUDGE ME!!) Last time I went here they were out of white meat...I'm sorry sir, you do specialize in chicken right?!!! But this time, THIS TIME THEY WENT TOO FAR!!! THEY WERE OUT OF LETTUCE!!! WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?!! It's kind of hard to have a salad without lettuce...so I settled. I settled for bland, unseasoned steemed vegetables. Sexy.

The manager told me to have a great night...I told him to get another job...I'm only trying to make the world a better place!! It's a hard job, but someone's gotta do it!


 
 I usually don't make a big deal about fast-food establishments but I love El Pollo Loco. DO BETTER!!!
 
My chicken was dry, my imaginary salad/steemed vegetables were gross, but my sweet potato fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Blah Blah Blah, Yelpers are such Jerks! El Pollo Loco is one of the best fast food places on earth and now there are finally two in Scottsdale. I love this place. Yes it is a new staff that needs training a bit but but why don't you try hiring the perfect employee, it ain't so easy. Everything I have had is delicious and I will keep going here because the food is healthy and fast and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"First time eating at El Pollo Loco and food was ok and line took quite a bit. But shoutout to Luis who was friendly and added some humor to the transaction and welcome me for it being my first time. Had it not been for him, I may not return due to mediocrity. At least it seems like actual food instead of Taco Bell or something comparable."}
{"text":"Honestly not surprised about the reviews for this location. I ordered a double chicken avocado salad in drive-thru and drove home without checking my food (which was a mistake on my part). Anyway, I got home and opened my salad to see that there was NO chicken in what I ordered. Like how do you even neglect to add the chicken?? I ended up driving back to this location to get a refund and the cashier questioned me asking if I was SURE that there was no chicken at all. Like why would I make up that lie ? And while the cashier was giving me back my refund, I actually saw one of the cooks pop a piece of chicken in his mouth while proceeding to handle an avocado slice with his bare hands. I've worked in fast food and that's certainly a violation. 

This location is trash, avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"I had the tacos al carbon platter and it was very good for the price. Appearance wise, It did not look quite as nice as the picture posted by the business owner, but overall it tasted fresh and the chicken was seasoned well. I also enjoyed their complementary fresh tomato salsa and green salsa."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco, but this location, no matter how many times they call you \"boss\", always manages to mess something up. If it's not the \"system\" going down were they cannot take orders, or the drive-through being blocked by green cones, it's them forgetting to pack tortillas or sauce that you specifically ordered. Come to think of it, this just became a two star rating. 
Order with caution. Can consistency really be this rare?"}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time today.  The food was good but the service was EXCELLENT.  Sandy C was a joy.  We watched him handle the people in front of us in both Spanish and English and was just as kind and helpful and pleasant as could be.  It was a great addition to what would have been just another fast food lunch.  Management, give him a raise!  Or at least a free Avacado Mango Chicken Tostada.  When I ordered one he said, \"I heard it's delicious\"."}
{"text":"By far the best and only choice for healthy fast food in the area. The food is always fresh and tasty. Only the slow lunchtime service gets them 4 rather than 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time I went there they said they were out of chicken.  Second time I went there they said there was a wait on the chicken, fine. But when I proceeded to order a 3 piece thigh they said I couldn't have that cuz they didn't have enough. Will never go there again. But ur a chicken place?! Ok!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years now.  Not often but every once in a while.  When we first started coming, I thought the food was pretty awesome.  Since the, however, I feel like there's been a steady decline.  Today just kind of topped it.  The service was fine - nothing to complain about.  However, the chicken was so DRY!  And I saw a little bit of blood!  When we first came here we bought extra chicken for left overs.  Never did it again because although initially the chicken was yummy and juicy, the leftovers was dry and not good at all.  That's what our chicken tasted like today.  I was very disappointed.  Needless to say, we probably won't be coming back here.  That really sucks."}
{"text":"Love El Pollo loco, this location is the worst. Have tried 3 times, each with horrible customer service through the drive thru. Twice my order has been wrong, the 2nd time I even went back to get the correct order and the MANAGER remade my chicken burrito with NO chicken!! It's a shame."}
{"text":"Didn't get my creamy cilantro dressing and got a bone in my burrito. Last time I went to the one on lake mead and had a bone in my bowl now in my burrito?! No matter what location I go to I get bones I give up on el pollo loco."}
{"text":"Grand opening is today! I'm happy there is one on this side of town. The true test will be to order chicken breasts and see if they have them. The other locations would strangely run out of breasts. They did forget my soda at the drive thru but when I went inside to tell them they gave me free flan! The drive thru went quick for a long line. Looking forward to seeing if they keep up the good job."}
{"text":"This is the second time we came to this location and they ran out of chicken! It's a 20 min wait for a chicken breast. Don't waste your time at this location. Does Pizza Hut run out of pizza?"}
{"text":"It's pretty much hit and miss here. Some days the service is ok the some days, just like today, the service sucks. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love El Pollo Loco, great concept, killer food. I will not patronize this location any longer as the past THREE times I've tried to go, they are out of white meat chicken. Last night I went in and ordered a 2-piece Breast and Wing meal. The cashier paused and then said \"we are out of white meat\". Fine. I asked if I could wait while they grilled more. It was as if I'd asked for a million dollars! The poor guy was like \"uh, it's going to take like 25 minutes\".
Really??? It was 5:30 pm but you'd think I walked in at closing time.
This has happened 3 times now and we spend (as a family) at least $30-$40 per visit. 
Someone needs to figure out how a chicken restaurant can actually have chicken at dinner time. 
So over this location."}
{"text":"I had to get my El Pollo Loco fix since I was in Phoenix. It is usually a great experience, but on visiting this location, I was a little disappointed.

I was greeted coming in and after ordering, I waited for quite a bit before finally getting up.  I ordered at 7:25 per the receipt and about 7:48 I was standing near the counter. I must have special powers of invisibility that I was unaware of. It lasted atleast 3-4 minutes until the girl asked if I needed anything else. I informed her that J hadn't even gotten my food and it was over 25 minutes ago. It was just a chicken fajita burrito. 

She took my receipt and I guess the burrito in the aluminium foil was in one of the pans. Fortunately it was still warm. She gave me a large cup for the drink and the burrito. She did apologize, but as delicious as the horchata is, I feel there should have been better compensation IMHO."}
{"text":"So looking forward to this place opening and it's a complete fail. Chicken drier than crap. I wouldn't even have received salsa had I not asked for extra salsa because my \"extra\" salsa was the only salsa I got.  I asked what size the salsa came in, i.e., how many ounces and the kid looked at me like I was speaking German.  Not to mention 23 bucks for 8 pieces of chicken #overpriced."}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive thru speaker at 10:40. Nobody answered so I pulled up to the window. The cashier that opened the window said that they closed early. The sign for their business hours said they close at 11. The cashier said that they closed 30 minutes early because they didn't meet their sales goal so they couldn't pay their employees. I've worked in management positions in the past, and at a fast food restaurant. The correct thing to do to say hours on labor is to send employees home early. By closing the doors early you're chasing customers away, therefore losing money. Horrible management. I was very disappointed. I was hungry and really wanted their chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is but I've watched this particular location get worse over time. The girl that took my drive thru order does not listen and I finally had to tell her to let me finish o e word before interrupting me again. Still got my order wrong even after going back and forth until she got it right. This is the 3rd time I've gone through this process at this location. Also...watch for chicken bones in the soup..almost swallowed a pointy one that wouldn't have done any good in my intestinal tract. I loved this place before but not so much after my last few experiences."}
{"text":"This place is very poorly run.  There seems to be no one in charge.  The tables were dirty. The trash cans overflowing. It took 5 min and a line before anyone even came over to say hello.  The food was OK at best.   I would say go spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Height of dinner time and they only have legs and thighs??? This is ridiculous. No one answered the phone when I called. Rang forever. Manager could not have cared less that they weren't prepared for the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Super Gross. I stopped here for lunch today and found a lovely surprise in my Black Bean Chicken Bowl:

3 RANDOM PILLS! 

They had been cooked with either the broccoli or rice (a black bean substitute) and had started to disintegrate so I couldn't tell what they where.

The GM wasn't there, but they gave me my money back. Lucky I didn't eat any. God knows how many other people where served rice/broccoli from the same batch. Ugh."}
{"text":"Not open on time again!!! I go to this place 2-3 times a week. Just about every time not open on time. Sometimes 20-40 minuets late. They always look at me like what's wrong. Dah! No more..... I'll spend my money somewhere else.
The manager, the owner and corporate office don't care. I've complained enough.  I don't dare go back they probably mess with my food."}
{"text":"My favorite place.  I love their Tostada Salad lines so much. I love the salsa also.  I miss the caramel Fran, which is no longer available. Chicken is also good.  Sure I often visit there for.  One downside is I feel their Ice tea does not taste well to me."}
{"text":"Was not given mashed potatoes, just the gravy when I paid $4 for them and the order was to go."}
{"text":"First time visit here for me. I went through the drive thru and asked what they recommended or what was was a popular item I believe it was called the double chicken bowl. Either way it was all amazing tasting...chicken was fresh in it...rice was tender and the sauces and salsa to put on top were delicious! Pinto beans accented the meal well. I will definitely be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Had the twice grilled burrito, it was amazing. Not bad for fast food"}
{"text":"My wife really like this place. I have to say, they were fast and got the order right, what more do you want from a fast food establishment?"}
{"text":"How can EPL open a new location and not babysit it long enough to get it off and running?  I was impressed that the old KFC location on Sahara, which sat vacant forever, finally got an overhaul and a tenant.  EPL seemed like a good option for the property. It also seemed like a fine opportunity to grab some food.

Ordered via drive-thru on 3/17 at 1:01pm and was sorely disappointed. My ordering went like this: Hi, I would like an order of the shrimp baja avocado tacos, please.  She asks, \"how many?\"  One order, please.  She asks again, \"how many?\"  One order, which I tell her it shows on the board contains two tacos.  \"Oh, okay.\"  Duh, now I'm confused.

Once I get my one order of two tacos, I pull over and park.  Good thing because one of the tacos is so filled with special sauce which is dripping out either side of the taco. There is  shrimp perched on one corner and avocado on the opposite corner, with small stingy strips of cabbage in between. That was a hot mess to eat gracefully.  The other taco had the avocado plunked in the middle and shrimp on both sides, same stingy cabbage. Took a bite out of one end and had a hot-sauce laced shrimp escape out the other, falling between the seat and console.  It's funny now, but it wasn't then.  And to add insult to injury, it wasn't even tasty!

I'm not trying to compare EPL with an upscale eatery, just one location vs another seems fair to me. Well, it doesn't come close to the one at Decatur/Sahara or the one on Craig Road. Come on EPL, do something and fix what's broken!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-through; they're out of fountain drinks at 1 PM on Monday. But whatever things happen. Get up there the woman at the window tells me how much it is I give her the money I say thank you she hands me my food not a word no you're welcome, no  thank you come again, no we're sorry we're out of drinks. Not a word other than what was owed, then basically just closed the window in my face. What crappy service. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  After I ordered I was filling containers with salsa and they stood there waiting for me so they could wipe the counter like I was holding them up.  After I got my food, no thank you, have a nice day.  Like they were doing me a favor."}
{"text":"First time here and the crew checked on us periodically until we figured what, of the great menu, we wanted. 

1/2 chicken with rice and tortillas for me, giant chicken salad for her. Fresh, hot, we'll seasoned-great salsa bar selection too. 

We'll be back this is our new favorite chicken joint!"}
{"text":"Its the 3rd time we come here and they don't have chicken to fill the order. This place needs new management, last time i came the breast on my plate was smaller then the wing, when I asked the manger whats with this small breast, looks like they were cut in half, she replied this is it.
Will never go to this location."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place,  but today not so much. Found a hair in my soup,  ewww blahhhh ,... missing condiments for the soup and sauces for the chicken !!"}
{"text":"Great flame grilled taste!! Chicken is always good, don't forget to order the chicken tortilla soup!!! Ordered the 8 piece with soup 2 sides and 4 chocolate churros for  $20 great deal except I didn't check the order and I noticed NOOOOO CHURRRROOOS!!!"}
{"text":"Simple and fast. We did the drive tru and got food for the family. They have a cool new avocado salad and I wold try their new stuffed quesadillas"}
{"text":"I had stopped coming to this location because the food quality was terrible and they did a horrible job with presentation and the staff were rude. Well its been 10 months and I stopped hoping it had improved. Well it hasn't. The staff are seriously out of touch with GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. The food quality was horrible. Why is this location so different from eastern avenue? Won't EVER visit this location again even though its close to home."}
{"text":"First, I do like the food.  But the service is awful.  I repeat into the drive thru speaker 4 times what I want...still wrong. Things are constantly forgotten for my order such as tortillas, salsa and dipping sauces.  Even after I ask for them and confirm with them that they are in the bag.  I look and not there or I get home before I realize the mistakes.  I'm done."}
{"text":"Great chicken thats always fresh. Sides are ok, nothing outstanding. The service can be hit or miss but you can't expect too much from a fast serve place. It's pretty easy to get addicted to the chicken... I think Kramer would prefer this over Kenny Rogers Chicken."}
{"text":"So I ordered for a family of 5. I chose a Mexican Cobb salad and asked for extra avacado (which I was charged for). It looks like worms coming from it!! The avacado is that nasty! Picture to follow. And the fact that I paid for extra and didn't even receive it makes me furious. If you can't provide fresh food, don't serve any! And at least put the extra amount on that someone paid for!"}
{"text":"The food was nice and hot and tasty! The service was quick and accurate however it could have been a bit more friendly. Overall it was very good!! We used the drive thru and got the half chicken and 3 piece chicken meal combos. We will use again if we are on that side of town for sure"}
{"text":"this is really one ignorant trained store  this was my 3rd and last time at this fast food arena

either they get your order wrong  You have to go back get a  credit but the person behind the counter is shocked  so they give you a credit take your name and put it in a book as you stand there and see all the other names with receipts    YOU think  OMG

tonite I used my credit got lip from the General Mgr who was working she told me if I got all thighs I need to pay MORE and then I get home both the Pinto beans and C Slaw was 3/4 full really but you made me pay above my credit for a bad order   that was fine but people want what they pay for and the greasiest  chicken ever  see ya...........YUCK"}
{"text":"Decent food and price. Chicken pieces are small but have good flavor. Got the family meal. I like KFC better but this place is cheaper"}
{"text":"Drive through service was ok, just like other locations. It does take them long time to serve folks and they often forget important things like straws, or sauces. I like their skinless chicken breast with steamed broccoli, great post workout protein packed (and low-carb) meal. Their less than 500 calorie menu is pretty good too, I also like their avocado sauces."}
{"text":"Great customer service every time I visit this location! (Drive thru or walking in)

The food always tastes fresh, made to order, and always hot and served the way it should be! Tables are always clean and the salsa bar is always stocked! This is my fave location!

If you want fast and great tasting chicken then el pollo loco is the place to go! Chicken is always perfectly seasoned and juicy!"}
{"text":"Always a good meal here. The bathrooms do need some maintenance. Reasonable prices. Whole ingredients. The salads are amazing for the price and quality. Staff is friendly. The only downfall is they have messed up the order on a few occasions."}
{"text":"This taco place really good. Stopped by here after we had drinks. I got shrimp tacos and the boy got a quesadilla. Very good, service not great but ok.

I would go back for shrimp tacos but the boy says he would not get the quesadilla again.

Go with shrimp."}
{"text":"We've been to several El Pollo Loco restaurants in different locations. The ambience in this one is identical to others that I've been in. Getting a free birthday salad prompted our visit today. My wife got the double chicken salad. I got the chicken tostada salad (free!! Happy birthday!!). Each came with a very tasty dressing on the side. I I enhanced mine by going to the salsa bar and picking up a couple of the salsas to add to the salad. Each of the salads was large enough to be satisfying as a dinner entree. There was an ample amount of tender tasty chicken in each. For an inexpensive fast food dinner, this is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"my family has tried this drive thru a number of times, and we did have nice chicken dinners.....

but not since the 1st of the year....  a 3 piece chicken dinner NOW consists of 2 thighs, and a leg (because they have run out of breasts and wings)...   and the chicken taco is dried out dark chicken meat..

i feel very sorry for the owner of this franchise...  maybe, the owner needs just to pay some attention to these reviews, if they care."}
{"text":"Not happy that I did not receive my tortillas for all three combos  06/192016 even when the order was verified. Also not happy with Craig location as they never ever ever ever (Taylor Swift) wings it does not matter when I go morning noon night never wings and mgmt could careless"}
{"text":"If I could i would give this location a zero stars. The manager is rude and lazy which reflects of the staff which has changed a lot in the year it has been open. When this location first opened the staff use to be very pleasant and nice to you when you visited. Now the staff cant wait until you leave. The location is ran down after a year and doesnt look they have any respect for where they work."}
{"text":"never been done wrong at this location.  the staff is always friendly and the food is always bomb.  Love me some El Pollo Loco!!  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Slow service, but the food was very good.  The pricing was ok.  The chipote burrioto was big and filling.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"This place has good service. I love the chicken. I especially love the salsa. Place has friendly people and great atmosphere. I dine there every chance I get."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and one or twice things were forgotten but we love el pollo loco. Three stars since the service is hit or miss and for the house salsa, today it tasted like chlorine in it and this stuff is usually so good but can't even pretend to like it now."}
{"text":"Took them a while to acknowledge us when we walked in. We stood there and waited until someone finally decided to make their way on over to us to take our order. 

We got their family meal. 8 pieces of legs and thighs, two sides, (pinto beans and mashed potatoes) tortillas, and a chicken tortilla soup. Oh and a drink for about $25.

We got our salsas and while standing their one of the girls (an employee) phone starts to ring and she answers it. No one tells her anything. She talks and talks and when she hangs up she goes on and keeps fulfilling orders. 

They had one of the doors propped wide open with a chair so there were a ton of bugs on the tables towards the back. We ended up sitting in the middle. 

The bathroom had no paper towels so I had to use napkins. The soda machine was about to go down since most of the sodas we sampled were watered down.

The food at least tasted pretty good. I could hear the employees conversations from where I was siting. A couple who finished eating before us left all their trash on the table because the bins towards the back had some yellow cones inside of them..

I've definitely been to better locations."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a couple of meals, I placed my order and decided to try something new, the chicken avocado taco. For $2.99 it was okay, a corn tortilla with chicken, cabbage and a bit of avocado. It was good, but it was cold. Disappointing. Cold corn tortillas don't fare well with taste. The chicken meals were good, and service was good but in a to go order one would think that they would throw in some forks, spoons and napkins. Maybe the next visit will be better, I will be sure to ask for utensils."}
{"text":"Service sucks. I ordered one chicken avocado burrito. that's all. Was asked to repeat my order, and they still got it wrong!  This store is always out of something. Once I was told they were out of large cups!!!  They've been out of forks, broccoli, cilantro, green salsa, One time they put my chicken broccoli and salad in one container. The salad was hot and soggy I could not eat it"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were a mess.  The 1st time they struggled to take our orders properly.  Today, it was moderately busy and it was still taking 20-30 minutes for people to get their orders.  Everyone started to demand refunds -- what a mess.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"I see why the bad reviews from everyone...I normally go to the location at Trop/Ft Apache on the west side, which has generally been ok. This one was a little closer to me, so I ordered a simple 3 piece chicken with sides. Usually, EPL makes their chicken well done, which I prefer. The wings aren't all fatty and nasty, you can actually eat all of it. Even if it's a little dry I don't mind since you can mix it with a bunch of stuff in a tortilla and can't really tell. Well this time I ordered on line right before they closed, and when I got home and bit into the wings they were so undercooked and disgusting, still pink inside I was grossed out. I could have gotten sick from that! The breasts were a little better, but definitely not the same quality as the other location. Nasty, I will never come back to this store again as I doubt they would have footed the hospital bill if I had gotten salmonella from that still-moving chicken I got. I don't think I'll be eating at EPL for a long time, they need better quality control so people don't get ebola virus when they eat there. Ugh."}
{"text":"I've tried my share of Pollo Loco locations, and this one is pretty consistent. The chicken is always well cooked, flavorful, and never burnt (yes, that has been a problem at other locations). When I'm eating low carb, I often opt to eat here instead of other \"fast food\" places. While ordering chicken with a side of veggies or cole slaw is always a safe bet - be careful with some of the salads have have higher calorie dressings or ingredients like tortilla strips (or that tostada bowl!) Although I love the cilantro ranch dressing, I tend to use the avocado salsa instead. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is worth a try - and they'll make it without tortilla strips if you ask."}
{"text":"Having a chicken avacodo tortilla wrap from El Pollo Loco. I haven't eaten here in 20 years. It was delicious then and should be delicious now."}
{"text":"Every time I come here at 530 pm there us a 15 minute wait for chicken. Every time. I'm gonna stop coming. For goodness sakes Mr or ms manager put on more chicken. Really you sell chicken!!!"}
{"text":"It's a typical fast food chain. I come here for the salads, Although, They're small and slight with toppings for the price, I always have to buy something else to fill up. The Cilantro dressing is AMAZING! They should bottle it up. I miss the Taquitos, They were full of crisp goodness, =) They took them off the menu. I'm happy they carry Peak Tea, It's a favorite, Especially the Unsweetened Passion Fruit Mango. I wouldn't get the Churros here, I love Churros so I keep giving them a try but every single time they have been hard and old tasting, Gross. =/"}
{"text":"This polo loco is always fast with the service by the time I poor my drink my food is ready. Always cleaning up as well. Good job!"}
{"text":"The marinated chicken is always juicy and tasty while the salsa bar has unlimited and different salsas, serrano peppers, cilantro and onions.  Their loyalty club gives you free food and discounted items and is very generous.  Portions are large and filling and healthy.  No wonder they are always busy."}
{"text":"I am amazed by this location. The store was clean and everyone was friendly! Especially the cashier who took my order. My wife and I know that we are very picky and hard to take care of. Latrell did an excellent job handling us even with a smile on his face the whole time. It is rear to find this customer service in the fast food industry. I am definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"It has been a few weeks since our last visit.  The food is always fresh. My concern is that the tables are always greasy and have food particles on them.  Not wiped down. Also the drink area had soda spilled all over the prep area. The manager was very nonchalant about it when it was brought to her attention. Think it will be a long time before we go back."}
{"text":"I feel like the quaility is going the wrong direction with this place. I used to love the Churros here but the have been falling off."}
{"text":"Always go through the drive up. Usually takes the person a while to either understand me or me understand them. Otherwise ordering is pretty simple. When asked if I want sauce I just stop saying yes over the intercom cause I never get it anyway. The food is pretty basic but once in a while they have some new item that is pretty good. They are fast and havent had to many mishaps."}
{"text":"This location is not good. You never get what you ask for in take-out. Love their chicken,but they give you boney thighs with little meat. They also seldom have boneless skinless breasts,which is on their menu."}
{"text":"Charlene Lopez sent me a letter and a voucher in the mail for my previous negative experience.  While I don't write reviews for anything other than spreading the word to the rest of you this is appreciated and taken as they do value their customers and brand.  I will be back and will give an update on my next visit."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would...I asked for salsa and got none. I ordered a family meal and they forgot half my order. The rice was extremely hard and had no flavor. The chicken tasted rushed and mushy. This place needs to be reformed because the people they have running it now have no clue. I will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been inside always do drive through. Food is tasty and friendly service. BUT the inside table and floors are very dirty. Please do a major clean up!"}
{"text":"When to get a meal at 9:55 drive through was close people were working inside - operations hours should be update - that way customer don't think is open - thanks"}
{"text":"I ordered two tacos, chips and a drink.  No complaints!  The tacos were excellent.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. I was emailed a coupon for a family meal and when I came in to order the meal they would not honor the offer. On top of that the manager named Mercedes was not nice about it and did not try to remedy the situation in any way."}
{"text":"Still looking for the avocado. They got my order wrong at the window. Already half ways home. This was suppose to be the chicken chipotle avocado burrito. After further inspection and eating rice beans and chicken burrito,  I did find a small sliver of a avocado in the bottom half of the burrito."}
{"text":"All El Pollo Locos are a hit or miss but this one especially is a miss. The chicken is sometimes burnt, sometimes soggy, and sometimes really good. Not s good track record but I keep hoping for good every time. Don't care for their salads (no flavor), love chicken tortilla soup, chips are too over cooked and thick."}
{"text":"Just like all other El Poolo Loco's, love it!!!  For fast food, I think this is as good as it gets.  The chicken they serve here has a lot of flavor and the sides are awesome too.  I especially love the new burritos and that Bacon Avocado wrap thingy is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, first let me just remind everyone that this is fast food.  So by giving this 5 stars, I am not saying it's some sort of gourmet restaurant.  As far as fast food goes, I feel like this place is one of the best.  Everything I have eaten here has been excellent.  I especially lik ethe newer burritos.  They have a spicy chipotle burrito that is especially good.  I recommend the chicken nachos, but you should eat in for those because they use a queso cheese that will qucikly make the chips soggy if you take it to go.  They have a salsa bar with this delicious avocado salsa, as well as hot and mild salsas.  I also like the fact that almost every week I get coupons in the mail from El Pollo Loco which helps me save some money.  The chicken is flavorful, the portions are high, and the cost is about the same as anywhere else.  If I had any complaints it would be that the seating in this particular place is a little tight."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend. I ordered a steak and shrimp burrito. She got avocado shrimp tacos. When we got our order, they accidentally gave her chicken tacos. I brought them back to the counter with the receipt and they apologized. It took a little bit, but they brought out a new set of tacos. This time, they accidentally added mango instead of avocado. 

2 Stars because my burrito was pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst El Pollo Loco I have been to in quite a while. Visited here on the 12 of September in the evening. The staff that night was very rude and not helpful at all. The service was terrible, when our food was ready our name wasn't even called. Not sure who the young lady is who may be a shift manager or manager of some sort, she is rude and had a group of friends or relatives in the restaurant getting free drinks and being very loud. Disappointed with this place and will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Well to start w the order was incorrect in Drive thru. The server at the window was very tight lipped and not smiling. I thought to myself, she must be having a bad day. I told the woman that it was not right and she corrected it. When I paid and it sounded ok to me. I ordered a 2 taco platter. I guess she thought I ordered 2  1 taco platters. Not a big deal. I told her what I wanted. She replied rudely I read back the order to you and was very upset with me. So I asked her for the Manager. She said she was the Manager. What!! I couldn't believe she was the Manager treating customers like they are dirt. I told her she didn't need to be rude to me. She brushed me off. OK, so I spoke my mind and I'm ready to move forward. I get a refund for the mistake that was made. When she refunded me I held my hand out and she tossed the money at me. The change fell to the ground. All I could say is WOW!! When I got home my Taco platter was a huge mess with the tacos being pushed to one corner. I will never go back. She had hate for me!! I'm a very polite woman, I treat all with respect. Her name she told me was Vesta. I'm not sure if this is her name or not. I wish I could give a 0 star."}
{"text":"Ok so I keep coming back but, now I go later in the afternoon and usually only order a side salad and a crunchy chicken taco. They always get my order right and have my salsa in the bag as well.
The meal is always good and wishing I had more :)
They still have an issue of not having any Flan. All I can say if you NEVER have it take it off the menu."}
{"text":"What is going on with this location? The salad is inedible and rotten; they gave watered down,  runny cilanto dressing. They forgot the tortillas and I had to drive through again and the ones they gave me were rock hard. This is the worst El Pollo Loco I have encountered and I don't think I'll be going back after this experience. Get it together EPL."}
{"text":"Food hasn't been bad.  Always hot at the least.  People seem friendly for the most part.  But I must say, this location hasn't been holding up to the same standards.  They consistently forget the little things like my salsa.  Also, food quality has been lacking a few times as of today.  My chicken came out over cooked on the thighs.  Still love el pollo, but needs improvements."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you like order accuracy, consistency and professionalism. If you do decide to visit, check your order thoroughly (open up your burrito if you have to) because we've had to go back inside every single time we've visited. The food is okay and some items are quite tasty, the prices aren't terrible, but a routine visit somehow turns into an inconvenience every time."}
{"text":"This chicken chain is awesome.
The quality and taste of the food at each location is remarkably good.

These folks know chicken.

The best thing is feeling of being full without the guilt for eating at a fast food.
And unlike some other places, the chicken doesn't need to be overly coated and deep fired (not that there's anything wrong with that) to be tasty.

I really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"Well we were super excited to have a El Pollo Loco on the way home. Stopped on the way home today. Ordered an 8pc family meal through the drive thru. At the payment window we paid and the girl just handed us the bag. We were asked if we wanted salsa, had to ask! She seemed bothered that we asked for it. Understand it's the end of their day an hour before close but really?  Low and behold we get home and there is no plates, silverware or even napkins!!!!!! 

Again, it a freaking family meal!
Adding to this- the mac and cheese was hard!"}
{"text":"I do not like writing bad reviews but unfortunately I can't this time!!! I typically go to Pollo Loco five or six times a week never had any issues with the store. This time the manager yelled at me through the speaker give me chicken and a tortilla bag!! The burrito with discussed no napkins are salsa was offered to me. Wow that sucks they lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Way too many beans in the pollo bowl. Almost 3/4 of the bowl was beans. The bowl was titled guacamole bowl, but only two slices of that avocado was present. It was still only about $6.99 for the combo and the chicken was decent, but the cabbage, beans and salsa were horrible. Bad choice."}
{"text":"We come here every week after we play soccer. We always see Issac at the counter. He is very friendly and now knows exactly our order. We have never been disappointed with the quality. The coupons they send you in the mail are a good deal too. For $10 we get two side salads with that amazing cilantro dressing, 3 sides, tortillas, drinks for two, 4 pieces of their lip smacking delicious chicken and two full size cinnamon  churros. You've got to look for those great coupons they send you in the mail! How many places can you go for $10 and have healthy options for two people? Not a whole lot of places. Don't forget to ring the bell if they did a good job!"}
{"text":"I bought the chicken breast meal and I have to say I liked the flavor and tenderness. I would defiantly come back to eat here."}
{"text":"Well I use to stop and get the $5 burros here and they were decent, as decent as a $5 burro meal can be.  My last visit I decided to try a chicken meal.  I got the 3 piece with corn and fries, came with 2 tortillas.
Soda-Ice cold no problems.
Toritllas-warm tasted good
Corn-Previosly frozen over cooked
Fries-Soggy/limp -too bad seasoning was good
Chicken-Dried out, pieces were 1/5 of a normal piece. I measured the leg it was the length of my index finger maybe an inch around-maybe.  

So basically for $8 I got some warm tortillas and a coke.  I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"We wanted something healthy and good. Normally, EPL would be consistently good wherever you go, Not this time!

This is probably the dirtiest EPL I have been to in years. The food trays were wet and dirty with some leftover something on them. All the tables were filthy dirty, as if they were not cleaned all day or weeks. We had to wipe things down before we could eat. They were out of sugar, wet wipes, and low on straws and stuff. The floors were sticky dirty like a dive restaurant or bar.

This place looked like it was run by mom and pops not like a corporate run franchise! The cook was taking his smoking break in his truck in front of EPL entryway.

The food was their savior for the couple of stars, otherwise I would have given them 0-1 star."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as usual. Ryan helped us at the drive through, and was very nice. I always get great service, and food here. Plus its super close. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I should've read the reviews before going there
The cashier today with long eyelashes was so condescending with her expressions trying to order a meal
We got two burritos
Mine was all rice little bit of salad where is the chicken who knew they don't give you chicken in there
Paid over eight dollars for a burrito full of rice and beans
The other Brito they put charbroiled Blackened chicken skin falling apart wasn't even wrapped properly is this a three second wrap job


 You want good chicken Chick-fil-A!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded, if touching expect lines of people. Besides that the food is always ready and very delicious."}
{"text":"Mmmmm first time eating here, my expectations arnt high for a place like this, i was expecting same style as a taco bell but a little better portioned. As i thought, the portions were def. better and the food better quality. Not much of a huge fan of drive through eatings but i was in a rush. I had the double grilled chicken burrito with sweet potato fries and it was ok for what i paid and how fast it was. The service is quick and the portions are good for the price. All in all if your in a rush and your on a time crunch, hit the place up. You cant really go wrong."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location a couple of times while visiting my husband while he was on his lunch break. 

The last time we went in here, I noticed the lobby area had a different feel. I think maybe they remodeled some? Either way, it had a pretty decent flow. 

The staff was friendly and didn't hesitate to offer good service. The food came out in a fairly quick amount of time and everything was correct on the orders (something that is becoming uncommon in the fast food realm). We ate, were offered condiments while seated at our table, and we left. No complications, no complaints. 

The food tasted good and fresh, as it usually does. I generally just order the chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy as my side."}
{"text":"It's a typical El Pollo Loca, however, the staff really makes it stand out. I have been coming to this location for lunch breaks ever since it opened and I have always had great service. 

The food is hot and fresh, the service is professional and friendly. The lobby is kept clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Came through the drive thru tonight & when I pulled up in I waited for a few minutes before the rep came on and asked for my order-- so I ordered my 2 combos. Now I wait for him to respond... literal dead silence for probably 3 minutes! Then I hear \"were you ready to order?\" I then repeat everything! Cashier was nice when I got to the window and apologized. I'm usually satisfied with the great service here but in the end Only to get home and my combo is incorrect ! Disappointed in tonight's service and I'm a frequent customer :("}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience at this location. The food is always great & you can get Serrano peppers & salsas inside which is also great! Today, a gentleman named Christopher allowed me to exchange my salad (that my husband ordered & wasn't aware that it wasn't a tostada salad) free of charge & also gave me a free beverage! I told him that I completely understood if an exchange wasn't possible, but he insisted that it was fine & did not make me pay the 8 cent difference lol. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This was a good pollo bowl, although I'm not happy they got rid of the make your own versions. Now, you just get the standard items, but at least the chicken is decent white meat chunks and the rice is usually cooked good. It is a pretty unremarkable item, but yet still a healthy and safe choice at this chain. Ask for less beans because they load that up  bowl with plenty of beans."}
{"text":"A cut above the rest. Stopped in and food was above average and service was fast! I will be coming back for lunch as it Is harder to find something healthy while on the road other then the basic burger and fries! Staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, and always fast! Carlos I think he's the assistant manager has amazing customer service :) everyone is really friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my idea of fast food. Clean, quick and not greasy and friendly quick service. The food is as good as it was years ago when I was in college. This is a different location and the menu has expanded but their main item the Mexican fire broiled chicken, flour tortillas and pinto beans are consistent. So is the salsa and pico de gallo."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past month or so, there is a new employee, I don't know his name I never asked but I certainly will the next time I see him, it pleases me to see a young man actually want to work, just yesterday I went to buy a late dinner meal and this young man helped me and asked me what I would like and I told him I don't know what I was hungry for, he mentioned several items. This young man truly has a bright attitude and cares for working, 20 out of 20 stars for his customer service, thanks young man."}
{"text":"We've lived in Las Vegas for 5 years and have yet to find a decent restaurant for Mexican, Sushi and even fast food or any restaurant. We have never had bad El Pollo Loco anywhere but here.  Chicken is reheated, and many times they don't have mixed pieces at dinner time!! I have had to call ahead to make sure it's available and often times it's not.  \"Do you have breasts, thighs, wings?\" The say yes but they can't put a friggin' mixed box together! Sad case at Lake Mead and the one on Cheyenne and Buffalo."}
{"text":"The drive thru lady gave us attitude but maybe she was just not having a good day so I won't hold it against the place. I had 2 BRC Burritos and they were really good. BRC stands for beans rice and cheese. They were big and fresh. The green hot sauce they give you is really good but you'lll have to ask for more since they only give you 1 unless you request more. I enjoyed the food and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible and I mean HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE... I'm never coming here again. The manager, I believe her name is Daniela and the other girl Isamar were extremely offensively impolite, uncourteous, and had an egregious attitude. I was almost too petrified to even speak up when it came down to my order being erroneous . I felt like if I said something they would've been hesitant about it. People like them shouldn't be working in the customer service field if they don't know how to treat customers with respect. Overall it was a really bad experience, as I previously stated. You should hire different people who actually want to come to work with a positive approach: maybe things would be different and you'd actually get \"good\" commentary."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave the counter. There is always something missing whether it be tortillas or even a meal. Salsa bar is always empty too."}
{"text":"You know, in a town not really known for healthy choices, much less fast, healthy choices, this place really does fill the gap.

They have bowls and salads with REAL avocado, not some green mush that they try to pass off. You get actual thick slices. That and they toast your tortilla, melt that gooey cheese, you get real red beans, not some processed fattening stuff that will clog your arteries and you get it all FAST.

It's not the ideal choice or necessarily the healthiest, but it sure does beat TB or DT when you want fast, fresh Mexican!"}
{"text":"So me being the nice person I am decided to give this place another try...I ordered the double avocado chicken salad. I get home to find my salad with half a slice of avocado. I called them and the person I spoke with didn't even apologize.  She said well you can come back and we can give you a extra side of avocado and hung up. This chain needs to train their employees to treat people better and how to make food or they'll be going out of business. 


This place can not get a order right...I've given them a few chances but no they just can't. Every time I order a few things, at least 2 of the items are wrong...the staff doesn't even try to apologize and always have an excuse. They said they were out of avocado and that's why they didn't put any on my \"avocado chicken salad\" get it together people."}
{"text":"Big drop off the star ladder. The double chicken avocado salad was my choice, but after arriving home, almost half of the chicken was ineligible to be eaten. It was either rubbery or fatty and chewy. The other half of the chicken was good, but some soggy lettuce doomed most of the salad, even though the dressing was served on the side. At about 7 bucks, this wasn't a great deal or meal. Watch your chicken people.

UPDATE: Customer service and manager responded to my online complaints in a timely fashion. They were both nice and gave me coupon codes for free food."}
{"text":"After a desperate search through this gigantic Phoenix ghetto for an hour looking for something to eat, finally ended up here. They have a zillion new items and it is tough to decide, but everything new seems to include mango. The grilled chicken tostada is only 480 calories, but after you add some cilantro lime dressing, I'm sure that number bumps up a bit. I did find the mango, but it was part of a salsa in the far right corner of the plate. The tostada is not a shell, but a giant wheat tortilla filled with black beans, lettuce, pico, and some very large and tasty grilled white meat chicken chunks. It is pretty good for a fast food item, although the fast food prices are getting a bit out of hand as this thing costs $6.99. That is way too much for an item purchased in a drive through and not a combo price either. They have this $1 off coupon on the back of the receipt, so that should do the trick next time.

UPDATE: Miserable performance on 2nd try. The tortilla and most everything else was soaked with black bean juice, half the chicken was inedible due to fat and overall it was just a disgusting meal. I did save a dollar though with previously mentioned coupon. Nothing is ever as good the 2nd time."}
{"text":"We were so excited to finally get a Pollo Loco over here, but so far we've been extremely disappointed. The food is fantastic when we are actually able to get what we order. Three out of three times that we have been here they have been out of several menu items and one time were not serving chicken at all. They definitely need to get their stuff together!"}
{"text":"The national chain won out today over the tiny family taqeueria and the main reason is because if your in the mood for white meat chicken, those mom and pop places don't use that cut, they only use thigh meat. It's a prevalent trend in about 90% of those places. The funny thing was that the cook at El Pollo got mixed up making my two chicken breast grande tacos for 7 bucks (no side or drink included) and used dark meat. Once that was corrected these were very serviceable tacos. They were loaded with pretty good charbroiled white chunks, lettuce and cheese and some sort of salsa. Sour cream and guac were on the side of the fancy plate and the flour tortillas were freshly made as well. They were too big to pick up until you forked some of the insides away. They were supposedly under 500 calories too and hit the spot for a quick meal. It's hard to trust the smaller random places, but if I had more time I would have tried one of the many in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Stopped a bit ago for a salad.  They didn't have lettuce so I ordered chicken to split with my son.  We asked for coke zero, got diet coke, asked for flour tortillas, got corn.  Broccoli is still somewhat raw.  Chicken is super dry and not fresh.  :("}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to get a drive through order right?  The lady taking to order was a little on the rude side.  Ok, we all have bad days. So I repeat my oder a few times. She repeats it back wrong a few times. Couple of simple combos. At the window, I ask for cilantro. It's in the bag she says.  Nope. I check the oder. Yep. Wrong. Come on guys. Food is great and speed was really good but get my order right just once and I'll vote for your 15 bucks an hour. Maybe."}
{"text":"Horrible pollo loco. I've given them multiple second chances and they can never get my order right. I shouldn't have to make 2 trips to get the correct meal...they have no problem charging me extra for shrimp but they end up using chicken. And on top of it they give me attitude like I'm in the wrong for bringing up the issue."}
{"text":"The worse place ever. Animic chicken,  the wrong tortillas, no sauce, wrong sides. In drive through. The help don't care"}
{"text":"What happened to my avocado?????? This is the only slice they put in the doble chicken avocado salad. ONE SMALL SLICE. So disappointed. Avocado is the reason why I get this tostada alada. Stop doing this. You are messing up the pollo Loco dishes! Not coming to this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week and had the Shrimp and Chicken Tostada, and thought it was pretty decent.  I went back yesterday and asked for the same item and was told they no longer carry it.  Even though it is on the menu board.  Even though it is listed on the set of coupons I RECEIVED IN THE MAIL THREE DAYS AGO.  They said the only one they (all) make is the California Tostada, which \"is close\".  I told them no, and they said they had an 'ultimate shrimp' tostada, which they could add chicken to, for 'an upcharge.'  I thought, sure, if it tastes similar.  NOT!!!!!  The shrimp was chewy (a clear indication of being overdone) and they threw on shredded, heavily seasoned chicken, (it looked like leftover pieces from chicken they had cut up into pieces) NOT the chunk chicken that was on the other salad.  It also had pinto beans instead of black beans.  They also charged me twice as much as what I had paid the week before.

By the way, I went to a different El Pollo Loco today to see if the Shrimp and Chicken Tostada was 'off the menu'.  Guess what?  It's not!  (I even saw one being delivered to someone while I was there).  The other ones have it, so this store is either inept or just didn't feel like making it.  Lazy staff?  Inept?  Or just not noticing what's on their menu board?"}
{"text":"Smallest piece of chicken I have ever had at El Polo Loco.  Also, the chips were WAY over cooked. Chicken tasted good though."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken avocado stuffed quesadilla. It had way too much cabbage, like more than half of it I felt was cabbage. The girl taking my order was very monotone and had no personality. I wasn't sure if she was hearing what items I ordered because she wasn't addressing what I would say, I had to ask her twice if she heard what I said because she wasn't addressing me or confirming the items that I ordered. I could tell she was a younger girl. It was a strange interaction during the order, however, I did give it 2 stars because they did prepare the food quickly and she did flash me a little smile before I left. That's all. Oh and one more thing, I have been to this location a few times before, and overall the customer service sucks, it's like everyone there is a damn robot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is obnoxious.

The employees have all been friendly and I've never had a problem with customer service.

I have a few complaints.

This restaurant is NOISY.  

The big hispanic dude chopping the chicken is annoying.  The BANG BANG BANG!!! of the cleaver cutting the chicken echos through the whole restaurant and it is loud.  BANG BANG BANG!!! then he turns around, flips a few chicken carcasses over on the fire, then turns back to the chopping block and BANG BANG BANG!!!  I know they need to cut the chicken but damn... why does it have to be so damn loud???

This store plays \"background\" music.  Their music isn't bad.  It could be worse-it could be some obnoxious mariachi crap.  But they always seam to have the music turned up really loud.  

And maybe it is the design of the restaurant... maybe this store has some weird acoustics... but everything in this building echos.  I was here a few nights ago and you could hear the conversations of everyone sitting around you loud and clear as if they were sitting next to you.

This place gives me a headache.

Did I mention the food?

The food has a good flavor but the portion sizes are a joke.  I remember years ago when El Pollo Loco gave you your money's worth.  Not anymore.  Like every other chain restaurant they too got greedy and give you tiny portions.  i always leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"This location doesn't seem to care anymore. Last time I stopped in they were out of breast and wing plates at 3 .o'clock in the afternoon for 1 1/2 more hours. This time, they're burnt and dried out. Most times, it's burnt and dried out. Neither the cashier nor the guy serving the chicken up bothered to smile or say much. They also served up a leg and thigh and when brought back to their attention for the right parts, they just threw those back on the grill once it had been out of the prep area/kitchen."}
{"text":"This location is convenient due to it not being so far off the Las Vegas Strip! The service and overall area is clean and surrounded by grocery stores so that you can pick up a few things before heading back to the strip. The customer service is great and I had no problem with my quick lunch here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. Not all locations have horchata, an iced drink made of rice, cinnamon and sugar. The Pollo Bowl is satisfying, and the grilled chicken is fabulous. They have a fresh self-serve salsa bar that has the best salsa verde. I am sad that they no longer have fried chicken flautas. Their carne asada tacos isn't bad either. Finish your meal off with hot churros."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Moon Valley High School on Cactus and 43rd Avenue. West Valley gets another El Pollo Loco! I ordered at the drive-through. Service was friendly and fast. I am so excited about their $5 deals. I enjoyed my Pollo Bowl with Mexican rice, marinated El Pollo Loco grilled chicken, pico de gallo, cilantro, beans with your choice of flour or corn tortillas and a medium drink. Their horchata is yum, yum, yum.

I wolfed my meal down so fast I forgot to take a picture. My bad!"}
{"text":"It's 8:55 pm. I was at your restaurant at 8:20pm. I ordered legs and thighs 8 piece. Was told we're out of that chicken. For 3$ more I could order mixed chicken. Mixed cost more.  

No explanation just buy it or leave.  So I left. Get it together el pollo loco. You can't run out of some chicken and not other. That's your main item menu for G sakes.  At least offer me the 8 piece mixed for a discounted price of legs and thighs. 

That is called thinking outside the box.

After reading all the reviews of this location my complaint is 100% justified.  Wow shape up or ship out is what I have to say."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru to order some food around 8pm & the girl working the drive thru had a pleasant voice & interacted well but she literally was just shoved my change into my hand and swung the bag of food at me as she handed it to me. After I pulled off I realized they didn't get my order correct & I had to turn around just to have them fix it & she asks me if I had the receipt. I tell her she didn't give me one & she decided to tell me that she did... When I CLEARLY did not have a receipt in my car & I was literally just in the drive thru... I've worked in the food business before & that's definitely not how you treat customers or talk to them. Right or wrong, you don't argue with the customer."}
{"text":"Jodi, the Manager, at this location is AWESOME!   We enjoy the food here.  We had a small problem with an order placed in the drive through and she immediately took care of it and went above and beyond what was expected.  They should be proud to have such an employee as Jodi on their staff!!  A+++++"}
{"text":"The drive thru is the most inefficient drive thru I have ever witnessed. Thirty five minutes with only three cars in front of me. You serve CHICKEN! That's it. CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"The cashier was the only one who seemed to know anything! !!
Julio the general manager is a rude nasty person! 
They messed up my order. He gave me 24hrs to come back and get 15% off my next order. Really, I shouldn't be forced to come back 24hrs later!!! I called corporate today.  Hopefully they CLEAN HOUSE and bring in a new staff!!"}
{"text":"I've never dined inside at this location only been through the drive-thru. The first time we came here I ordered the avocado chicken salad. The chicken was super dry, tough, and kinda burnt. But we came late even though that shouldn't be an excuse for a business. My boyfriend got a burrito and a couple of loco street tacos and he liked them. The second time we came was a bit earlier in the day. I ordered the same salad and it was much better. I was able to actually eat it. Honestly we'll probably be back, but reading the reviews on the uncleanliness scares me a little. I hope management visits there soon to make sure. I really think they need to have people with nicer customer service running the window. The normal girl is super blah and unfriendly."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is always so slow. Been here 5-6 times now and every time they have new people working and it takes 20+ minutes for any family meal. Would come more often if they just improved the service level..."}
{"text":"Once again our order was screwed up. This time, we ordered an 8 piece family meal. We ended up with 7 pieces of chicken. Is it really that hard to count to 8? So frustrated 80% of the time we come here, something gets messed up."}
{"text":"It's a great fast meal with a lot of options for side dishes. The salsa bar is great if it's maintained. If you love grilled chicken this is a great option. Try it and see what you think?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the crazy chicken. For a healthy fast food option you can get 2 pieces of chicken, 2 sides and a drink for under $8. I opted for the leg and thigh meal with a loco side salad and spanish rice as my sides. This particular restaurant gives you a pager that goes off when your food is ready if you dine in. The cashier was super friendly and even cracked a few jokes with me while taking my order. The interior of the store could be cleaner. I know that this particular store gets busy, especially during lunch hours, but there should be someone checking the dining room to make sure the tables and floor are cleaned regularly. The chicken is good, and if you are trying to be extra healthy you can get it sans skin, although the skin is my favorite part so I would never do that :-)

Yelp 2015 Review #17"}
{"text":"Went to El Pollo Loco today, ordered a salad..took it home and most of the lettuce was brown and black and close to moldy. Took it back to the store and the manager Julio Martinez with no apology said this is what happens to lettuce sometimes. I asked him if this was acceptable to serve to guests and he said yes. Asked him again and he said yes.  The first thing out of his mouth should have been I'm so sorry what can I do to fix this. But instead he blamed the lettuce and that this is normal. OMG!!!! I am not going to let this one go, called his supervisor and corporate. Unreal"}
{"text":"Almost all pollo loco in Vegas that I've been to have been disappointed but this one has been the far most ordered tacos al carbon came home and tortillas were not even heated/cooked at all they broke into pieces from folding them they didn't even bother heating them up the whole point of ordering out is to not have to come home and still have to reheat/cook the damn food"}
{"text":"Dirty!  Door . trash overflowing on to floor.  Then you get your food...the seasoning bar is dirty, spills and scraps of food.
We remainwd in the resaurant for 40 min. The counter staff made no attempt to clean the season bar or pick up trash.
I made a call to customer service.  He didn't even ask my name or contact information.  He said that he would make the management aware of the problem."}
{"text":"I have never had a more awkward drive-thru situation in my entire life. 

I personally don't eat here because their food nauseates me for some reason (sanitation?), but my husband likes it so I came here for him tonight. 

Selina, the gal who took my order according to the receipt, was ridiculously awkward. I ordered, she repeated it back incorrectly in pieces. I re-ordered it. She repeated it, I said \"correct\".... Then there was silence for 30 seconds. So I asked, \"Are you done asking questions or what's going on?\"

She repeated my order again INCORRECTLY. I corrected her and just drove around to the window. I don't have time for these games all night. When I pulled up to the window she was telling her colleagues about how awkward I am. 

Seriously: Chicken, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a coca-cola is probably one of the most common meals in America. I'd hate to know what my experience would have been like if I had a complex order. 

Be professional at your job and do it right, thanks. I don't normally call poor employees out by name, but this is well-deserved."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and order an 8 pieces mixed of legs & thighs.. we came home open the box and all the chicken was burned badly. We can't even bite it. Yuck! Why would they sale burned chicken to customer??? I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I'm not from Las Vegas , actually this is my first meal here and after a long day booking a hotel and finding the right one all I wanted was food . Me and my huge family came into this pollo loco not were we just looked at up and down , we got attitude, and apparently my moms English wasn't good enough the cashier had let her know loudly that she didn't understand. When I received my order I got the wrong salad , I let the cashier know and she replied\" well do you want to eat it either was it's going in the trash \" (add lots of attitude on that) , man the only thing I asked my self after looking at her name tag \"is that what pollo loco looks in a shift leader -Dolores ? \""}
{"text":"Food has been great from here the drive thru just takes forever and sometimes the chicken is too fatty.. Otherwise great chicken tostada salads, staff is nice and always apologetic for the ridiculously long waits. Chicken tacos are way too greasy and literally drip puddles of grease."}
{"text":"We were so excited for this location open, but was very disappointed by their food. Thought they should all taste similar but no at this location! Very nice built our but poor food quality. Chicken was not marinated enough and their green sauce was awful. Maybe because it's new and all the employees were not trained well...? Hope they will improve soon!"}
{"text":"Love this location!! People are very friendly here and food always fresh and tasty! This is my favorite pollo loco in town."}
{"text":"I know a place has good food if that ethnicity is patronizing and yes, this chain restaurant has great flame-broiled chicken served with sides of pinto or black beans, rice, corn or flour tortillas and the best salsa bar - mild, medium, hot, red, green; avocado salsas, cilantro, limes: help yourself! Whether in CA or NV, we will surely enjoy a few meals at El Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"So aggravating when you order a damn salad and you ask for extra dressing but then you get no dressing AT ALL!!!!!! Why even take my order if you are not going to do it right. I go to this location a few times a week and they always mess up ill just take my business else where since you customer service is not your PRIORITY"}
{"text":"I absolutely love El Pollo Loco's BRC (beans rice and cheese) burritos. I could drink the green avocado salsa all day - it is that delicious. If my review was only focused on these two items and their taste it would be five stars. However, the price of this simple burrito has gone from $.99 on the value menu to the current price of three dollars in a matter of probably two years. It's still a decent deal for the taste, but I think tripling your price of a value menu item is a little bit outrageous.  The staff at this particular location are always friendly but often are fairly slow and the organization in the kitchen area is not the best resulting in some confusion."}
{"text":"Whenever I stop here I leave happy!!! They are always so nice, and with all the other choices close by that goes a long way, making the decision easy!"}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch here today. This was my first ever visit to an El Pollo Loco. I purchased the two piece meal. The chicken breast tasted OK but was pretty dry. The macaroni and cheese was mostly pretty watery cheese with about half the macaroni that I would have expected. The side salad was nothing special."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through at 8pm on a Friday. They didn't have thighs and legs, they told us to wait 20 minutes. I came back another time, same thing. I did not wait for their chicken on both occasions. EPL on Rainbow and 215 is way more efficient."}
{"text":"was not pleased with my visit tonight. waited 8+ minutes for two tostada salads (that's it). then, asked for salsa with cilantro dressing. did not receive a receipt, or the salsa. went back through the drive thru, and, who looked like the manager, heard my complaint but definitely did not satisfy. she handed me the salsa and receipt, no apology or recognition of my problem. probably not going back, and have been coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"One star for the Serranos. They weren't even spicy. Smh. Bomb tacos tho.  CHICKEN IS ALWAYS AMAZING"}
{"text":"Wow all the negativity. I don't get it. I am so happy they opened near by. Very very delicious chicken and very good prices. Oh did I mention how great the chicken is. 

I don't know anything about bad service every  time I have been there I have had exelient service from very nice and knowledgeable folks. Perhaps the problem some of the other reviewers had was because the location is no where near where it is shown here on Yelp. I guess I would be upset to if was trying to order delicious El Pollo Loco chicken from the mattress store they think is the restaurant. El Pollo Loco is about a half mile west of there along the 101."}
{"text":"Gone several times and bought the burrito because of its cheap price. Enough times where the tortilla wasn't fully cooked and I've decided not to go anymore. There staff is friendly at times but for now I'd rather eat here if I get desperate."}
{"text":"Great price on my BRC burritos. Too bad it closed last week. I'll have to go to Taco Bell to eat for $2 now."}
{"text":"Good place to eat it's real authentic Mexican I feel tight at home even though I'm Colombian"}
{"text":"Trying to eat healthier.  First time trying the restaurant.  Place was not busy . They took our order promptly.  The cashier accent was very strong  . We ordered black beans and a salad. We ordered water and she charged  us for a drink . She did not offer us any salad dressing  for salad . We did enjoy the chicken.  The tortilla  was warm but half was not cooked. I was pleased with the salsa.and the guacamole was decent . The chips were a little too thick. The rice was bland . Salad did not have any cucumbers  or tomatoes"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the very best fast casual lunch and dinner dining experience across the board. 

Highest quality, taste, selection, value, service, environment, etc."}
{"text":"Only 12 minute wait in the drive-thru this time.  I ordered a three piece and was given a two piece."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this location for some time and the food has always been great. The thing I want to mention here is how they handle things when something is wrong. Recently I went through the drive through and ordered two steak
Tostada salads, my mom's favorite,  when I got home I discovered that they had been made as chicken tostada salads, I called back and spoke with the Manager,Francisco, and he was very apologetic and took my name and told me to stop in whenever I wanted and he would buy my mother and I replacement salads at no charge.  A week went by and I went in and could not get over how pleasant The manager was and how he really cared that a mistake had been made and that he wanted to correct it.  this place is great and they really do care that their customers are Happy, something i think is valuable in this modern world.  I will continue to go here knowing that if a mistake is made i will be taken care of by a staff that makes me feel like I matter."}
{"text":"Always go to El Pollo Loco when I'm close to one since we don't have them back home. This was one of the best locations, it also seemed to be fairly new. Quick service, clean and the avocado taco platter was very good!"}
{"text":"Since I can't leave ZERO stars this place gets 1 just so I can review.

Just keep driving by this location! They are terrible at making tacos believe it or not! We bought chicken tacos for the family and every taco lacked the CHICKEN!!

Feeling RIPPED OFF!"}
{"text":"Needed something close to my office to feed a team of twenty for lunch.  Placing the order was quick and easy.  Order arrived on time and the food was great!  We had a nice presentation of chicken, rice, beans, cheese enchiladas, chips/salsa, and churros for dessert.  Will definitely order catered meals again....especially since they deliver."}
{"text":"As far as chains go, this is one of my favorites for fast food. Why? Because you can stay healthy and still have a great quick meal. When I am doing the low carb thing, I love grabbing some grilled chicken and a salad... easy and much better than a burger and fries..."}
{"text":"I actually don't mind this place.  For years I have said I would never go there for some reason or another but every once and a while my mother suggests it.  Surprisingly, every time we've had it, it has been enjoyable.  I've gotten a few items but most of mine have been the salads and honestly, they are pretty darn tasty and filling.  Would I come here over other Mexican places including Cafe Rio and Chipotle, no, not necessarily, but It may be included in my thoughts."}
{"text":"I am by no means one of those El Pollo Loco crazy people.  I've only had it a few times.   But for reals, their chicken is crazy good.  I've had the chicken by itself and it's super tender and tasty.   The other day I got the double chicken burrito and it really hit he spot.   It's kinda more like a chode burrito.   I only got it with chicken, beans and rice.   I'm not into cabbage or pico in my burrito.   

The sauces don't hit the spot so I took it home and used good old fashion siracha.   The coupon that I used made the prices more up my alley.  If I'm gonna spend $8+ for a fat food burrito, it's gonna be exploding with ingredients.   For the $5 I paid for the burrito and drink before tax, I was very satisfied.   The churros are really good.  Always make them fresh for you.  As far as fast food Mexican that's a step up from del taco and Taco Bell, it has rubios and Baja Fresh beat."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service specially Rosa she is awesome.... Love to come to this location!!!"}
{"text":"My gripe with this location is the service.  I'm trying to eat healthier so I go there get a breast, take it home and eat it with a salad.  I went there last week, the drive thru was crowded so I walked in.  Ordered a single breast, the kid at the register told me the register wasn't letting him select a single breast.  I told him I come there and order it all the time, he tells me in an irritated tone \"I'm sorry sir, it's not letting me enter that on my register\".   Again I told him I place that order all the time so it can be done.  Instead of asking for help I had to tell him to get a manager.  It takes her about 5 seconds to punch in the proper keystrokes for a single breast.    They need to train their staff a bit better."}
{"text":"lord have mercy on my bowels...the burritos will cause you pain. eat one if you need a colon cleanse. only eat here during the zombie appocolypse"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to El Pollo Loco for about 5 years, but something drew me to it yesterday. I went through the drive through, which was probably one of the slowest I'd experienced in quite awhile. The food, however, was delicious! Hot, fresh, tasty- I don't know why it took me so long to return!"}
{"text":"Writing this as I'm waiting in the drive thru line going on 25 minutes now with only 3 cars in front of me. The young lady taking our order had to repeat it at least 5 times (we only ordered two items.) We wouldn't have as much of a problem until we got to the window and Mr. Jonathan handed is our food. We asked what took so long and this was his answer \"it was only me dude and I had the girls on break.\" we will not be back here for a long time. Thanks for the ridiculous wait, lack of not only professionalism but customer service as well. We'll be sure to fill out the lovely survey on the receipt"}
{"text":"This El Pollo Loco is about a half-mile from our home.. and I have watched it mature over the years. We have taken home meals twice in the past couple of months and BOTH were outstanding. Current staff, also terrific. Derek handled my order this evening, and was the sort of employee every restaurant would hope to have. Smart and courteous and very engaged in making sure the order was correct. The young lady helping serve - also very good.
Now - the food. We had a couple of the double-chicken meals.. added avocados for a reasonable extra charge. Every single thing on the plate was perfect. Chicken, beans, rice, salsa, sour cream and cheese.. I can highly recommend my neighborhood El Poco Loco. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this just opened close to home! Awesome chicken, great bowls and healthy!!"}
{"text":"How many times can  they have my order wrong? Last time I went I ordered a burrito with no cheese no beans and no cabbage, I cane back bc they put beans , they re made it then they didn't put beans but they put cabbage, I came to work late and I canceled my order. Today i went and I prefer a salad NO beans NO cheese NO spur cream I get to work and start eating my salad and I realized it has cheese noe I am sick and I can't eat my food  I AM NEVER GOING BACK how hard is it to get the order right ? ... unbelievable..."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food chain. They have a salsa bar with a half dozen things to add to your food; I had a Classic Chicken Burrito with a side of Tortilla Soup and it was all quite yummy."}
{"text":"I found that is was important to yelp this location because the customer service was outstanding  and the team work between the staff was A+  .  I just ate a BRC and my husband had the tacos al  carbon combo. Both were fab.  They also had horchata!!! I was so excited about that. Overall the staff made this simple pit stop enjoyable."}
{"text":"I ordered our meals online because I that I would get the right stuff.  I ordered 3 combo meals.  My husband came out without the drinks.  Back in he went.  Came out with 3 drinks that were the same size.  I ordered 2 large drinks and one regular size.    This clearly shows who ever put the order together didn't read my explicit instructions.   Growing up things had to be prefect.  Anything less was not ok.  Tired of paying for and not getting what I paid for."}
{"text":"This was the first and absolute last time I eat at this place.

We ordered through the drive through. Typical order. Taco Salads and some tacos.

Get home, open the package and start eating. Well 2 bites in and i get something chewy. I spit it out and its a piece of paper. Square and crumbled and green so it looked like lettuce. I nearly vomited. As I dug through the rest, there was yet another one in there.

I immediately called management. Once I said it, its like he knew exactly what i was talking about. Apologized profusely, offered all new meals, however I declined. He offered a full refund which we received. I appreciate his response, however, we are completely disgusted and will never return.

Pics posted!"}
{"text":"Clean environment family meal we ordered was perfect! We had beans and Mac and cheese . The staff was very friendly and always were smiling"}
{"text":"Came by after picking up the kids from school. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly especially for a drive-thru.  

The lady who took our payment was also friendly. We ordered a family meal with a couple sides. As for the experience it was more then you would receive at a typical drive thru. 

However, when I got home our order wasn't as expected. It was incomplete no Tortillas and the chicken well it was dryer then dry. I placed a call to inform them about our order and the gentlemen was very friendly he guaranteed to replace our order on our next visit. They took down my name and apologized for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"I'm now done with this location.  Service has gone to crap once again.  Employees don't care.  Filled out the survey on the receipt and this is what I had to say:

This location continues to have issues with the speed in which they complete the orders and how the restaurant is kept up and supplies are in stock.  Long line at entrance, long time to get food, salsa bar a mess, no small lids, no napkins, tables needed to be cleaned, bathroom smelled horrible, nobody that works there cares about their job, food or service.  I've filled out many of these surveys and nothing gets done.  This was the last chance.  I  most likely will never return to this location.

ATTN El Pollo Loco Corporate, don't bother contacting me again, and trying to entice me with free food to update my review.  The service still suck and I never used any of those coupons or gift certificates you sent me.  Fix the root problem and I'll fix my review."}
{"text":"Can't really give much fast food 5 stars, but this is a good clean place, food is tastey, staff is friendly. Costs more than something like Alberto's, but the quality is much much higher."}
{"text":"Went in 20 minutes before closing and they locked the doors and refused service. Waste of time!"}
{"text":"So gross, we got two of the double check bowls and a burrito .. I was biting into my food and hurt my tooth, was thinking ew must be a chicken bone, nope... It was extremely stale rice. Then starting looking in all of ours and all the rice was hard as a rock. So gross. We just moved to this neighborhood and I've never had a problem with an El Pollo Loco until this store. Called the manager who was nice about everything but never apologized... And they wanted the food were disgusted with back(fair enough) I will never eat at this location again. If their rice is stale and old who knows what's going on with the rest of the food"}
{"text":"Guess I've been coming to this location since they've opened and it's been the same consistent quality, good but not great. Today however the chicken seemed more fresh than normal. And hot and juicy. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Went through drive through the person couldn't hear me so I had to go to the window to make my order upon arriving home my order was completely wrong to the point my son burrito had avocado and he his allergic to it he had to throw up to avoid going to the hospital. We called to talk to the manager which he said he name was jerry he had us on hold for 30 minutes never came back on the phone. What service we will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"This place was terrible they messed up my order not once not  twice but three times how is that possible I asked for no cabbage in my double shrimp salad and they still put the cabbage in the salad, they forgot my wife Mac and cheese and then I realized I was missing my two chicken legs, everything was on the receipt I just don't understand. Plus the chicken tasted like it's been seating there for hours I always like Pollo Loco I love the chicken but after a visit today to this location gave me a second thoughts."}
{"text":"It's 10:10 pm, they close at 11....should I be upset that they only have a 3 piece? It's Halloween night and I have a car full of hungry little monsters."}
{"text":"This is our go-to drive-thru for yummy chicken salads (because we'd rather be golfing than cooking)!

Their cilantro dressing is delish, salads are always fresh, and service/food has always been very good for drive-thru fare!

It's the healthiest fast food option we've found, and the drive thru moves really fast even with a line."}
{"text":"We often eat at El Pollo Loco when we are at our home in Reno. I tired one here a little over a year ago and was very disappointed. 

Well As I was traveling west on Indian School I noticed this store and said to my self, why not. 

I ordered and received my order quickly, it was all done by a very pleasant young woman. 

Got home, opened the package and found I actually got what I ordered. 

Ate it. Liked it. So when in the mood I will trek back to this location for more yummy chicken. 

The place could use a bit of a scrubbin though. Oh well can't have everything, huh."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. Each and every time they messed up my order. Last night was the final straw, I will never go back. Every single item that I ordered was incorrect except for the side of guacamole. I spent $30 there and have an expectation of getting the things I actually ordered. The actual dishes were incorrect, they did not include salad dressings, salsa that they offered, or even plastic ware. When I called, the assistant manager kept offering to replace my food. I insisted on my money back. I'm heading there today to get my money back."}
{"text":"Do they have any lettuce that is green?  The ads all around the restaurant itself show green lettuce.  I got a bowl full of white and brown lettuce.  The burrito we ordered was soggy and contained everything but chicken - although we ordered a chicken burrito.  All the tables in the restaurant were dirty.  I really truly wish that the food looked as presentable as it does on all the commercials and the ads.  What you actually get is slop."}
{"text":"One and done for this location. I went on a Thursday night at 6:15 pm after a long day working  to order a family meal and was told they were out of chicken breasts, truly unbelievable. That is like calling Pizza Hut only to be informed they are out of Pizza. So I get all legs and thighs with rice, beans and flour tortillas. When I get home I discover that  they gave me corn tortillas even though my receipt say flour. The large side of rice was not even fully cooked  and was the worst Spanish rice I have ever tasted, definitely not what I have come to  expect from El Pollo Loco. This all adds up to poor management in my opinion. Stay away and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love the chicken here. It's a fast food place and not fine dinning for all the people that come here expecting a waiter and a server."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 4 times in the past few months. Every single time I've gone they have forgotten something so make sure you check your bags before you leave.  I went through the drive through for lunch today not only did they forget a salad but I ordered crunchy tacos and they were FROZEN when I bit into them.  Absolutely disgusting! I do not recommend this location at all!"}
{"text":"YUM! I was driving around looking for a good taco salad and ran into this place, I love the variety of their menu and how quick the service is! Having just moved here from Texas I was missing some of my local places, this definitely made up for it and made my list of favorites!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Location .rude employees to the consistency in there food to the dirty dinning area . 
Today I wanted to try their new FIRE GRILLED CHICKEN BURRITO \" What a huge disappointment that was I had the Farmers Market it was so stuffed with lettuce ( which was not one of the ingredients that was suppose to be in it, they didn't put avocado in it and that was a ingredient that was suppose to be in it , it was basically a lettuce, cabbage, carrots and some very gross dark meat chicken with some dripping sauce . The burrito did not stay together it was so over stuffed with lettuce that it  completely bursted open to the point where it was un edible with my hands and of course who asks for silver ware when you get a burrito  and this was a drive thru order on my lunch break eat in my car kind of lunch DUHHH what was i thinking... What a HUGE FAIL that was ... I am over you 
El Pollo Loco get your act together"}
{"text":"My burrito was cold. My wife's chicken was dry, tasted old. Salsa was old, not crisp. Sour cream tasted like it had turned. Even the roach on the floor agreed."}
{"text":"Usually love El Pollo Loco. Got a quesadilla from this location and opened the wrapping after leaving. The quesadilla was unwrapped and falling all over the place."}
{"text":"The chicken is amazing, in any form.  Avoid the tortas, they're horrible.  The beef is just so-so.  I deducted a star because the tortas are so bad, and I still regret eating it 3 weeks ago.  UGH!!  But seriously, get the damn chicken.  Oh, and any of the sides rock.  Solid, go-to place.  Salads rule too."}
{"text":"The staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and very friendly. The chicken is very juicy and well cooked. Me and my mom got 2 bowls. Mine was a black bean bowl with no pico and no cotjia cheese add jack cheese, and hers was a grande avocado bowl with no pico, no cabbage. The meal tasted amazing! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered myself an Ultimate Double Chicken Bowl using online ordering and pickup. When I got to work and opened my bowl I was very disappointed in the amount of chicken in the bowl. I thought the \"Double\" meant extra chicken, double the amount of a regular bowl. If it actually was double the chicken I would hate to see how much chicken the regular bowl has. This bowl is full of rice and beans and a few slices of avocado, hardly any chicken. This is definitely not worth the price I paid given the fact that I could have gone to Chipotle or Cafe Rio and got more chicken with higher quality ingredients. I gave it two stars since I thought the bowl tasted good; it just needed more protein."}
{"text":"I seriously hate coming to this location. There's better luck inside but never go through this drive thru. It's the worst service ever."}
{"text":"First and last time here, too many other good restaurants in this plaza with way better tasting food and that appreciate their customers. I am white. I ordered chicken quesadilla, classic chicken tacos, and a classic chicken burrito. While waiting for my order the individual making my order came around and asked the girl who took my order if he was supposed to use flour tortillas. Even tho I am standing right there, she just looks at me and nods yes instead of asking me. The manager started laughing, so she started laughing too, as if it were funny that she just assumed the \"gringo\" wants flour tortillas. Aside from that, the food was terrible, worst tacos (burnt flour tortilla) were awful, my husband said the burrito was bland, and the quesadilla was just ok. I wont be going back. I will give my business to places that dont make fun of their customer."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday and got ripped off bc there was 1/4 of my thighs missing..then I got charged more for an extra tortillas. Never going back..."}
{"text":"Twice now, I have eaten here inside of (2) months. I thought the first time was just a bad experience and chalked it up to \"sometimes bad things happen.\" But today, nothing different. Both times eating there, I got explosive diarrhea about 30 minutes after finishing my meal. And no, it's not something else I had earlier in the day. Too much of a coincidence for it to be anything other than people in the back are not washing their hands and the cooking utensils are not clean. Will not be back."}
{"text":"And yet another extremely disappointing experience. Honestly, if there is another decent grilled chicken spot around GO THERE!

I attribute our visits here to my son, if he didn't request to come here for the chicken, I wouldn't! And I'm pretty sure when he grows up and realizes how horrible the service and people are here he will cease to frequent this spot as well. 

We walk in and Sarah is at the register couting her money (we realized later she was starting her shift so she may have been verifying her starting cash til). We walk up to the register and after making complete eye contact with me turns her head and looks at the other employees busily trying to get orders together. We stand right in front of the registers (again Sarah is standing directly in front of me) and SILENCE. No hello, no someone will be right with you, nothing! About 4 minutes later someone comes from the drive thru area and takes our order. 

When picking up our order we asked for the cup since we had ordered a drink and again Sarah says nothing to me and just stares. So I show her my receipt and say \"see I got a drink, can I have the cup\". She gets a cup and hands it to me....all again with NO WORD spoken. No thank you, no have a good day, NOTHING! 
Seriously, I know its a fast food place so service is definitely not a priority but if you hate your job that much, get a new one! If my son can tell me \"she looks miserable mom\" then its clear as day that you don't want to be there and you are making others not want to be there either. 

Chicken is good that is all they got going for them."}
{"text":"Every time I come here at the end of the day, this place never has any chicken. Every single day. Which is why I stopped coming here. Why would I go here if you have no chicken? There is nothing else decent to get. 

I am giving this place an extra star because when they do have chicken, they are pretty good."}
{"text":"This place was super busy during lunch, but the food was decent and came out quick. I went with the tacos al carbon which are just chicken with onion and cilantro, a litle bland but oh well it was only 5 bucks for the combo. You could always load up your food with salsas from the condiment station they have. 

While we were eating, they shut down the dining area and locked up at about 1 pm and I'm not sure why which made it a little awkward when they locked all the doors and put signs up saying that only the drive thru was open. Meanwhile all of us are still sitting and eating inside with no explanation whatsoever..."}
{"text":"Downloaded the app says I get a free taco, lady at drive thru said it didn't work for anything even though my app coupon says it's good until 10/25/17 ... lady is a dumbass wasted a perfectly good coupon ... And why advertise if you're not gonna hold true"}
{"text":"Male cashier had bad attitude... All I needed was small lids :( 
Also, burritos seem to be made a bit smaller than other locations."}
{"text":"OK so I have been trying to stick to this whole New Years resolution thing which is not easy. But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.

I guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito. 

Now I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund. Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good.

Never again"}
{"text":"Before I explain why I am putting 2 stars, I want to say the service here great. The staff is normally friendly and usually (for the most part) they get my order right. 

This time, the woman at the window, was not very friendly. I asked her for creamy cilantro, she gave me guacamole instead, she asked if I wanted flour or corn tortilla, I asked for tortilla chips and she didn't include it in my bag. I didn't go back to correct my order, because I did not want to get back to work late from my lunch break. Let's just say I expected better service."}
{"text":"I'm so happy after discovering El Pollo Loco a few months prior. It's always a good thing to have a fast food chain that sells only chicken with rice instead of the usual burgers with fries. Also, the grilled chicken is so much better than the usual fried chicken so it's always a good last minute option."}
{"text":"Call Brittany Spears, because I did it again. I went to the chain chicken joint and guess what, they don't make very good chicken. I justified it with the \"on the way home\" rationale backed up by the \"they aren't a major chain\" basis. Yeah, they may not be McDonald's but they sure suck like McDonald's. 

It really isn't too hard to make chicken and I almost dare say hard to screw it up. El Pollo Loco likes to beat those odds apparently. Think thin chicken breasts a little overcooked with loose skin. I guess it beats the alternative of under cooked chicken which would result in an awesome vacation to my lavatory. El Pollo Loco has some pretty good spices to work with and even better equipment by the looks of it. When you walk in you are instantly welcomed by some pretty sweet aromas. Presumably that is where they get you around the outside, the smells. Give your order and take it seat, though. It's going to be a bumpy ride.

The restaurant was fairly empty so I don't know why it took so long to get our food. Blame it on the drive through I suppose. Again, the smells are nice when they arrive but the chicken just falls apart after that. In some cases, this is literal. Rubbery skin, mushy chicken, and the flavors just kind of slop around in that mess. The biscuits are dry and pretty flavorless making the highlight a well mixed fountain drink. Yeah, it was pretty bleak.

Never again I say. I drive past this location very often since it is in my vicinity but I don't even look at it anymore. I feel like it is mocking me because it led me astray. It was the temptation that reminded me of why don't do the chain thing if at all possible. I would have rather been disappointed by Chick-fil-A. At least then I would have had some good chicken out of the deal."}
{"text":"2 stars 2 words. Cold food!
Yuck that's a HUGE turn off. It was old and dry chicken also."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. I arrived very hungry, the store was very clean.  Brandy took my order and was very friendly and thorough. The food was excellent.  I ordered a 3 pc. Combo (all breasts) and the price was good. I'm super happy and super full."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!!!  IS ZERO STARS AN OPTION??! Zero Customer Service!! The orders are always wrong!!!! Missing sides! Missing tortillas! Come on ... I went there and waited in the line, by the time I got home, I realized I didn't even have tortillas or the sauces. I can't do their job every single time!! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! I get chicken breast and make my own chicken tacos. You can't have tacos without the tortilla ...... it's not a hard job sadly to say. So I don't understand why it's soooooooo difficult to get the order right!!!!!! With Chipotle right next door (literally) how can you have room for error???? How is this location going to get more customers or keep up with the competitor if they can't even get your order right??????  COME ON!!!! Get it together... Where is the management here? These people need hospitality training and they evidently need reading lessons as well. Almost every meal comes with tortillas...... How do you forget them EVERY TIME..... I hope this location gets it together. SERIOUSLY. THIS IS OBNOXIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the location in Henderson and wanted my BF to try it since he loves chicken. Tried this location twice and each time I had small bones in my wrap and Bowl. I understand they're using real chickens but twice? Maybe it's my luck, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the drive thru. I was the only car there at about 4:30 on a Saturday and only ordered a side of mac and cheese and a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. That's it. That was my order. Waited like 9 minutes for them to give me 2 side dishes that had already been prepared.  Smh. Not going back. I'll go to KFC"}
{"text":"el pollo loco has really good chicken for the price and quality. my dad had some 12 pieces of chicken for 12 bucks and got some kind of chicken pocket pita with avocado and other stuff. really good value.

the chicken isnt all salty and greasy. baked with a seasoning marinade. considering they have to cook it for a while it was still juicy. their spicy guacamole sauce is really good. i didnt like their pico.

after i finish eating im pretty grubby and have food all over my hands a face and scream \"VIVA EL CHUPACABRA!\""}
{"text":"The first time I have ever been to this restaurant was wonderful. The customer service was great! He explained everything and was very patient when I was ordering. The avocado burrito was amazing. It was full of flavor with what seemed to be very fresh ingredients. It was also a reasonable price for what I got."}
{"text":"Shoot out to Cameron. He was very helpful and respectful to us. We should have more employees like him. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Asked for a bowl with nothing but rice beans and chicken they handed me one with everything I said I didn't want anything and they took it back and scooped out the veggies but the taste was still there and small chucks of it..."}
{"text":"Best el pollo loco I've been to in Vegas ! Food was hot fresh salsa bar very clean fully stalked and fresh good tasting salsa ! Only downside was food took forever to order and receive bcuz they only had 1 cashier with a line of 6+ customers no bueno !"}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service and my order was completely wrong, first the lady in the drive thru was rude and had terrible etiquette. Second they were out of chicken breast and said it'll be 20 minutes before it's ready, how does el pollo loco not have chicken breast ready??? Third once we get to the window the drive thru worker didn't say a word to me, she acted as if I was inconveniencing her. I had to ask for my receipt! Fourth I finally get home and realize my order is wrong! I don't understand how you can completely mess up every aspect of the customers experience at your restaurant. I know it's only a fast food restaurant but service standards still need to be met."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this new storefront! Sunday night at 6:08 and the place looks like a pog pen. Floors a mess, salsa bar messy and missing items. Took forever to receive order. Will not return, shameful!"}
{"text":"My sister loves to eat here, so I pickup food for her all the time. Once when the wait was extremely long, they gave me my order for free. The staff is all very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, they were generous enough to let us stay and eat after closing time and that was greatly appreciated, my family and I love the food and they are always smiling."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco - fast food that's a step above normal fast food.

Tasty flame grilled chicken, tortillas, two sides (rice and beans for me), a salsa bar...great place to grab a fast, but enjoyable, lunch!"}
{"text":"JoAnna working the drive thru extremely rude all she would say when I'm ordering is \"is that all\" how about you shut up so I can give you my 33.00 order then I pull up to the window and the rudeness just keeps coming can't get salsa can't even get her attention to get salsa the manager gave it to us would not come back here again"}
{"text":"Food is great, when they have the products. Usually are out of avocado and cilantro sauce. Worst of all they close early. Usually about 30 minutes before their posted hours say they close. No one greats you when you drive up to the window. Last few times I had to wait a few minutes while the window girl finished her cell phone convo. They constantly want to charge you full price even when they don't have all the ingredients."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Food is cold and the service is horrible, no wonder is always empty! Had to go twice after they gave me the wrong order!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is really good and fresh, no issue there. The problem was with the service. The general manager was taking my order this afternoon and due to the place being super noisy with cooking and fan noises, he became very agitated/frustrated with my order (I thought he was saying \"what\" when he was saying \"which one\"). The manager started yelling at me to \"PICK A SALAD!! THERE ARE LOTS OF SALADS!!!!\"  and made a scene complete with waiving arms and yelling. The behavior was so uncalled for. Lots of good lunch places nearby that don't yell at their patrons so bye bye Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food here but please STOP PUTTING MY SALAD IN A BAG OF HOT FOOD. I love the chicken, black beans and green salsa."}
{"text":"So apparently this place can't void out item's (??) I ordered a large soup, then right after, changed my mind to go small soup. The guy at the window says, we can't do voids. 
I was confused, I just put my order in. So i asked for a manager, I was just confused as to why no voids were allowed. He exclaimed that corporate doesn't allow voids. So I then asked, then how do you void it out if someone says never mind I don't want it. He says that he'd have to call and ask his manager to void it out. That's just super weird and irritating to me. So, while I'm speaking to him about my concerns he asks me to move up so that the other folks can get their food..... How RUDE! Im still a customer with concerns, deal with me first, of be polite about it sheesh! 

Definitely calling corporate on this, because its STUPID

UPDATE: called to ask for corporates #, I was put on hold for 6 mins, the associate came back on the line and said to look on the receipt for corporates number. Smh"}
{"text":"I've been to this El Pollo Loco a couple of times and ordered the family 8-piece meal for dinner and on both occasions, I've been happy. The food is good, the tortillas are fresh, and the drive thru is always quick. 

For me, I found the service to be good. Not incredible, but definitely not bad or anything like that. The location is pretty good and when I tend to go, it is later in the evening. At that time, there is usually not any line or long wait in the drive thru. 

I can't speak to other reviews here, but overall I have been happy with the food at this location and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Back in Florida, we had a place called Pollo Tropical, which I was always fond of because of the grilled chicken flavor with plentiful servings of rice and black beans.  After catching a spring training game up the road, we decided to check this place out. This place is similar to PT with a western flair.Avocados are sufficiently present and they use red beans instead of black beans. The food was really quite good. I got a chicken avocado bowl with rice, beans, salsa, and cilantro. I like the sauce bar they have, where I was able to get some spicy salsa and an avocado creation that was a little too different for me. The food gets a 4.5 star rating, but the place was completely trashed and dirty. There were about four or five tables occupied by people, and these were the only clean tables in the whole place. All the other tables had soda and rice and salsa and straw wrappers and all other kinds of detritus strewn about. Needless to say, it didn't look or feel very sanitary in here. A clean restaurant would earn this place 4 stars, but being it looked like a bunch of 6 year olds were turnt up and let go for an hour, 2 stars is more than generous."}
{"text":"Can someone please help El Pollo Loco!!! 

Do you intentionally leave food that I have paid for out of my bag?! I am beginning to think that it is on purpose! Every single time and I still return?!? Apparently, I should be double checking my bag before I leave... Well I would, if you wouldn't tie it in a knot;( I think that I like to help their profit margin and starve at least one of my kids every time:("}
{"text":"Friendly staff took my pre-opening order quickly. Even though they are new to fast casual. I liked their enthusiasm. They suggested I order a side of churros, yes please!

My double chicken tostada arrived quickly, with chopped chicken from the grill, slices of avocado, lettuce, mild salsa, sour cream, hot beans and rice. The tostada was flaky and good for breaking off to use like chips.

I received a free $10 voucher for a meal by signing up to be a part of their pre-opening practice event, which was open to the public."}
{"text":"Nice to (finally) have an El Pollo Loco close to home!

As El Pollo's go, this one is above average!  The beans are good (my go/no-go determining factor for an El Pollo location).  

Quick, tasty, affordable...what's not to love?"}
{"text":"In the 19 years since we moved away from California, this is the first time there's been an El Pollo Loco that's conveniently close to home...glad to have you in the neighborhood!

What I remember from those days of yore was, you rate an El Pollo Loco on their beans...if the beans are good, the El Pollo Loco location is going to be good.

Great news!  The beans are really good here - not dry, good taste...everything was just as it was supposed to be.  

Once again, thanks for opening in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"I spoke to  the manager today to inform him that this location is doing better.  I had the family meal with  $10 coupon at lunch.  The chicken breast was much larger,  was moist and tender and had the flavors that I have grown to love.  The churro was crispy on the outside and soft in the center.  Now I will start coming back.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Tonight I was accidentally the A-hole that showed up 2 minutes before they closed in the drive through. I didn't realize they closed at 11. Nancy C took my order and they were understandably out of several items on the menu but she was so sweet, polite and kind that I didn't even care. She talked to me in the window the entire time my burrito was being made and delivered the most personable drive through interaction I've ever received. I didn't ask but they discounted my order for the inconvenience, wow!!! Thanks Nancy and closing manager for being so kind! I'll be back soon (and y'all better have some chicken)! Lol 

Update:
I was lucky enough to get Nancy AGAIN in the drive through last week and she was just as nice and kind as the 1st time! Someone needs to give her a raise/promotion ASAP!!! Thanks Nancy!!!!"}
{"text":"My local Pollo Loco is always clean and cheerful. The staff are knowledgeable and even though they have to offer you desert with every order the food is great. Their tortilla soup is chock full of veggies and bite sized chicken pieces. If you join their email address they send coupons for new items  before the geneeal public gets to try and a free meal for your birthday. Fountain drinks are a plenty and the horchata isnt too sweet. Lastly the salsa var is well stocked with to go cups and lids."}
{"text":"We have come here a few times now.  We find that for the price it is better than KFC across the lot.  The service was good, as it usually is.  We came in the early afternoon so there was not a busy rush going on.  The dinning room was messy.  The dinning room is almost always messy.  Garbages can use changing and several tables needed to be wiped off.  It seems that the chicken was kind of dry also.  At least the chicken breast I had was.  My wife said the leg and thigh she had was very tasty.  The rice, beans, and mashed taters we good.  This was one of the times that the salsa bar looked half decent as well.   Usually it is disoriented.  The avocado salsa is good stuff.  To stop here for a better food option of real grilled chicken opposed to deep fried chicken."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait any longer, and had to go In and try the New Item on the Menu, called BARBACOA, and was very disappointed, as I expected at least some beef of some sort, and NOT  just stuffed with ALL Rice, and Beans. If I wanted All Rice, and beans, then that's what I would have ordered a side of rice, and beans. I hope that it was not just a mistake, or just being stingy?, of not putting a decent amount of beef as advertised as shown? Polo Loco, you better take this promo Barbocoa burrito off the Menu, if You intend to just stuff it up with just the rice, and beans.  Not a Good Idea.  Will Not order this again."}
{"text":"We have been here before without incident but tonight we went in for the family meal and had an Entertainment coupon AND a one week expired coupon.  THEY WOULDN'T TAKE EITHER ONE!  Manager was rude and wouldn't even talk loud enough for us to hear him simply say \"too late\" to the expired coupon.  Who knows why they wouldn't take the Entertainment coupon!  What a jerk.  We walked out."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru. Ordered white meat combo, oh wait, their out of white meat??? I waited in line for that??? How does El Pollo Loco run out of chicken??? Had to wait again just to get out of the drive thru line. I'd give zero stars for it it I could."}
{"text":"been to a few el pollo loco location  by far this was the worst place I ever been. bad experience from supervisor , customer service does not apply to this location, tried to request a different chicken due chicken was dry & burnt . supervisor said  that is new it just came from this side of the grill. she said that that is not dry .  got home food was dry n burnt. this is the last time will be going to this place, rather drive farther to get a better service & better treatment as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I rec'd a Groupon type coupon from our daughter to come to the opening of this El Pollo Loco's restaurant near ASU.  It was a ten dollars off, so I schlepp over from the 101 last evening, and I am very happy I did. 

I've been a fan of the Crazy Chicken for a long time, but their store locations have always baffled me.  But here's one that's in a high trafficked retail area.  Finally. 

I was told by one of the managers that this was the first of many new corporate owned stores here in the Valley. Last year El Pollo went public, so they must be using some of that new investor money to open some highly visible stores. Hear that Chandler?  There's one coming our way to replace the now shuttered one near Chandler Fashion Mall I was told. 

I ordered a take-out of two Chicken Chipotle Burritos for $5.69 each, one Chicken Avocado Burrito for $5.89 and something they call a Stuffed Chicken Quesadilla for $5.89. All were very good, bordering on excellent. Even without a $10 Off Coupon, that's still a good deal. 

Here everything was spiffy and they must of had at least six well groomed corporate type mangers making everything go smoothly behind the counter. It's interior and open flame grilled taste is a welcome change from that former McDonald concept, with the industrial designed Interiors.

But what was really incredible to me was that 8' by 4' chicken grill (photo), where they were cooking almost 30 butterflied chickens. Wow. How I love that BBQ grill taste. Last night the food looked and tasted as good as the menu photos. Nice.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I realty love el Pollo Loco!

Their restaurants are always clean and up to date. The food is fresh and you can watch the chickens cook on the grill. What can be better?  Oh, price you say?  Well that's pretty good too. If I were Boston Market, I would buy them up, so to put them out of business!  

My first crazy chicken was nearly ten years ago in Burbank, CA of all places. It was late in the day and I was starving from a long drive down from Sacramento. 

The food was as good then as it is now. They're are some new menu items. The introduction of family sized portions, but in essence El Pollo Loco hasn't changed. 

On my most recent visit, I had their Loco Salad for only $1.89, which comes in a deep bowl. I also added a BRC burrito for $1.69 and a cup of pinto beans for $1.89. A good deal and a filling lunch for $5.47 plus tax.. Delicious. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order because I did not have much time for lunch today. I arrived 6 minutes after my food was supposed to be ready and it was not ready yet. There was only one other person in the ordering area who was already waiting for food when I walked in. I waited an additional 8 minutes before my food was ready. This now puts it at 14 minutes after it was supposed to have been ready. As other reviewers mentioned there were lots of people in the kitchen area but nobody was really doing anything. When the girl told me that my food was not ready I expected her to give me my drink cup so that I could get my drink while I was waiting. Instead, she just walked away. 

Once my food was ready I had to ask for my cup. I arrived back at work to find no utensils in my bag.

I ordered a chicken bowl combo. I have previously only had pieces of chicken and tortillas for any El Pollo Loco. I would say that the bowl was just ok. The portion was smaller than I would have expected and the side of chips was 4 chips.

I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Today I tried the bean, rice and cheese burrito . It is good , not dry and its a good size considering its like 1.69 in price. Taco al carbon was delicious and the green and tomatoes sauce were fresh."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. I was in a hurry to get to work, went through the drive thru and saw they forgot my fork for the black bean bowl I ordered. Got out of my car to walk in because there was line in the drive thru. They locked the door as I was walking up and the girl wouldn't open it to hand me a fork. They were also laughing at another customer who was angry they messed up her whole order as well."}
{"text":"ok have eaten at el polo loco for at least 30 years. Prior to eating at this new scottsdale store i ate at the one on Bell and 7th street. that had been several years ago because i got food poisoning from there. so after throwing up bad chicken you tend not to want to eat there again. so fast forward several years. new one built in Scottsdale. So i thought why not... greasy and old chicken, i couldent believe it ... new store and greasy and old.  Well im done.... very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent here.  Love the seasoning on the Wings Meal.  Try the Chicken & Shrimp Tostada, the shrimp is grilled nicely and still juicy."}
{"text":"Their drive-thru is designed to be negotiated by compact cars only, and the speaker at the ordering menu makes the order-taker unintelligible. That's what you can expect EVERY visit. Additionally, they are regularly out of what they claim to be selling; this last time (Friday) it was tostada shells as well as all chicken except for wings and thighs. Seriously? My wife and I patiently waited in teh inescapable drive-thru until we were able to leave for a nearby Cane's.

I know declining level of service is rampant throughout the fast-food kingdom, but this place seems to be trying for some sort of Lack Of Service award. They regularly screw up orders; for a while they were selling ultimate double shrimp tostadas, but you were just as likely to get chicken on it as shrimp. Eventually, they stopped selling the shrimp version, I assume because the preparation of same was too taxing on their skills and intelligence."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is fantastic! Great customer service. My order is always perfect. The chicken is hormone free and tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Entered the drive through line at about 6 pm. I noticed the guy ahead of me giving a \"thumbs down\" sign out his window as he was ordering. When I ordered, I was advised that they had no white meat. Really? Now, I am stuck in this line and ended up getting legs and thighs. What kind of management lets this happen?"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've tasted for the pice, has a restaurant feel, the smell of fresh chicken cooking, nothing seems to be processed, burritos are fat  and in good portions. I really enjoyed eating there"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing. The double chicken bowl and it's usually pretty good but who ever was making the food today did not do a good job. The bowl usually has rice and half an avocado. I got only one sliver of avocado and all beans so my bowl was soggy and soupy. So disappointed with my food today."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Yummy chicken. The house dressing for the salads is awesome.  The drive through can be a little slow in the evening."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time ever in December 2016. The building was very nice and it was clean inside and out. There was no 1 in line and only 2 groups eating when we walked in. This made me a little nervous. The cashier didn't know what kind of meat was in the new beef burrito. Decided to get it anyway. Husband also got a burrito and a taco. The salsa bar was nice. Had at least 4 types. Plus lemons and jalapeños. We took the food to go. We both were happy with our food and the salsa.  The food looked and tasted good. We would be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco, but this is the first one Ive ever been unhappy with. I went in pretty early in the day. I'm not sure if the chicken wasn't prepared like normal... or if it was yesterday's. The skin was so tough, when normally that's what makes it so delicious. 

The reason it's getting one star though, is because this store obviously has a sewer problem. Walking up to the store it smelled great. Inside was another story. At first I thought it must just be because they had the bathroom doors open for cleaning. But eating in the dining area it was still an overwhelming smell. It was stronger by the soda machine, where only water and soda is going in the drain. So definitely do not eat in!!!! It really ruined the food. But I wouldn't return for drive through either, since they're trademark chicken was a let down. 
There's always a silver lining, so I will say that the staff was nice, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I got 6 free meal coupons sent to me online. This is my 2nd free event I've attended and the staff was really great. Super friendly and the place was really clean. Definitely nice seeing one outlet in Avondale. I will definitely be going back and I thank el pollo loco for allowing me and my family to get some good meals to try out."}
{"text":"Horrible service hot as hell inside and everything was dirty. There was plenty of staff on hand so I don't understand why the tables were dirty and the salsa bar was empty people were literally scraping the salsa out of the bowls. I also had to take my tortillas back twice they kept calling apart I know they throw them in the microwave, but damn leave them in there a little longer. Needless to say my husband and I will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I LIKE IT!!! 
If you order your food there, they even give you a little number and they bring your food out to you. Not bad for a fast food joint! 
They have healthy options too without outrageous calories. Always a plus. Nom nom! I particularily LOVE the little salsa bar they have inside with several different salsa's and spicy peppers! Nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"When I got my burrito, I took a bit and the chicken was chewy. I opened it up only to find it had been undercooked.the. I pulled out a giant piece of fat, which made up most of the burrito. Never had a bad experience at any EPL location until I visited this location. I am now convince I have salmonella. Please avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but I enjoy their quick and nice service. I wish they were open even later because I seem to crave their food 10-12 at night lol. I love their horchata and they have vitamin water blueberry pomegranate flavor in their fountains now! Drive thru experiences are always fast and friendly, they haven't messed up on my order yet so that's definitely good that they're consistent!"}
{"text":"Have only had the chicken here but the chicken was excellent.  It was juicy;and the herbs and spices made it very flavorful.  Good value for the money;fave is the family bucket.  Sides were also good. Service was fast and have not had problems when we have ordered;my husband and I love this chicken."}
{"text":"Been there several times. Customer service is consistently bad. Not friendly; slow at making food."}
{"text":"6pm drive through, and they were out of chicken breasts.... how can an empty chicken restaurant be out of chicken breasts at dinner time?"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Ranchero burrito and the first 2 bites I took each had a chicken bone in it. They were both at least 1 inch long pieces of chicken bone. How? And the burrito has cabbage in it so I thought it was a piece of stale cabbage that would not crunch. Nasty!"}
{"text":"Waited in a ridiculously slow line to buy a gift card and was told that they were waiting on their gift card shipment.  Stopped in a week later and despite signage all over the cash register about buying gift cards for the holidays, the guy behind the counter told me they have no gift cards and won't be getting any."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST location I've ever had in my life!!

All of the OC locations couldn't come close to this one! I've been here 2x and both times the food is just so freaking fresh and delicious! You won't get dry chicken here compared to other locations cough cough..

I can't get over how amazing the chicken is here! The sides are tasty, my BRC is yummy even though over the years it's been shrunken down to nothing, shame on you corporate for charging almost $2.00 for something so little :/ 

I have no complaints with this location, my food is great and comes out in a timely manner! It's dangerous to be so close to my house! LOL!

^__^"}
{"text":"We enjoy the food here but it seems like they might have a lot of employee turnover. If you ask what's in an entree they usually have to ask someone. Tables are often dirty, tea is out etc. We would probably eat here more often if the employees seemed trained and it was consistently clean."}
{"text":"Experience horrible food was cold ordered the 2 piece combo with black beans and Spanish rice both cold black beans over salted and cold and let's not forgot the Spanish rice disgusting and cold couldn't eat either of the sides the two piece leg and thigh burnt and over cooked the meal was a disappointment. The service was also horrible the women at the counter shouldn't work at a food service place her attitude was horrible mentioned to her that the diet coke was flat and only clear carbonation was coming out she precedes to tell me that I was wrong clearly this location needs extra training on food preparation and customer service. Will not be returning to this location complete disappointment ."}
{"text":"I could eat their soft tacos for days! The down side is that their hot sauce packets are confusing for a stoner! Their colors are opposite from taco bell. Be careful not to grab the hottest one!"}
{"text":"I always get horrible service whenever I come to this location. I've already left reviews on your website and no one ever contacts me back to get further information or to even apologize. Today I went through the drive-thru and Cassandra took my order. She was very rude and disrespectful. I don't understand how people can be so rude to their customers. Even the manager is rude. This location really needs to brush up on their customer service skills. I will continue to leave bad reviews as long as I get poor service from this location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to do something different than the usual. We had passed by El Pollo Loco many times and had agreed we'd try it, but that kept getting put off. 

That finally just changed, and now I wish we hadn't waited so long. Seriously, we are the perfect combination of full and satisfied at this very moment. 

We took a look at the menu and weren't sure of how much to order. Eventually, we based it on cost, assuming that around $15 worth of food would be enough (it ended up being almost $18). What can I say, we're both good eaters. 

She ordered the chicken avocado quesadilla and a side of mashed potatoes - yes it's a strange combo but she loves mashed potatoes so why not. I opted for the chicken avocado burrito and a crunchy taco. The understanding was, of course, we'd try a bite of each other's food.

The quesadilla and burrito were both stuffed full of tasty goodness. She's not big on beans but admitted she actually liked the burrito. I don't think I've ever tasted a quesadilla that had such an explosion of flavor, at least not in the fast food world. The quality of the ingredients was far superior to what I expected. That goes for the whole meal as a matter of fact. We've both eaten enough fast food in our lives to know better so I feel confident in saying that. The crunchy taco was a huge hit as well. It reminded me of the kind of taco I'd get at a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Even the mashed potatoes rivaled KFC so no complaints here!

The service was fine. They confirmed the order before and after we got our food. I'd say we waited no more than 2 minutes in the drive thru to get it.

I wouldn't hesitate to go back, and again, wish I'd tried it sooner. It's tough to put your finger on how good a place like this is going to be when you don't know how big the portions are and they have a variety of sides to choose from. I can't wait to try a different combination next time!"}
{"text":"Unreal. Terrible service. I'm standing here and am being completely ignored. Bye bye never again"}
{"text":"I love el pollo loco but it makes my husband really sick almost every time we go so we probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Not to mention my first time coming to this location. Waited in the drive thru for nearly 20mins AND while ordering food I was rushed through my whole order. Received a free drink which was nice BUT when I opened my chicken burrito everything was in it EXCEPT the chicken. Where they do that at?!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and line was wrapped around & to the door. Waited a very long time since there was only one cashier. Manager stood around talking rather than jumping in to take some orders. Many people had orders that were incorrect. I ordered the 8 piece family meal & the pieces were very, very small. Did not get much meat off of them. I know they are new but with so many places to eat in Scottsdale people will move on quickly. I won't be returning. Food was nothing special."}
{"text":"Love there food yummy and satisfying. Clean restaurant and friendly service. A young man by the name of Jose helped me and was very polite. I will be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Great friendly place. Great food. A must go to place. Food is made fresh to order and a special request are OK. The manager is very helpful and so is all the other people that work there. You are welcomed with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a chicken avocado burrito combo from El Pollo Loco at $7.39. The burrito a la cart was $5.89. With the combo they advertise chips and a drink. I was shocked when I got home and found my chip bag had 3 full chips and one less then half broken chip. 3 1/2 chips???? Really? I basically just bought a drink in that combo. The burrito tasted great but feel cheated. No one in their right mind would accept 3 1/2 chips and call it reasonable. Feel like I was swindled."}
{"text":"I love when a restaurant accepts they have made a mistake and does what's right to fix the issue. Not many managers no how to do that now n days. Thanks chance i will keep coming 3 times a week"}
{"text":"After recieving some coupons in the mail = .99 Fish Taco's, my interest was peeked & I decided to make it my destination on my walk. I got there at lunch time and there was a line halfway into the seating area but it wasnt a long wait to order, maybe 5 min.

I had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.

This is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!

The Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was \"OK\" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.

I'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad. But for value's sake, I could have paid another dollar & gone to lunch at Buffet @ Asia (see previous review here) & had more of a choice of dishes & all you can eat.

Way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco thats for sure!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, every time I go they forget something. I'm just over this particular spot. Thanks for your service I hope others don't get screwed like me on a 25 dollar order"}
{"text":"Always out of chicken. Staff in a hurry and throws your food around. They act like you are bothering them."}
{"text":"A trifecta of goodness - service, food, and value.  I stopped in to pick up lunch for a working Saturday at the office.  The value family meals are just that.  Plenty of everything and very flavorful.  Also, it is very clean inside the restaurant and the salsa bar was well stocked and tidy as well."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. They need to train their staff to quality check food and make sure orders are right. They need to read orders back completely. They do it half ass. The last 3 times I have gone, they have forgotten the dressing to my salad. This last time I checked my order and they still forgot. When I asked for my dressing the guy looked like I inconvenienced him! They need better service and consistency if they wanna stay open."}
{"text":"2nd time at an El Pollo loco, 2nd time I got sick. (Different locations, too)

DON'T go here."}
{"text":"How does El Pollo Loco run out of POLLO??! Seriously, someone needs to talk to the Manager or whomever is responsible for placing orders. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Happy and friendly employees and great food.  The best chicken anywhere."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! While we were ordering my husband grabbed a high chair, it was dirty like very gross. So he asked the girl that was taking our order if it could be wiped out. Her response was \" can't you get another one \" I told her that there was not another one. She just stood there and said \" i don't know \" my husband then said can't you get some cleaner and spray it and wipe it at this time a gentlemen named Andrew walked up and said let me clean that for you sir! Thank you Andrew
 Then our food came, the shrimp I got was cold! My tortillas were wrong , and my chicken wing was gross! I went up and just asked for the right tortillas and the girl said I\" um ok we are out, I have to microwave you some I will bring them to you\" so I went and sat down. 5 mins later no tortillas so I went up and asked for the manager, a lady named Jodi came out and I started to explain. She tried to justify her employee handed me tortillas and walked  away! As we left Jodi yelled across the store \" have a good night\"
So rude and what a horrible experience !"}
{"text":"It's a shame how this location gives pollo loco a bad name, managers are rude, and can't train there employees customer service skills, couple times I've gave in to eat at this location, trash cans are over filling salsa bar is sloppy and not attended, they give u the oldest dry chicken they been turning over and over, and when u tell them u want a fresh juicy chicken the give u attitude, um excuse me I'm the customer paying to buy my meal it should be to my expectations, if it's not for customers they wouldn't have jobs apparently they don't see it that way, nobody comes out and sweeps, restrooms are nasty, the GM OR MAIN MANAGER NEEDS TO PUT SOME SERIOUS ATTENTION AT THIS LOCATION, hire more friendly people and please care about the customer. Keep restaurant clean at all times"}
{"text":"Quite pleasantly surprised I must say. Of course keep in mind this is a fast food joint so you have to take that into consideration. That being said I was glad to receive a decent meal from a good fast food unique Mexican place. 
Definitely will be back from time to time not to mention the service was friendlier than usual."}
{"text":"I love their under 500 calorie offerings. I have had the burrito and the bowl (the one with broccoli) on several occasions. I will try the quesadilla 

I came last week for the black bean/broccoli bowl and they failed to mention that they were out of broccoli and threw corn in instead...I was not happy!

I came back tonight and they tried to pull the exact same thing, so I ordered something else. The girl says they have been out of broccoli for \"quite a while.\" Really? Did the manager think of going to the store to get some while they wait for their usual shipment!"}
{"text":"The food was good. But when I order my meal through the Drive Thru?they always forget to give me either the dressings or even the Tortilla! Last week?they even forget to give me the knife and fork??I went to this store about 10 times?only 2 times I got everythings that I actually ordered?"}
{"text":"The food here taste like trash. I bought a 8 piece with a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was disgusting and looked weird. Tried to correct the order and the shady manager literally gave me the same chicken and added a few pieces. Super trash."}
{"text":"People working here extremely nice. Place was clean. 
Couldn't find the sides. They were on the counter. 
We ordered 4 piece chicken dinner to split. Found the chicken to be very dry. Corn and Mac for sides. Both were bland. Tortillas didn't have any pizazz to them. Not a place we'll be going back to."}
{"text":"Horrible drive through. Been here twice and without fail they always forget something. First time a burrito that was a entree for us and this time tortillas for our dinner meal. This place needs better management maybe that's why it's always empty. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I purchased the shrimp bowl which only had 8 small shrimps the size of a quarter cost of the bowl was 8$. This restaurant is more concerned with profit and ripping people off with cheap ingredients I was disappointed and absolutely recommend NOT going I rather pay the extra dollar to go to a real Mexican restaurant. The price is not cheap for what you get but il tell you what the only thing cheap is the quality of the Food."}
{"text":"the food is generally pretty good but they're not very patient and i always feel rushed at the drive through. i always feel like i have to check my order to make sure i got what i paid for and half the time i'm missing something."}
{"text":"I have frequented this EPL quite a bit and for the most part have had good service. I know it varies between good and bleh but that seems to be the usual for this location. I know the usual things that are a nuisance are a messy dining area and the salsa bar either being bare or gnarly. However seeing the multiple poor reviews makes me second guess coming here. Hope things turn around"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience at El Pollo Loco. Went in to try their Barbacoa meat because it was a new release around 1230/1PM and also because I got some coupons in the mail. I understand this is the lunch hour but the people there especially a girl named Ruth was extremely rude to me. At the same time she was taking my order she was taking orders through the drive though which mean that she was having 2 conversations at once and wasnt focusing on my order, she also barely made eye contact with me. When I went in to get my lunch, the coupon was for a $6 chicken bowl which is not really a deal because the item actually cost $6.79 full price. What a savings El Pollo Loco! you got me. Cause most people I know dont look at the regular price and just present their coupon. 
With such amazing saving of $0.79, I decided I wanted to get a Barbacoa bowl. Which I was then given a hard time about because according to Ruth, They dont have a way to ring that up. I kept asking her even if I was wanting to pay extra for the substitution (and ring up a chicken bowl and add barbacoa) She still said that I was unable to get that combination of Barbacoa in a bowl. I stood there in disbelief and was forced to order a barbacoa burrito. About a couple minutes after I ordered my burrito, I realized I had a coupon for a free chicken soup. I then asked Ruth if I could use this coupon to which she said no. And then she got another coworker who also said I couldnt use it even though I just ordered the burrito less than 2 min before than. Then the manager- an older male- didnt get his name- re-explained to me that it was impossible for them to ring up a barbacoa bowl because the system didnt allow it. I mean I dont even work there but I have worked in a restaurant before- all they had to do was put in an order for a chicken bowl and add barbacoa! I was even willing to pay for it!!!
The customer service here was horrible!!! RUTH made my expereience here very unpleasant and didnt even make me feel like a person. Whats up with the no eye contact? Whats up with the taking an order of another person while taking my order. Its like she wasnt even listening to me. 
I have read other concerns of this restaurant and the managment worries me. The main manager was great but it shouldnt have esclated to that point where I had to talk to 3 people. I didnt even get the order that I wanted. The main manager- old male- did end up giving me a chicken soup for free to make up for the horrible customer service but the soup was sooooo salty that i didnt even eat it. 
He even offered me a free churro but i dont like sweets. 
After giving me all this free food- they ended up losing money and giving me a bad customer experience instead of just making me a barbacoa bowl like I orginally wanted. 
Sadly wouldnt suggest coming here and if u have a bad customer expereince, I wouldnt be surprised which is sad because the location is really good.
PS: chicken soup was horrible. Super bland with heavy heavy taste of salt. Didn't even taste like chicken and had def cornstarch thickener. Do NoT recommend"}
{"text":"I don't what happen I used love el pollo loco but something's changed. I ordered the chipotle chicken burrito and all I can say it looked good but was pretty tasteless and then I got chips with it and omg they had to have been 6 days old because how rubbery they where. Needless to say This farewell im not going to el pollo loco anymore."}
{"text":"Thanks for trying to kill me. Ordered my burrito with NO CHEESE, because I'm ALLERGIC & also a vegan. It came labelled \"no cheese\", but halfway through eating, realized there was a layer of cheese that melted.

Had a stomachache all day, thanks for making me scared to eat out. A+"}
{"text":"the people here are great, the food is addictive...it's not burger-chain cheap but with coupons and senior discounts (you have to ask for the senior discount of 10%) it is more than affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Used to eat here several times a week.  But in the last year, literally four out of five times I go here, they've run out of chicken.   If it happened once in a while that would be understandable.  But it's pretty much every day.  Horribly mismanaged."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken bowl, of course they forgot the rice. I don't expect much from fast food restaurants however I do expect rice."}
{"text":"Chicken dry. Chicken small. Chicken did not taste good. Light light years worse then the good Pollo Loco we knew back in the day. So disappointing ."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 burritos. Both of them were ripped, spilling all of our food as we tried to eat it. There were chicken bones in both burritos, which we didn't realize until already swallowing one! Service was great, food was horrible."}
{"text":"Good but could improve. This is my go to spot for my el pollo fix. Staff is usually nice and pretty prompt. Where this place kinda lacks is keeping up on things in the eating area. Sometimes i will go in and it will be nearly empty however the dinning area is pretty messy. I know in a rush it is hard to maintain it but in n out does it all day everyday. Little things like wiping down the table and chairs, condiments, salsa bar, soda machine , straws and lids. There is one manager who is always on her game, wish they would find another like her."}
{"text":"Update regarding my experience with El Polo Loco. Today I received a call from Jorge. I am not 100% sure what his position is, I believe he is may be the District Manager. At any rate, he took the time to read my review and also my complaint to their corporate office. Jorge was professional in his demeanor, apologetic, empathetic and more than willing to resolve this issue. He advised me that he will speak with the staff, review the surveillance and resolve this issue, which is exactly what I wanted to hear. I wanted to be heard, and Jorge was the right person to speak with. He put himself in the shoes of the consumer, resolved the issue  and he also sounded very down to earth.(very relatable) He referred me to the new store Manager, Maria and invited me to come into the store for a full refund. When I arrived, I presented Maria with my receipt, she issued a full refund to me, gave me and my guest a drink along with guacamole, chips & the salad that I originally purchased which was totally unexpected. I did not complain in order to receive a replacement meal; I just wanted to bring the situation to the attention of management because the way the food was handled was unsanitary. I will not report this store to the health department as management handled everything in an expedient and professional manner. Maria, the new store manager was fantastic, and I will go back to this store in the future."}
{"text":"After waiting inside in line for 20 minutes, we were informed by the cashier that they were out of chicken and it would be a 15 minute wait. Don't you think our time is valuable Mr. Manager? How about let's us and the 20 people behind us know your out of chicken so we can go somewhere else?! Horrible customer service. Words of wisdom... put more chicken on the grill at dinner time especially on a Friday."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru & ordered a mexican cobb salad with chicken... Got home and where was the chicken?! Rip off.. Too far to drive back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I live near this location.  After about 2 years of visiting there on and off I am finally going to right a negative review.  While the food itself seems to taste okay.  Getting your order correctly and being charged the right price seems to be and on going problem.  I realize because most of their business seems to come from travelers that they sadly have no desire to fix these issues.  If you do eat there always check you order and make sure you have everything.  If you need forks, napkins, sauce,make sure its in the bag before you leave the parking lot.  Also check what they charge you, verse what is on the menu you board!  It has not been the same on several occasions.  In one case I questioned why a $5.00 item was $7.57 she told me tax!!  Finally I was told the price had been raised but not changed on the menu board and no one else ever asked them about it!!! 
My last visit I drive thru and ordered exactly as it states on the menu- The 500 calorie Chicken Mango Grilled Tostada.  I tell the girl again its from the 500 calorie menu, to double check she understands.  She tries to upsell me on the meal, I say no.  I get to window, and she hands me a salad(no tortilla on the bottom).  I thought she was accidentally handing me someone else food.  So I said I that's not mine, I had the Blah, Blah.  She snipes back at me \"That is what I ordered!\"  I ask for the manager.  Manager comes over and we have words.  Girl is yelling in the background \"That's what she ordered!\"   Manager tells me they don't make what I ordered any more, they only make those new salads now.   He gave me my money back.  
That is my last visit to this location.  There is another one not to far from me, I don't have any trouble there."}
{"text":"I got the three-piece, with two sides . One  of my sides was the macaroni and cheese and it was burnt and hard ,gross."}
{"text":"Chicken was very dry and over cooked.    I like their bean and rice.  And the guac and chocolate cake was good."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment.  I hadn't had Pollo Loco in a long time. Now I know why. I ordered a salad with chicken and there was about three pieces of chicken on my salad. It looked more like a side salad. The dressing which is usually delicious was very runny. Will not be returning!  I actually wish to give this restaurant zero stars"}
{"text":"I came here the other day and it was ok. My second time coming here . The lady behind the counter cutting chicken is loud and annoying. I don`t think i`ll be back. friendly service, but it seems that this chain puts alot of spicey additives."}
{"text":"This is the nicest El Pollo Loco that I have eaten at in AZ.

As much as I find El Pollo Loco's secret marinade so addicting, I was taking a hiatus from it because I had hit a bad run of dry chicken and super small pieces at other locations. I also thought I had to sacrifice cleanliness in order to get my chicken fix because almost every El Pollo Loco that I have been in recently has been slightly grimy with a thin layer of chicken grease on almost every surface and a messy salsa bar. Not this one! Light, bright, spacious and clean - shocking. 

Two piece meal with rice, salad and flour tortillas - perfection."}
{"text":"They actually deserve a zero! This place is the worst, an embarrassment to the company. The evenings never have a manager and always out of chicken tonight the salsa was spoiled so bad that the acid in it burned my tongue. No one to talk to. Find a different one"}
{"text":"Not real impressed tonight. 
The place seemed very unorganized & they were out of product. If it weren't flor the excellent service we would have left.  
They were even out of napkins & side bar condiments. 
Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday and used the drive-through around 2 PM. I only had one person ahead of me. Service was quick and accurate. I even had a coupon ($20 for a 12 piece family meal), which was awesome. Just like it has been mentioned in the tips, don't forget to get the creamy cilantro sauce! It is so delicious!!! Food met my El Pollo expectations! I recommend this location."}
{"text":"Tried El Pollo Loco in Ahwatukee for the first time. The first thing that came to mind was how expensive it is. We ordered an 8 piece family meal with 2 sides and it was about $22 since we didn't order drinks. The service was fast but the chicken was overcooked and very small. We ate a couple of pieces and asked for the rest to be replaced with better chicken. They did and the new chicken was much better but I still think the marinade was a little off. I don't think I will be eating here too often mostly because the prices are high. I would rather get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store for $6 and make some rice and beans at home."}
{"text":"I like the food at El Pollo Loco, I just wish this location had better flow through the restaurant and places to sit.  It seems like we were standing in line trying not to get run over by the people getting their condiments and drinks.  The young woman who took our order smiled and was nice, but the rest of the staff were not too friendly towards the guests."}
{"text":"Gave them a 2nd chance but service is still poor, the iced tea and salsa bins were empty and even though I saw an employee tip the container to fill his own cup, it still didn't get refilled until several customers were waiting. 
Needs better management and customer service training."}
{"text":"Can I say that this place sucks! I've been to a few other locations around the valley and they were on point. Today, this experience was really shitty and it probably has to do with the leaders of worker bees there. My food was cold, the cashier didn't know how to utilize my app to redeem rewards, the tables were disgusting and we had to clean it up ourselves. My food came out portion by portion. One piece of chicken was hot and juicy but the wing was small cold and I couldn't find the meat on the bone . I def won't be coming back to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"I would like to not only update my review, but change it, delete it and leave it in the past. I actually reviewed based on the drive thru, and I don't think I should have done that. I went in today and from the door you feel the aroma of chicken on the grill, you feel welcomed and greeted kindly by hard working employees, which are mostly young, good looking guys. And then the chicken comes out hot, fresh off the grill. The self-serving sauces on the side are a great plus, but let me tell you about the green sauce..... It's awesome! Zesty and delicious on top of the chicken. Which I ate on a well decorated, modern, dining room. From where I sat I even caught a glimpse of the mountains. So it was dinner and a view! I feel like I can eat here everyday... Not lying. They actually have everything on the menu. Chicken, rice, salads soups, desserts, burritos, tortillas, I mean, what else do you need. I appreciate having Pollo Loco in the neighbourhood. We really did need a place to eat good pollo!"}
{"text":"I got a chicken avacado burrito meal... so it came with a large drink and chips... let's just say the chips were the best part... the salsa had a fishy taste to it... and the burrito had really no taste at all... so if u like food with no seasoning or spice to it at all this is the place for u... granted it is fast food... but still... I would recommend del taco at least there is flavor there... I guess I could have drenched the burrito in taco sauce to make it better...  but I could drench a dog turd in taco sauce and probably make it through the hole thing..."}
{"text":"I go in the restaurant and order 5 thighs and 5 Wings. Greg Valdez the Manager tells me no. He would rather throw them in the garbage rather then sell me just wings. Wings go with a breast. He is unwilling to sell them no matter how many I order."}
{"text":"Come on now, this location needs some help. Took forever to order , then when I did I had to wait 10 min to get my order... I get home and bite into my burrito, no joke a qtr size bone in my burrito.... nasty. And the green salsa was super watery... I know it's a new location, but come on get it together...defiantly disappointed in this location"}
{"text":"4/17/16: While waiting for our food, another patron noticed a MOUSE in the kitchen. We all asked for refunds, and the employees said they were calling an exterminator and closing down for the day. We went across the parking lot to another restaurant and watched cars being served in the drive thru, and as new cars pulled up to dine in, they were not turned away. Ew!!!"}
{"text":"If there was a KFC, Popeyes, and El Pollo Loco side by side by side and I was in the mood for chicken, I would  walk straight to El Pollo Loco with no hesitation.

I have read a lot of the other reviews for this location and came to the conclusion that most of the people who gave a low rating did so not because the food was bad but because the customer service was poor. I too would give a one or two star rating for bad service no matter how good the food is. However, I started coming here since November, 2014 (I am writing this review in March, 2015) and have yet to experience for myself any bad service. The five stars I'm giving is based solely on my own personal observations with the service, as well as food, I had during each of my visits.

Since poor service seems to be a somewhat common trend in other reviews, I'll briefly talk about my own experiences for this location. Each time I've been here the staff was pleasant enough. Never had to deal with rude or disrespectful employees. Never had any issues with my order. The dining area always seemed clean and sanitary. So, for me, I have no reason to lower my rating for what I feel is five-star quality \"fast-food\" chicken. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, on to the food. Like I mentioned earlier, El Pollo Loco is my favorite fast food chicken restaurant. They cook the chicken fresh, right up front so you can see it grilling on the huge grills right behind the cash registers. Each time I've been there the quality has been consistently good. The seasoning may be on the slightly salty side for some but I find it just right. I love how the chicken is cooked just right so that the skin is ever so crispy but not burnt, and the inside is always super juicy yet never undercooked.

The salsa bar is great. They have for your choosing toppings like onions, jalapeño peppers, cilantro, freshly made salsa, etc. My only gripe is a couple times the cilantro seemed a little withered.

The churros here are excellent. I've never had authentic churros before so I don't know how credible my opinion would be in this regard but it's definitely better than taco bell churros.

Overall, I really like the chicken. I have no issues with the service. Five stars."}
{"text":"Arvy gives the best customer service ever. Goes above and beyond for his customers this is my favorite el pollo loco location."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would.. I was not happy with the Service at all.. I came thru the drive thru and got a family meal.. I went to the window and paid they gave me my bag, everything was thrown inside the bag the gravy was not put in a bag like I have always got so in case it opened.. then all the salsa was thrown in the bag as Well they left out my soup. They had people standing around just talking while I waited for someone to see that I needed someone. Then I asked them for my missing items and it was awful.. I left and tryed calling this place for about a half hour and couldnt reach anyone.. I have never had this bad of an experience at any other pollo loco location. Not pleased!!"}
{"text":"I have had problems with this store before but thought I would give it another shot as I received a coupon in the mail. I went through the drive through at 5:30 pm, placed my order, and was told I have to wait thirty minutes for the chicken. I made a fuss and they magically found enough chicken for my order. The place is poorly ran and not worth the hassle. Also the girl at the window was not friendly. I will definitely not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Once I watched a woman berate half the staff because she \"didn't like people touching her food\". She was crazy, rude and unreasonable as she tried to get her 3 bags of food for free. You would never know it based on how the staff reacted, they were so calm and professional and never once got pulled into her drama. 

The salsa bar could be cleaner but it is always well stocked. Salsa is messy.  

My standard order is one chicken leg and a bowl of the tortilla soup. I love this soup, they don't skimp on ingredients. As far as fast food goes it is great and I would return many times."}
{"text":"so i came to order dinner at this location never had i ordered here before, when i go to the window to pay the girl forgot to give me my sprite until i reminded her then i asked for hot sauce she doesnt even asked which one she gives me a red sauce so i asked for the green one after i ask for it she rolled her eyes trying to pull it off acting like she had something in her eye! and thats just the customer service & she forgot to give me my bbq for my chicken tenders, not to mention the french fries are old & cold taste like they were from yesterday & the chicken bowl is disgusting the rice in the bowl is raw for it being my first time here i expected it to be good never ordering from here again! that cashier was rude & the food was cold old and nasty!!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Las Vegas and needed something to eat.

 KFC was not an option there but driving by, we did see El Pollo loco which kind of made me want to try thanks to Spanish Class.

 First walking in, it smelled sooo good but what made me stop my tracks were the burnt looking chicken on the grill. I had the moment where I was like \"Lets get out.\" But my mom wanted the family meal so oh well.

We had recieved a huge meal which was apparently too big for the small hotel tables. The churros were amazing as was the salad. Too much tortillas and not enough rice and beans was my dad's opinion.

The chicken was AMAZING! The thought of the burnt chicken on the charcoal went poof out of my mind. It was crispy on the outside and so flavorfull on the inside. 

We ended up going there at least 2 times before leaving.
 (The second time we took it to Red Rock Caynon for lunch)

All i'm thinking is, WHY isn't there El Pollo Loco in Virginia?"}
{"text":"So it is amazing how just a few bad employees, can ruin your dinning experience . The food is good when looking for a some what healthy options.but management step it up get your employees to up to par. When I was going through the drive thru I ordered a salad and the didn't even give me the dressing. And the lady was very rude, and nearly dropped the bag when it was handed off to me. The wait is also very long too long if you ask me ."}
{"text":"Best pollo in town! Food is always fresh, staff is friendly, they put out the bigger salsa cups for you... seems small but some of the locations are real sticklers about the salsa. I go out of my way for this location, they're doing great. BTW I only go in to eat, the drive thru is slow."}
{"text":"I really need to start checking my orders before leaving!!

Drive thru was fast, employees were nice but they forgot our forks, napkins, extra side of sour cream and my entire chicken salad. The lettuce was old and wilted, the avocado was black and the dressing was only half full. Once i returned to the chain the manager had them make a new one and he was nice enough to give us a large sour cream at no charge."}
{"text":"From 3/31/15
I'm not a fan; the food was sub par at best!  I got a burrito, and the beans were hard and undercooked as if they were not prepped overnight as you would do with fresh beans. I'm not saying my expectations where high, but cooked beans in my burrito would have been awesome.  The only reason I am giving three stars is because my cashier was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I go to this el pollo loco every week.  Everytime I come with friends or family a employee  is having his/her lunch break which is fine.  But they always take the best spot in the house the booths.  As a paying customer we then have to pick a spot next to the bathrooms and the non paying employee sits in the best spot. Why can't they sit next to the bathrooms. Very poor management!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, also workers don't pay attention for what you ask for and becomes a hassle because I've came here numerous times and now always dread going. Only reason I go is because It's close to my house but now I'm going to look for a new location. ALSO DON'T GET THE NEW CHICKEN TENDERS. Mine tasted funny like sweet and I figured out it that it tasted like a churro which some how the sugar got on my chicken tenders. BE WARNED!"}
{"text":"Thirty minute wait if you want chicken?
Well..
Unless you wanted a salad or burrito..
It's inexcusable for a chicken place to not have chicken ready.."}
{"text":"I am really trying to give this location a chance. This is the second time I have been back In a very long time and I left with no food, again. I tried to order the family meal. I was asked if I preferred legs & thighs or mixed. I asked for mixed and the response was we only have legs and thighs. Ok. I guess you dont have what I prefer then. It's only 7:00 pm. I can't imagine they were all out of chicken for the evening, but this really happened. They said sorry and we left."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was at another location that was doing a deal anything $10 or under was free. I came to this one because it's closer to my house and ask them two times are you doing the same deal as the other one where anything under $10 is free. The lady repeatedly told me yes, yes we are doing that. When I come to the window she charges me the full price even though it was under $10. I kept asking her why I was getting charged and she just kept saying something in broken English about a coupon but I couldn't understand her. Finally another woman came to the window who also didn't know how to answer my question. She kept repeating as well that it's just a coupon that you have to go online to get and then you get a discount. I told her about five times that I had asked if they were doing the same deal as the other one where anything under $10 is free. She just kept saying no, there's just a coupon. It's really frustrating when you can't communicate with the people who work here because they don't understand English very well. I ended up just giving up and driving away when I realized no one was going to understand my question. Really frustrated with this location."}
{"text":"I love it, the two piece leg and dark is quite tasty. I will definitely go back, they have remarkably fresh salsa."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst El Pollo Loco I've ever been to in my life. I'm only writing this review after numerous times coming here and being disappointed. I live right around the corner and every single time I make the mistake of coming to this location instead of making the drive all the way down to the Sahara and Decatur location I regret it. Without fail every time my take out order is wrong or the chicken is over cooked or the staff acts like they couldn't care less about the quality of their work. 

Avoid this location at all costs. Make the drive to any of the other locations and you will be much happier."}
{"text":"This is no Pollo Feliz from Tucson.  The chicken had a good flavor but the beans and salsa left little to be desired.  It is another run of the mill chain that cranks out orders of already prepared stuff...boring!"}
{"text":"Every time I go there, they are out of something... such as corns.. salsa..or even sauce container... Staffs were very rude. I love el pollo loco but never like their service..."}
{"text":"Only a few blocks from the office and yhis was my first visit. Ordered a Grande Bowl. with tortillad and drink for close to ten bucks. Rice, beans, corns a small handful of xhicken cubes , three avaccado slices and a teaspoon of sour cream. Liking sour cream I requested a teaspoon more and a manager looking homdre turned and said \"that's extra.\"  A little customer service,  or lack of would go a long way to retain customers but he missed the mark. Didn't matter that the food was acceptable, it will be my only visit. For the money there are several sit down Mexican places with a full meal for the dame price. Thanks  gerente loco."}
{"text":"Came with my family, had them sit in a table while we waited to order.  Someone arrived right after us and we let him go before us while we figured out what to order.  Well, they took SO LONG getting his order that it gave me time to walk around the restaurant.  This customer asked for something on the Menu, and they said they didn't have any ready.  I noticed how six employees later, every single one of them just kept asking another employee what it was going to take to make a new batch.  While they asked each other they were rolling their eyes at him!  Then they proceeded to whisper at each other.  

I noticed that there were no customers inside the restaurant but their drive-thru was pretty busy. The floors were SO DIRTY that the reflection of the sun hitting the floor made it more obvious. There was a set of  footprints by one of the tables and I wondered if someone had been in there without shoes but the more I looked around, the more I noticed how dirty it actually was. I stopped my husband from ordering and left immediately. Even the section for the fountain drinks was filthy, like it hadn't been washed in a couple of weeks. 

No, we won't be back to this location.  Not for dine-in or drive-thru.  Restaurant was filthy and they had poor customer service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE El Pollo Loco but this location is giving them a bad name.  Was there once before and I felt I had walked into a high school cafeteria. Employees with off the clock employees being just too loud and making feel out of place. Food was ok. I decided to give this location another try and I was asked if I can wait 45 minutes for chicken unless I want fried up chicken that's been on the grill for hours. That chicken looked like dry skin on bones yet it's still on the grill. Will not be back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to pollo loco and I was really excited to try something other than Popeyes or KFC. I head here for lunch around 1230 on a Friday and I find myself stuck with 4 cars in front of me; sucked but I figured, it should move fairly quickly, this is fast food after all.  This was SO NOT the case; it took me just over 15 minutes to get to my food. 

The food itself was just okay. My wing was pretty burnt and dry and the breast was good. The black beans, which I was hoping for just some side regular black beans were BBQ! I think they need to advertise this, I don't care if it's their way of doing it, but some people don't like BBQ flavor and should be aware of this. The veggie side was just whatever, not bad but nothing to brag about; glad they didn't load it down with butter! 

I will consider trying again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid. I hbe find memories of El Pollo Loco and family discussions around the dinner table. Flame grilled chicken and fresh tortillas always make for good eats. I have never been into a dirty Resteraunt and I have never had an order messed up. But I must say the drive thru at this location takes forever! Literally over 15 minutes every time I come. Even with only a few cars in front of me. I don't know what the hold up is all the time or if language barriers are an issue but El Pollo Loco needs to figure it out... At least at this location."}
{"text":"Order my food Gracebrook presentation nice people great food for a good price I love good prices for food because when you're on the run it's a good place to goI would recommend pull a local to all my friends because it's a great place to eat"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco serves real chicken. You can see the giant grill behind the counter with  dozens of roasting chickens. The food and salsa there are very fresh .They can get very busy at this store. They need more registers and counter people. Be sure to ring the bell when you leave!"}

{"text":"Great chicken for a great price. So happy to have fast food with a healthy choice. Wish they paid better so they could upgrade the help a little, not the worst, but not the friendly, chipper and ready to please you get at QT or In and Out. Strong 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great costumer service! It started from the entrance Jesus welcomed us, was really patient while taking my order. Great food then the manager later ask if our order was right, and was just great staff members here! One of the best pollo loco I've been too!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I have been here. Was pleasantly surprised. Very good menu - food - service."}
{"text":"For fast food chicken this is my place. And if you haven't been there in awhile you might want to because they have updated their menu and have some real great fresh new choices like street tacos and double chicken avocado bowl. Sometimes I just drive through and get two legs LOL I try not to eat too much chicken but when I want fast food chicken EPL is my choice."}
{"text":"Stopped to pick up a meal before work, once I got to work ready to dive in and found my chicken pieces very small. The wing did not look like a wing it was smaller than any other wing I have had, the breast was not any bigger. For a place to be focused on chicken, I was highly disappointed. I can buy bigger chicken at a grocery store."}
{"text":"Management needs to be aware of an employee named Angel who is illegally misusing of wet-surface signs and chairs to block patrons from access to the restrooms and rest of the restaurant. 

Being lazy is not an excuse for breaking Ally's Law aka The Restroom Access Act. I'd fix this code violation before your next inspection"}
{"text":"Food was great, especially the chicken, as usual.  Chips fresh, lots of salsa.  And the service was excellent on the drive thru.  Sweet young lady name Maria Garcia I believe.  Thanks Maria you are the best."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to order. Arrived at 12:23 on 01/15 to place two separate orders and the rude woman at the intercom would not let me place two separate orders because it was \"rush hour\". Rude, inconvenient and they were only taking cash. Skip this place for lunch because they obviously are a hot mess and can't handle themselves."}
{"text":"I have been to this el pollo loco location about 2 or 3 times already. In all the times I went here for lunch with my colleague, the food was fresh and the service was great. 

I recently went there and got a free meal worth $7 with an order of a meal for signing up on their app. For 2 3 piece meals to be worth only about $11, that's an excellent deal! 

Now that I have claimed this reward, I received another for a family meal! This is great! 

The first time we visited this location, I believe it probably was the manager who came to our table and offered us a churro for free. It was actually very good! I was surprised that they had such bad reviews and he shared that those reviews were in about their first week of opening and he promised that the service would improve. I honestly have not had any issues with service in the 3 times I've been there. 

You will notice that this branch looks a lot nicer than other branches of el pollo loco. I actually like this one the best. 

Good value for money especially with those offers on their app. Closeness to work and fast service makes this a good lunch option when at work."}
{"text":"Got the chicken tacos and quesidilla - chicken tacos were bomb with some green sauce - the quesidilla left a lot of room to be desired! I'd go back if I was craving tacos but other than that I don't know. Plus the drive thru is rather slow - so word to the wise - walk in"}
{"text":"Real bad service. Help not trained. I asked for their new chicken Avaado salad that is on the menu and well advertised on TV. After significant fidgeting the server said they didn't have it.  You will be closing this location very soon. 

Really ?"}
{"text":"El pollo loco is the bomb. But the only thing I've ever ordered is the chicken avocado quesadilla so I can't speak on behalf of its other food. The drive thru is quick and the workers are always friendly"}
{"text":"i ordered the chicken super bowl with extra avacado with no onions and there was one avacado slice, not even kidding, there were onions, and my rice was unbelievably undercooked making it feel like i'm biting into BONES and there was no citrus sauce on my salad - very disappointed"}
{"text":"You need to be mote generous with your food, when I pay extra, I don't want a tiny, thin piece of chicken breast to take the place of a thigh, WHEN I PAY EXTRA.

THIS PLACE IS FILTHY!  empty salsa bo

wls with salsa smeared all over the counter.  It obviously hadn't been wiped or refilled

Hire a steam cleaning company to clean the filthy tile and grout, I hope the kitchen is clean, every surface needs to be sanitized.

Mopping dirty tile is useless and unsanitary, all booths should be wiped down with antibacterial wipes.

The drain under the pasta table is rife with mold and bacteria. Scared to find out how dirty your buckets for ice are.

 I FEAR FOR THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY."}
{"text":"This is a great place recently remodeled and great service for get the fast food i think best fast fast food. always they give you all the necessary items without asking. Manager lady is super nice and, she knows how to keep the place busy and clean.."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE this place, yet I am still attached to it since my husband is a health nut and likes plain 'ol chicken and veggies...and this is the only \"quick\" place to get it in the area.  Let me start off by saying...they take FFOORRREEVVVERRRRRRR.  No matter if you are in the drive thru (which I'm talking about literally spending 20 minutes in the drive thru line), or if you go in the store (about 10-15 minutes).  They are always understaffed.  I've been through the drive thru so many times, and get stuck in between cars for 20-30 minutes.  Its absolutely ridiculous.

When my husband opens up the containers, there are anorexic chicken pieces inside!  On a number of occasions.  There is hardly any meat in this $10 meal, its such a rip off.  Last visit the other day, I walked inside thinking it would be faster (not), I order the same $10 meal, I ask the girl to be sure there is actually meat on the bones since it seems thats all I get.  She laughs....whatever....I wait 15 minutes.....they toss everything in a bag and turn around to grab the churros I ordered.  So I then took the food out of the bag to look at the chicken.  I was right, one anorexic wing and a piece of chicken breast.  I ask the lady behind the counter if they had a wing with more meat since all I get are bones each and every time.  She was nice enough to apologize and give me two additional anorexic chicken wings.  It was the thought that counts...

As much as I hate going here - I do it for the love of my husband....but I cry each time..."}
{"text":"Can't say much about this specific location, drive thru girl was nice. But the new chicken breast bowls are AMAZINGGG."}
{"text":"Food was good but the restaurant was very messy. Flor was dirty as they were some tables. The salsa bar was a mess,  I had to get some napkins and wipe it myself. Flies present...
They were two registers but only one cashier although I could count 5 other employees there. Food took too long for just a chicken bowl and a quesadilla. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"The citrus/spiced grilled chicken is awesome!  Beats the other greasy fast food places hands down.  Fresh salsa and pico etc.  is really great.  Had to eat here twice on my trip.   Too bad there is no franchise in the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Got here at 10:53 and the friendly recording notified me they were closed. Pretty annoying but not unexpected."}
{"text":"Out for a quick bite today & in the mood for chicken, we decided my husband and I to go to El Pollo Loco. We have been here a few times before however, quite a long time ago now. 
We ordered the family meal which has 8 pieces of chicken and 2 large sides. We decided to order the rice and coleslaw. For some reason they offered us an extra side for free. Glad they did, we picked the corn without asking why! The whole meal with one small drink cost around $26, not too bad. 

While waiting for our food, we got our toppings from the bar and the drink. A few minutes later, they called our name. When we opened the box, we were surprised to see that the chicken pieces were small, they looked like Cornish hens rather than chicken! The drum stick was super tiny. We were worried this wasn't gonna be enough after all but we decided to just dig in and hope with all the sides and the tortillas that we would be full. 

Honestly, the food was delicious. The chicken was tender and fresh and the sides were great. By the time I had my third piece I was absolutely full. My husband enjoyed the rest of the meal and by the end of it, we were both glad we ordered it not more, not less because it was the perfect portion. 

Will be coming back again. I've always liked their food and so far they have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not very clean. I am not a clean freak by any standard but I can tell you I had to get napkins and clean off the table we sat at. The food that I was expecting to look more like the pictures in the advertisements failed there. However it did have plenty of flavor and was fresh. I would choose this over a Taco Bell anyway. My rating would have been higher if they would focus on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Having a person walking around offering a tooth picks and hand sanitizes would be make more of an impression if she cleaned the tables and chairs!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and the service was very friendly. I had a 10 minute wait on mix chicken and so she offered me a free drink and when getting my order she put in churros. I had to minus a star only cuz I didn't get rice like I ordered instead I got beans. Other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Skip this location!!!!   I love pollo i eat it all the time but unfortunately this location is closest to my work :( they always get my order wrong!!! On my recent visit i went thru the drive thru and asked if they had the tortilla roll combo- the person on the other end said yes so i ordered that... when i got to the window i was given 3 tacos- when i told her i had ordered the tortilla rolls she replied by saying they dont make those anymore ..... what!!!  Was that not the first thing i asked her??? She kept saying yhey didn't make those anymore- i asked her why it was on the menu then... she kept saying they no longer made those- finally i asked ok so then what did you givr me?  She said i gave you what you ordered... i said no i ordered tortilla rolls...  she then said oh well we do make them but they arent 5 dollars anymore.... ummmm soooo ugh anyway i was do angry i just left but I'm never going to that location anymore!!! I suggest you Don't either.. this isn't the first time they screw up my order.."}
{"text":"Yummy food but stupid idiots working there how are you out of chicken plus flour tortillas it's a white world Douche bags way to pricy !for order Riders can't get it right urghhhhh DONE!!!!! You suckkkkkk"}
{"text":"Came here extremely famished and ordered the 3 course family meal for $20. An absolute great deal for what it comes with: Mexican cobb salad, 8 pieces of chicken, corn or flour tortilla, your choice of 2 sides and churros for dessert. Quality of the food was fantastic. For a fast food place, they're all about healthy dining which is a plus. Service was awesome, food came out in a timely manner.... I'll definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Repeatedly dirty dining room, dirty salsa bar and all tables dirty. I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"Second time to El Pollo Loco in the past 10 years and was very disappointed in the chicken. I use to absolutely love their chicken years ago while living in California and now find it not as tasty nor worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm not sure where to start! While eating our meal we had to watch staff walking around the store with their pants pulled down showing half of their butt. I know this may be the style for a certain age group, but this style does not belong in a restaurant. Also, after they finished cleaning, with their pants pulled down, they placed the cleaning solution right next to people's orders. Improved work attitude, ethic, and pride would go along ways!!"}
{"text":"this location is my favoraite, i love the food and service, i like eating healthy and this serves a lot of different healthy food."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I was once in this restaurant while it was literally HELD UP AT GUNPOINT, I am still giving it 4 stars.  If the whole nearly dying in an ill-conceived fast food restaurant heist thing hadn't happened, I would totally give it the 5th star. El Pollo Loco is so freakin good."}
{"text":"Great location at the intersection of warm springs and rainbow. Always busy lunch time and dinner time because their grilled chicken is just so juicy, perfectly seasoned and so so yummy!
They opened about 5 years ago. Last couple time i came i noticed the sauce area where you can self serve wasn't clean or well loaded with items like green or red sauce, salsa etc... 
I always order their Double chicken tostada with cilantro dressing!!! So good, rice, beans, salad, fresh grilled chicken cut and avocado in a tortilla \"bowl\". I recommend to ask 2 cilantro dressing :)

Management please do something 
Your location use to be so clean, self service station always fully load and your soda machine always working...
We love El Pollo Loco because your chicken is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Worse Pollo Loco I visit. Everytime drive thru takes too long when its full and empty. They always forget something. One of the managers is so busy playing around, he has no time to manage. Therefore the employees are a reflection of that and get mediocre service. The food is actually cooked well but again, you can only wish to get what you paid for. It sucks that the staff service is what factors into my going to eat there. If you can go to a different Pollo Loco, I recommend you are better off."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  They open at 10am they aren't always ready to open on time.  They forgot to give my moms debit card back and we had to drive back later that night.  Very rude lady at the drive thru. Worst location in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"For the person that said this location was closed, I am positive it's still open. I think you are thinking of the one on Ray and McClintock. Anyways, I know this isnt exactly fancy dining but I saw another person review it and I couldn't stand by and not have a word on this place. EPL is cheap and delicious, two things I love in a meal!!! Ive tried numerous items on the menu and almost all have been delightful. My favs are the pollo bowl with flour tortillas, the chicken tostada salad, and the chicken with a couple of sides. Their tortillas are really good, soft and warm. If you are going to get their sides, get either the pinto beans, mac and cheese, rice, or corn. I had the coleslaw a long time and remember it being dry and flavorless. Their churros are really good as well if you are looking for something cheap and sweet. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are very tasty. I especially love their house salsa and the verde avocado salsa. Other entree items that are good are the chicken taco's (though pretty greasy) and the green chili quesadilla. An item not worth getting: the classic chicken burrito. Kinda dry and sad. Haha. Anyways, if you have not tried EPL, you must!!! Its not at all like KFC and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I foster kittens for a rescue and had to take them to be altered at the AHS yesterday. My husband works close by so we met up and had an early dinner here before the kittens were ready to be picked up. I haven't eaten at any El Pollo Loco restaurants in four years because the last time I did they gave us the wrong order. We threw caution to the wind, mainly because nothing else close looked good.

I ordered the taco salad and my husband got the chicken avocado taco combo. He liked his tacos well enough, but my taco salad was sprinkled with dry, hard pieces of chicken. They were so hard you could tap them on the table and it would make a clicking sound (if it wasn't covered in sauce, that is). I didn't complain, I didn't take it back. I will never again go to El Pollo Loco. I didn't learn my lesson before, serves me right.

I gave it two stars because my husband said his combo was \"meh, it's okay\""}
{"text":"I hit up the drive through today for a Mexican Caesar Pollo bowl and they forgot to add the pollo. I mean, really? This location has screwed my order many times in the past, but no pollo?!? Unforgivable. Now all I have for lunch is this tiny bowl of cold rice and lettuce :/"}
{"text":"Store doesn't close for 20 minutes. 

But ... they decided to stop cooking chicken a while ago... So just the lights are on.  

Really???"}
{"text":"They don't speak english very well. The chicken was very dry service sucked rude and unfriendly. chicken was tinny looked like they were on a diet."}
{"text":"Smelled like sewage right when I walked in the door. The chicken breasts were cut in half...horizontally. The wings look like they were torn from the chicken. The butchering skills of the staff are obviously horrible. The chicken was dry and did not taste good.  The chicken was so small it looked like a pigeon. 8 pcs for $20 = 4 ozs of meat."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER!! First time we went we went through drive thru and it was a girl she was nice but the food took FOREVER!! As most of these reviews would say.. I understand your making the chicken fresh and your grilling, but if you know it's lunch / dinner time you can start cooking a little more earlier so we don't have to wait so long. Then second time I went through the drive thru it was a guy and OMG idk what it is about this kid but he ALWAYS FORGETS SOMETHING. EVER SINGLE TIME!! I ordered salad and didn't even put the dressing!! Wtf kind of salad is without the dressing!! Then last time I asked for some salsa and he only puts 1 little cup.. when I have a family of 4 and we ordered family meal!! This place is just rediculous!! Where's the management!!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend you use your debt card when you order here. Young lady took my husbands order and charged him for the wrong size chicken combo. He asked her why it was so much and she replied that she charged him for the larger combo. He told her that he didn't order the larger size and only wanted to be charged for what he had ordered. She was annoyed that he wouldn't accept her mistake. So now she has to call the Manager to void the order and correct it. The Manager says that it will take up to three days to refund the amount on the wrong order the young lady rang him up for and then has to recharge him for the correct order. I don't understand why? They should be able to cancel the initial charge that was rung up incorrectly by the employee. Something here isn't right. Someone needs to be trained the correct way to fix their error and not inconvenience the customer for the mistake made. I now have two charges on my debit card for a mistake they made one for $30.31 and one for $24.90. Not the correct way to handle this situation. I will be contacting Corporate to lodge a complaint. I understand mistakes being made but this was not handled appropriately."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru  about a week ago and the girl faith was so friendly and had great customer service skills. She was fast and had a smile the whole time. Our order was large and she didn't miss a beat. So when I decided to go back again I went to dine in and the guy Ramon at the register was also giving great service. The restaurant was clean and even though there were a lot of customers they kept on the maintenance of the dining area. I read some other reviews and noticed some people writing things that just don't make sense. Makes it hard for people on yelp to believe the truth when some others want to be vindictive and write obviously rude and distasteful reviews"}
{"text":"I went to this location after driving in from California - and the food is cold, chicken is burt an dry, and they lady at the drive through window had a terrible attitude - I will never go back to this location, and I will tell all of my friends and family not to go to this location."}
{"text":"tldr

The chicken is good but I ordered the double chicken avocado salad which was under 500 calories; was good not spectacular

get:
-8 piece chicken only special

Protip: get $1.00 worth of tortillas and hit the salsa bar hard"}
{"text":"I have to say for this good being so good is the only reason I ever come back that and their isn't a close one to me. I go Their maybe once or twice a week around the same time bout 6 pm. Now I have gotten used to dealing with the same employees for the past couple of months. Their is one girl that always seems to be in the drive threw working. And let me say this it's never pleasant dealing with her she rushes you threw your order by saying \"ok anything else\" after you order one item. Um yes I do have more to order I will let you know when I'm threw ordering. To make matters worse as she is rushing me threw the order she always ends up messing up my entire order every single time. My girlfriend is allergic to avocados so I always ask for no avocado on whatever she orders. We got 4 tacos but she charged me for 5 and I didn't order 5 and I asked for 2 with out avocado what does she do puts avocado on all of them and chargers me for 5 when I asked for 4 tacos. Maybe if she wasn't so pushy threw the drive threw she could have gotten my order right. Also anytime you have to ask this girl for condiments that's she's supposed to give you she gives a dirty look and shoves it to you out of the drive thru window. Sad she still has a job Their with such poor customer service skills love their good but not enough to go back to keep getting my orders wrong."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service is always a plus. I love El Pollo Loco. The chicken taste really good, and its probably the healthiest fast food alternative when your in a hurry. They give you enough chicken to fill you up at a fair price, so I'm sold. Their corn tortillas are really good as well."}
{"text":"I don't know. It's chain food. Which I rarely, if ever eat. So in a pinch I stop today and ordered their chicken taco Al Carbon, two of them and not really overly impressed with the size. They are about the size of two regular egg rolls at any Chinese food restaurant Though flavor is pretty good but the size for the price $1.69 each. I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came to the drive through. Sat for 10 minutes Before taking our order only to be told they were out of chicken.... wtf??"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy the fire roasted chicken here.  The price is affordable and well worth the money.  I am somewhat luke warm with regards to dark meat which they seem to promote.  The side dishes are good and they have free salsa in the condiment area.  Fries typically take a few more minutes to prepare.

Good overall."}
{"text":"Just came back from El Pollo Loco ...  Love it !

Pros:
 * Juicy chicken
 * Cilantro Cream Sauce is bomb!!
 * huge tostadas
 * quick service

Cons:
 * dirty bathrooms w/ no mirrors
 * their natural ice tea has a weird taste to it
 * they don't carry Choco Tacos anymore (okay that's super old school, but it must have been outrageously good because I remember ha).

Overall:
  I go to El Pollo Loco when I feel like eating out, but attempt to be healthy at the same time.  During this visit I ordered the Chicken Tostada with no sour cream plus a side of the creamy cilantro sauce.  The cilantro sauce is pretty thick in consistency and really doesn't seem to healthy, but I couldn't resist.  It's so hard to resist (that alongside the avocado salsa).  What's up with the tea?  I can't describe the taste, but there was definitely some type of funk to it ?  Egh, nonetheless I'll be back for more.
** 4 Celestial Spheres **

Tips:
 * if you are actually looking to count your calorie intake, the menu lists the caloric value of every item next to it (you might have to squint a bit).
*  Opt for the cilantro dressing... trust me on this one!

{"text":"I just moved here from Long Beach. I had to review this place b4 I left the bldn. I came in with my service doggie. At first they looked at me alil funny, but I just smiled and placed my order. They where so friendly, didn't even seemed bothered by me dinning in the far left corner with my doggie. It was a very comfortable, and relaxing experience.  I truly appreciate your kind service and for not judging my doggie and I. This is not my local El Pollo Loco but I will definitely make the drive to come here everytime"}
{"text":"I ordered my food in the drive thru, and like most times at fast food places, they forgot something. I went back thinking, to myself, I am gonna make a fuss and they better make me happy, lol. Once I get there the cashier was nice and went to see what happened. The drive thru girl came out to apologize, and offered me a free drink while I wait. They took care of me, so I forgot I was mad, lol. 

In conclusion, I will go back to this spot, but definitely double check my order before I leave. Need to make it a habit before I drive away. 

I want to say lesson learned, but we will see if I did learn my lesson."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Service is awful. Food is awful. Worst Pollo Loco EVER. I've never had an order not messed up. The quality of the food is AWFUL. You wait in line and for your food for no less than 30 minutes, ever. Chicken is rubbery. I usually get salads which comes complete with wilted lettuce and old pico de gallo, warm salad dressing/salsa and cold entrees. I can't express how awful this location is. I am an avid supporter of El Pollo Loco and have never had the awful experiences that I've had at this location. I absolutely refuse to go to this location any more. Don't go if you don't want to waste the decent chunk of change and your time for a piss poor meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food !! Been going to this location for a few months now and absolutely love it. The design of the place is beautiful, not to mention the welcoming employees and delicious food. Wish more pollo loco's had the service and food quality they have at this location ! Definitely will continue to eat at this location."}
{"text":"Like others have said.  Noontime visit to get some chicken.  No breasts or wings.  What part don't they understand about it's a CHICKEN restaurant!"}
{"text":"Although the food is ok at this Stephanie Street location, most (not all) staff are rude or don't offer friendly customer service. Also, I can be the only person in the restaurant and still have to wait 10 minutes for two burritos. Finally, prices are a bit high. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awful.  It took forever to get our food. There were lots of employees standing around; at one point they seemed to completely forget our order.  The table was dirty. The salsa bar was a complete mess and looked filthy.  There were lots of screaming children running around. The food was cold when we finally got it. The whole place creeped me out."}
{"text":"El pollo loco is one of my favorite chain fast food restaurants, so I was excited to see a new location opening near my daughters house. We ordered the crispy chicken tacos and the shells were all way over cooked, the chicken was burnt, & extremely scarce. I was so disappointed especially because this location is new so I assumed that attention to detail and quality would have been at it peek."}
{"text":"This location is by far my favorite in town. The food is always good(of course) but the employees here always seem to be so rediculously friendly. Its so nice to go to a fast food place where the people dont put off the vibe that they are completely miserable. The guy working the drive thru this morning was the friendliest guy Ive ever seen at just about any food establishment in town. Period. GREAT service. Makes all the difference in the world. ALWAYS have had friendly service here...if not always fast. 

...and of course the chicken is great...even as a snack I like BRC burrito and cheese quesadilla...so much more on the menu I need to try...its hard though, Im a creature of habit :P"}
{"text":"Ordered double chicken bowl and the chicken was super nasty. I actually had a bone in it lol. Lettuce was nasty to. Really sad because I love el pollo loco but this location needs to get there act together. Food sucks guys!"}
{"text":"I visit this location about once a week and love the convenience of the drive through. It's my go to spot when I don't feel like cooking or getting out of my car. The service is great and my order is always correct."}
{"text":"Given this location is close to my work I find it convenient. I generally go through the drive through. It can get busy during lunch hours but for the most part they move cars fairly quickly. Customer service has always been good to me and my order is always correct and complete. My typical order is a chicken bowl with rice, pinto beans and chicken. This place is perfect for those looking to cut down on greasy fast food meals. While it's still not the healthiest, the charbroiled chicken is simply flavorful and a healthier choice."}
{"text":"Very affordable. They also have discount for ASU students! :)
The sauce is pretty good too. But sometimes they run out.
Although most of my orders have been good, some are sub-bar.
The people here are nice."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco without Pollo it's 9pm in Las Vegas, it will take 50 mins before we can have it ready what I was told"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood.  El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions.  I spent like $10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa.  I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"A mistake was made on my order and they gave me chicken instead of shrimp. So I let them know and they fixed it. Very professional and no issues whatsoever.

And it was my first time at this chain. 5 burritos! Er, I mean 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to this location, through the drive-thru, and ask for more sauce - the girl at the window always looks extremely annoyed to go and get it. Either she needs to not be so lazy - or move the damn fridge closer to the window so that she isn't \"inconvenienced\" by her job."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this El Pollo Loco it is during lunch time and always busy. I appreciate the staff always providing great service at a fast pace for those people running on a tight lunch schedule."}
{"text":"I haven't been to El Pollo Loco in years, so we decided to stop by because we were craving some delicious, healthy, semi fast food and I believe el pollo loco is that. This place has completely did a 180. I think the food has always been pretty good but just the feel of the whole place has changed. The restaurant is beautiful, completely remodeled with. Modernized Mexican American type of feel. The employees are very friendly, attentive and helpful. The food was fresh and delicious. They still have their delicious avocado salsa I remember, but it's a lil bit different. I got the 3 chicken leg plate with rice and pinto beans. My boyfriend got that shrimp and chicken tostada salad, he's obsessed. 

I'm really proud of the way el pollo loco changed things and upgraded themselves. If you haven't tried it in awhile, I recommend coming to this location, I don't think they'll disappoint ya. Will be back sooner than later (:"}
{"text":"I've only been to Pollo Loco a couple of times but I'm definitely a fan. Today I ordered the Chicken Avocado Taco Combo. This includes two soft chicken tacos along with chips and a soda for $6.99 plus tax.

I really enjoyed the tacos which came with lettuce and a slice of avocado and a sauce that made everything come together. I thought the pricing was fair and the A/C was definitely cranked up a skoosh too much today. I'm going to make this a go to destination when the outside temps are in the 110 degree range."}
{"text":"Awful! I was STARVING and it still sucked! \"Anything would have been yummy\" not here! I gave it 3-4 tries. I ordered the avocado chicken salad. Drowning in lettuce water at the bottom. The avocado was to very thinly sliced pieces you need a magnifying glass for. The half a chicken combo. The very bitter end of any carcass of a chicken you can possibly imagine. Dry too YUCK!  \"3 piece dark meat\"  An absolutely slaughtered chicken breast that was stripped of the skin in hopes for it to have a chance at juice, a dehydrated chicken wing that crumbled and then you get the leg. So much for dark meat praying for Juiciness. Don't stop here! I gave many chances."}
{"text":"I am very embarrassed I ate here. So much so I didn't even photograph because anyone would think this was just a hate review. I will start with my iced Tea.

I went to the iced tea dispenser and got splashed in the belly with cold iced tea. The manager just laughed when she saw saw iced tea hit me in the stomach  but she did wipe it off the floor.... (yeah)

I thought the packaged salsa looked better than the salsa bar salsa because the salsa bar salsa looked like it was just frozen tomatoes just brought out.

The  chicken in my salad was so dry I don't think anybody body would come back for trying chicken here. (In the salad anyway)

And the tomatoes seemed like thawed  grainy frozen tomatoes and the dressing was just Mayo with a little green stuff in it.

It was very bad food....sorry"}
{"text":"3/5/17 
I ordered via the drive thru and there was some drama going on with the customer in front of me, which may had had then distracted since they didn't put my order churros in my bag, however they charged me for it. Lesson learned to ALWAYS check my bag prior to driving off. I ordered a grande avocado chicken bowl and an order of churros. 

The bowl was good, my only complaint was the lack of avocado, the online pictures are deceiving.

Grande avocado chicken bowl - 3 1/2 stars

This time I ordered from the one on East Thomas. Thank goodness my food was free thanks to the $10 comp that the company gave me for the mistake on my last order. This time the food was lacking in flavor, I didn't even finish it. Needless to say I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"We went through drive through asked for salsa and a spasific one. We asked for salad dressing. When we got home there was no salsa and no dressing. The dinner was dry and the 4 drops of salad dressing was a joke. We called and spoke to a manager named Brenda and she was not helpful at all and had a adittud. Very bad customer service. We will call corporate tomarrow and get back our money. They need to do much better or they won't get my business anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying .. I never give bad reviews. I always go with reason when I have a bad experience and focus on the plus side of things. I was reluctant to even write this one. The food is always tasty and fresh. However, the girl who seems to be the manager/supervisor is needing some direction. Bad experience dining in and for drive thru. I'm pretty she's the same girl who takes the orders for the drive thru. She's by far the rudest person in drive thru history. She was even snappy to us once! She obviously can't stand people and has no patience (it wasn't overly busy the past 2 times when we experienced this). She'd be better at just prepping the food with no customer contact.. although I read another review that mentioned her and she wasn't doing that properly either. She also acts like she's right when she gets the order wrong or gets huffy when we have to repeat the order to correct it. She seems annoyed to be there and annoyed with the public in general. Even when she has tried to be nice when handing off the order, she comes off as fake. I'll be back because the food is good and quick. Hopefully the 5th time will be the charm. Optimistically, maybe we happen to catch her on her bad days?"}
{"text":"This is a terrible El Pollo Loco. I was at the drive thru at 7:30pm and I ordered the 8 piece chicken only. I was told they don't have grilled chicken for the chicken only order. Really? Then he said it would be over 30 minutes to make grilled chicken. Really? Go to a different El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS CRAZY MOTHER F'ING CHICKEN!!! Every time I go to El Pollo Loco my socks are knocked off with not only DELICIOUSNESS but QUALITY!!  The chicken is great and all the sides are great ESP. THE NEW SIDES!!!!! SWEET POTATO FRIES & CRAZY SWEET ROASTED CORN!! Sign me up!  For real the food here is always amazing and not only this El Pollo Loco but them all they raise the chain restaurant bar high like 25 feet if we were pole vaulting, jon gets it do you?!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!!! I'm currently inside and have been waiting over 20 min for my food. There are only 3 people inside here eating. Also too they said they ran out of rice?? It's dinner hour! They are slow every time I'm come here it's crazy."}
{"text":"Had to try it. I know it's a fast food chain but as far as fast food goes these guys have some pretty healthy options and who isn't impressed with 2 2'x10' grills all covered with chickens. Okay, it's not a sight for the vegetarians in the crowd. 
Amazing smell none-the-less. 

I went for the 2 piece meal with a breast, beans and coleslaw. All of which I thought were very tasty! Hubby ordered the fajita burrito which was packed full of veggies. Nice for those that like peppers and onions.

The beans had a nice spicy kick to them and the chicken although smaller pieces was delicious."}
{"text":"It is quite annoying to go to a fast food place that solely sells chicken, only to find out they ran out and it will take 30 minutes to prepare. Not the first time this has happened and not the only location. El Pollo Loco really needs to get it together."}
{"text":"This visit was upsetting to say the least. My hubby had hard tortillas and ask three times until they stopped microwaving the crap out of them. His food was cold and when he asked for new food, the manager refused to give him the sides. She did give him one piece of chicken when he purchased a 3 piece meal. We got upset and our dinner was ruined."}
{"text":"They must be cutting back on their overhead while still charging you the same price. My so called \"Ultimate Double Chicken Bowl\" barely has any chicken in it all. My friends \"CHICKEN Burrito\" has a couple of scraps of chicken. If I pay for what I ordered, I expect it to be what I want. It's not rocket science nor gormet. GET IT RIGHT!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered an 8pc chicken meal with corn and mashed potatoes as our sides and half/half corn/flour tortillas all very good.  We also ordered a Chicken Avocado Quesadilla for my son he like it but said it was bland.  I had the Ultimate Double Chicken bowl which I loved.  I added some corn and hot salsa to kick it up a notch.  Bridgett was our cashier  she offered great customer service and was very patient with our modestly complicated order (a few items on the side or not added)  The Crazy Chicken was Crazy good.  I'll be back.  As a general rule I tend to only give four or fewer stars for fast food, but if they keep up the great service and food I might make an exception."}
{"text":"We decided in work to get a drive thru lunch from El Pollo Loco in this location and it's very disappointing because the staff who prepared our orders doesn't pay attention to our orders, what we paid is not what we got, it's incomplete  and my coworker needs to drive back to get the missing order. The guacamole is not  a guacamole and has a jello like or a greenish abut  we guess. 
Just a note before you leave this place check your orders and  for us, we won't go back to this place . Not worth spending a dollar"}
{"text":"The main reason I come to EPL is for cheap and quick meals. Their chicken is on point! The Avocado Salsa and Creamy Cilantro Dressing are also noteworthy. They're unique to El Pollo Loco. Good chicken needs good sauce too!"}
{"text":"This is my usual place but today my visit was very different. I pulled up to the drive thru and was asked if I wanted to try some chicken bowl and I politely declined and attempted to order regular chicken. I was then told that there was no chicken at the moment and that it would be a 20 min wait. Why wasn't this the first thing said when I pulled up. The primary item sold here is chicken so what else would I come here for? I was disappointed that they would allow themselves to run out of their top selling item instead of planning effectively to avoid losing customers."}
{"text":"i don't know what to say their double chicken bowl deal is delicious! you get a lot of food here for your money i think plus the salsa bar is pretty dang good itself!!!."}
{"text":"great food for a fast joint. the chicken is always nice n juicy. i love the ultimate bowl which i get almost everytime i go there. the only drawback is their tortillas taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had El Pollo loco! We used to always eat here growing up in Cali. A few years or so ago, El pollo loco restaurants opened up in Georgia where I live now. I was super excited and my family and I ate there at least once a month (we lived 40 mins away). Everything was good until they just closed. My family was pretty bummed about it. 
We were in Vegas for a few days last week for vacation and of course, we had to eat at our favorite grilled  chicken place. This location was close to our hotel. The food was delicious as we remembered. We got the family meal and also the new shrimp tacos. Everything was great and delicious. One of our boys who only had El pollo loco a few times when they were briefly opened in Georgia kept saying, \" I forgot how the food tasted but now that we're eating it again, I know why you love it so much\". If you like chicken, you have to go to El Pollo Loco.
Btw, if you need to go to the bathroom, you have to ask the cashier for a token. You then take the token and insert it in the lock on the bathroom door. It was pretty neat. Haven't seen anything like that before."}
{"text":"Growing up in Southern California this was a place that we would definitely stop and eat at quite a bit. I haven't eaten in this place for many years being that we moved out to the Midwest which I wish they had these in Oklahoma City. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu I always go for the three-piece combo which I highly recommend come on Oklahoma City bring one of these out to our place"}
{"text":"I stop here often on my way home, I like the hard chicken taco and side loco salad. It's perfect especially since I don't cook often since I live alone and it's affordable. The ice tea is good too! I like the chicken plates too, and the salsa bar is good!"}
{"text":"For a few months I visited this location every Monday. I went thru the drive thru and the lady who runs it is so nice. She would recognize me and my daughter and my dog every time :) this is the MAIN reason for the 4 stars. 

Food wise... I wanna say 2 out of 3 times when I order the chicken chipotle avocado burrito WITHOUT avocado (I'm allergic but the burrito is SOOO TASTY!) I get avocado on it and I can't have it. So that's sad. 

This last time was in they didn't have any grilled chicken available. Normally I get a 3 piece. The chicken is so juicy and the the skin is crispy and the flavor is BOSS. We were sad that they didn't have any. 

My daughter tried one if the new overstuffed chicken cheese and bacon quesadillas and she said it was just okay. She was expecting it to be actually pretty cheesy but it wasn't. 

I like this location and I will continue to do so :)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food, but my husband likes their chicken and I had a coupon so off we went.  He had the three piece chicken meal which he always likes and I had the Grilled Chicken Burrito Combo with fajita vegetables and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was really delicious.  They can be expensive for fast food and what they offer so I suggest only going if you have a coupon."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. The young lady taking orders was rude and appeared to have no interest in her customers. My mom and I had to wait for our food for about ten minutes and there was NO apology. The salad that my mom ordered was put in sideways in our bag, along with our hot food. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"POLLO LOCO -- YUM!!! We always loved El Pollo Loco when we lived in Los Angeles. We came often to enjoy their delicious chicken served up at a price starving Navy types could afford. 

Happily, that has not changed in the 23 years since we were last here! :) The chicken is as juicy and flavorful as we remembered, cooked up hot and fresh after being marinated in a delicious citrus and spice marinade. Black beans are still delicious too!!

They have added more choices to the menu, and for a limited time they even have Chile-Lime shrimp. That we will try another day -- today it was all about the pollo!!

I got the 2 piece breast and wing with 2 sides (rice and black beans) which was my fave back in the day. I always wrapped mine into corn tortillas and drowned them in red salsa -- but with the new salsa bar I tried all the salsas!! I have to say my fave was the Salsa Roja from the salsa bar - smoky and hot without overwhelming the flavor of the chicken. 

The salsa bar is a great addition to this chain. There are 4 kinds of salsas, red and green, with varying levels of heat from very hot to mild. Each salsa is made fresh daily, and you can taste that's true. 

The place was a bit dirty when we were there, with unwired tables and trash under the seats and the salsa bar. Staff walked by but never came back to clean, which was odd because it wasn't busy. Clean the place and you get 5 stars from me because 5 star food + 3 star cleanliness equals 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great employees, very clean and great food. I love the double chicken avocado salad!!  Keep up the good work Greg."}
{"text":"I like their horchata and the overstuffed quesadillas. They aren't the most quick here but their food comes out fresh and always tastes !"}
{"text":"This location disappointed me. I came here last night and ordered the two piece combo to go. It came with a breast, a wing, tortillas, and two sides. 
EVERYTHING SUCKED. 

I usually really enjoy eating el pollo loco's chicken but this place served me a lousy meal. The chicken was dry and came in small pieces. The wing was also half burnt. The mashed potatoes had nothing special about them either. I didn't even bother with the tortillas. All of this came out to be $9 and it wasn't worth it at all. 

The service was also pretty bad. The cashier forgot to give a cup to everyone (including me) that ordered a meal. I would see each person ask him to give them a cup. He would also keep forgetting what people ordered."}
{"text":"After a long day of work we ended up ordering food from here. We got a family pack. The kids love the chicken and sides. I had the soup and it was bomb! Price was great too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the double chicken avocado salad & there was definitely NOT double chicken and absolutely NO avocado! Avocado is literally in the name of the plate. So disappointed. They seemed to have skimped out on the whole salad.. barely any chicken, no avocado and a tiny drop of sour cream.. I should know better by now as this is not the first time I've been disappointed by this location. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Super slow restaurant. There was 1 person in front of us and it took us 10 minutes to get up to the counter and order. On top of that, took them 30minutes for our order of the 8pc family meal to be ready. I mean cmon now! 

Also, very dirty! Do not recommend"}
{"text":"I am very happy to report that I no longer hold a grudge against El Pollo Loco.  The chicken is great, the sides are great, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is the best El pollo Loco that I've been to because the employees make you feel welcomed and happy to help out. The cashier was extremely pleasant and the other employed were friendly and my food was all ready to eat within a few mind of ordering. 

This pollo Loco blew my mind."}
{"text":"I've stop few times at this location and such a bad service .. they close whenever they want to close .. I don't even care to stop at night because no body ever is there at drive thru .. the sings says they close at one time but they close before the time.. since then I have Deltaco is right next to it.."}
{"text":"I love this location. They're the only El Pollo Loco I've been to that doesn't mess my order up the first time, which is a plus. Super friendly staff! Nicolas at the drive-thru is awesome!"}
{"text":"I got a chicken burrito and asked for chicken on the side and none inside and still got chicken inside. The cashier even said there was none inside but what does he know, the one who made it should've made sure and read the order correctly. It's usually good when I get the correct order but the service sucks."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food!  I can eat it without that gut bomb feeling you get after most drive thru's.  The staff is always friendly, the food hot and spicy!  Plus I love the avocado salsa and the new corn cake is yum!  Never thought I would look forward to eating fast food, but I do!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. 6/24/14  1:35 PM

The counter girl, Liz, was charming young lady, smiling, polite and a great example of customer service.

I had a the three piece combo, two breasts and a wing, mashed potatoes and corn on cob for sides, it comes with a small drink. $8.49. 

The service, at the counter, was great. If it was based on this, 4 stars.

The food was good. If it was based on this, 3 stars.

The restaurant was a mess. The ice dispenser on the soda machine had dumped all it's ice into the tray and onto the floor (it took awhile for that much ice to be dispensed). Since it's around a blind corner, I'm surprised no one was injured rounding the corner and slipping on the ice. It was a slip and fall suit, waiting to happen.  Every napkin dispenser in the place was empty. And there wasn't a clean table in the place, looked for the least dirty one. Did I mention it wasn't busy here?

What's the manager doing? Milling about smartly, behind the counter, basically accomplishing nothing, oblivious to everything going on around him. He's standing two feet away from two empty napkin dispensers, that were already open, with a new package of napkins next to them, did he fill them, no. Did he go into the restaurant to see the ice everywhere or the dirty tables, no. Whereas Liz was the epitamy of customer service, the manager was the antithesis of customer service. When a manager reaches the point they feel they are above their crew, no longer a part of the team, too good to assist with the work, disinterested in the condition of their store, they are no longer effective.

This is an unusual situation for me, where I would have given two more stars, had I used the drive-thru, instead of going into the store. My work truck is too big for the drive-thru, so that's not an option.

Okay, I'm done ranting. I just expect a place I'm eating at, to be clean. Possible exception a picnic, but even then I bring a clean blanket, if there's no table."}
{"text":"Standard El Pollo Loco fare here - marinated flame-grilled chicken and all the fixins. The one thing that is notable about this particular location is the friendly service. We come here about once a month or so and the food and service is consistently above par (compared to other El Pollo Loco locations).  They are accommodating, efficient and work hard to ensure that the orders are correct. That's all management and they deserve a nod. If you're looking for a quick, delicious meal in the area, El Pollo Loco is an easy choice."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible most the most of the employees do not know what is on their menu I ordered a double chicken tostada I got a 500 calorie avocado bean salad I'm not happy I come here all the time and I still get the same crappy service, this time I sat in the Drive-Thru for 20-plus minutes for my double chicken tostada."}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was polite. 

It's El Pollo Loco, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I love avocados so of course I love El Pollo Loco.  Their chicken is very well seasoned and they have a great variety of menu items.  I especially like their kids meal options.  It is a great break from the normal chicken nugget and french fries at other fast food places.  My son usually gets the 2 chicken leg meal with a side of mac & cheese.

I also love their spicy avocado salsa:)"}
{"text":"The food is good and a welcomed break from the average fast food joint.  However, when I was eating there, something in their kitchen started beeping really loudly.  I watched to see if anyone was going to turn off whatever was sounding the alarm...but no one looked affected b the noise.  The beeping continued for over 8 minutes before I asked an employee what was making all that noise.  She said they were cleaning some equipment.  And asked if the noise was bothering me with a tone and look that showed she was confused that anyone would be complaining about it.  It was very annoying and caused me to rush to finish my food just to get out of there before I ripped all my hair out.  

I only give them 3 stars because the food was good.  Otherwise it would have been less just for the poor service and disregard for their customer's dining experience."}
{"text":"If i could i would give it a zero star. Disgusting location dirty, trashy resturant. Went in today no clean table to sit at, salsa bar was a mess with salsa and little containers all over the counter a box was over the counter of the salsa bar. Yes the salsa bar! The soda machine was all dirty. When We finally received our food found a fly on my salad ugh.. not to mention i orderd some tacos and the meat was still pink. When we approached the staff about the fly in the salad they couldnt believe or just didnt want to believe we found the fly in the food. Worst customer service did not try to make it right. Had to ask for a complete refund and still the moron of the Assistant manager had a hard time giving us a refund. Kept going back and forth getting approval from his manager. Did not hear an apology from neither one of them until after the fact i asked for his name, his supervisor name and corporates number.  Never going back!"}
{"text":"What Happened to this place? High prices and bad food..."}
{"text":"I love me some El Pollo Loco.  When I visit California, this is the first place I must eat at.  So when I visited my brother I was super surprised that there was not only El Pollo Loco in Las Vegas, there was one minutes away from his house!

I only order their flame-grilled chicken because it's so juicy and the skin is so yummy.  Of course I eat this with their tortillas and top it with some avocado salsa.  So good!"}
{"text":"After months of staying away thinking maybe it changed? NOPE same incompetence cannot even take a simple order and how does a chicken place run out of skinless breast chicken? Employee Sergio can't handle a simple order to complicated.  $15 an hour? 
The only time they ever get anything correct is when Nancy is working! Why isn't she the manager?"}
{"text":"Asst manager put food back in container after someone brought it back from their table cause they want something eles gross"}
{"text":"There's no excuse for such bad quality of meat for such an expensive burrito. And beware because it has bones."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!! They never get your order right!!!!!! It's almost everytime i order this happens. It's ridiculous! I will never go to this location again. I should've known better when 3 months ago i got food poisoning from this location. Obviously they don't wash there hands either. Gross!!!!Stay away!!!!! I'll be calling the health dept In the morning."}
{"text":"All of the tables here were nicely wiped off and clean. Unfortunately, though, every chair in the place had crumbs/dried lettuce, etc. 
Either their customers are leaving secret bits of crap on every seat or the person who cleans off the tables isn't watching where the crumbs go. 
Pull yourselves together! You have a great product."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate at El Pollo Loco when it first opens, and I must say I prefer coming early. The chicken was super juicy and tender and not dried out like I'm normally used to. 
I completely forgot to take photos of the food lol it came out so fast and the chicken looked so fresh I completely forgot about the photo. 
We ordered a three piece meal with a side of rice and beans and a double chicken bowl with a side or chips. 
No complaints here staff was super fast and friendly and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"After working a long day at work my wife and I decided to come to El Pollo Loco for a late night dinner. Jasmine took our order. She greeted us right away and seemed  very friendly and approachable. 

We ordered the double chicken avocado salad with out sour cream, corn mix or citrus vinegar. I ordered a Chicken Tostada no Pico or sour cream with extra chicken and I added cheese :) We ordered it to go. The wait was rather fast. When she gave us our order she read back our order to make sure it was correct and didn't forget to ask us about salad dressings even though we didn't need any I was happy she offered.

We came here a few times and every time we had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Somewhat Disappointed This Time


My co-workers and I go to El Pollo Loco because of the tasty and healthy roasted chicken.  I say healthy because it's not fried like most other  fast food restaurants.  EL Pollo Loco gives guest the opportunity to order dark meat (leg and thigh) or white meat (breast and wing).  The chicken goes well with their Spanish Rice and tortillas.

I was just quite disappointed in my most recent visit.  I order the grilled chicken salad  and to be honest the salad juzt wasn't very good.  The lett e was wilted and the chicken was somewhat dry.  However, my co-workers really enjoyed their meals.

I think I will go back and try a burrito or maybe even a bowl."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and have always had great service. Tonight was about the same, despite a slight attitude problem from the person who took my order. She got a little \"put off\" when I had to explain to her that I had ordered two LARGE Diet Cokes. She tried to pass off two SMALL ones, saying I had ordered those. I once again reiterated that they were indeed large, and yes, she stood corrected when she double-checked the order on the screen. She rolled her eyes at me, gave a loud, obnoxious sigh, and changed my drinks to a large. I certainly hope I don't encounter her again on future visits so she doesn't decide to spit in my food or something out of spite. 

Otherwise, this visit was once again fine. The food was excellent, and I even had enough to take as lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco and their food is always served fresh and hot. The service is really good at this location and I have never had any problems. They always make sure you have what you need and if not they are quick to get it.

As long as they keep doing things the right way, I will remain a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"This food at this particular location has been horrible for the past two times we have received take out orders.  The chicken is over cooked and dry, and the sides tasted like they were made the day before.  Never again would we go to this location."}
{"text":"The second time they forgot to give my tortillas. I get home from all the traffic then when I check my food the order is incomplete. Then when I call them to tell them, they don't pick up their phone. Very bad service for the second time"}
{"text":"Went through drive threw and my order was not all in my bad
Had to go back. It's the 2nd time this has happened ."}
{"text":"Blanca was a pleasure. When we came in we had no idea about the new menu we normally get the $5 taco Al Carbon meal.. She was knowledgeable and also professional! It was FRESH&FAST! We enjoyed our dinner! I will recommend this location to all friends and family thanks Blanca for making it a great experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered and went to wait for our order.  First....we notice the entire floor is sticky...then tried to get a table which should not be a problem since there was only on other customer there BUT...EVERY TABLE WAS DIRTY....like smeared with food and liquid.  I told the cashier and a boy came out and wiped down a few of them.  Then our double chicken/mango burrito and chicken salad was ready....both had every piece of chicken was burned, dry and not even chewable.....and no Mango.  We left and are not happy about the $14.04 wasted and still no lunch....my receipt says we were there at 1:04pm Sunday July 24th....we tried it again after a bad experience in 2014 and it was very good in every way...either it is very inconsistent or it has gone back to its old ways"}
{"text":"The last 3 times I came here they were out of chicken breasts?! That is all they serve, chicken, how are you out during lunch time? Also, got spoiled cole slaw."}
{"text":"What we received were cold  burnt chicken.  They were as black as they could be and they were not even warm.  They were not helpful at all because they were about to close.  Well, we paid full price.  What more do you need to know? Of course they didn't give us any refund.... as expected.

 Update: The corporate contacted us and also we spoke with the general manager at the store and he was very apologetic. We received a refund."}
{"text":"Food is good service sucks.
Damn shame, a couple of bad apples can ruin a buisness.
The shrimp tacos are amazing. Usually pretty fast..
Everything I come here it's a new cashier and they are so rude and unpleasant."}
{"text":"I went in to claim a Birthday Tostada Salad, it was the worse salad ever!  I don't like beans in a salad and especially who puts rice in a salad, I don't.  It isn't a \"Mexican\" Original Chicken Salad anymore.  They only give you 1 oz of chicken, a tablespoon of sour cream, a tablespoon of pico de gallo, I didn't see any guacamole.  All I got was mostly iceberg lettuce which has no nutritional value.  They remind me of Taco Bell on 67th Ave & Peoria Ave in Glendale AZ who charge $7 for crumbs from tortilla  chips.  If you want to get something FREE for your birthday, get the 2-pc chicken deal.  At least you will get a lot more than an ounce of chicken but no vegetables."}
{"text":".The chicken is good and for the most part everything else is good but something is wrong with the coleslaw there. At one point, ever time I would eat there, I'd get stomach cramps soon after. Once I thought it was because of the side of beans I ate but then the next time I ate there, I didn't order the beans yet still had the same problem. Then I'd notice that when I ate leftovers, I only had the chicken and didn't have any problems and figured that the only common thread was the coleslaw and that seemed to be the problem. I haven't had their coleslaw ever since and haven't had any problems since."}
{"text":"I originally tried El Pollo Loco in Tucson many years ago.  I recently decided to visit while doing a bit of horse trading at the Bookmans next door.  For  not much, I got a drink  plus a bean, cheese and rice burrito with a fire roasted chicken leg and a chicken taco that were tasty and filling.

The parking is ample it seems.  While it's not been dirty or messy, the decor is not very impressive.  Not bad, not great but a-ok."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews! Just got done picking through my 8 piece mixed dried up heat lamp chicken I went 10 miles out of my way to go to this dump! $16 for perhaps the worst chicken I ever had not to mention no tortilla in the bag. Been about 15 years since I ate at one of these in CA and I remember it was great.... never again Boston market blows them away."}
{"text":"OK...I know this is a chain.  I try to steer away from chains most of the time.  In this case we had an appointment nearby, and it was incredibly convenient.  Plus sometimes you want simple food.  OK...enough justification...

We find this better than KFC.  The marinade they use is subtle but flavorful.  The chicken at this location was no exception. The beans are ordinary pinto beans.  At least they aren't that refried muck.  The rice is very lightly seasoned, not what I would call Mexican rice despite its color.  However, adding a bit of pico de gallo to both makes them better.

We ordered a \"three course meal\".  This included soup and a dessert.  The soup was fine (again, add some salsa to jazz it up a bit).  The dessert was supposed to be chocolate churros.  But the manager was very accommodating. She let us swap out the churros for a brownie.  That's good customer service.  The brownie was pretty dry (so I wouldn't recommend it), but I give credit for the customer service.  I have to round UP my rating instead of rounding down.  So instead of 3.5 stars I have to go to four.  

Understand that is for the sort of place this is.  I'm not comparing to Kona Grill.  This is a fast food chicken place.  It's not fair to rate them against Vintage 95.  

Also, the place was clean (dining room...I didn't check the restroom)."}
{"text":"This is a fast-food chicken joint.  They put something of a Latin spin, but it's really just grilled chicken served with tortillas.  The chicken is pretty good, as are their sides.

When we were there they seemed to be having problems.  Their card reader was out, so we had to pay cash.  And there was something going on in the back, but I couldn't really tell what (someone was have trouble with something, and there was chattering back and forth).  So it's difficult to judge them on other aspects besides the food.  The person who took our order was nice enough, but distracted by whatever was going on.

I'd come here before KFC, but I wouldn't call this my \"go-to\" place when I want to eat out (or do take-out, which we did).  We had a coupon, and a couple of our other choices were closed.  But they did fine.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST fast food experience of my life.

I've never had El Pollo Loco, asked my boyfriend if I should go here or Popeyes and he said here because it's healthier and good. 

I'm not writing that off, but I will NEVER return to this location. 

First off, the women taking my order in the drive through either didn't know the menu or couldn't understand me. I asked for shrimp tacos with lettuce wraps combo. Asked if it came with a side and she said \"if you want\"???

I said okay broccoli. Then she says hold on and makes me wait another 2 mins after already waiting 10 just to order. She comes back after having obviously had to ask what it came with and tells me \"it comes with two tacos, chips and tortilla and a drink\"

I said okay well I don't want tortillas, I want lettuce wraps and that's fine.  She's tells me the total is almost $10 when the board said it would be $6.99

I get to the window to pay and ask about the price and the girl said \"it's tax\" like oh okay didn't know tax was $4?? I also ask to confirm that they are lettuce cups and not tortillas and she says \"no ifs tortilla\". Guess I can't have it my way, lol

I ask for lime and hot sauce and extra of it, she brings me my food with no hot sauce. I ask again and she says \"oh you want hot sauce\"?? After already repeating that a few times. 

She finally gets me two little hot sauce packets and at this point I've given up.

The only thing this place has going is the girl who rang me up was kind. But it seems like no one either knows what they're doing, or don't care to try and do good? WHAT A JOKE.

Oh also and my tacos were cold and thrown together and the \"guac\" was thrown in the bag stuck to what looked like an already used container??  

Not sure why I can't add pictures to this post but there somewhere on here. 

Praying I don't get sick HA"}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to fast food Mexican restaurant! I especially love this location because the service is always great and the food is always delicious. I've tried other locations before but found they aren't quite as good. I love the burritos here! Very filling and fresh! I usually order the Chicken Avocado burrito, the Pollo Bowl or one of their Chicken Meals. Their grilled chicken is soooo flavorful! The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is the Salsa. I feel it's kind of bland and I usually don't even use them with my burrito or chicken. Luckily they are already tasty without the salsa. The large selection of sides are awesome, and I usually treat myself to a yummy melt-in-your-mouth caramel flan dessert- which I sometime end up enjoying before my meal. Once they were in the middle of cooking a side I ordered so they apologetically asked me to wait in the parking lot and gave me a drink of choice while I waited. When I got my food soon after, they gave me a free side for the inconvenience! That's great customer service that keeps me going back!"}
{"text":"Finally a healthy fast food restaurant in our neighborhood. 
Love the \"under 500 cal\" options!!!
The Double Chicken Avocado salad is great and very satisfying. Also everything is very fresh!"}
{"text":"As part of it's restaurant chain Pollo Loco has a delightful standard in the quality of it's food - being Hispanic and having experience with paralleled variants of both traditional and American takes on Mexican flavors I can tell you their brand is delicious.

Now to why I gave this particular location a two star rating is because of their inability to complete my orders on several occasions both inside the restaurant and through take out. Their chicken on my last family order had very little meat, a problem I've never had out here in Arizona or in Los Angeles. Prior to that I ordered a 5$ bowl amongst other things which comes with tortillas and a drink and they forgot both. On another occasion they forgot to put corn in two bowls I ordered that come with corn naturally. They hesitantly comply with their mistakes but they have a way with their attitudes which makes it unpleasant to interact with them."}
{"text":"Ordered a family meal via drive thru. The wait for my food was a tad excessive but I could see them putting it all together. I guess they don't have premade containers with sides, etc. When I got home the food was still hot so I guess that's a plus.
The drive thru lady was very nice and the inside looked clean and everybody was working diligently, rare to see."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service the manager on shift Cynthia definitely needs more training I showed her salsa with big gulps of slime in it and told her that it definitely doesn't look good and normal I had my receipt and told her I wanted a refund after showing her the salsa and told her I was disappointed and disgusted she said no.

Cynthia definitely needs more management training fast."}
{"text":"Really enjoy el Pollo Loco.there tostada salads are really good.
Little tip to save money.
Buy a 8 peace dark meat chicken for $10 and 5 packs of flower tortilla for $1 you can make your own tacos with there salsa bar and feed 4."}
{"text":"I personally think this is the worst experience I have had at a Pollo Loco.and I love Pollo Loco I ordered the chicken bowl looked like ground chicken and Had lot of bones.i would never return to this location ever."}
{"text":"El pollo loco is what it is this place is a constant hit or miss. I only come to El Pollo loco when they send those $5 coupons for there me yes items. It can get pretty damn expensive REAL QUICK. With that being said my most recent experience was last week and it wasn't bad... Im wondering if they were short staffed on this visit because I have to ask myself why my stuffed quesadilla combo took forever? Anyways when I pulled around and presented my coupon the cashier seemed reluctant to even take it! And I'm like is it a problem he has to check if they accept the coupon? This is when I have to again remind people that reading is fundamental.. it clearly said at any LasVegas and Henderson location give me a break.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and to be honest I really wasn't impressed! They were super busy which yes it was lunch hour however I think the service could've been better! They were clearly short staffed as the manager actually had to open up on a register to help with taking orders! I know a good quality bowl when I taste one so me wasting my $9.99 on the \"double shrimp\" bowl will never in my life happen again! I got the bowl and to my pleasant surprise it wasn't anything special! I thought to myself what did I seriously just order! There were about 6-7 shrimp in this huge bowl and they were the tiny ones! I'd hate to see what the normal bowl with shoring looks like as mine being the double was lacking seriously! On top of them being stingy on the shrimp the rice seemed dry and unseasoned! Most definitely not worth the price! I'll never return!"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco like any other fast food place can be a hit or a miss depending on the day you go. I generally don't come here unless they send me some of those coupons in the mail. The prices can get a bit high without some savings so I will always wait until I can get some sort of deal. The chicken here is pretty damn good but I would only like to pay the coupon price lol. This location gets 3 stars from me because they are extremely slow every time I have decided to pay them a visit. Today I waited about 15 minutes in the drive thru because the cashier was clueless. I read her my coupon description and she insisted that it was for one of the under 500 calories entrée MEALS and not just the salad. Now I know that I can read and comprehend very well so I was sure this was for just the salad. I get to the window and she tries to apply it to the MEAL she was so adamant about and well what do you think happened? Yep.. it wouldn't take it because it was only valid for the salad. But didn't you say... Never mind I shall digress... Overall it was just an okay Chicken Avocado salad anyways.. Under 500 calories though I may have to look into..."}
{"text":"We came in with our daughter for some fresh cooked food. We ordered the food and asked for a few special requests and they were super helpful. Elizabeth the manager was friendly and helped us with our order. I'd recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Just a quick shout out to Samuel who greeted us with a smile took our order quickly and efficiently, describing the menu and it was just super friendly. Made our experience wonderful today."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Quality of the food is much better at their Chandler or Riverview locations. It would definitely be more beneficial to travel a little further to one of these other locations. 
Bathrooms were dirty and didn't have toilet paper. 
Employees seemed bothered when notified of this."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place from time to time. The chicken is always fresh tasting and their avocado salsa is my favorite. I like to stop in for a grilled chicken breast with a loco side salad or their new chicken tacos. Best choice for fast food."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I had never eaten at El Pollo Loco.  But Jeff Lewis seems pretty fond of it, either that or El Pollo Loco pays him extreme amounts of money to eat it on the show.  And I LOVE that show, so I thought I might love El Pollo Loco, too.

I went with the twice grilled chicken burrito, not sure if the twice grilled part referred to grilling the chicken twice or grilling the chicken once and then grilling the burrito.  It was the latter.  Anywho, filled with chicken breast, pico, sour cream, guac, and a little cheese, it was quite tasty, and probably pretty healthy wouldn't you think?  I like that you get a little bag of tortilla chips with your order.  Also sampled the black beans, but they were a barbeque bean, not my thing.

It was fun to see strawberry soda on the fountain, too, which I had to have, much to my husband's horror.  This from the man who drinks orange soda routinely.  

The restaurant was reasonably clean, but my shoes stuck to the floor, perhaps from someone else's sickeningly sweet strawberry soda.  It was a nice change to have your order brought to the table.  I hate the lingering at the counter you get at most fast food restaurants.

Too bad my somewhat healthy burrito had 796 calories, and 39g of fat.  While I might return to El Pollo Loco if convenient, I wouldn't go out of my way for that kind of nutrition.  I would opt for a (insert name)berto burrito instead.

And BTW, you can catch the new season of Flipping Out Tuesdays on Bravo.  Now that's useful information!"}
{"text":"This location sucks it took 45 minutes for me to get my food from drive-through the Guy who was taking my order is a complete idiots they are losing business because their very unorganized..."}
{"text":"I am lovin' El Pollo Loco. Muuuuuch better than the local colonel imho. All of their salads are very good. My food has always been fresh, including the salads. Service could have been a little tighter at times, but it seems like most people like working there and working with each other which shows in the quality of the food. Overall I am pleased with this restaurant."}
{"text":"After having stopped at a few Riverview Stores, we decided to grab lunch from the drive-thru at El Pollo Loco on our way home. Ordering was a tad frustrating since we had to repeat the ourselves several times. The menu has many similar items so that probably did not help with the communication issues. When we pulled up to the second window the food came out very hot so that was plus. I liked my Chicken & Street Corn Bowl (that is advertised as only available for a limited time) but it was definitely lacking the Cotija cheese that is shown in all the photos of the bowl. Also, the avocado clearly had an unappealing spot from oxidization that probably should have been removed before serving to a customer. And I wasn't a fan of the beans as they seem to be watered down (a pet peeve of mine). Overall, the food was not too horrible but I doubt I'd be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was so impressed tonight with the service at this restaurant.   It was quick hot friendly.  Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Just went to the drive thru. All I wanted was an 8 piece leg and thigh.  Was 4 th in line at drivethru was told they were out of legs and thighs.  I was offered for 2.50 more a mix.  So my way of thinking you're out of chicken which is your business and now want to charge more for something I don't want. In my opinion ignorant people work there.  I will never go back and will always use this example when I do my training sessions on what terrible customer service is.  

If you're out of something and you offer an alternative offer the price of what you're out of and maybe a discount from that to compensate.  I will never goto your restaurant ever again.  Good luck with keeping the rest of your customers happy."}
{"text":"My daughters first comment about this place was \"why is everything so dirty\"? The place was empty, yet nobody was cleaning the tables. The food to me was bland, even my non-picky husband didn't like it. Friendly manager, grumpy cashier. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I drove through El Pollo Loco for lunch yesterday and to pick up some delicious morsels for the ladies at the office. I was asked if I wanted a beverage, but when I ordered a coke I was told the soda machine was down. I guess they were just kidding about that offer of a beverage? I had something called a crunch burrito. I was just intrigued by the name. It had cabbage and beans, which would seem like a ghastly combo, but it kind of worked somehow. It also had rice and chicken, which was just lovely. The burrito was huge. Think of the ones they give you at Chipotle. It's a similar size, so I was able to make two meals of it. I don't know that I would order it again, but it was a novelty. If I did, I would tell them no beans. I just think it would be better without. In all it wasn't bad; it was just OK."}
{"text":"Usually go to the one on Decatur when we're in town; decided to try our luck.  Went for the 3 course family meal, $21.60, same price we paid for the dinner buffet last night at Sam's Town.  We should've went back to the buffet.......seems we were given all the dried up legs and burned thighs.  Salad was okay, hubby thought the beans tasted a little off, tortillas weren't even warm.  Only thing good were the churros.  Needless to say, we won't be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Lake Pleasant Towne Center, located in the NW corner of N. Lake Pleasant Pkwy. and W. Happy Valley Road.  They're rarely crowded, because not many people realize that there's shopping all the way out here. I like the 2 piece / 2 side with drink combo!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I listen to the previous reviews?!? I could have saved time and money. Long wait time,
Computer/cash register issues. Employees, though nice, seem not properly trained. El Pollo used to be fast and tasty! What happened? I'm sad"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday for lunch it was very good & tastefull.....the reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because of my server & they have dirty filthy restrooms"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love El pollo loco and have been to many. This is by far the best and I have no idea why the reviews are low. All the employees seem very happy and deliver great service. Great and clean atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and lately the chicken is dry and condiments are not refilled.  Don't think I will be going back. I don't like day old chicken!"}
{"text":"We just stopped here on the way home and I got the 1/2 chicken combo and my wife got the chicken enchiladas. Mine was fine but her enchiladas were absolutely horrible. We surely won't be back. Would rather go down the street to Julioberto's for my Mexican food."}
{"text":"I gotta give them props and bump them up a star. El Pollo Loco is still my healthy lunch of choice in this armpit of the city. It's kinda like a shaved armpit now instead of a musky, hippy armpit. At least in regards to EPL that is. 

They have booted the homeless crew who use to reside here AND remodeled the interior of the restaurant which created a brighter and more spacious environment for grubbin'.

*Salsa bar is clean and full (until I get a hold of it)
*Staff is on point even if they still say,\" Hi-Me your order is ready\". I'm cool with that. Makes me feel all Bon Qui Qui inside. 
*Food here is consistantly delicious and fresh. 
*They have a loyalty card that seems to equal a free $5 salad for me once a month. Boo ya!!!!

Yeah, they are on their game right now and I'm likin' it. Only thing I don't get is this. They started selling smoothies and slushy coffee drinks. Why don't they have a Horchata flavor ice-blended drink? Wouldn't that make more sense? I know this Ranchero would be all up on it on Cheat Day."}
{"text":"Best healthy alternative near here.  Fresh avocado and the avocado lime salsa is my favorite.   The chicken citrus avocado salad is fantastic.   Chicken avocado poblano tacos are amazing.  Love this food.   I usually get drive thru and go home and eat.  Sometimes I don't have time to cook a healthy dinner and this is a great dinner rescuer."}
{"text":"Today I went to your store 6066 order #1667 I went in the drive through. I ordered 2 combo meals, the young lady asked if I wanted drinks I said yes the combo meal again she asked if I wanted drinks ? I said yes they are with the combo meal. She took the rest of the order and I went to the window and said the word combo meal come with what it says on the menu. This is where I got mad she told me that most people don't know what they want and say the wrong things implying that we were all dumb. I don't go to your restaurant for grammar lessons or to be put in my place as one of the sheep. 
I will share my experience with other members of our group.

{"text":"Would give it zero stars if I could. Placed order at 7:24  walked out at 7:53. They were out of flour tortillas, churros, almost corn tortillas and the average wait was 30 minutes. They could not figure out which buzzers went with which meals. The salsa bar was out of onions, avacado salsa, and cups and the whole thing was disgusting. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I like their food but the drive-thru is dangerous to exit with being far too easy to tear the side of you car apart.  This time I went through the drive-thru I was in line for 30 mins."}
{"text":"Favorite chicken spot of all the chains. The marinade is awesome. Grilled so it feels healthy. The toppings n sauces n salsas are a huge bonus. Their fire grilled corn side is so good!!! Avocado chicken burrito is fantastic. I'm definitely craving el pollo for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"There's something about this chicken that tingles my taste buds. Once that grilled chicken hits my lips, it's bliss. When the flames of the grill lick that marinated chicken, sizzling magic happens. Absolutely love this chicken."}
{"text":"I eat here probably once a week. It is always clean, the staff are always friendly. I usually get a Mexican salad, which is always pretty good. I rotate between the double chicken and the Mexican Cobb salad. The cilantro dressing is tasty. Today's salad had a little too much lettuce, but otherwise tasty. I like that I can add cilantro, onions, salsa, etc to my salad at the little bar they have. I eat for less than 10 dollars which these days is really good. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Don't know how the actual food tastes here because the store decided to close up 30 minutes early. Went here because the yelp page said they close at 11 only to see everyone in the back, cleaning up already. I get it can be slow but change the hours then if that's the case. Instead, I just got a blank, annoyed stare from the employees inside who clearly saw me,  for coming by 30 minutes before closing. No words other than lazy come to mind."}
{"text":"I really love the food at EPL, and while I had spent most of my day shopping and traveling, I thought I'd stop in for something to eat!

I've been to this location before and loved the service.

The dining area was clean and so was the condiment bar. The bathrooms however, not so clean. I've been to 4 locations in Las Vegas, I feel like that's a recurring theme. LoL

There was a line when I entered and it seemed like the drive through was just as busy. The employees did a pretty good job at expediting. 

When I placed my order, the cashier handed me a pager which resembled a taser, I thought that was pretty funny!

I ordered 2 tortilla rolls and churros! Yum! Just as I remembered it.

If you are seeking deliciously grilled chicken and want a place where nothing is fried but always fresh, this should be a go to place for you!

Oh yeah, ask for a side of the creamy cilantro dressing, you're gonna love it!"}
{"text":"this one is one of my favorite locations . Food is always warm , service is fast . Every time we order a large amount for the office is no big deal . No 24 hr notice ."}
{"text":"been here twice and even though i live close by it was such an incovinience. I used the drive thru not once but twice yet even though i order a tostada salad and other things .. the dressing never seems to make it to the order . Other than the food is cold and the quality suck i rather drive farther than try this place again"}
{"text":"Love their avocado sauce! I take shots of that stuff outta the containers. They ran out of the sauce yesterday. So I know I'm not the only one that asks for 6-10 of them. Dudes I bet they drink the sauce like I do too huh.

The crazy chicken never lets me down with their burritos and taco platters though. Plus their taco platters come with beans and rice! That pair alone makes me full. Their burritos are hoagy. The platters have 3 soft tacos. 

Careful how you order churros. One order has 2 churros so if you say \"2 churros\" you might get 4 sticks. Make it clear, sugar fiends. 

For you spicy lovers their jalapeno hot sauce is perdy good. I tried mixing it up with the pico; works well!"}
{"text":"We do enjoy eating here!!! It is few and far between.  We most like the salads. They are fresh and full of hoidies. They will definitely fill you up. The salsa bar is simple but super tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many El Pollo Loco's! This one by far is the worst.   I have generally liked and enjoyed other ones. I ordered a 2pc chicken meal,  from a reward I was given. The cashier says the meal came with a drink, so okay. Hubby ordered a tostado salad, double chicken,  also on a 5.00 reward. The cashier could not get the reward to scan, so manager came to help.  Manager states its because 2pc chicken meal with breast and wing was 1.00 more and does not qualify for a drink. I disagreed with her and tried to reread the promo but it had already been redeemed. After 5 minutes of back and forth and  the manager speaking Spanish to the cashier, finally gave in and accepted the   promo. 
The chicken was DRY!!! And scrawny!!  The guacamole was Brown and runny!  I paid extra for chips and gauc. Such a disappointment!   I will not be back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"So 14 months later I gave them another shot but this time I went inside. The dining room had a few people eating and one employee cleaning. There were four people behind the counter, and I was the only person in line. No one came to take my order as three to four minutes passed. I see an employee  (female with glasses) standing in the back talking to the cook about what she was going to do on the weekend. Now at the five minute mark approached the young man sweeping put down his broom and took my order. Order was right and food ended up being good. As another five minutes passed the girl with dark hair and glasses still was talking to the cook. You could tell the guy that had to stop sweeping to take my order was not happy with her. So still after all this time management still allows employees to be nonchalant and lazy. To the young man that noticed I was waiting to place an order, thank you. Go somewhere where management knows how to run a business. Food is always good but this location is horrible when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"Poor experience. Cashier couldn't make apply pay work, though they advertise they accept it and I've been using it without issues at other locations."}
{"text":"I like the new Grill Master Pollo Bowls.  However everytime I have ordered the grill master bowls especially the mashed potato bowl it has been inconsistent and the portion in the bowl varies dramatically which angers me when I get home and discover this. If they get it together this place would be pretty good and I would frequent it more often. The employees obviously are not trained correctly because they put whatever they want in the bowls.  There is to much competition in this area that are more consistent and get it right all the time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, dirty restaurant, and they charge you $1.89 if you want a water up (unless you want one the size of 2 ounces). Pathetic."}
{"text":"8 piece chicken dinner with 2 sides, 4 tacos, and your choice of deserts for $20!!!!!!!!! I can't cook unless it is on a grill so when it is dinner time and the kids need to eat, this was the spot.

I was just giving it a shot and I was super impressed. The chicken was very good, the beans were fantastic with a smoky taste, and their tacos are so simple but hands down my favorite part. 

Thanks for making my life easy El Pollo."}
{"text":"Best idea of this year!  An El Pollo Loco in West Las Vegas!

They just opened and the place was PACKED.  I couldn't help but thinking that we would wait at least 20 minutes for our food. To my surprise, it came out in less than 10!  It was very, very quick.

Plenty of seating space.  Friendly empmloyees that come around asking if you need anything and they even come around with a tray when you're done eating with napkins, mints, toothpics, etc.

Its like a fast food restaurant with waitresses, but not really.

The food was awesome. I got the #7 Grilled Chicken Salad. It was awesome.  The mint-green dressing and the roasted corn on the salad was most memorable.

My friend got a Chicken Avacado Wrap and he thought it was good.

The drink choices are good.  They have the Low Calorie Lemonade from Minutemaid and then they also have CHERRY COKE!

I'll definately be coming back to this place soon."}

{"text":"DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU IN ANYTHING BIGGER THAN A COUPE!!!! I thought I was going to rip the side or front off my truck. Not sure who built this but it is INCREDIBLY tight. I actually rubbed the pole on the drivers side and got red paint on my truck. It was that or hit the retaining wall with the passengers side. Had to go up the curb and over the grass to get out. Looked back at the pole and the paint is removed on one side from everyone rubbing it with their vehicles. Chicken pieces are mediocre but really like their salads. Unfortunately,  I won't be going back because of the drive thru situation."}
{"text":"I have gone to this el polo loco many times in the last 8 years. Last night the food was bad. The avocado salsa was so watered down it barely had any taste at all. The coleslaw was heavily salted and the chicken had no flavor to it at all. The corn tortillas were perfect. And the house salsa was bland as well. So disappointed. The staff is always so friendly sure hope this was just an off night since this has been my favorite chicken place."}
{"text":"Food is okay. It's chicken. With tortillas. Expecting anything else is like picking your nose and hoping for gold. Average service, average food, average everything. Is it a boring Tuesday and you haven't had chicken for a while? Need to pick up dinner on the way home? Stop by. Oh wait, it's a busy intersection."}
{"text":"No issues yet. The chicken was good. My first time eating there. Going back today. Descent customer service... young kids working there...you know what to expect. My only criticism is, not as much food as I expected."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about El Pollo Loco for quite some time now. I'm excited that one is open close to my house. I tried it today for the first time and had the double chicken avocado salad. All of the ingredients were super fresh and the salad was huge...a very filling and satisfying lunch! I love that they have so many options that are under 500 calories and I can't wait to try more. For a new business the service was also excellent and the person who took my order was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!  After standing in line for nearly 15mins just to order, they kept messing up my order.  The three people that ordered after me ended up getting their orders when they haven't even started on mine yet.  I was there for over 25 mins before they even considered to get started on my order.  I ended up cancelling my order in fear that I would be late for work.   Another customer ended up asking me if the service is normally this bad...  I told him I had no idea,  that it was also my first time at this location.  I ended up eating nothing on on my lunch break so I could make it back to work."}
{"text":"The women working the drive through window on saturday 2/17 at 2pm was the most kindest wonderful women. She made sure my experience was the best it could be.

This chicken sucked"}

My food taste great and it's nice and hot"}
{"text":"The worst ever. Chicken overcooked, avocado on salad completely brown (spoiled). Returned avocado and gave slices already sliced and wrapped in plastic. It was also brown. Never Had A Terrible Experience at other places. Cold tortilla. They need help."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner for kids tonight. They were out of chicken nuggets before 5 pm and mentioned they are \"phasing out\" the French fries on their menu so they didn't have any at the time. Every visit lately it seems like they are out of one thing or another. Not very reliable. Customer service is great, but the food is going down hill."}
{"text":"They were doing so good I'm not sure if they changed cook or what but the food just isn't like it was in the beginning."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time with a coworker for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered off their value menu which ranged from $1 to just under $2. I got a salad, chicken leg, and a small taco for around $3 - not a bad price, especially if you're low on funds or just cheap.

The people were really friendly and had our orders out right away. I liked that they had a little salsa bar with lemons and peppers that you could take to go... not a bad option for a nice quick lunch!"}
{"text":"For fast food, this place hits it out of the park. First off, the counter space, drink station and salsa bar are always clean. Service is prompt and courteous. As you might guess, (el POLLO loco) their specialty is chicken - \"flame grilled,\" though I've never looked for the flames, personally. They offer all kinds of applications from whole chickens (wings, thighs, legs, etc.) to sandwiches, to tacos, burritos and salads. 

Heads up: the street tacos are TINY. The burritos are dense (loaded with beans, rice and cheese). Today, I tried the new jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was good but lots of condiments: jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, southwest sauce, lettuce and pico de gallo that distracted from the chicken. Interesting bread - like a hybrid between cibatta and a Wonder bun. 

They boast a citrus-marinade which they also use on their beef. I don't know that I've ever tried their beef though... the chicken is moist and flavorful. Maybe, one day, I'll mix it up a bit!

Another cool thing about this place is: there are numerous options for combo \"sides\" including beans and rice but als fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and more!"}
{"text":"I have just encountered the worst service I have ever received in the entire time I have been a customer at El Pollo Loco and I plan on telling all my associates and family about it.  I am going to post this on your Facebook page and add it to Yelp.

My daughter and I decided to have El Pollo Loco for dinner, one of the few \"fast food\" places I eat, mainly because it is chicken and I can see it on grill cooking so I know exactly what I'm eating.  I usually order a 2pc dark with pinto beans and a salad. 

When we arrived at the drive through it was 6:37; there was a car backing out, I should have followed her.  At 6:39, I noticed a truck get in behind us, so we were stuck.  I looked at the clock it was 6:39 and the line was at a stand still.  I know that the service is not always quick during the dinner hour, but I didn't imagine that we would not pull out of he drive through until 7:11.

Each car in front of us took at least five (5) minutes to service and we were stuck, because once you are in the drive through line, you can't get \"out\" of the line.  

When at 7:02, we pulled up to the window; Brandon the window server was very casual and nonchalant.  He took our money and disappeared for six (6) minutes before he came back.  No apology for taking up more than 30 minutes of my time and when I stated to him that we were in line for over 30 minutes, he just laughed and said. \"Well, the car in front of you food totaled $78 (or 70 something).\"  

Huh? What did that have to with why we all had to wait, while we are stuck in a drive through with no method of escape?

I checked my bag and noticed that I didn't have the pico de gallo that I asked for, that took an additional that took an additional three (3) minutes, hence the time was now 7:11 when we drove off.

Where was the MOD or the shift supervisor?  Why didn't somebody come out and explain that they were experiencing unexpected delays, they ran out of chicken, they were training a new crew? Something would have made the wait more understandable. 

Horrible customer service.  I have lived in Las Vegas for over 15 years and El Pollo Loco became one my favorites instantly and anybody who knows me will tell you that I eat there almost weekly.  

They have now lost a very loyal customer.

Thank you for your time.

{"text":"I tried to order 12 breasts via the drive-thru, and the woman's voice on the speaker told me simply \"I can't give you twelve breasts\" as if there was a rule against it.  This was a large order, but not so large that it shouldn't be fillable on demand.

We debated it for a little bit through the speaker, and she then said that if I were to wait 20 minutes, she would be able to fill my order.  There were other things as well, and a 20 minute wait in a drive-thru doesn't work, so I went inside to order.

When I arrived, the same woman told me that \"if I sell you 12 breasts, then I don't have any chicken to sell other people.\"  She actually explained to me that \"chickens only have two breasts.\"  I instantly felt like she did not want MY business. 

Let me take this forum to explain something to the woman who dealt with me:  YOU SELL CHICKEN.  WHEN SOMEONE COMES INTO THE STORE TO BUY IT, YOU SELL IT TO THEM.  YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THAT SELLING IT TO THEM WOULD BE BAD.

I've never had someone ACTIVELY discourage me from spending money in their establishment.  Thankfully I don't live in this area.  I would not visit this store again."}

{"text":"I don't consider conversations with employees a review but whatever floats your boat.  I love El Pollo Loco. Their twice grilled burritos are great. They are stuffed with good chicken and all the good fix ins. The sides are decent. The chips are good with a salsa bar to choose your salsa. I like that their are lots of choices for entrees and sides which is convenient. For being a fast food mexican, it  is fresh and is a staple for my family. Its healthier than Taco Bell and doesn't give you explosive diarrhea."}

I said legs & thighs please. He turned arround talked to the cook, i cant really hear what they were talking about, BUT i have clearly heard the cook said IT'S OK. Got my order legs&thighs with they lovely salsa. I was curious  while im driving back home, what was that \"IT'S OK\" about??? Told my wife to look at the receipt & i was charged for breasts instead of legs&thighs. Came back talked to the cashier & the Manager returned $2 & she appologized.
This is not about the returned money $2 only, c'mon! Its about service & BE HONEST TO YOUR GUEST!
Got home 5 minutes after that, After smelling the deliciousssnesss of the chicken in the car and hungry stomach : got really dry dry dry,small legs&thighs at home :( 

The rice,beans was good & the salsa was bomb! Here is why i gave them 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"The food at this location is really good, it's better than any other in Vegas. That's why I came back. I would have given 5 if the service wasn't horrible. 

I are el pollo loco thru 2 pregnancies lol. I know a good one from a bad one.  The food here is good. 

The service on the other hand stinks. yes, that's the only word I can use to describe it that isn't inappropriate lol. The first time we came here they were rude in the drive thru and not so much at the window. The salads were really fresh tho and the food was yummy. 

Tonight, when I ordered the girl was kinda rude but, not too much. I know they were really busy and I understand that. I've been in the service industry since childhood ( my parents made us all work). Anyway, age hands me my drink, takes my $, gives me the change and slams the window shut. No Ty or good night  etc...

Then she's looking at me like I'm stupid because I'm still sitting in the drive thru. You know that \" WTH does she want look\"? I know it lol!!! She finally opens the window and I say \" you didn't give me my food\". She literally bent over to look in my car like I was hiding it or something. Then, she turned away quickly she looked panicked. She never said one word. Not, sorry, my bad... Nothing at all. Then this lil jerk comes up dark hair glasses and hands me the bag. I ask for green sauce. He says I put the dressing in there. I said \" no green sauce\" he says \"you mean avocado salsa?\". Obviously, you know what I meant dip sh&t. I don't say it tho... I just think it. He hands me two tiny green sauces turns his back to me and starts conversing with his coworker. 

Where are your damn manners? I don't care how old you are. My daughters 11 and she knows to say please and thank you to everyone. I said \" thank you very much, have a good night\" and he turned towards me his back was to me the entire time and he said \"yeah bye\". 

My daughter went into the store. She had to use the restroom so, I gave her $ to buy a coke. I didn't want them to think that she's a free loader. I drove around to pick her up and she was so angry. Lol. She said \" omg they were so ride to me\" I said \" me too\". 

What can you do, right? Just write a review on yelp to let out your frustrations lol. 

Ps. The food was really good again."}

{"text":"One thing I miss about AZ is El Pollo Loco...yum. Love the marinated chicken tacos I make-and it reminds me of my childhood. Not bad for fast food chicken."}
{"text":"Well since El Pollo Loco has not returned a phone call I asked them to send I will just give them a blast on Yelp.
About two weeks ago a coworker and I stopped at One of their locations near the Scottsdale Airpark.
We had both ordered a three piece meal. 
Now I've never had a problem with any of the locations I've ever stopped at before their chicken is always been nice and tender. And the food has been very good. 
Due to time constraints we got our food to go as we were headed back to our office.
The chicken received that day it was dry and crunchy and very overcooked. I could barely eat the chicken I had received, ended up tossing most of it in the trash. I commented on the survey on the receipt that the food was unsatisfactory and that I wanted the manager to give me a call. This was approximately two weeks ago and they have still not called me back. It is because of this reason I will I will never spend any money in any of their restaurant again. If they do not care how the consumers feel about their food and the customer service why should I spend my hard-earned money and their establishment.

Sept 19. Well after posting my comments on Yelp I finally heard from El Pollo Loco. They sent me a form to fill out. In which I told them about my experience. I received a phone call from one of the managers named Nick. Told him what happened. He told me they would make it right. I went in on Sept 18th for lunch after contacting Matt and they took care of me. The food was all that I expected it to and of the quality that I have come to know and love from ElPollo Loco. 
Thank you Nick and Matt. I will return to your fine establishment."}
{"text":"I've grown to not expect much from fast food restaurants, but a basic level of integrity in the food they produce should come standard. 
I ordered two crunchy chicken tacos and a BRC burrito. I can't fault this location for doubling the price of a BRC burrito which is a no frills bean and rice burrito that is designed to be cheap. Double the price makes it less worth it but my gripe is with the tacos.
Broken shells, lukewarm ingredients, and a general lack of care by the staff earns this location 2/5.
I could at least eat the food even if I don't fully trust the way it was prepared by people who don't care if I can actually eat the $10 meal I've purchased."}
{"text":"Ms sable was kind and helpful in my order, but somehow i have to wait few minutes on line cause was like 4 customers ahead of me. Service should be faster bun bun and bun, Lol . I will comeback for sure , also the chicken is portions are decent!! Not like the location in decatur and flamingo there are ridiculous."}
{"text":"I always go to pollo loco i love the salads here but two nights ago i was upset with the service.  I ordered a bowl and upgraded to a meal because i wanted tortillas and as well as added corn , this was druve thru around 10pm . When i got home i was upset and annoyed because you guys didnt give me my tortillas which i paid extra for as well as the corn in my bowl."}
{"text":"If you want to get some food but don't want to settle for being a \"dollar menuaire\", the crazy chicken is the place to go. I've had my fair share of encounters with crazy chicken:
-my brother was once bitten in the arm by a chicken, and soon was able to lay eggs
-after finding inspiration in a pleasantly plump mother clucker, my great uncle's dogs previous owner did (what was in his time) the first ever recorded \"chicken dance\"
-I once took advice from a chicken in Wisconsin, and after pulling over to ask for directions, found myself in Canada.

Don't be weary. The two piece breast and wing meal (with a drink of course) is better than getting the best parking spot at work, and remembering when you leave ('cause everyone knows when you get that good spot and forget it SUCKS!). Help yourself to the freshly chopped/diced/picked/squeezed salsa bar while you're at it! Might as well....

You may need some extra tortillas, it's OK! they're only fifty cents!

The service is so slow.  Like expect to wait 20 minutes.  Is this a gourmet restaurant - or fast food?  Maybe if the foot was edible it would be worth it. 

But alas, the food is terrible.  Not once, not twice, but the five or six times I have eaten here in the past 3 years.  The chicken is ok, and that's why they got two stars.  Anything else, beans, avocados, even the chips are gross.  My favorite item (at other el polo locations) is the avocado burrito.  Here no good.  Cold chicken and beans and grainy avocado is not what I wanted.  

Ugh.  I wish someday a new owner would take over this location and make it like the chain was designed to be."}

Double check your orders... an employee helping put my order together assured me I had gravy for my mashed potatoes.

Consuelo in the back needs to smile and be more polite, same with Andrea at the register. Last, they ran out of lemons. Not coming back here!"}

{"text":"I probably should have checked the rating before going in but, live and learn. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the staff is nice and fast. The food is garbage and the presentation was ridiculous! The avocados in my grande chicken AVOCADO bowl were brown and mushy. When I asked for new ones they gave me nice, fresh, green avocados. Why would you even sell the bowl with nasty avocados?! That's the whole reason I ordered the bowl. Before all that, I had to drain the bean and corn water out of my bowl because I didn't order soup. God forbid the company should buy slotted spoons! Needless top say, won't be making that mistake again."}

Because of no soft chicken tacos I ordered the Taco Al Carbon and the husband ordered the El Tradicional burrito that was supposedly like the classic. We dug in since we were hungry and realized I prefer the old soft chicken tacos they used to have. Don't forget to grab salsa. My fave if the Avocado Salsa and Salsa Roja which is a little bit spicy. 

Overall good place to grab a quick bite. Still getting used to their new options on the menu. I love chicken so I really like this place."}

{"text":"Before last night, I had never eaten nor considered eating at any Pollo Loco. A couple of friends brought some over to my house last night.
Their chicken was not as I expected. It was roasted, moist, not a lot of salt (which I like), and it came off the bone very easily. It was very good. Then I saw all of the little condiment containers. There were stacks of them. There was salsa verde, pico de gaillo, containers of just onions, and some others that I can't remember. 
Then I saw the big sides. Excellent mac and cheese, great mashed potatoes with gravy, and there was also baked beans, which I didn't try.
They also had sweet tea, and rice milk (which I tried for the first time, and liked.)
I will go on record, and say that if my friends bring over more Pollo Loco, then I will eat it."}
{"text":"Me and the other homies in the hood were quite delighted when we learned (a few years ago) that the old gas station  on this corner was being replaced with an El Pollo. 

Why? Because there aren't enough Mexican fast food places in this neck of the woods? Hardly.

Because it's a healthier, tasty alternative to the usual fried stuff? Maybe, but you can trot into pretty much any grocery store and grab a rotisserie chicken, a tub of salsa and a pack of tortillas. You'll have a lot more of basically the same food for a lot less dinero.

No, kids, we were delighted because of the flan. And anyone who knows flan knows that, for whatever mysterious, inexplicable reason, EPL has the best flan anywhere. 
Make that HAD.

Drove on thru a couple of days ago, put in my order for whatever I had a coupon for, and added on a request for my favorite dessert, only to be told \"I'm sorry. We don't have flan anymore\".

Wha wha WHAT?? \"You mean, you ran out\"? \"No. We don't have it anymore\".

I am still in shock. What corporate dumbass made the decision to eliminate the best thing on the menu? What's next? Those greasy little deep fried tacos at Jack in the Box?  Only reason they got any stars was because the guy working the window agreed with me wholeheartedly. It was his only reason for going to work each day.  

Don't worry, bro. They will probably lose enough customers now that you will have to find another job anyway."}

{"text":"I have got to say we got here on Oct 21 and I have ate at the Pollo Locos at least 7 times since, and it does not disappoint. I always get 4 pc chicken with 2 sides usually slaw, pinto beans, flour tortilla s. Delicious, make your own tacos and all the fresh salsas freshly made on counter to get as much as you want. They gave me a senior card with large drink $10.22 not bad. Chicken is so good, you want to eat it all encluding the skin."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican food but it's gotten worse over the years, quality and price. It's too expensive to get barely any meat and the food is honestly not good quality anymore. Yeah I like that it's grilled before my eyes but it's nothing special, at that point, Cafe Rio looks like luxury dining. I'll go elsewhere unless offered or good deals."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh great tasting grilled chicken and friendly professional service DO NOT visit this El Pollo Loco. Chicken and potatoes were so old and dry we couldn't eat them. Asked for salad dressing on the side, didn't receive any dressing. When I returned with the entire uneaten order and receipt, I was laughed at instead of receiving an apology. The only funny part was when she said they've never had any complaints. ( guess they don't read these reviews). There are so many places to spend your money on for a meal, I definitely DO NOT recommend wasting it here. Only reason I gave one star is there isn't an option for none"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here the food was ok. Standard family meal (mash and gravy, mac and cheese as the sides). It was fine. Second time was on a Friday night. It took them more than a half hour to move through a line of 6 cars. It was maybe 7:30.  Larger family meal this time, with the aforementioned sides some slaw. Chicken was fresh enough (probably because they had to fetch it from the farm and go from there given the time delay), but the side containers were just barely more than half full. And the slaw was just dry cabbage with no dressing at all. Gross. No straws were provided for the drinks we ordered. Two stars here and the second star is solely because of the prior meal that was average at best. Step it up people."}
{"text":"CLEAN,GREAT customer service Best fast food place,  Love coming here,"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for buy 1 2 piece and get 1 free.  The chicken was so dry, I couldn't eat it.  I didn't want to say anything because I have been there before and it was better.  I think when they have coupons they make too much chicken and it just sits and gets hard."}
{"text":"Never been to one of these before but thought I would give it a try. Had the double chicken bowl. The chicken was dry and the bean/corn/cheese portions for the \"bowl\" were not adequate. I just wasn't impressed at all. Added a small side of mac. At least that was enjoyable. Probably won't got back again."}
{"text":"I HATE giving bad reviews...its doesn't give me any pleasure or joy but sometimes it needs to be done. 

My family rolled in here today for our favorite crazy chicken. They took our order for the 10 piece combo meal with 3 sides (coleslaw, pinto beans and french fries) and lots of tortillas (that's what we usually order). All goes off well. We find a booth and chill out for a few minutes, then a few minutes becomes a lot of minutes. People behind us got their orders before us (the orders were the same size as ours)..so we began to wonder. Sure enough...we go up to check on it and they had lost/forgotten our order. They were super apologetic about it and brought it out on the double. The food was cooked to perfection and they even threw in some extra tortillas to make up...that's why they are getting two stars (food quality and willingness to admit their mistake). I will be back again and hopefully I can up them to what should be at least a 4 star review (Yay! I'm a fan)."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Love the grilled chicken. Not greasy and full of flavor.

Fast food that's not really fast food. We got the family meal deal and every part of it was delicious. If the potatoes ARE boxed, then it sure as heck fooled me cause it was thick and tasted like home made mashed potatoes. Complete with salad and corn cobs too. We pounded that meal like it was the last one on earth. Well, for us Hawaiians, it was, at El Pollo Loco anyway. :)

The cinnamon rice drink was also delish! It was like drinking a churro. 

Great stuff. We'll definitely go back for more when we get back to the mainland."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their Pollo Bowl!  The avocado salsa made it taste even better!  I am never disappointed when I get take out from here"}
{"text":"Tried to get a simple 8 piece family meal breast and thighs and was told sorry but it would be 45 minutes so i asked to get a mixed meal combo and was told there would be a wait on that as well although not as long. How can a chicken resturant that serves pretty much nothing but variations of different chicken meals not have chicken? That blows my mind.  I would understand if they were busy or it was close to closing but it was 8 pm and they still have three hours to be open and this is not the first time i went to this location and was told the same thing. I Like there food but someone in managment needs to give there employes better guidence on food prep or maybe someone from corperate should come in and give this location some help as it doesnt look like this location is rated very well. Front end employee was very nice and apologetic.  Dont think i will give this location a 3rd try.  :("}
{"text":"With relatively few fast late night options in this shopping center, we decided to drive through the El Pollo Loco for a late night meal. They were out of breast and wings, so we ended up ordering a family meal with legs and thighs. Upon opening our package, we were immediately annoyed that they didn't include plastic silverware with our order. Famished, we decided to just use the tortillas as makeshift utensils for the beans and sides. Upon ripping open a thigh, I noticed that it wasn't quite cooked inside. I moved onto a piece of leg, only to discover it was nearly raw inside as well. Nearly every piece we got was not suitable to eat due to being undercooked. With the risk of food poisoning,  you'd think that a place that specializes in chicken would be extra careful in making sure their food was fully cooked. I threw everything in the bag and drove back to the restaurant.  The only reason I gave this review two stars instead of one is because they gave us a prompt refund with no questions asked. This will surely be my last time at this location, which is a shame because I generally love El Pollo Loco as a go to place. (This was my first and Last time to patronize this particular location)"}
{"text":"The drive thru here is super busy sometimes. Which can be annoying when you want your fast food fast lol but hey it happens! They are typically pretty fast despite the line so thats good. 

Its a great option for those who don't want fried stuff all the time. I usually get the pollo bowl. Tasty! Lol"}
{"text":"one star only because their chicken is on point.  the salsa bar was a disgrace!  the cilantro was yellow, wilted & rotting.  the salsa was spoiled to the point that you could smell it! I brought it to the managers attention, asked her if she had fresh cilantro, she showed me the pitcher that had the same sad looking cilantro and said it was fresh.  wtf? and when I told her she needed to change out the salsa, she said it was fine.  I told her she was gonna get people sick, she rolled her eyes and disappeared to the back and never came back out.  SAD! ALERT, WHERE ARE THE FOOD SAFETY INSPECTORS!?"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of El Pollo Loco, the meal I ordered today was a disappointment. The Mango Chicken Bowl, it was my first and last. The problem, I live four miles away from the location, when I arrived home and opened the lid I did not see mangoes. I was disappointed but I know this can happen, it gets left out. The clincher, the 1/2 TBSP of micro mango was at the bottom of the bowl. When I say micro, the pieces were so small I thought it was corn. Don't even bother calling it a mango bowl if this is the amount one will get The second disappointment was the amount of chicken, if there was a 1/2 cup I would be surprised. I was hungry one hour later, and the $6 bowl did not do it for me

The good, they use a spring salad mix, and there was a generous amount of salad. The drive thru was efficient and I received my food within minutes. This  franchise does not have the long lines that I have seen at the Craig location. When I return, I will stay with the grilled chicken, it is what the do best!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, the staff were friendly, and the food was acceptable Mexican Fast food as expected."}
{"text":"Always make sure to ask for your salad dressing a dozen times before you leave! Beyond annoying that every time I have come to this location and ordered a grilled chicken salad they ALWAYS forget the dressing!!! Get with it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just got home - he ordered his 2 quesadillas which were made fine.. And I had ordered 2 of the shrimp tacos and the chicken avocado al carbon 3 taco platter.. I got ONE tiny ass taco!!!! And to make the trip worse, whoever originally took our order (only lady not in a hat, possibly a manager? Dark hair and maroon shirt) when we got to the window - she legit just walked away and left the next female (glasses) to take care of us.. She seemed confused just as we were.. Asked if we had our drink already like no ? We JUST pulled up. Communication here is visibly horrible and I'm PISSED that my order was messed up. We were on our way somewhere and didn't have time right now to go back. It wasn't even busy and we were the ONLY ones in the drive thru line. Unacceptable!!!! And let me add (photo was posted) a dog gone chicken bone - sharp, almost made its way down my throat. Never again will we return here!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the drive thru at 7:45, got to the speaker at 8:00 and started ordering but was asked to wait a second. 8:05 comes around and I finish ordering and the lady says it will be a 30-40 minute wait time. 1 hour for fast food chicken is unacceptable. If you know you are running low on chicken: 
A. Make some more before you run out
B. Let all the people in the drive thru know it will be an hour wait for the only thing you have on the menu. 
Sadly this is not the first time this has happened here, but last time was closer to closing time so that's why I gave this place another try. 
100% avoid this El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"Absolutely torture trying to order here. Either it was her first day on the job, OR she was smoking some drugs before going to work. All we wanted was a 12 piece chicken family meal for $24.29 comes with warm tortillas and 3 sides. But when you talk to her she's all confused asking if we got the special meal, asking if we wanted an extra side even though it says 3 I repeat THREE SIDES, then she says sorry no salad even though we NEVER said salad, never said special. Had to repeat everything 3 times, spent almost 10 minutes just saying the order, until finally someone else stepped in to complete the order. They get 2 stars for at least getting the order right. Good luck trying to order anything here."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the chicken tacos, the side salad with cilantro dressing, and the chips and salsa bar.  It all changed today when I ordered the shrimp and avacado quesadilla...  Oh man, was that tasty!  I loved it...perfect little grilled tortilla with goodness packed inside...The shrimps are good sized and grilled...delicious!  I'm going back tomorrow for more!"}
{"text":"Very rude staff! Told us they were all out of chicken only because they didn't want to reclean the grill at night. Kind of ridiculous considering there name is el Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"el pollo loco lo que tiene de loco son las cochinas locas que trabajan la foto esta muy linda pero todo es mentira pagas por un pollo y te dan 4 patas ni que fuera un caballo y 2 entremuslos y un hueso y la pechuga  se la qudan y los platos dan asco lo tiran todo como puercas  harriba de la ensalada y el nacho es lo mas asqueroso que e mirado en mi vida la foto tinene 3 pedasos de aguacate y te dan un pedasito por la mitad y eso es todo de lo frijoles lo mas con agua que e comido las tortillas cuando la calente en mi casa por 1milla que me fui estaban  firas se pusieron dura como palo menos mal que mis dientes son naturales o los pierdo y comi sin mirar porque tenia hambre y al final me tome un sal de fruta  para los gases porque antes que llegara al stomago ya estaba  dando buelta  $21. dolares + tax y era asquerosamente servido soyy una prfesional de lasescuala culinary de las vegas 1ro aunque la comida no tenga sabor la presentaction es lo mas importante ellos se quedaron atras 1ro como asquersos los boy a reportar a l canal  13 el miercoles a las 11:am para una impection  los mejicanos son unos cochinos '''''NO''''  FUE EL  Restaurante del Pollo Loco de Raimbow fue  EL RESTAURANT EL  POLLO LOCO AN Warm Spring y Eastern .

{"text":"Great enthusiasm!  I love the crew here!

I must admit, not EVERY time, is it a 5-star....sometimes the chicken is dry.  But who cares, they are lovely people working there and they GET IT! Service with a smile and if anything problematic they handle with grace.  Hooray EPL!"}
{"text":"Decided to go through drive thru.I order a #1 2 piece meal chicken breast had no skin on it.ordered a chicken tostada salad, there was NO lettuce nothing but red cabbage in my salad.also ordered 3 crunchy chicken tacos AGAIN NO LETTUCE! Nothing but red cabbage!"}
{"text":"I love the food, the employees and the location. If you have a special order such as their BRC (beans, rice and cheese) burrito and want the cheese on the side, they accomodate you. FYI if you are vegetarian /vegan the beans and rice contain ZERO animal products. 

This is the only place that I purchase my fresh made corn and flour tortillas. 

Also the employees here are very courteous and if there is a problem they quickly resolve it.

My husband and I enjoy their desserts."}
{"text":"Updating my review as I came back here a few weeks later and the professionalism and customer service has completely changed. My cashier was patient and explained menu items asked me politely my preferences. No snarky attitudes this time around. Service with a smile is always appreciated!"}
{"text":"A great idea for a healthier version if fast food.  Ordering was fast, food was ready quickly, the 3 stars is due to lack of taste and staff personality (or lack there of). 

I would definitely return as I appreciates the healthier choice...but I will bring some seasoning."}
{"text":"My \"chicken and street corn bowl\" was nothing short of embarrassment. The chicken was green and the corn was cold. Very disappointed. This is the third meal in a row that has been disgusting when I used to love this place. What happened? Labor, management, food source?"}
{"text":"My favorite place for chicken since I was a kid. Grow up in Cali and was so happy vegas had one."}
{"text":"I was really excited to have a El Pollo Loco near my home. I have been to the restaurant twice and I am nt sure if I will return or not. The employees are friendly and the service is fast. Both times my chicken was VERY dry. The flavor was good but what was left over could never be re-heated. I liked the creamy mac and cheese, the corn and the coleslaw and that is what got this review up to 3 stars. I might give it one more try but It is not cheap to get chicken and sides and find the chicken is dry. Think I might try the salads some people commented on."}
{"text":"This location has come a long way since it first opened. I stopped coming here for several months because they were always getting my order wrong and this always happened in the drive-thru and never inside. After some time went by I decided to give them another try after I received some coupons in the mail and figured I'd go inside and eat since previously I had no luck in the drive-thru getting the right order. My order was not only correct when I went inside, but tasted really good and when it's good like that, I hardly remember that I am in a fast food joint. I've been back several times and they accept the coupons I present with no problem and even my order has been correct when going through the drive-thru. Problem is consistency. Sometimes It's hot, fresh and tasty while on occasion the chicken is on the colder side. 

Original Pollo Bowl ($5) - This is the best value on the menu currently. Get it as a combo (still $5 even if you don't want the combo) and it comes with a small drink and side of hot tortillas. The bowl as fire-grilled chicken, onions, beans, rice, cilantro and pico. Filling and affordable! 

Ultimate Double Tostada Salad ($7.49) - When you feel like something more filling and with a few more extras, this should do this trick. This one has all the same things the original pollo bowl has, but the chicken is double in portion and with the addition of shredded cheese, sliced avocado and sour cream it's really good. The creamy cilantro dressing is very good!!! All this goodness is put inside a crunchy tostada shell that doesn't taste bad either. 

They have Cherry Coke from the fountain and drinks are free refills if you are eating inside. One improvement this location could make is not running out of chicken. I have stopped by between 6:30 - 8 pm and they have been out of chicken for the night. Not sure what's up with that, but when chicken is the main ingredient and you are out of it by dinner time yet staying open until 11 pm or later only serving rice and beans... well that is crazy."}
{"text":"Really?....tables not bussed...all of them dirty...staff goofing off. Dried up chicken....straight from the grill....NOT.  just horrible. Food stone cold. A total waste of $20. Never NEVER AGAIN at this location or any other."}
{"text":"Beginning in Mexico originally as a Roadside Chicken Stand, El Pollo Loco has come a long way since opening it's first American El Pollo Loco on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles (I think sometime in 1980)  In any event I love when I get to visit in Southern California & Arizona. That's when I get a chance to grab me some Pollo Loco !!   Such a different chicken place from the others !!   Their Fire Grilled Marinated process just makes the difference !!  So Many Sides to choose from, it's getting me hungry just writing this review.......

I have visited this location a few times during my visits and have always had good service.  They have Horchata here too !!!   Would be nice if they expanded the market to Washington State !!  (Hint, Hint.......)   I would definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Food is always good at this chain but the service here is awful!!! Every time I go through the drive thru they have some kid working and always forget a part of my order or the salsas or dressing I ask for!!! Check your food before leaving!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was ok, but the chicken on my blackened chicken torte was a little bland and my wife did not care for the very thick tortillas on her grande tacos.  Should have tried their mainstay, the grilled chicken plates which looked very good. Probably worth another visit."}
{"text":"This is great option for fast food- much healthier than a burger standard.  The drive through is quick and easy and the service is great.  Their creamy cilantro dressing is amazing as well as their avocado salsa which I like to put on everything.  This location is consistent and that will make us return."}
{"text":"* sigh*

I don't understand how it's possible for service to be this bad!? Every time. It never fails. When coming to this location you have to be prepared for either A. Waiting a ridiculous amount of time for your food or for drive-thru line to move or B. expect your order to be incorrect. These people have selective hearing or they just don't care. Very annoying!"}
{"text":"Went through dive through and ordered the tostada which is a salad that comes with dressing but got home and guess what,  NO Dressing!  Which means DRY salad,  yuck!  Now you'd think they would include the dressing without asking but no, ASK FOR THE DRESSING!  It's delicious woth the dressing!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I was trapped in the drive threw. The screen where you orders makes cracking noises. The girl mumbles and forgets she is taking my order. I can't get the hell out cause someone is in front of me. She says wait and I waited over 10 minutes. I didn't want to eat food made by such idiots"}
{"text":"I've been to many El Pollo Locos. This one is one of the best. It's clean and modern. The employees are friendly and fast. The food is fresh and tastes great. Awesome. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I rarely do fast food, but every now and then, I find it convenient, cheap, and oh so appealing, especially when fast food drive-thru windows exist!

So, on a recent Sunday, upon realizing that I had two hungry kids in the car and nothing too appealing at the house to eat, I made my way toward El Pollo Loco, entered the drive-thru, and within 10 minutes, was headed home with a feast for all!

I ordered a salad for myself, some chicken nuggets and sides of mac and cheese, corn, broccoli, and french fries for the kids.  However, I arrived home to find that they forgot to include the broccoli.  Bummer.

I liked my salad and the kids liked the nuggets and fries.  The other stuff, not so much, but there's always something that doesn't get eaten at my house with 2 little ones that are hit and miss picky eaters.  

I noticed El Pollo Loco offers some family style meals and everything is moderately priced, so I may just return again soon to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago when it was almost 10pm and a lot of places were closed, looking for a light meal to keep me from getting hungry later in the evening since I'm a night owl.  I ordered a small bowl of soup which happened to be on sale for about $1.59, a chicken tamale to try for $1.29 I think, and a drumstick off their value (99 cent) menu.  All three were delicious, hit the spot, and were the perfect amount of food for under $5 to tide me over.  I was especially impressed with the flavor of the soup, though it was served way to hot and I had to wait a long time for it to cool down enough to eat.

I went there again a few nights later because I got a craving for more of that chicken tortilla soup, this time ordering the larger size, still on sale, about $3.69 for a pretty big container.  I asked if they could not make it so hot this time, so it was my fault it cooled down to barely warm by the time I'd finished the $2.50 steak taco I got on the side.  I only intended to eat half the soup but it was so good I couldn't stop till I'd wiped out three fourths of it.  

It's handy having this place be so close to my motel.  Now that the weather is turning chilly I'll probably be back for more of that soup!

For the second time in one day I encountered a restroom that was out of TP, but here they responded quickly, with concern and apologies, with one of the clerks hurrying back immediately to remedy the problem, a far better reaction than I got at Stein Mart at Tempe Marketplace earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Greatest place to eat when trying to be healthy but want to have something fast. Very comfortable and clean when eating in the resturant. Everyone who works here is so friendly and makes us feel welcome.  My wife and I love coming here. Highly recommend this place especially if you like hormone free great tasting chicken."}
{"text":"This bow was the best! I am coming to El Pollo Loco 
Again. I never thought I would like this food this much!
The food was fresh looking and delicious!
I am trying the shrimp and chicken next time!"}
{"text":"This El pollo loco has the best set up I've ever seen for there salsa bar.  I should have taken a pic,  but I was in a hurry.  It's in a circle.   So if other people are at the bar, you don't have to wait behind them like your stalking them.   I got the new layered salad.  Then I layer more  I add a layer of there onions, then salsa, then cilantro, then to top it all off I put about 8 Serrano peppers to the mix.  The salad was ok.  And customer service was good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location 0 stars. Not only were they out of everything I tried to order in the drive through, I'm now stuck for over 20 min in the drive through and can't get out. Even if I did end up ordering food I would still be losing my mind at how slow they are."}
{"text":"First time at El Pollo Loco ever. Jose at the register was extremely friendly and helpful he knew the menu items very well. Food was very tasty and fresh. Everything was clean. Plenty of parking. I will definitely stop here again when in the area."}
{"text":"Food is good, but restaurant floors, tables, are filthy!!  Makes me questioned if I want to continue eating here.  This place has gone down hill in the past year."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed.  We went at dinner time 600 on Sunday just to be told they had limited chicken.  It's el Pollo chicken. How can you not have chicken?   We had to leave so I suggest you call first to make sure they have chicken.  Their food is good as long as they have it available."}
{"text":"We love pollo loco but this pollo loco never seems to have tortilla soup after 9pm! It's just disappointing when that's what you went for at the moment..."}
{"text":"It was a bad experience.  We walked in and it s freezing inside.  The salsas, even though they say are fresh were more like tomato sauce instead of spicy salsas. The tables were dirty.  The service was \"where\".  The condiment table was dirty. Don't have their enchiladas, it tastes like tomato powder.  I thought it would be better!!"}
{"text":"After binge-watching Breaking Bad and thinking of El Pollo loco during each episode that 
Los pollos hermanos was on, I became obsessed with eating at el pollo loco after a long time had passed that I had not eaten there. I ate one of thier bowls, very tasty and I love the fresh ingredients used."}
{"text":"By far this is the slowest pollo loco in the world. We had to wait around 23 minutes in order for us to get our order through the drive-through. This will be the only and last time that I ever come to this location."}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased since I work here, but the fajita burritos and quesadillas are awesome, great place to work and great people to work with! Yammie is the best manager ever!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place f*cks up your food more than they get it right. \"Why don't you complain to a manager?!\" You ask? Well because by the time you get your food home all you want to do it eat it and not worry about arguing with an idiot. We generally deal with a scenario like the food is good but not what I ordered. The most frequent offense is ordering a breast combo and getting totally shafted for a thigh. Which if you're a white meat person, a thigh is totally unacceptable. Including photographic evidence in case EPL monitors this."}
{"text":"This seemed like the place to be when we came here for lunch. The line was so long to put in your order and we waited about 15mins to get our order. The only reason I came here was for their chicken and sweet corn cake...mMm. Too bad the closest one to me back home is Oakland =("}
{"text":"I have found El Pollo Loco food to be fairly consistent no matter the location.  This was my first visit to this particular one.  I went around 7:30 and the dining area was fairly full and so was the waiting area.  In fact, I was a little confused as to where the line to order started because of the crowd waiting for their orders to be ready.  And I wasn't the only one as someone that came in after me had the same problem.  Maybe they were short staffed that night but otherwise I would expect they know their busy times and should be prepared for them as far as staffing and having chicken ready.  The girl running the register was very apologetic about the wait, and I witnessed another customer receive free dessert for the inconvenience, not to mention a couple customers state that their orders were wrong when ready.  I ordered an 8 piece chicken only, no sides, and probably waited at least 30 minutes.  I don't think I will return to this location again."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!! They never have anything!!! Every single thing I ordered they were out of! Then when I received my food it was not what I had ordered! Some of the workers were touching the chicken pieces with their bare hands!! And the little chicken that did make it to my plate was cold!!"}
{"text":"If I have to choose drive thru for dinner it is either In-N-Out or El Pollo Loco. There chicken is always cooked well and I love their seasoning/marinades. I usually only get the the thighs accompanied by a salad or just cole slaw and that is it. I do not venture too much, just an occasional order of the churros. The place has not let me down yet so I will keep this location in my rotation."}
{"text":"One of the only fast food places I frequent this is another stellar location. The staff is always friendly and my order is always right when using the drive thru. I make it a habit of stopping here when I'm hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is one of my favorite fast food lunch spots. Well it's only them and in-n-out that I frequent. The food is good but the drive through was designed way before cars were invented..yea I know it doesn't  make sense. You place an order and have to make a 90 degree turn to the window. Better off going inside and play it safe. I didn't hit the curb but 2 cars in front of me did."}
{"text":"This place have good food, but service is BAD. The supervisor \"Belen\" have time to look at her cellphone but no time to help the cashier. Line is always long. Every time I come here I get disappointed. Need to retrained supervisors. I don't like the other ladies that helps assemble the food you're so polite and nice hopefully Belen Learns from them"}
{"text":"Originally was suppposed to be an update for El Pastorcito because we had our minds set(Don't you HATE when that happens?) on their kick-ass Al Pastor Tacos(A good replacement for those of you who miss what Los Parados served up)Luckily, we called and found out they weren't open for business over the phone.

So El Pollo Loco was plan B....I'd never been, its close by, so WTH, let's go...
We pulled up and there was a traffic jam in drive thru. we step inside and its packed as well, and the chicken on the grilled smelled good...Grilled chicken combo it is!

I love me some legs and thighs(all you horn dogs get your minds out the gutter!) and the sides(corn cake, mash, slaw, beans, tortillas,etc) were aight...salsas were decent for a chain, but its all about  that crazy chicken!

IMHO, The Crazy Chicken Kicks BOTH the Colonel's(KFC) and the Bee's(Jolibee)a$$ses!.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tostada salad--which is new--is pretty tasty. Grilled chicken is less fatty than what you get at KFC. Pretty fast service. Now, in a safe, Summerlin location. Provecho!"}
{"text":"Today was definitely an off day for El Pollo Loco. I thought I was grabbing a quick lunch...well not today. If the food wasn't prepared so well I would have given them 2 stars. But the taste factor saved them. Maybe ill just use them for last minute catering and stick to something more typical for lunch like tropical smoothie or jack in the crack...today my friends you have given me the lunch time sad face :("}
{"text":"I went to EPL first long line in the drive thru .. I place my order for a two piece combo, then they tell me they only have chicken legs and thighs nothing else so I order 3 chicken legs and change my order to a 3 piece combo. I order rice and corn as my sides and then they say they are out of all their corn. I then change my choice for a side and order beans and they never acknowledge me. I then proceeded to the window to pay. When I get to the window the girl working the drive thru goes and gets the manager and the manager then tells me they have no chicken at all and there is a ten minute wait after it took for ever to order and for ever to wait in line !!!!  Get your restaurant together you should of informed me you had no chicken when I first pulled into your drive thru.. I Am so annoyed with this location . The only reason I go here is because it's the one closest to my house and when I do go their chicken is always burnt and they forget to put stuff in my bag it never fails!!! I like EPL but this location sucks don't waste your time going there."}
{"text":"Why bother asking for salsa in the drive-thru, when its rarely given? 3 times in a week. Last time I'm going to this place!"}
{"text":"This place keeps going down hill. You pay $7.00 for a Salad, at least fill it with the ingredient that even has the lowest Food Cost! I can see skimping on the Chicken and Shrimp but the lettuce? REALLY?!"}
{"text":"I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! They're always fast & polite AND THE FOOD IS FRESH AND DELICIOUS.. I was surprised to see the negotiate reviews. Sebastian assisted me today and he and the lady who gave me my food were super sweet. When I read the other reviews I just thought you can't make everyone happy! Honestly this restaurant is only one $ not $$. Great food for a great price! Better than a Big Mac! :)"}
{"text":"I love the food they serve here, very healthy and decent prize. I always get the grilled chicken, i believe this is the best chicken in town, i also love the new look of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the last week and it's been decent. Staff is friendly, food good. The dining area could use a bit more TLC but it hasn't been horrible. \"3.5\""}
{"text":"Six months ago i would have given this place 5 stars. I don't know if they changed managers or what. I used to eat here at least once a week and get the chicken meal combo, breast and wing with 2 side salads to keep it healthy. I haven't been in at least 6 weeks, so i was looking forward to it today. 
However, i forgot to double check the order and when i got back to my office I found they gave me a leg and thigh. I only eat breast meat. Not only was it super greasy, but there was hardly any meet on either piece. The tortillas were so hard and chewy. I suspect they were microwaved too long. Today's order was really disappointing.

This is the 3 rd time in the last few months they got my order wrong, which is why i stopped going so often. 

Be sure to check your order before pulling away."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The quality and the price were adequate. The salsa bar was definitely good when it comes to the options it brings."}
{"text":"Love their family dinner combo with the salad but the reason I'm on here to day is to give props to Lattrell!  I went in to order 2 dinner combos for a hungry crowd at home.  It was after work & they were slammed.  After ordering, I waited for about 5 minutes (not bad).  Well, whomever packed up my food just called my number & pointed to the bags on the counter.  I went home & started unpacking & realized, they didn't give me the 2nd dinner's chicken (about 12 pieces).  I called the restaurant & spoke with Latrell, explained the mess.  He immediately asked if I could go back there & pick up the rest of my order, well of course I could, I still had hungry people at home.  On my way to the restaurant, I received a call from home that we were almost out of rice.  I immediately called Latrell (on my hands free), and explained that I needed more rice too.  When I got there, he had  packed up the chicken I was missing, an additional container of  12 pieces of chicken & 2 containers of the rice, all compensated for having to go back down.  Before I got my food, he showed me what was in each container.  Great  management move!"}
{"text":"Today was a nightmare. No chicken available, only breasts, when running your specials. Never had a problem with this El Pollo Loco until today. On top of that my breast was not fully cooked...smh. Big waste of time here today."}
{"text":"They were kind enough to remake my order when it wasn't exactly as wanted. I have a picky eater at home and the original mistake was more from how I ordered so they didn't have to correct the mistake I made. I appreciate their courteous costumer service. The manager and rest of the staff did great."}
{"text":"This isn't even where I started out to go for lunch today.  I was driving down the road and it caught my eye.  I have eaten from here several times but this is the first time I have been in one of their restaurants.  Even though I like their chicken it seems like the order gets screwed up about half the time and I don't go back for a while.  Like many fast food places the order seems to be correct most of the time when eating in.  I had a breast with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw.  It comes with a couple of tortillas (flour or corn).  I tried the salsa and spicy avocado from their salsa bar, neither was great but both edible.  I have had better Horchata but again it was ok.   For $8.20 total with drink I was happy.

The restaurant inside was clean and the staff friendly.  Being a beautiful day outside I would liked to have sat on the patio.  Here is where they lost a star, the tables looked liked they had not been cleaned in several days and the patio trash bin was way too full.

I am sure I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Literally went there 45min ago and ordered togo. They didnt have any cilantro or onions at the salsa bar so i asked for some in my bag... they didnt give me any... i ordered the family meal 8pc family deal with the bacon avocado salad and they didnt give me my salad. I tried calling 3 times they dont even answer. Wth. I wanted my salad so badly... and im 20min away so i cant go there, its too far... this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went to El Pollo Loco with some friends for lunch and saw they have new burritos on the menu, so I decided to try the Poblano,  it was a good size burrito, don't really need a combo meal with it cuz it's a meal in its self, it has chicken, avocado, rice, beans, corn, cilantro, onions and cheese with salsa wrapped in a gold wrapping (um kinda like Chipotle). The flavor was good and I would have it again but looking forward to trying the other new ones in their line up! Good lunch choice!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location at least a dozen times over the past 2 years. They have always done me right. Great food and good service. Prices seem fair to me for what you get. 
Sure one could make it all at home for less, but it is a restaurant. They have people to pay, overhead costs, etc.. Worth every cent, in my opinion.
I have seen a lot of bad reviews for this location and I have to say that I am confused by the attitudes of some of these reviewers.

My advice to those people, a little politeness and patience goes a long way. Try it next time."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 4 times in the past 30 days and have ordered the exact same menu item from the same cashier. Each time I have needed to speak to the person handing me the food and have them correct the order because I received a completely different item, sometimes not even from the same section of the menu. At this point chance cannot be a factor and it must be general incompetence from the staff.  Thankfully the manager was able to refund my money, but this will be my final visit to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the ranchero burrito and requested no rice. I repeated it during my order and then I asked again when I was handed my food.No rice, right? Yes no rice. Well, I should have bit into my burrito at the drive thru because it was chock full of pinchi rice. Unfortunately, I had to find this out when I settled in at home. I looked at the receipt and it even had no rice listed on it. Idiots!"}
{"text":"I had a very large order. The lady behind the counter was very happy. She was very friendly had a large smile and when my order was finished she laid out all of the different parts of the orderon the counter and called me up to review all of the different parts of the order as she was bagging them I forgot to take one of the bags and she ran it out to my car so that I would not forget it. Excellent customer service. she repeated everything back to me as she was bagging it even the special requests everything was perfectly accurate.Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the staff were friendly but all of the tables were dirty...food remnants on them...and the trash was overflowing. I had to put my tray full of trash on top where you put the empty trays.  I didn't want to eat from the salsa bar because it looked like no-one had serviced it in a while and salsa was all over the counter area of the bar. It just didn't feel clean, almost like kids had been playing in it or something. That said, the food was pollo loco delicious and the staff were friendly. If they don't clean it up I will probably drive a little further to go to a clean one.  If they were clean and a little more on top of their dining area I would have given them a 4 or 5 star review."}
{"text":"This is another place I run into for a quick bite before my workout. I get the 3 piece meal with two sides plus a drink.  Always pretty quick and the food is fresh and still hot."}
{"text":"I have not been to a El Pollo Loco in AGES!!!  Got the 10pcs meal, mac/cheese, and beans.  Of course it came with tortillas (you choice:  flour or corn), we got corn.  I swear the chicken pieces got smaller?  It still taste good.  The place was dirty.  Most tables were not cleaned."}
{"text":"Not a great location, everything was old looking and tasting. Maybe because this is right by the mall? Either way, take the drive and visit another location."}
{"text":"So I had to eat here cause I was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital. I gotta admit what I had was not half bad for a fast food joint. I had their Spicy Chipotle Burrito. It had some kick to it and the flavor was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Huge dining area and food was pretty good. The salsa bar was full and clean. But the floor and bathrooms are pretty dirty. Not super dirty, but it looks old and dirty. But other than that not a bad place it's decent eat."}
{"text":"came in for a quick re-charge between jobs. 
ordered the double pollo bowl meal
and it was very good. 
the employees seemed a bit unfriendly and looked tired. 
besides that, everything else was kosher."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for an office luncheon, and was told they were not taking phone orders.  Jared was the person that took the call.  I informed him that I was sending in someone else to pick the food up and asked if he could at least write it down so that when the other person came in, they would know what they were getting.  Everything was on point!  She went to pick up the food and said everyone was very nice in assisting her to get what I had ordered.  The food was delicious, and plenty of it!  The Churros....delicious!!!  Very happy today for such a nice change to the typical food in Ahwatukee.  Will be back for more office luncheons for sure!"}
{"text":"As soon as I turned 16 I walked up the road to apply at Wendy's Hamburgers where I spent six months toasting buns, smearing mayonnaise, and multitasking like mad as a drive through attendant. The worst of it was dismantling the gigantic salad bar which had about 55 tubs of salad fixings plus as much ice as three cattle troughs. The second worst of it was when my friends chose to steal all the signage and got busted by my feisty manager who then forced me to call my friends to return the loot. Through the sweat and slipping on fryer grease, my fondness for Wendy's blossomed well beyond my love of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger. 

But now my fast-food preference is leaning toward El Pollo Loco, mostly because they serve chicken and it's healthy. The chicken salad is basic and satisfactory, which I like. Real grilled chicken is delicious. The salsa is fresh and the employees at this store are generous with it. The chicken tortilla soup is probably one of the best I have ever had. 

At first I was afraid of El Pollo Loco because I thought it might be like Taco Bell or, worse, Carl's Jr (the brand color palettes are similar). 

El Pollo Loco food is good. The drive through is fast. And they take debit cards. A meal for three is $23 or less. What more can you ask for from a fast-food restaurant? Maybe a little more veggies on the salad, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This El Pollo Loco is always clean, with friendly customer service as well as fast and efficient. The food is always hot and delicious. The restrooms are clean and stocked. The wait for the food once it is ordered is very minimal. The workers take pride in their job as its not easy to work in fast food; too often they are given negative feed back instead of positive. I would recommend going to this location if in the area or if you live nearby, as you won't be disappointed. ****We usually order the family meal and it is so yummy. El Pollo Loco knows how to season their chicken :)"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. The wait is ridiculous, I had to pull out of drive through because I waited over 15 minutes and no cars were moving. I go inside to order my food and they are out of fajitas and chicken breast. Chose a different bowl and they still got it wrong. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Food as always is superb ... guadalupe however at the cashier is not only beautiful but also very friendly and great with her customer service skills..."}
{"text":"Very good food, yummy!!  Will definetly go again. Sign up their app get a free meal, nothing better than a free lunch!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were so excited to have a Pollo Loco closer to our house. I went tonight, after having read all the awful reviews on yelp. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and give them a chance anyways.

Joke's on me: ordered through the drive through and I messed up by not checking my order before leaving. I was missing both orders of flour tortilla's, a side order of corn, a side order of guacamole salsa and any cutlery... Not cool. I love their tortillas and was looking forward to having this restaurant closer but they don't know how to check orders before passing them out the window. 

2 stars only because the food we did receive was satisfying but not over the stars."}
{"text":"Probably the healthiest fast food around Love their tostadas salads and their twice grilled burritos. Great value and always clean especially at this location. Plus look in the mail great coupons. Only suggestion is bring back the smores desert it is awesome.  I would give them another star (5 total) if they bring that desert back."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12pc chicken with 3 sides. Corn, mashed potatoes and side salad. Overall everything was good. The chicken was just a little burnt. Cora M was a friendly cashier."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see el pollo lock open in my neighborhood! Every time I would go to California, I would make sure to get some! My son and I went there tonight and got the chicken fajita burrito... omg it was so effing great! The staff was really nice also, and the restaurant was very clean, and really trendy and nice looking. The memories I have of el pollo loco just got even better! Love it! So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at the \"Crazy Chicken\" restaurant (Not it's real name) last night. NOT impressed. Employee kept saying \"I don't know\" when we asked about ingredients. Example - Rick Hates avocado. We asked if there was any in the fajita burrito. Employee turns and looks at the menu (we already read that and didn't see avocado listed in the ingredients), then turns back and says \"I don 't know.\" Rick asked what was the difference with another burrito - was it just that it had shredded chicken? Was it spicy? You guessed it - 2 more \"I don't knows\"! Apparently it was Her first time there also?!
We aren't unreasonable people - we weren't expecting someone who knew everything. What Would have been nice, was if she had followed \"I don't know\" with \"Let me check\" - which wouldn't have required a big effort on her part, since the other employees were Right behind her. And it wasn't busy - she Could have taken the time to make that effort.
Well at least they Did train her to ring the discount we had.
We won't be back again.
(DID try to let the company know of our dissatisfaction first, but it takes Forever to pull up the survey page. Obviously they don't want to know!)"}
{"text":"The only thing \"loco\" about this place is how at noon on a Saturday there's no chicken ready.  Oh you want chicken?  Sorry come back later!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  I ordered a chicken & Avodado bowl.  The description sounded great.

After too long a wait for fast food, out buzzer finally went off. I went to the counter to grab our food and took it back to our table.  My wife said \"I thought you ordered chicken & avocado\" which pointed out that there was no avocado in the bowl.  I took it back to the counter and the girl said \"oh, let me get you some\".  She comes back a moment later with a piece of aluminum foil wrapped around something.  I opened it up and there was one tiny slice of avocado inside.

Okay - that was not good.

Then, as I'm eating the bowl, the chicken was way overcooked and tough.  One \"cube\" of chicken had a hard bone in it that I had to fish out of my mouth without looking gross. 

There was supposed to be cheese in it and there was perhaps a quarter of a teaspoon of tiny shredded cheese interlaced between lettuce.  

The flour tortillas that I got with the bowl were almost raw. 

Oh, I forgot. There were a lot of beans and hardly and rice in the bowl. 

Overall I was less than impressed."}
{"text":"I guess I won't be using the drive thru at this location again. I ordered a 12 piece mixed family meal with 3 large sides. The lady at the drive thru kept asking me what I ordered, like shouldn't you know? First time that's happened, then I get home and notice one of the sides is wrong, ok no big deal I guess. When I open the box where the chicken is I see there are only 8 leg and thigh pieces. Thanks a lot for charging me for a mixed 12 piece but giving me less and only leg and thigh. What a rip off."}
{"text":"After repeating my order 4 times to an inattentive cashier and waiting 20 minutes in line , my order was still incorrect . I only ordered 2 meals , one with no sour cream or pico . Of course both are on my tostada . Oh , and the cashier forgot my drinks . He wondered why I was still waiting at the window after another 5 minutes . I will never return to this location ."}
{"text":"I love this El Pollo Loco.  They have the friendliest staff and the food is always fantastic.  I eat a lot of El Pollo Loco and have been to many of the locations in AZ and this one is by far the best.  I think some of the other locations should send their employees to this one to be trained because the level of service is superior to the rest.  I moved to Chandler and I am super happy that this gets to be my go to spot for fast great meals.  Gracias to Maria, Abby, Fanrose, Elly, Elijah, Sam and anyone else who works at this location (sorry if I misspelled your names or left anyone off that deserved a compliment but keep up the great work and the awesome food)."}
{"text":"At this El Pollo Loco they charge more for some items than any other El Pollo Loco I have been to. What happened to me is I simply asked for black beans instead of the pinto beans in a burrito and was told they might charge more. The manager came out and rudely said it would be .49 more. This is even after I mentioned that the 3 other El Pollo Loco's I go to do not charge more. I wasn't asking for a side dish, just a simple substitute. Wow, customer service is bad and I should have gone to any one of the other places around there."}
{"text":"I thought that I would try El Pollo Again. What a mistake. Only thing that could be drier than their chicken would be a dried up mud pie and that would probably taste better. Chicken was dry and the part that looked like chicken was very yellow. Tossed food in trash, and walked out only to never step foot in this or any other El Pollo Yucko again. Save your money and your health-go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I see why this location is rated at 1.5 stars!!! The food sucks and the service sucks even worse!!! This is the 2nd location that I have visited in the last 2 weeks and the food was awful. El Pollo Loco has gone downhill. The chicken looked like plastic and the rice was hard and crunchy. When myself and my spouse complained to the manager, he had an attitude. Enough is enough! Where has the quality control gone?"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would. The Chicken here is HORRIBLE! I've been to this location several times with the same results. Around the edges of the chicken looked like and tasted like plastic. The skin was so rubbery I couldn't even chew it. Hell, I couldn't even tear it! I complained to the manager and he swapped it out with some more chicken. Which was even worse than the first chicken. The manager was really nonchalant about the whole ordeal. He said that he didn't see anything wrong with the chicken after I showed and demonstrated to him what was wrong with the chicken. I told him that he needed to eat a piece. The condiments bar is never stocked. I always have to ask a worker to replace the items. I don't even know why I even bother going back to this location. You better believe that I will never ever go back to this location again. The worst El Pollo Loco EVER!!!

I tried this El Pollo Loco again today 4/5/18. The condiments bar was not stocked and it was messy and dirty. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free burrito and they would not honor it for some reason. The manager was extremely rude. I definitely won't be back. I think I'm going to give up on El Pollo Loco. They have gone downhill."}
{"text":"Positives:  If you're looking for a healthy option this is a great choice. This place is located by my work so I eat here often.  They are known for their fresh flame grilled chicken meals. You get to choose a couple sides and are served tortillas with the meal.  This is always good.  My favs I usually get are:  grilled chicken salad with extra chicken, avacado chicken quesadilla, loco street tacos (these are tiny get a couple), and the chicken tortilla soup.

I like their food it is always fresh and their chicken is good where most chicken gives me the gags.  They serve healthier options like pinto beans instead of refried.  Don't get me wrong, you can most definitely get those calories up with their burritos!  Today I got the chicken tortilla soup and felt it was time to do a review since it was super tasty!!  I really wanted to do 4 stars but the more I thought about it I think I will settle on 3.5. 

Negatives:  Filibertos is also across the street from my work and yes, I do love classic greasy Mexican food and refried beans."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!! I love El Pollo Loco but this location has horrible customer service. Went through the drive-through ordered the family meal they forgot my churros had to go back then they forgot the dressing for my salad had to go back again finally got home thinking they got everything right just to find out there are zero napkins utensils or plates! I called the store and spoke with someone named Oscar who was very rude and a smart ass. After telling him what happened the only
thing he had to say was \"uh huh\" saying usually people ask for utensils and napkins. If someone calls your store letting you know about service they have received don't try to argue and make up an excuse just own up to it!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and inaccuracy. Nowhere near the standard of other restaurants in the chain. It seemed like it was all trainees working. Will avoid this location for sure"}
{"text":"Last review I left was for what used to.be my favorite el.pollo loco. Last 2 visits were very disappointing. The drive thru window is slacking now. Dont ask me if I want salsa if your not going to give it (last two visits they forgot the salsa!!!) This time no salsa, tortillas, napkins or a reciept. So disappointed. I will continue to visit this place, sucks I have to babysit you and double check my order. Come on guys get your shit back together!!!"}
{"text":"My mom used to take us to another El Pollo Loco (or else pillows local as auto correct keeps trying to rename it on my phone...) location when I was a kid. I never really liked it. My husband and I decided to give it a try last week and oh man... delicious and cheap. The perfect combination.

I think I'll eat here tonight! Try it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, first time in and the food was good and fresh. It is in the same lot as Tuesday Morning so I am sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Grande\" 10 piece meal.  It is supposed to be enough for 3-4 people.  One of my sides was salad with ranch dressing.  When I got home, I realized they only put in one 1.5 oz tiny single ranch dressing.   When I called I was told this is the corporate policy.  So, the corporate policy is that one out of 4 people can have dressing for their salad, and the others clean eat dry salad? What a joke and a ripoff.  Salad for 3-4 should come with dressing for 3-4.  My other side was broccoli.  I asked for some butter, as their broccoli has no seasoning of any kind on it, and is subsequently,  dry as hell.  Answer was we don`t have butter.  There seems to be very little thought about pleasing the customers, in this corporation's policies.  The only reason I keep going to El Pollo Stupido  is the chicken is a little less greasy than Popeyes or KFC."}
{"text":"I ordered the taco signature salad and chicken nachos, which was pretty good. The service was good too. I will order this again in the future order."}
{"text":"Food is good can't compare with nothing around but the guys working there no manner they be checking out the girls last time I went an a guy that work there was talking about how big a girlass was wat a service they should see who they got working 4 them"}
{"text":"Worse managed restaurant there is if you go at 9 o'clock don't ask for a whole chicken close they don't have it there when I give you chopped rest because that's all they have it's 9 o'clock it's leftover time so whatever they can't sell they want to give it to you, and you have a five or six people inside there that are the worst idiot you ever want to ever meet it's too bad that this so-called franchise or franchisee is as stupid as they are the most stupid peoples that I ever seen.. so sad that the company won't train them.."}
{"text":"This place sucks what kinda of fast food restaurant runs out of lettuce and tortillas when there's is smith in the same shopping center as them. Worst customer service ever give me the runs."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Double Ultimate Chicken Tostada Salads.
Based on eating at other locations, this place seem to use smaller tortilla shells.
The assortment & quantity of ingredients appear to be adequate but Chicken was cold.
That was going to be a known fact because, flames were off on grill where numerous grilled chickens lay to dry out & get cold!
Exactly what the chicken tasted like, old, dry & cold!
The last straw was when cashier could not credit purchase using my Pollo Loco Gift Card. 
Cashier explained that the computer system has not been setup to easily scan their own gift card? 
What? It easily accepted my credit card but not their gift card?

As before, when you call the 800 number on the back of their card & input their card number to get balance, the call in system also doesn't recognize their card number.

Let this be a warning to everyone Pollo Loco cards are so far the only gift cards that I have trouble using or getting balance info.


Do not purchase these to give as gifts!
Unless you dislike the person you're giving it to.

No more gift cards for me & won't be back to this location until I read better reviews."}
{"text":"Although I've always loved El Pollo Loco, this location's food portions and taste are lack-luster. The last three times I've been here (hoping for a different result...what's the definition of insanity?), the food has tasted horrible.
Unfortunately, they just can't keep up with demand of service and I've actually seen employees get upset with customers simply asking for more salsa to-go (happened to my friend, actually).
I've written this place off and won't ever go back here."}
{"text":"I've worked around the corner from this location for 2 years at have eaten at this location at least a few times a month. 
Customer service is hit & miss. 
Cleanliness is hit & miss, especially the tea. It's MISS MISS! I choose EPL because it's a quick healthy option, and I choose iced tea for the same reason. EPL's mango iced tea is yummy and I look forward to having it with my chicken salad. The last few times I've been in, it's in a nasty stained plastic gallon pitcher. Very unappetizing and I'm sure would not pass with the Health Dept!
El Pollo Loco get it together or you will lose a regular customer!"}
{"text":"One of the few \"fastfood\" restaurants that I can walk away without feeling terribly guilty. 

Their food is fresh, and they have great service. 

Okay, it's nothing fancy...just a little Taco Bell type spot but on higher level. El pollo loco serves real chicken. You can see the giant grill behind the counter with  dozens of delectable roasting chickens.  It's like every day is a Mexican family reunion and you're invited! 

Don't skip out on dessert if you're a fan of flan^*^

The drive-thru is fast. The food might be a few dollars more than say taco bell... but you're getting much better food."}
{"text":"I decided to try the new double chicken mango tostadas which turned out to be one large tostada. It was ok. I thought it lacked flavor and could use a mango salsa dressing. Very overpriced for what you get. This location has friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been going to el pollo loco forever and sense I'm in Henderson now its pretty much my default spot. When I don't know what I want its like \" well....... The Crazy Chicken it is then\". I don't have anything bad to say about this establishment. There food always taste fresh, the service is cool but I rarely use the drive thru ( just a habit I have ) so I wouldn't know about how that experience would be. I mean its grilled chicken at a fast food pace but backyard quality, the burritos are filling and satisfying. My mandatory item I must get are there al carbon tacos, they remind me of the little taco cart tacos back in L.A. The place is clean........ and its grilled chicken soooo....... yeah."}
{"text":"Food is great!!! service is awful. After I ordered my meal the clerk asked me are u sure you don't want to order from the under 500 calorie meal.  Seriously"}
{"text":"I miss eating here, so when I come down from Seattle I make it a point to stop in and eat!!! Seattle could use one up there. Great food!!!"}
{"text":"Like this location, but they do have a tendency to mess up my order (-1 star)... but they kind of sort of - not really- make up for it with free extra corn tortillas! In love with their flame broiled chicken and cheap tacos al carbon!"}
{"text":"My overall take away was that it was a long wait (over 10 minutes and there were no other drive through or dinning room customers), the food was eh, and it was pricey. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food is good the service not so good.. I've been here couple times and the service is always the same, to me is like people that work there don't want to work there.. we passed drive thru and ordered a family meal 8 piece to be exact. I asked for corn tortillas got flour tortillas, asked to only have leg and thigh, they put all kinds of chicken, i asked for the mando chili salad and she put the avocado salad.. after all we were so hungry and on a hurry that I just decided to call and let them know about my order.. the lady just said sorry and never even offered to come back and change what they had done wrong.."}
{"text":"I only eat at El Pollo Loco during Lent, when I give up Meat.  I love their BRC (Beans, Rice, Cheese) Burritos....and the price is right, $1.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw?select=EdwwFuJK_tM_Y6643VKYRQ
In addition to the BRC Burrito, I tried a Quesadilla for the 1st time.....pass on it, trust me.  The BRC Burrito was good, as usual....however, I think they're getting smaller and smaller.

Their complimentary Salsa Bar is pretty good, although they don't have a really Spicy option for us who love the Heat.

Overall, this past visit went OK.  The cashier was really slow at taking the orders and it took forever just to place one with only 2 people ahead of me.  The food was good and made up for the minor inconvenience.

{"text":"Love EPL. They have great food that I'd fresh. I am a big fan of their green avocado salsa. The salads are delicious is you are watching your weight but I really wanted leftovers for work tomorrow so I got a bowl tonight. Have never been disappointed with anything from EPL."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday and suffered through a uncomfortable meal. Cooking area was cool but dining area was hotter than there spicy hot sauce. Ruined the whole experience. It was so hot we ate 1/4 of our meal and left. Manager told AC was working even though everyone was sweating"}
{"text":"I went in and bought a bowl of soup, and ended up biting into a huge bone! Literally, I bit into it. It could've killed me. I have a picture included. It's absolutely ridiculous that this got past the workers. I should sue this place."}
{"text":"I am only giving them one star because there is no option for zero stars.

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a crispy taco. I sat in the drive thru line for about 10 minutes. 

I pulled forward, looked at the food and saw that the crispy taco wasn't crispy- it was burnt. The shell was broken in several places and was a dark brown color. It looked and smelled burnt. I'm shocked that someone would even wrap that taco up and serve it as food. 

I went inside to ask for my money back. I explained 3-4 times that I had literally just left the drive thru. Over and over she said drive thru???  She kept mentioning two minutes to make another taco. I said I didn't want the food anymore. I just wanted my money back. I told her I paid with a card and she went to the register. She asked for my receipt. I didn't have a receipt in the bag. It was a $2 item. I can't believe she kept questioning everything. She kept punching keys on the register not looking up. I have no clue what she was doing.

I started to get very upset so I left without the money or food because it is not worth it to get upset over $4. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Good place to eat,drive through always fast unlike the McDonald's that's in front,inside el pollo loco there are very friendly people that work there ;)"}
{"text":"Like a lot of other reviewers this location is awful. I stopped by last night and when I arrived in the parking lot I noticed the parking lot lights were off and so was their signage. when I walked in and up to the counter they told me they wouldn't have any chicken for 40 minutes...that's crazy, no chicken at 6:30 at night at a chicken restaurant. On my way out I ran into a friend going in and told him they were out of chicken as I stood outside talking to him, 10 more customers went in and out of the place shaking their heads. This isn't the first time this has happen...they are constantly out of chicken. Get your act together EPL."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  We got the chicken with 2 sides. It was a family sized meal. It was very fresh. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I walked up to the counter like i would at any other place, but here, the employees just walk by you and look at you and don't ask you if you need anything. They also they were not in a rush. I will give them credit, they have good horchata and good food. Also in the bathroom, they have a hand soap dispenser that you have to touch-eww germs. Same with the paper towel dispenser. Hey, at least they have paper towels so you don't have to touch the door handle"}
{"text":"First time at this location (drive thru). Chicken was what you'd expect from El Pollo (really good) and service at the drive thru was friendly and efficient. Will return."}
{"text":"I hate writing 1 Star Reviews. I try to avoid writing reviews for Fast Food places because like the old phrase goes, \"You get what you pay for.\" Unfortunately, my last visit here is something that I feel needs to be said:

I visited just this past Wednesday to pick up an 8 piece dinner with two sides. Instead of hitting the drive thru and pissing a line of cars off with my large order, I decided to park and walk in to order. I walk in, make up my mind what I am going to get for sides and proceed to order my food. It wasn't overly busy, just a couple people ahead of me ordering and a couple diners eating. I order my food, get my receipt and that's when everything goes downhill.


The first thing I notice was what looked liked the manager/supervisor (she was wearing the dark green button up shirt) is standing behind the counter by the tortillas and is straight out texting on her phone. Right there, in front of customers, on the floor. She then sets her phone down on the same counter, possibly on top of the bagged tortillas, and proceeds to start throwing tortillas in the plastic baggies. No gloves. No hand washing. 

I was thinking WTF but tried to ignore what I saw, scooped some salsa into to-go containers and waited for my order. I then saw that my cashier was now scooping my sides with no gloves and if she washed her hands, that was the fastest hand wash in history. She was helping other people behind me when I was at the salsa bar so I don't know how she could have quickly made it to the hand washing station, washed for 30+ seconds and go back to the side dish hot trays. 

I know fast food jobs suck and a lot of time the workers are treated like complete crap. I understand and can sympathize with them, but I can't excuse improper food handling as having a \"crappy day at a crappy job.\" Needless to say, those two incidents were enough to turn me off of this place."}
{"text":"Paid $24 for a family meal drove all the way home to find the insulting mockery they try to pull with serving us days old rice it was literally balled up into rice rocks all in the large side that came with the meal. I am forwarding this picture to corporate as they only offered us 25% off our next order for the inconvenience. Never again. Disgusting run fast from this location they don't care what they serve their customers as unhealthy and disgusting it may be"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on here, but it seems like they have fired everyone and hired an entire new staff. It feels like they are incredibly disorganized and have never actually been in the store before. We have been here for over 20 minutes and do not have our food. Every order that has gone out before ours has been wrong. Not sure about the food, since we don't actually have it, but I feel like living on the edge so I'll eat whatever food they give me."}
{"text":"They called us up when are food wasn't even ready and we waited 40 mins to an hour to actually get it.The general manger was being disrespectful to my squad and her employees. This location ain't shit. Will not be going back. If I could give them a zero rating that's what it would be."}
{"text":"Went with my wife thru the drive thru. Got two combos. One was a salad and a drink. The other a burrito and a drink. Not worth the $14. Burrito was ok. Nothing great. Mostly filled with rice. It came with a little bag of stale tortilla chips. Wasn't impressed at all. With other fast food choices available, prob won't choose this one again."}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews for fast food chains, but I think El Pollo Loco will be one of the exceptions. So I have been impressed with the remodel of this location, which can be best explained as traditional Mexican flair while being modern at the same time. I believe all the older locations will look like this too. I also like the new menu options, they are definitely adding that Tex-Mex attitude. Giving it that fresh taste similar to Chipotle. A good thing is the prices are still affordable and you can order a decent size meal for $5. Did corporate leadership hire a hip up to date marketing consultant to re-vamp their image? Something is definitely going on and I must say it is not just 1 step in the right direction but probably 2? And this is coming from someone with a business degree!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday for dinner.  The food was good as always.  I mean you can never go wrong with el pollo loco, but this one the floor was really disgusting and sticky and the seats at the booth were sticky and torn.  The management really needs to work with their employees in the up keep of the restaurant.  I have been to el pollo locos in worst areas that kept their facility nice and cleaner than this location.  Overall, I rate this restaurant 2 stars."}
{"text":"Screw KFC and its suspiciously anemic-looking, super-salty \"chicken\" pieces. The second that I found an alternative to my husband's weird craving for fast-food chicken, we dumped the Yoh! empire brand. 

I love me some El Pollo Loco. It's super-cheap (family meal for 4, under $20); the chicken parts are identifiable as real chicken; there are always two to three cooks grilling up a sea of chicken, so you know it's fresh; the marinade makes the meat soooo tasty; and the ranch beans are nummilicious. Love stuffing some of the chicken and beans in a tortilla, drizzling with the avocado green sauce and chowing it down. My kids love it. The husband loves it. 

We only use this one location. The service isn't the fastest, but it is ALWAYS correct and with a smile. 

I must admit - my last visit there was less than stellar. I was asked to park until my drive-through order was ready. After over 10 minutes, and watching another dozen or so cars whiz through without having to park, I called the number on my receipt (no, not lazy... a car full of hungry kids), to ask how much longer it would be.  The girl who answered quickly mumbled, \"Ok, be right there\" and hung up before I could reply. I went inside at that point, and asked to speak with the manager. No one would say why it was taking so long (I suspect someone forgot) but the manager had already comped a few flan desserts (not bad for being so cheap). When I explained that this visit was a disappointment, after so many other, very satisfying experiences, the manager asked for my receipt and promptly refunded every cent. I didn't even ask. This removed all doubt as to whether I would return. I will definitely be back. In fact, maybe this Friday... hmmmm..."}
{"text":"It's the crazy chicken. You know what to expect when you go here. For those who don't know what to expect, it's a Mexican/American fast food restaurant that serves some satisfying flame grilled chicken at a low price. Remember that I said fast food, so this means it can potentially come with bad service (depending on the cashier) and crazy customers. I really do like this location though. I think I come here at least 1x/every week or every other week to get a fix of my pollo bowl, overly sweetened horchata, and some bomb guacamole salsa (I seriously think this is one of the best salsas I have ever had) 

They also have some great $5 deals going on every now and then. Not to mention the coupons they constantly give you for family meals and other smaller items. They also have a \"dollar\" menu but they are priced starting at $1.14 for a chicken taco, flan, a piece of chicken leg (yes just the leg), churros, and other things. It's quite a value meal deal. To me, if you don't like El Pollo Loco, then maybe your palate is just too fancy or just plain wrong. I support the crazy chicken!"}
{"text":"After dinning at this place over the last year and a half as my last minute effort to actually gets dinner in a pinch (some nights) that won't blow my nutrition plan, I can confidently say that this is the best location in the city! My order is always accurate, the food is always hot and fresh and the people are always prompt and courteous. 

Kudos to El Pollo Loco for stepping outside the norm of fast food and offering things like the chicken avocado bowl and the chicken and shrimp platter served with broccoli! So good and so right on. Also, the sauces actually are fresh and made with real ingredients with real spice - it's tastes authentic rather than pre-fab out of a package."}
{"text":"In a pinch, we swung into El Pollo Loco for a quick bite last night. The restaurant was very clean and the menu was easy to navigate. I settled on the Citrus Mango Tostada salad. 

The plate consisted of a fried taco shell salad bowl ( which was absolutely delicious), lettuce, tomoato, sour cream, rice, beans, mango salsa, a citrus vinegarette and 1/4 avocado. My meal was fresh and delicous - I really couldn't stop eating it. It was light and didn't leave me feeling like I just consumed heavy Mexican food. 

I was pleasantly surprised, and we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"In general the food is ok but nothing special. I tried this place a few times before the dinner busy time and the service was fairly quick. Some of the bowls and the tortilla soup are good and a reasonable value. The bigger issue I see with this restaurant are the small portion sizes and high prices. A 8 piece chicken meal is between $18-$21 depending on the selections. The chicken pieces in the dinner are on the smaller side. Not worth the money considering the other options in the area. Ownership should pay attention to the reviews posted and make some improvements or people will not return. So far the reviews are showing a fail. I will give this another try in a few months."}
{"text":"This is a dirty place! Dirty floors, you can tell they haven't cleaned them in a long long while. Dirty restrooms, not cleaned in a long time either. Dirty tables. I'm afraid to know what it looks like where they prepare the food... The chicken bowl I ordered had 2 little pieces of chicken. It was tasty, but I highly doubt I'll ever eat here again..."}
{"text":"Been eating at this place many times, and it is some good food!

I usually get the bowl , sometimes chicken and rice which is yummy!

They have recently redone the inside and outside and it looks great!

Pricing is nice and the staff is always professional.

Great place for a quick lunch or dinner and convenient!

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to eat Pollo Loco all the time for lunch. This new location was disappointing. I ordered a chicken avocado tostada salad and requested extra dressing, but instead received NO dressing whatsoever. As for my girlfriend's burrito, it was so badly made with so little chicken that she ended up feeding the rest to the dog."}
{"text":"Fail. Ordered 2 chicken breast and drum stick. Got home 1 chicken breast and drum stick. Not the first time they have done this to me which makes me. Check your food before leaving."}
{"text":"Kimberly is seriously the best cashier I have EVER had the opportunity to have take an order from me. Always smiling cheerful and happy to do her job. Keep an eye on her I see her going places. The food is always perfect and the rest of the staff is on top of their game too. Keeping up with our tables needs like clock work. I am seriously surprised at the couple of less then 5 star reviews because this place deserves every one of them and more from my MANY MANY visits to this location. Thanks and keep up the great work! Customer for life :)"}
{"text":"Quick and efficient, but not very friendly. Some of our chicken thighs skin was pulled off. Love their chicken tacos and chicken & shrimp tostadas, but I probably wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco recently rolled out a menu with 4 new burritos and wow was I blown away. Their new spicy chipotle burrito is one of the best americanized burritos i've ever eaten.
Chicken, cheese, chipotle sauce, sour cream.. simple but done so well.
I will absolutely be back.. !"}
{"text":"We have had good experiences at this location, unlike many other El Pollo Loco locations. The prices have gone up, however. Today the gal's shirt (cashier) said something about free-range chicken, so maybe that is why the prices went up. They upgraded their pop machine.  Not like Firehouse Subs and BK, but still more flavors than the norm. Oh, and drinks are pricey and not included with their meal/family pack deals at any of the locations."}
{"text":"I received the wrong order twice!!! Horrible! I wanted shrimp but got dried out chicken! Train better please!"}
{"text":"Went threw the drive thru ..it was real good and fresh order was just the way I had asked"}
{"text":"Got a family meal that includes eight pieces of chicken, two sides, four enchiladas, and four churros. Somewhat a decent meal. Mac n cheese is not that great. The corn cake and the BBQ baked beans was the best things El Pollo Loco had on the menu. I say \"had\" because both items are no longer offered on the menu. The new enchiladas that was added to the menu is a good addition. Not bad for fast food! Service is generally good. The drive thru does tend to get extremely busy."}
{"text":"First time eating at El Pollo Loco and I was very pleasantly surprised!! I had an avocado chicken quesadilla and it was very good. Drive thru was very fast and employee was very friendly. Will return!"}
{"text":"Two words: bug infestation. 

Prior to tonight I would have given this restaurant at least 4 stars because I have been to this location through their drive through a couple times and they got my order right, were very friendly, and the prices were always good because I receive coupons in the mail. After tonight though, I'll probably never return. 

My husband (this review is being written by Stephen's wife, Celeste, by the way) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out, especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons. Well we had never eaten inside the store and didn't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests. They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him. He was so grossed out that he couldn't finish his meal (and he's not usually very squirmy about bugs).  All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was \"bug! bug!\" as he pointed at the floor or tables. 

The service was still very friendly, but our bag of chips was very stale (they did replace them when I mentioned it though), and the place was generally filthy. I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area, because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I'll be very surprised if we didn't ingest a few bugs. It's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service (certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner, but will not be now)."}
{"text":"Clean, newly renovated. Have eaten here numerous times over the last 6 months. Food is always good! Friendly staff. Shrimp dishes are really good. We substitute to the black beans because the black beans are really good. Even the \"cobb\" salad is good, spicy, lol, but good. Definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"The Riverview El Pollo Loco is a convenient location, easy to hit on the way home from work and quickly get back on the freeway. I have only ever used the drive-thru. 

The menu board is easy to read, and they have great items.  I got a woman at the ordering mic that I had to repeat my order 5 times to. I am not exaggerating. 5. Times. I pull around to the window, and my order is incorrect. Go figure. A second woman hands me the second half of my order and quickly rectified the errors of the first, with apology.

I ordered a chicken avocado burrito. The filling was plentiful and tasted great. The avocado, cilantro and other items were fresh. My husband also enjoyed his stuffed fajita chicken quesadilla, which resembled the quesarito from Taco Bell, folded in a pinwheel. Something has changed in the churro recipe, and they no longer have the taste, nor the consistency of a churro. Weird.

The quality of food and value is worth the trip, but check your orders!"}
{"text":"Came here once before and was very disappointed with the food and service. 
Lady was cocky and rude when taking our order. Then the food was cold and wrong. Mac and cheese was old and smached like mash patatos. Spoke to a manager and she gave us too free dinners to come back. 
We are here again and the service was great but the food was raw. Wtf!! We can get a break. Make sure you check your chicken!!"}
{"text":"Imbeciles work here - I ordered a shrimp burrito and they gave me uncooked chicken.. will not come back -"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love El Pollo Loco food. I'm not a big fan of this location.

My husband was there today. He went through  the drive-thru ordered a burrito and salad for me. He gets home and there's no chicken on the salad. He went back to let them know. The manager was very rude. He did not apologize for the wrong order.

We will not be returning to this location ever."}
{"text":"Can't believe it. Stood in line for seemed like 10 mins. The lady, two people infront of me, ordered a family meal. Then the clever guy yells, \"Okay, we are out of breast\". So I turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"My child got Food Poisoning from a Cheese quesadilla here..pretty hard to screw up Cheese and a tortilla ..

And my chicken avocado burrito came with Zero Chicken at All!! Jst cabbage and beans who would Ever eat that ?!!!

Worst location on numerous stops !!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday and ordered the 10 piece leg and thigh chicken. The pieces were very small. Service was pretty fast and the cashier was very nice. The chicken was good and pipping hot, just very small pieces."}
{"text":"The worst El Pollo in Las Vegas! They are shorting every customer in chicken that should be included in their dishes. A DOUBLE CHICKEN Tostada salad should have TWO SCOOPS of chicken. The manager/owner of this location doesn't care about any reviews or complaints. They are lazy, cheap and  fraudulent. Just bought a chicken avocado quesadilla, got home and there was no chicken! Do not give this location your time and especially your money."}
{"text":"Food ....fantastic as per usual! Customer service.....way above and beyond! I believe her name is Alex....wow what a super employee! She was so kind and patient with us as we ordered and made special request! We let her know that we were staying at a hotel and she hooked us up with a few little extras here and there to make things easier for us! Excellent excellent excellent!! Thank you for a wonderful dinner!!"}
{"text":"always wanted to review this place but I usually stay away from chains..  I do have to comment that their marinated grilled chicken is some of the finest I have had.  I recently had their new BBQ chicken and well that was great too.

I dont really see the point in reviewing too many fast food joints but El Pollo Loco is special.  

Sometimes I have seen people get pissed with the service because they think it is a fast food joint and it takes a while sometimes for the food to cook.  People need to just stand back and relax.  It is worth the wait, although sometimes the place is understaffed.

I love the crazy chicken."}
{"text":"When I don't know what to do for dinner and want something quick, but healthy, this is where I go. I usually get a salad (all are great) or the skinless chicken breast combo with veggies and a side salad. The chicken is always delicious and the service is great. Every time I've gone, the cashier is suuuper friendly. The drive thru is always packed when I go, so I just pop inside, which is usually faster. Either way though, it's served up fast!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it's not phenomenal. As far as the restaurant itself goes, it was clean and the employees were courteous. The food on the other hand was just okay. The chicken is similar to the rotisserie chicken you might find in the deli at Fry's.  The burrito I tried was decent, but probably about as good as something I could make at home.  Again, not bad, but just didn't live up to the hype I had been hearing for months before trying it."}
{"text":"This is the worst el Pollo Loco I have ever been to. Not because of the food but the employees. They have attitudes and like to use profanity to their customers just because I had to make an adjustment to my order. The manager said he can say whatever he wants. What?! The manager is a young girl with a horrible attitude. First el Pollo Loco on this side of town, thanks for the nasty employees!"}
{"text":"What they show you on TV is totally different when you get inside there, it's your classic bait and switch it's a con game I'll never go there again to get anything!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted!  Their chicken is bomb and made fresh to order!  This place is like my go-to place for a healthy dinner after a good workout.  I like to order a 2 pc. leg and thigh meal with corn tortilla, a corn on the cob side, and some pinto or black beans.  Everything is good, including their hot sides. Everything tastes fresh and they have all kinds of sauces. But my favorites are the pico di gallo, and the avocado green sauce.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Here's my secret for the healthiest meal on the menu:

Grilled Chicken Salad (No dressing).  

But this location is your typical El Pollo Loco with a drive thru.  I've always went through the drive thru and never sat in.  Food should taste the same though!"}
{"text":"Took over 15 minutes to take our order.  Manager just standing around watching the new employee flounder."}
{"text":"This location freaking sucks. The drive thru is hella slow, the rice is usually mushy AND underdone(takes skill to do that), they usually give me a small portion of fatty chicken in my pollo bowl, and someone keeps forgetting to de-seed the damn jalapeños, so the salsa is too spicy. I love me some spicy food, but this salsa just ruins the entire meal because you cannot taste anything but spicy. No bueno, El Pollo Loco. Why you gotta play me like that?

I've started to take my butt over to the Cheyenne location and they have been consistently good. I don't know why this location is so dysfunctional, but I will drive out of my area from now on if I want to get some EPL goodness."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 stars for me, especially in comparison to the closer location to me on Durango, in Centennial Hills. I've now travelled to this location twice for some drive-thru action and both times were very favorable. I actually had some coupon codes to use as I complained about the consistently crap-tastic service and food at the CH location, so I came here for my free food, hoping another EPL location could turn it around for me. This location certainly made me appreciate this particular chain all over again. I`m not gonna lie y'all: I love me some crazy chicken.

Both times the drive thru moved quickly(this was between the hours of 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.), the drive thru employee was friendly and did not give me any grief about using the coupon codes I had, they gave me plenty of napkins, and the food came out of the window quickly. I was SO relieved when I got home to check out my pollo bowl and realized, both times, that the rice was cooked well(unlike the other location which kept giving me underdone, mushy rice), there was plenty of delicious chicken without gross chewy fat pieces(like I had been given at the other location), and the salsa was actually made well. My gripe with the location near my house is that sometimes, whoever is making the salsa, forgets to take out the jalapeno seeds and it ends up being TOO spicy. Like, whoa. I like spicy food, but the amount of spice just ruined the entire bowl on the occasions when they wouldn`t remove the seeds. Rude. So, overall, I am super happy with the two pollo bowls I've gotten here. The tortillas are fine and I usually get horchata, which is also pretty tasty here as well.

It IS fast food, but if I had to choose a chain to be \"bad\" at, I would definitely choose this one, and in particular this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic taste and value!  We had several items on the menu.  The crunchy chicken tacos were fan favorites; the basic chicken meal was very good too.  The shrimp dishes were good enough but stick to the chicken.   They have a great salsa bar that also includes fresh serrano  peppers and cilantro. Prices are great, as was the service...very professional, personable, and well timed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that they had so many healthy options!! The freshest salad I ever had and the best marinated chicken!! Love the location, and friendly service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Today my family and I went into this pollo loco for dinner and we've been let down by this location in the past however this was the last time we'll ever be coming here. At first the whole store was an absolute mess, all the tables were dirty and so was the floor. There were other customers who were complaining about the chicken not being cooked properly as well. On the other hand, the customer service was also horrible, no good attitudes or average customer service whatsoever. Once we got our chicken we noticed that in one of our chicken breasts there was a piece of metal inside of it, which we took notice of before digging into that piece of chicken. Along with this the chicken itself was flavorless (other than the out pour of oil that was the only taste to begin with) and some pieces were extremely dry and not fully cooked. We will not be coming back to this establishment due to the lack of quality food, cleanliness, and customer service that we've received from several of these locations."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, large portions, and great salsa bar with guac and 3 kinds of salsa. They always send coupons in the mail for $5 specials which are great deals. 
It won't replace a real mexican restaurant, but close enough for fast mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but service is slow, cashiers are super friendly when going through the dinning room. Anytime I've gone through the drive through they seem to take longer with taking my order. They do tend to fall behind but they are friendly about it and apologize. They are getting better, hopefully they'll find some constancy with their service."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min in the drive thru and chicken was blackened burnt to a crisp after 45 min of waiting . They also left out dressing for salad . Completely ridiculous no apology or explanation . I made a comment at the window that it smells like a fire the guy laughed and shook his head . I like other pollo loco locations quick healthy options this is a disaster where was management ? How do you let ppl that waited over 45 min for drive through food leave with burnt to a crisp chicken ?"}
{"text":"Had lunch here after a doctors appointment and while the lunch rush was really slow the food was fresh and at a fair price. We used the restroom after going through the drive thru and it seems that the restaurant is under staffed but the team work of the staff was really good."}
{"text":"Good food,but terrible customer service.Cashier is hard to understand and doesn't make eye contact."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru and the lady Maria was so rude. I had two people taking turns trying to take my order. Neither could get the order correct and would keep on saying can you repeat that over and over. Not coming back her again. I said no drink multiple times that when we got the the door she said oh what drink would you like, we said no drink again.......if you want bad service and people rolling their eyes at you then this is the place for you. Don't forget to ask for Maria.
.....
After reviewing an email from corporate I decided to give this place another chance. The lady taking my order, Candice, was exceptional. Great attitude, fast, and efficient. Our food was given to us quickly. Overall the chicken was juicy and tender. I still wouldn't give this place a five starts because of my first experience. I think I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Came for lunch to watch an employee sitting down for her break wiping her runny nose and coughing consistently, not using any tissues. Ew I hope she wasnt going to touch any food after this"}
{"text":"The food tasted alright but they got our order wrong and they put only a sprinkle of chicken in the chicken avocado bowl. I'll go back and hope its better next time."}
{"text":"This location used to be great. They would send out coupons weekly, good prices and fast service. Ever since the changed management it has declined. Prices have gone up, slow service and even ridiculous practices such as making me sign for my credit card from the drive thru window! Food still tastes good but everything else could be better"}
{"text":"Very very bad service. In the drive thru fur 15minutes when I got to order was told that I can not have a four piece meal all thighs. 
Was told to come back in 20minutes ..I was already in line for 15 minutes. Was told that he needs the thighs for the big family meals people are ordering....ohh I am sorry that I don't have a family to feed... Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Service is really slow, but I still like them.  You generally need to clean your own table.  The place is always busy."}
{"text":"Man avoid this spot especially if your getting off work trying to grab something fast to eat . They move like snails and they litterly take their time . Females were working this night moving like snails I tell u been in the drive thru line for 30 min never again !! Don't do it keep it pushing I'm telling u .."}
{"text":"My first time EVER at El Pollo Loco and I didn't know what this place was even all about. Discovered all the grilling and sizzling chicken thighs after I ordered my burrito and a side salad.

I was a little annoyed by myself for not looking down but just looking up on the menu. Loved the salsa bar though and the traditional chicken burrito that I got was pretty good too. Staff was very friendly and polite. Will definitely go back to have the real stuff."}
{"text":"The crazy chicken is crazy good! For healthy but filling fast food, El Pollo Loco is pretty hard to beat. My husband loves the 2 piece combo meals, with breast and wing. The citrus marinade they use is excellent and the chicken is always nice and moist. 

I have always been a fan of El Pollo Loco's side dishes, like the steamed veggies. They recently added some premium sides, which are slightly more expensive then the standards.. The premium sides include sweet potatoes fries!! The fries were excellent, a little on the softer side but not to the point of being mushy. 

It doesn't seem like many people in Henderson know about how good El Pollo Loco is, as there is never a wait. I don't mind that one bit."}
{"text":"I have never been into this El Pollo Loco. It is near my work, so when I need to grab a quick lunch and I am burnt out on sandwiches I hit up the EPL drive thru for a fairly quick, fairly healthy meal.

I enjoy the grilled chicken salad, and when I am super hungry, the chicken avocado burrito is high in calories and flavor. I also appreciate that the drive thru menu lists calories for the different items. I have always been helped by really nice employees as well. 

The one area this El Pollo Loco falls short, as noted by another reviewer, is speed.  There have been times when it felt like a slightly excessive wait to get my food... Despite this, El Pollo Loco still remains one of my go to lunch spots because it is inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is great but this location is pretty hit or miss. I'd rate it 2.5 stars if I could but since I can not, 2 stars it is. 

On my last visit I ordered 2 of the 2 piece combo plates, with flour tortillas. Sweet potato fries and a salad were the sides I selected for myself, mac and cheese and rice for the husband. My husband loves these combo plates and has a whole routine down for eating it... He shreds the chicken and makes himself tacos with the tortillas and the rice which he always gets as one of his two sides. 

They forgot our orders of flour tortillas. No do-it-yourself tacos for my husband. Also the rice was undercooked and the mac and cheese was on the watery side. The chicken was still on point though... 

The Lake Mead location is more consistent so I will be going there from now on, even when I am closer to this location."}
{"text":"Scary when I considered eating at El Pollo Loco as eating healthy.  But it's healthier than most of the restaurants that I will frequent throughout the week.  I don't go to this particular Loco often, only when I'm getting my cut at Xpress Cuts.  

Cleanliness is hit or miss here.  Sometimes it's super clean and sometimes it's just missing some housekeeping.  But I put that blame on the guest that don't clean up after themselves.  

I really don't go outside the box when I visit El Pollo Loco. It's usually 5 Chicken Legs or their 3 piece combo.  Regardless what choose, I'm shredding the chicken meat and eating it burrito style.  

TIP:  This drive thru is crazy busy and at all times of the day. One reason this drive thru gets busy is because it wraps around Wells Fargo Bank.  There has to be at least 2 times I've been here where someone thought they were in line for the ATM.  My suggestion, dine in or get your meal inside."}
{"text":"Excellent drive through service! I think her name was Karen. Fast and easy also always clean inside. Friendly staff all the time."}
{"text":"When I walked in there was no line, I waited at the counter for 5 mins with not one \"hello,\" or  \"we will be with you in a moment\" nothing and it wasn't like I wasn't seen. Not even a friendly smile. All I got was dirty looks from this small chick behind the counter, she looked very sloppy. She handed someone their tray all rude! The lady had to ask for plates since she was sitting in the dining area with her family. People started to walk in and stand behind me in line and still not one friendly  hello to the customers. So instead of giving them an attitude back and ruining my night with the experience i was about to part take I walked the hell out..so from the dirty looks I got and the non attentiveness of the workers, I definitely will not be returning to this location! Hell no!"}
{"text":"Drive through: 
Me: Can I order 2 tostadas?
Worker: We don't have any tostadas.
Me: Ok, can I have two chicken avocado burritos?
Worker: We have enough chicken for one burrito.

If you're called pollo loco, plan ahead and don't run out of the pollo. At the very least, open the dialogue with \"welcome to pollo loco, we are out of chicken, sorry\" good luck ordering from a menu that is 95% chicken.

Beyond disappointed tonight. Went to Don Tortaco instead and I'm glad they're just across the street!"}
{"text":"Jacob was super friendly.    Place is clean fast and friendly.   I will def be back thank you so much.   Love this place.     Can't believe I've never been to this location"}
{"text":"Oh yum. Why have I never been into El Pollo Loco before?

My whole family loves it. If we have a lot of people over, we order one of their big meals with all the sides. They are so good. I always order a large macaroni and cheese and usually eat half of it.

They have really good salsas too. If you are going through the drive thru, make sure you request some of their extra salsa- particularly their green one. It is so good. My husband also ask for Anaheim chilis to add some spice to his. He usually goes here for lunch once a week and gets the bowls.

I only wish they had a few vegetarian options and this location does not have horchata. Bring me some horhcata! It is so tasty and I wish it was there."}
{"text":"Make sure you order what you want in window because cashier SAMANTHA will make you go around the drive thru again , even if it's just churros! Lol she is a joke! Oh and count your condiments if you order specifics because they (epl workers) will get it wrong ."}
{"text":"I love to eat here because it's as much or as little Mexican as I want it to be. I always get the grilled chicken meals. The chicken is seasoned deliciously and usually not dry- and if you like dark meat, the leg and thigh are juicy and delicious. For sides- if I'm feeling adventurous, I get the BBQ black beans and rice. If I'm wanting comfort food, I get the side salad and macaroni and cheese. No matter what, I tend to down the chicken in their green salsa- it's the best! You can eat the chicken on its own, or pull it off the bones and put it in the supplied tortillas with salsa and pico. 

While sitting in the drive through, I noticed you can see them pull your chicken off the grill, check the temperature then cut it up. That alone deserves a star, food safety at its best. 

-1 star because of this location's flaw- they always seem to get one thing wrong with my order. I should probably start checking more closely but usually if I'm picking up dinner to-go I'm in a hurry. It's not usually anything major- among my experiences (from most to least frequent): No salad dressing, no silverware, no salsa, missing chicken drumstick, missing side, extra quesadilla. I guess I came out ahead once! 

All in all, this is a good, fast, hearty option for lunch or dinner. You can get away with a pretty healthy meal if you pay attention, and won't be disappointed with the taste and quality."}
{"text":"This is the very first time we've tried El Polo Loco. And we both loved it! This location is clean, well run, with friendly, helpful employees!  The food was awesome!  This won't be the last time we eat at this restaurant chain!!!"}
{"text":"I won't try this place again. My family ordered the 8 piece assorted meal with mashed potatoes and mac n cheese and got chips instead of tortillas. The chicken looked like it had been starving for some time. The wings and legs had no meat on them. The sides were ok but I would have liked to have known that you have to ask for salsa at the window. The menu on the website said it was included in the meal. I called to let them know they had forgotten it, but the manager did not seem to care."}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong even when I repeat it to them 3 times before pulling up to the window. Phone never gets answered like who is managing this place? Horrible."}
{"text":"I eat at pollo loco a few times a week and up to 5 times a week. Salad and chicken, you can't beat the flavor and obvious freshness. I go to the store on S Eastern in Henderson Nv. The staff is always friendly and smiling. For the food quality and having to give sometimes first jobs to their neighbors, I think they do an excellent job in providing quality food at value pricing."}
{"text":"Overcooked chicken with no flavor, but it's fast food so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I came in with my wife, a little hungry, and got a knowledgeable cashier 'Michael',  in helping with selection.  I ordered 8 piece legs & thighs, broccoli, and drink. Chicken was very good. Broccoli was fresh."}
{"text":"Went in to order food for take out and waited about 20 minutes.  Mind you it was ONLY ONE MEAL! the two piece leg and thigh combo was to laugh AT! I looked at it was asking where the chicken was!! The smallest pieces of chicken EVER!!! THERE WAS NO MEAT IN THEM! the salsa bar was a mess, the beans tasted old.... it was a mess!!! Will never go here again!
Oh and one more thing... my guacamole was brown!"}
{"text":"Customer Service gets 5-Stars for sure!!! But shame on El Pollo Loco for raising their prices, while lowering their Food Quality/Portions!!!! Great location, clean and A+ Staff.... but I absolutely do NOT feel like I got my money's worth!!!"}
{"text":"When using the drive thru I don't want to have to get out of my vehicle after because you forgot to place something from my order in the bag. What makes it worse is when I walk in there are 3 employees standing there (including the general manager) and it takes almost a solid minute for someone to acknowledge me because you want to print a report from the register. Maybe your customer service needs some looking into."}
{"text":"My husband wanted me to try this place and I'll be honest I am not a fan of eating fast food chicken. But I had the three strips of chicken with fries. They were just OK. Little too greasy for me but weren't that bad. I also had a side of ranch and the avocado salsa.. He had the chicken quesadilla, he really liked it. It was nothing to die for me..."}
{"text":"I was 40 miles away from home &  wanting to try the new bowls. The chicken & avocado was great ,fresh ingredients. Even 50 minutes later it was warm & tasty. I'll look for one closer next time."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the double chicken salad and the classic chicken salad. Basically  the same said but extra chicken and avocado on the double salad. Always tastes fresh and flavorful"}
{"text":"Seriously!!

I went through the drive thru again and knew I should have just went someplace else as every time we have been here our order was wrong.

This time takes the cake!
I went thru drive thru and placed order....tried to order \"chicken Tacos\" and the girl said we are all out of those.

I asked her how can you be out of chicken tacos at 5pm....she said sorry we are.

I said cancel order and started to drive out.
I then decided to get the managers card and complain.

The cashier went back to the office and retrieved the managers card which I decided to call from the car.

Dayania Ortega picked up the phone and I let her know I was not happy.
She decided to lecture me saying I didn't order correctly and should have said the fried chicken tacos. I asked her if maybe the girl at the window should have asked and she told me no because they have such a large menu.

As she was lecturing me on how to correctly  order the \"Fried chicken tacos,\" I again pulled into drive thru and identified the Fried Chicken tacos as manager Ortega had told me according to proper procedure at El Pollo Loco.

After ordering the EXACT way she told me the window girl again said sorry we are out of those......\"I said no the Fried Chicken Tacos\" and she said yes sir we are out of them! Are you F*#*ing kidding me??!!

To top it off Ms. Ortega got on the mic and said we can make them for you but it will be a wait!

This restaurant is the worse I have ever been too, which really sucks as when they get the food right it is good.

I am shocked that they are able to stay in business as this seems to be the norm at the Summerlin or just outside of Summerlin location.


No use complaining to Corporate Office as Ms. Ortega said it just comes back here anyway! LMFAO!
I am still in awe....."}
{"text":"Just ordered a chicken shrimp avocado tostada and was not given any beans or avocado on in the tostada, very disappointed"}
{"text":"As always the chicken is pretty good but they forgot to include salsa on my 4 piece meal. 
The $5 classic pollo bowl should be called 'rice & beans bowl.' I hardly found any pollo in it! 
Fast & friendly service on drive thru."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this location, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else! I ordered a tostada salad with no chicken, cheese or sour cream, add avocado. I was told avocado is  $.89 extra (no problem). When I got my salad I literally got 1 sliver of avocado! I went back and told them I paid extra for avocado and they said o could only have two more slivers for the $.89 I paid. This is the only location that I have been to that is so stingy with their avocado. It is the worst El Pollo Loco I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"I did not have the greatest experience at this El Pollo Loco location the other day.  Service was slow.  The floor was stickier and more gross than that of a movie theatre.  I was handed a cup and then told the ice machine was broken.  They did offer to fill it with ice in the back but it seems to me that should have been done before handing me an empty cup.  They did not have any iced tea or horchata from the looks of it.  And the soda was all coming out with little more than water and a splash of syrup.  It was watered down and extremely flat.  This place has really gone down hill lately.  The one saving grace was that they did, infact, honor the coupon that brought me in there.  I received an accurate order and it was good.  Every other part of this place needs some serious improvement."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  It's inexpensive, fast and tasty!  If you go here...you have to try the tortilla rolls and sweet corn!  And get the avocado salsa...muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Octavio helped me and he was amazing!! Since I did not buy a drink he reminded me about a water cup instead of me realizing later I needed one!! What a breath of fresh air .. Someone that thinks ahead. Mark also was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Well, it's no Chipotle, but I was actually surprised. It's been forever since I've indulged in a little Crazy Chicken, but we don't eat a lot of fast food, but getting grilled chicken \"feels\" healthier, yes? 
Went to grab a quick bite of protein, I got a chicken, rice, black bean and lettuce burrito. Pretty basic. 
El Pollo Loco is like Chipotle's less attractive sister, but she's still dateable, yes? Occasionally."}
{"text":"So first off, I have a small taco addiction! If I could eat them every day I probably would. With that said, I love El Pollo Locos chicken tacos among many other things HA! 

I'm pretty surprised with the negative reviews because I always have a good experience over here. When I first moved into this neighborhood I didn't feel like cooking and I literally ate food from here 7 days in a row. I know it's crazy, but their chicken is really good and I love it. For fast food I feel like I'm eating something a bit healthier than let's say, a burger. 

Just a tip, if you eat here often download the app and take a second to scan your receipt. I get coupons and free food from here all the time because of it. Thanks El Pollo Loco it's appreciated! Every penny and dollar counts these days. 

I don't know how they make their chicken so delicious and juicy but I'm so addicted to it. I wish I could cook chicken this good at home. My go to items are the chicken tacos al carbon, yummy..crunchy original chicken tacos, love the half chicken combo, and I recently had a coupon to try the double chicken tostada salad. This salad may be my new favorite and it's so big it feeds me for 2 meals. 

Im a drive thru kinda girl and rarely go inside anywhere for food. I usually see the same girl every time I go and shes always friendly and doesn't skimp on my green salsa when I ask for extra. I think in all the times I've gone here my order was only incorrect and missing items  once. The guy apologized profusely when I went back and hooked me up with dessert and an extra large side for the mistake. Great customer service always goes a long way with me and that's what keeps me coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Newly decorated. Great chicken. Ordering could use some line ropes, it can get a little confusing."}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican chicken dishes.  The only thing that I do not like it the burritos that have beans and rice with very little meat in them. 
If I wanted a bean burrito, a rice burrito, or a bean a rice burrito I would ask for one.  When I order a carne asda or chicken burrito that is what I expect to bite into."}
{"text":"totally awful dry, burnt chicken, lousy rice with hard grains, avocado salad with one small piece of avocado, waste of money, straight to the trash can, what do you expect from a place with origins in los angeles. avoid, buy a chicken at smiths instead. no more hell Pollo loco ever."}
{"text":"Have been a customer of this location for many years. Recently have gotten food poisoning THREE TIMES IS TWO MONTHS. The first time they replaced the meals. The second time they told me it could not happen and offered me a 50% discount. The third time they basically told me I was crazy and needed a doctors note! INJURY and INSULT! Wrote corporate... no response."}
{"text":"Screwed up my order after I checked with them to make sure it was correct before I left.  Manager and staff were rude when I asked for a refund of missing items.  Even though they screwed up I was supposed to go back there to get a refund for missing items.  No accountability at this location."}
{"text":"We always enjoy el Pollo Loco, so we were disappointed with this place. Upon walking in, the place looked great. Chicken was cooking, and everyone was busy getting ready for the day...it was 10 am. 
Sat down and waited for our order. Looking around we discovered that this place is poorly managed. The chair legs were filthy from where a mop had been up against them, there was crud of some kind...food probably...on the window sills, glass doors had hand prints all over them, and there was standing water with some warning signs around it. Little things really, but it all added up.
That being said, the tacos carbon and the salsa bar were really good. We had a side of tortilla chips that were stale. They were cold and stale. Blah. My guess is that we will never come back here again. They need better management."}
{"text":"Aurora the girl at the drive through was really rude about me bringing a coupon.  She brings me a warm bottled water . She had given me crap because I asked for green sauce.  
I had came in complaining about the warm water. I asked for a manager, to tell him about my experience with Aurora. The manager already went home. First off the manager should of been their.
Now the monkey are running the zoo.
I will have to report to cooperate. 
So sad that people like that work with the public."}
{"text":"We come here often as its just down the street from our vacation home in NW Vegas. This location is normally not busy and very clean. The streets around it have been torn up it seems like forever, but once you figure out how to get past the construction, its worth it."}
{"text":"I like eating here and the manager is nice but the two girls who work in the front shouldn't even be working there. Stupid little girls think they can mess up an order then blame me for it being messed up. This place needs new front people and those girls need a giant attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Good chicken, the Avocado dressing is so good on the salad. I only get dark meat and black beans with salad so can't tell you about the other sides.  Flan is great for fast food flan. Never eaten inside. Sign is not on always so I forget it's open sometimes!"}
{"text":"Last three times through the drive through.  Got home to find dry burnt chicken.  Takes a lot of determination to dry out dark meat.  Hate to see what they do to the white meat.  Cole slaw was stale.  Gravy was like water but that's my fault for ordering mashed potato and gravy at a Mexican place.  Very poor quality.  Maybe that's what they give the drive through guests.  Might give the good stuff at the counter.  Three strikes you're out.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"1. 18 minute wait in drive thru. Why? More importantly, why no apology?

2. Was told the restaurant had run out of chicken breasts once I finally got to the pay window.  How does a chicken restaurant run out of chicken at 7:30 on a weeknight?

3. The \"tell us about us number\" printed on the receipt 877-375-4963 is not for EPL.  Why?

When did The Crazy Chicken become The Crazy Circus?"}
{"text":"SAY What??! I haven't written a review about The Crazy Chicken yet?! For those who know me and those who don't I love the Crazy Chicken! I normally go for the 2 piece breast and wing and 2 side order and that's exactly what I did today. Most of the time the white meat gets overcooked and its tough to eat....however, El Pollo Loco makes it just right. The combination of the chicken with some flour tortilla, rice and salsa make it soooooo delicious. It may be pricier than most fast food joints, but its well worth the dollars."}
{"text":"I have always loved El Pollo Loco but this was the first location I have tried in Arizona.  I love that they have many lo carb/healthy-ish items on the menu.  For lunch I decided to go with the Double Chicken Avocado Salad.  It was pretty good but the ingredients could've been a bit more fresh.  The lettuce wasn't super crispy and the avocado was already starting to brown.  This salad could've been so much better if it had been fresh. There were lots of other healthy items on the menu as well so I'd like to return and try something else when in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE the CRAZY CHICKEN, this location is my fav because its on my own from the gym.  Fast and \"HEALTHY\", it is healthy depending on what your order consist of.  New remodeled (restaurant and employees), service is fast, employees are nice. 

This location gets 4stars for cleanliness (that includes the outside of the restaurant as well as the bathrooms) it's rare to go to a place 2hrs before closing and the bathrooms are clean.  I appreciate that, what more can I say? Its El POLLO LOCO

I order the same every time I go: 3 wings and a Loco Salad w/ flour tortillas (don't judge me I need the carbs) nothing out of the ordinary but I like it better than the fried chicken places"}
{"text":"Before writing a 1STAR review I will usually revisit the establishment to give them a 2nd chance. But this will not be F@$&:NG happening in this case. Ok, 1st of the service was horrific, and they were so unorganized. I promise no pun intended, but \"chickens w/ their heads cut off\". Just eww, then waited 30mins for a damn grilled chicken salad.

Now you may ask: \"Demetria, why did you not just walk out?\"

That is a good question indeed, and the answer would be: I wanted that salad for 4 days and I was finally on a side of town that a el pollo loco. FUNK that, I was getting my salad.

Well guess what, I got my salad and has UNCOOKED chicken on top. I couldn't drive back, but he time I made it home, they were already closed.

I called the next morning and got no answer, just the answering machine. So after calling for 2days w/o a response I called corporate. These mf's didn't do $h!t, I was told: \"all we can do is contact the owner and its up to him to call you back\". Are you serious???? So what you are telling me that you're cool w/ one of you franchise is serving RAW F@$&:NG CHICKEN??? 

So I'm so cool on el pollo loco, make sure you food is COOKED FULLY before you walk/drive away.

If I could give NO STARS I would, b/c that is not f'n. The health dept. needs to make a trip down there and I no longer eat at ANY el pollo loco, I had to cancel them out.

But that's just my experience, it could be different for you"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! First of all I ordered four tacos and they only gave me three. Then, I ordered all four tacos with no avocado. All of the tacos had avocado. When I brought the tacos back to them Isabel who sold me the tacos and was the cashier argued with me about whether I had three or four tacos in my bag. She argued with me over $3.99. Not to mention the time and money that I lost in having to drive back here in order to get my order? Needless To say I won't be coming back to this location. There are two other locations within 2 miles radius of my home. If El Pollo Loco ever gets my money again it won't be this location it will be the others."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was nice.  Cleanest el pollo loco I've been in, until I went in the restroom.  Not horrible but could have used some attention.  Parking is far from the front door if your not lucky enough to get a spot in front of the building"}
{"text":"A chicken place where the chicken is dry, the lettuce is dry, the rice is dry. We tried a salad and the new CHICKEN, SHRIMP & SAUSAGE PAELLA BOWL. Had to go and ask for salad dressing twice. Tries all the sauces and the fiery wasn't, the spicy wasn't and the salsa wasn't fresh. All in all, the best I can say is \"Nothing wasn't\" what we expected. Just another fast food place that has been X'ed off our try list."}
{"text":"Ahhh, El Pollo Loco. When I tell my coworkers I'm going there for lunch, they stare at me like I am a crazy person. Obviously, they have never been there.
First, let me offer a disclaimer *I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THING*. So the 2 piece combo (breast and wing) with sides of coleslaw and rice and flour tortillas is the only thing on the menu I can vouch for. But it is wonderful. I order that and LOAD UP on the spicy avocado salsa, which is amazing. Seriously, I could drink that stuff by itself. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 
Anyway, I make my own little tacos with rice, coleslaw, their broiled chicken and avocado salsa. It never disappoints. 
The staff here has always been kind to me, and you can get in and out of there quickly, which makes it a nice lunch stop.
I gave four stars because I wish the restaurant was a little...newer? The bathroom has been closed for repairs a few times that I have been there, so maybe it's time to replace it or something? Either way, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Seriously the rudest people taking the order in the drive thru.  Do not know how many times you can correct someone on what you order then having an attitude when you correct the order or ask a question."}
{"text":"I just picked up food from here and the girl taking my order I think her name was Fatima I may be spelling that wrong but anyways she was so sweet. She helped me find the best deal for my order and was very helpful."}
{"text":"Quality has improved from the last time I was here. This is my drive through place when I'm  tired, pressed for time, and want a good family dinner in a jiffy. The chicken is flavorful and juicy. Salsas are fresh. Meal comes with refreshing salad.  I just wish they have more choices for dessert. Overall, a great value for a good meal."}
{"text":"We generally have four choices (robertos, chipotle, baja fresh) for fast-food mexican, and this is one of my favorites. The chicken is really good-tasting, seasoned very well, and so are the seasonal meats (carne asada, carnitas, shrimp---I've had the bowls, burritos, tacos, tortilla soup, and salads) are very good as well, I've tried all of them except for fish. With coupons in the weekly papers and other promotions ($5 meals), it's a monthly staple.

This is the first time we came to this one, though, on the far corner of a shopping strip mall (20 locations in LV & Henderson). It's small, clean overall (there was a food mess with rice grains at the floor of our table, but the employee swept it up for us), with a bathroom. The salsas are at the front counter. The drink machine (free refills) is near the seating (mostly booths). Highchairs are to the right side of the drink machine.

Hubby got a shrimp burrito and I got the shrimp ultimate double bowl (to share with our son), which was yummy. It's nice to see our son eat his food, because sometimes he can be very picky. He likes the bowls and he likes rice. The weekend before, we tried the carne asada, and that was very tasty, too."}
{"text":"Healthy Fast Food- the best tortilla soup ever- just be careful because it's piping hot. The marinated chicken is seasoned perfectly, tender and not dry. The chicken burrito is really good, too. But my favorite besides the tortilla soup, is the bowl- I like the basic one because the deluxe one is too much. Also worth mentioning is the avocado sauce. Free drink refills. Bathrooms, but sometimes some people (not patrons) use the facilities, so I'd be careful or bring some clorox wipes. Drive-thru window if you prefer to avoid the super busy lobby. 
 
Good Prices. Great food- never had a bad meal here. Busy location, especially around lunch time."}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru took forever customer service was rude would not go back to this location"}
{"text":"Visit A:

Lid in the salsa at the salsa bar, waited close to 10mins for them to bring out new salsa, and when kid was just about to pour the salsa in:

Customer: \"You're not going to pour that in there are you?\"
Kid: \"Why not?\"
Customer: \"Bc there's a lid in there, it contaminated now\"
Kid: \"OMG, really?\"

Dear Kid,

I think your Food Handler card needs to be renewed!

Visit B: 

Order was wrong, three times. They told us that they'd bring out whatever they hadn't given us and by the end of our visit, we never rec'd the last bit of our food. 

The management and staff at this place has NO CLUE as to what they're doing. Either they're too young or need add'l training. Staff speaks to customers without 'Thank You's\", \"You're Welcome's\", or a damn smile, it's really not that hard to smile!

The food is good but the service and staff are keeping us from coming back here. I think I'm ok to drive all the way to rainbow to avoid the headache of dealing with the craziness here. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"I've loved EPL since I was a kid, first choice in chicken FF, never really was fan of fried chicken and EPL has practically been the only one that doesn't serve fried chicken. They have a self-serve Salsa Bar where you can get as much salsa, onions and cilantro as you want. 

Our usual order is the 10pc Family Meal with 2 large sides (Mac 'n' Cheese & Mashed Potato) and flour tortillas. I love flame grilled chicken and their seasoning soooo good that I actually like eating the skin of the chicken and I usually don't like chicken skin! Mac 'n' Cheese is super inconsistent. The Cheese can be super thick, super thin or chunky. Mashed potatoes are usually a little more consistent. 

Yes, I've said that I love EPL but I gave this location 1-Star because when we walked in, the Salsa bar was DIRTY, there was only ONE clean table in the entire restaurant and we took it before anyone else could. Trays on the other tables with trash, tables weren't wiped down, it was GROSS. 

My son accidentally spilled a cup of water on the floor and on the table, so he asked them for a rag, and what they gave him was thinner than the napkins on the table in the dispenser! I got tired of slipping and sliding on the floor so I asked one of the employees to mop it dry and the guy says \"OK\" and walks away. I don't know if he understood me but the water sat there so I let it be their problem for the person that slips in it. I hope to change the rating on this location in the future as I heart EPL."}
{"text":"If I would be able to give this facility less than 1 star I would. Seating area is filthy, bathrooms are a disgrace. Ordered my usual salad from them, while eating it found a shrimp label along with some type of wrapping in the salad.  Several hours after eating it became extremely ill, will avoid all the details. Called the facility and left a message for manager Maria for a call back , as of Thursday no  call back . Called her today and she seemed annoyed like we were interpreting her day with my complaint. Said we can come in for a refund. Showed no compassion for what I went through. Also notified corporate and no response from them. I guess there Mission Statement does not include customer service. Take my advise avoid this place like the plague! Not worth what you will go through. Will never step foot in it again."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here and the prices, but the service isn't always the best...but some things, folks, I can ignore if the food is good enough and is IS here.  Always made perfectly!  Just check your order and you will be ok."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love everything about it. Food is good. Chicken is tasty and hot (temperature, not spice). Its healthier than regular fast food depending on what you order. Prices are cheap. The salsa bar offers variety. The unlimited amount of onions, my favorite part!! Anyone who has been to one knows that it's delish. 

So why only 3 stars? For some reason, I don't know what it is, my order ALWAYS, let me repeat, ALWAYS, is wrong. I order a 3 piece meal, I get a 2 piece. I order a side salad, there's no dressing. I want rice as a side, I get fries. I go through the drive though, they forget my utensils. Something has always been wrong with my order. The employees there, friendly and fast. But seriously, get it together please. I love this place a lot, and it's not going to stop me from eating here, but please make sure the order is correct before handing it over to me. That is all."}
{"text":"This store is so dirty! Will never be back. Yuck, all the tables hadn't been wiped, floors were full of debris, under the sofa station looked like it hadn't been swept in forever!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, but the food wasnt all that great. I used to love their chicken, it wasnt really as soft as it used to be. We tried their burrito with creamy cilantro, but Instead they just gave us a burrito with no creamy cilantro. I mean, how can you order \"burrito with creamy cilantro\" and not get the creamy cilantro part?"}
{"text":"Normally, once I have a couple of bad experiences at a place, I never go back (and as you can read from my previous review, I had a few bad experiences at this location). But one day, I was taking my dog home from the vet, where she just had surgery. My dog loves chicken, so I thought I would buy her some El Pollo Loco, as a special treat on her difficult day. I thought, if this location did not brown the skin properly (as was the case in the past), it be no big deal, because I would be removing the skin from the chicken anyway for the dog. When I got the chicken home, it was cooked perfectly, and the skinned browned properly. So i ate some of it, and it was great. But I was still leery in going to this location, because they have had good days in the past, only to be followed up on my next visit with undercooked chicken. Well, I tried it again a couple of weeks later, and the chicken was perfect once again. Then tried it a third time about a week later, and it was perfect again. I have now been there at least 15 times in the last year, and each time the chicken was cooked properly. So it looks like, whatever cooking problem they had in the past, has now been fixed. So I am going to give this location an upgrade to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this location. My food was cold and I swear the beans were dumped right put a can.  They definitely were not made in el pollo loco.  Won't be going here again"}
{"text":"The guy handing me my food had dirty finger nails! EFFING GROSS!

I went through the drive thru and decided on a pollo bowl, I wanted to add cheese and he said it was one dollar more.... REALLY? What a rip off! I got to work and was taken aback! Literally, a bowl filled to the brim with rice and beans and 1/4 of a small breast! BOO!

I tasted it and was turned off, the chicken was bland and dry and it just wasnt yummy! Had I got the cheese and added salt then yea, but seriously EPL?? I also got some red salsa and it wasnt good. Just a sad visit!

What was the worst is that the guy at the window had long DIRTY fingernails! OH HELL NO!"}
{"text":"Their food tastes good. Advice: It's a fast food restaurant. If you can't order off the menu and need to get all precious about how they slice your chicken, make it at home."}
{"text":"Can't say I would try this place again... The commercial makes it look so good, so my hubby and I decided to give it a try... Well to get straight to the point he ordered a chicken burrito and I ordered the chicken wing meal... He couldn't finish the burrito and left 1/4 of it. About 4 hrs or so later he was violently throwing up, it was horrible, and I was seriously worried. 
Today he is still weak but at least the puking has stopped... 
I don't think it was a 24hr bug as I looked up the symptoms and it was salmonella. Sorry El Pollo Loco"}
{"text":"They have been here so long and are tucked to the side, sometimes I forget about them. They have great chicken and can be a healthy option in the area. The area is void of Mexican food , unless you count  Taco Bell. This place is a great reprieve from all of the burger drive thru's in the area. Most of the menu items have a crazy amount of ingredients, sauces,etc. However, if you special order a plain chicken and cheese quesadilla or other simplified item, you shouldn't be disappointed. A favorite is the chicken street taco al carbon for $1.69. I requested pico de gallo with my three street tacos and was stuffed for under $5.53."}
{"text":"Me and my family love el pollo Loco every time we come to Vegas we eat pollo Loco never had a complain 
Last night we check what time this location close and said 11 pm we arrive  at 9:45 they were very rude they look like they wasn't happy to see costumers 
 we order and they had no more rice OK we are OK with that we were sitting and we heard the cashier tell the manager we are out of mash potatoes do we make more or do I let them know 
She said we close in 4 min just let them know we don't have any
 wow very disappointed never go back to this location"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time going to El Pollo Loco at this location and it was by far my worst experience EVER!! I had a coupon for a free Avocado Tostada Salad with a purchase of $10 or more. So i ordered a Shrimp Wrap $6.49, 1 side of Mac and cheese $1.99, and 1 order of chips and guac $1.99 but i was told they ran out of guacamole so instead i got chips and salsa. So before taxes, the total came to $10.47..so i presented the coupon for the free avocado tostada and was told that i couldn't use it because i didn't order an Avocado tostada???? what?? I told him that my order came to more than $10 and he insisted on telling me that i didn't order an Avocado Tostada so i can't use it... so instead of arguing with him, i ordered a Chicken Tostada $5.89.  As i was waiting for my food, i wanted to get some cilantro and they were out, they were also all out of the Mild Pico de gallo and medium pico de gallo.. the only thing i could get was the avocado salsa so i got 2 cups of it and i couldn't find any lids.. So me and some other customers were looking for lids and asked the shift manager... so he was getting more lids... but instead of him replenishing the salsa bar with more lids, he was counting to hand out how many lids each of us customers needed.
After the shift manager gave me the lids, i simply asked him when can i use the coupon for the Free Avocado Tostada.  He said i had to purchase $10 or more.. i pointed out to him my receipt and he acknowledges that my order came to more than $10.  I told the manager that the person that took my order told me i couldn't use the coupon because i didn't purchase an Avocado Tostada. And when the shift manager asked him why he didn't let me use it and he said that it's because i ordered a chicken tostada.  And the shift manager simply agreed with him.  I pointed out to him AGAIN that the coupon says \"with purchase of $10 or more.  He looked dazed and confused like he never seen a coupon before. He was about to give me 2 tostada salads.  i told him that i only want the 1 avocado salad (chicken fajita).. the manager looked soooo confused and didn't know that he needed to give me a refund until another one of his employee was explaining it to him... (let me remind you that this is the shift manager that was all confused.)... so while i was waiting for my refund for the Chicken Tostada salad that i had to pay for, my food was packed and ready to go.  The manager gave me a refund $4.00. (not sure how he came up with that figure) but my refund was suppose to be the price of the Chicken Tostada that i paid for plus tax ( $5.89 plus NV sales tax of 8.15% $6.37 )  At this point i was sooo aggravated and got the hell out of there. So i got home and come to find out that there was no dressing for my Avocado Salad. (WTF?!?!?!?!)"}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious. I only had the chicken but it was amazing . Not sure what the seasoning was but I could eat this chicken everyday !

Staff was friendly and place was clean ."}
{"text":"Gotta love El Pollo Loco! The food is really good (I especially love the quesadillas) and the girls taking my order all seemed nice, although I could tell that maybe they were tired (possibly of doing the same thing over and over again). Despite the hefty price for a fast food item, I enjoyed my chicken avocado quesadilla and will be back to this location. 

4 stars for the overall atmosphere -- I felt welcome, but more of a forced welcome than a genuine one."}
{"text":"Frustrated with this location as they no longer allow you to order guac and chips.  I am willing to pay for guac and chips...  and you do not want the extra revenue?!  I am shocked...  I will probably return to this location, however, disappointed that my favorite starter is no longer available."}
{"text":"One of the best values out here.  Fast Food or not.  I simply love their Cilantro dressing.  Their chicken burritos and roll ups are out of site.  Especially when you dip them in the Cilantro dressing."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I had a salad and halfway though it, I realized they didn't give me any dressing.  The salsa area is bad! Most choices were close to empty and the area hadn't been wiped down in awhile.  The seating are had not been wiped down or swept either.  I may come again for the food but if it's like today, that will be it for me."}
{"text":"This a great healthier fast food.  The chicken is marinated then grilled and taking straight from the grill to your plate.  They have a great  creamy cilantro dressing for the salad.  I'm not a cilantro fan but love this dressing. Great meal at a reasonable price and you won't feel all bloated like regular fast food. Great place for a family lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible servicio al cliente ,pedi una quesadilla de pollo con tocineta q no venden con tocineta, entonces dije q me vendieran tocineta aparte y dijeron q no podian , pedi churros con salsa de chocolate q no tenian salsa de chocolate.
Que Es esto????? Patetico y frustrante servicio.
Horrible horrible servicio"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with el pollo loco when you want fast food and chicken. It's a great place to go. The charbroiled chicken is delicious. I always get the 2 piece combo, breast and wing, with rice and beans. It sets it off right every time. The house salsa is tasty too. One of my favorite fast food chains."}
{"text":"Ok this chicken is so good, it has been said, that even another chicken would eat it. That is an understatement. This is a decent restaurant in the guise of a fast food joint. They have a great loyalty program-Plus. They send out great coupons- Double Plus! A great alternative to fast food, not just in quality but healthier as well. I should also mention the very friendly staff. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an El Pollo Loco for ages for some reason I can't explain, I guess I forgot how good they were. Juicy flame-broiled chicken, a great selection of sides, warm tortilla, and salsa bar with fresh ingredients, what's not to like?! This location is very nice, clean and well ma"}
{"text":"Good but some issues but long waits caused by bad parking structure caused me to be late from lunch. Salads always have the center of the head for some reason. Always have to throw lettuce away. If I see another brown avocado I may stop coming"}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. I  gave this location four Stars the week after opening. The last couple times they have forgotten something and I've let it go. This time was utterly ridiculous. First of all the girl forgot part of my order. Then I asked her for dressing if she tells me it's in the bag which it wasn't. Then I get home and I order a pretty big meal and salads to arrive with no utensils. Does gravy was watered down for the first time ever and also the macaroni and cheese was watery than normal. When I called to ask the manager what they can do they told me I can get 10% off on next order. I advised I had to go back now because I don't have anything to eat with since there are no Forks in my bag. Stay away from this location corporate will be getting a call from me soon. I got the well we are training excuse. 5:30 p.m. is not a time to train. Management needs to have additional training first"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time trying el pollo loco and it still didn't like it. 

Handcrafted chicken bowl
The rice was dry and the Pico was mushy. The chicken was grilled well but the chicken was also dry. The only thing I enjoyed was the green salsa. 

The customer service was great. I was greeted at the call box at the drive thru when I got to the window the guy was really nice and gave me extra salsa. 

With the terrible food and good service it's a 2 star for me."}
{"text":"This is the filthiest El Pollo Loco I have ever been to. Health Department where are you!! Food all over the place behind the counter. Funk behind the coke machine visible to all! Tables and floors filthy. And hardly anyone in the place. The manager or lead making customers wait while she scolds the counter help. Come on!"}
{"text":"I ordered their new Avocado Burrito with a small soda, they corrected me \"you mean the number nine\" (a chicken avocado burrito)... Um ok, they'd know their menu better right?  

WRONG... The chicken avocado burrito is DOUBLE in calories and fat (I couldn't even finish eating it, it was so gross)... Be careful when ordering, you may end up with more than you bargain for."}
{"text":"I usually love the \"fresh\" guacamole at this restaurant. We recently ordered two family sides of chips and guacamole. It was at least two days old based on color and taste. I called and spoke to someone who identified themselves as a manager and told them it tasted bad and I wanted \"fresh\" guacamole. After my husband drove all the way back to the restaurant we received two family size tubs half full and the same old, sour guacamole we were served before. Not going back to this restaurant. Guacamole is supposed to be green not border line brown. Gross."}
{"text":"I just got takeout and sat down at home to eat it. My very first bite/spoonful of soup came with a hair. Brown. Needless to say, I won't be eating that or there again. Furthermore, I called to let them know and they didn't offer me a new soup (not like I want one at this point) and simply said \"sorry.\""}
{"text":"I threw it out. I came at 5:29pm and must have received chicken left over from lunch. Hard as a rock, dry and inedible. This location does not do enough volume to provide a consistently edible product. Someone has to be in charge on sight to decide when to throw out old product. Who ever it was on my visit obviously did not."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes and making the customer aware of nutrition this fast food spot is pretty good. This location is close to home and saved me many times when I worked more hours than I work now. 

The number one reason that I come here is because it's so easy to get calorie counts. Calorie counts for each item are listed on the drive-thru board, the board over the register, and on a list next to the register area. This saved me the other night when my dinner plan failed and I ended up here last minute. They also offer plenty of options that actually fit into the average diet. The taco el carbon is only 160 calories and the crunchy taco is 200. Neither are huge, but at least they offer lower calorie meal options. 

The food here is probably more of a three, but I gave the bump to four for being diet friendly. My favorite items here are the tacos al carbon and crunchy taco. I like that they offer several salsas as well with my favorite being the avocado salsa. 

The service is hit or miss. There are plenty of friendly employees, but there are also a few that leave a little to be desired."}
{"text":"Went in today because my boyfriend never tried el pollo loco. I haven't had it in a long time as well and I found out why I stopped coming here when i got the food. The taco tortilla wasn't warm. The chicken was dry. The guacamole was old and discolored. The veggies also didn't seem fresh. Also, the rice was very crunchy like it dried out...nothing was good in this restaurant. I even had a cashier told me to wait because she had to cash out her emoloyees meals. I work in the food industry and this is unacceptable. I'm surprised how this place is still open.... taco bell, del tacos, tacos el gordo... any of these places will have better food than here.....do your self a favor and stay away.. I wasted my $20 on a shitty food. So much for Mexicans knowing how to cook Mexican food lol.. I'm Asian and I think I can cook better than all these fools"}
{"text":"Service isn't the best. Place was practically empty and we waited a good 5 minutes for our order to be taken even though no one else was in line. We watched them just chatting and talking while we waited. Tables were dirty and floor was a bit dirty too."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for the past couple months. Service is good and has been getting better each trip. I always get a Classic Tostada Salad, no chicken, no beans, no creamy cilantro dressing but with avocado salsa and pico on the side. That's my online/drive thru order. Dine in I get the same but I have the option to subtitute chicken for avocado. I wish I can do that online also. The best el pollo loco location near me ^_^"}
{"text":"I stopped by here today Monday 05/07 to pick up an online order through their drive thru. I was told by a lady that they were not allowed to give online orders through the drive thru so I had to come in. She was apologetic but I drove here since it was on the way to work even if I prefered and frequent the one on Sahara/Fort Apache because my trips there has always been smooth and it's closer to my home. It was such an inconvenience that I wasnt able to get my order through the drive thru as I had ALWAYS picked up my online orders through the drive thru at the Sahara/Fort Apache location with an ease. I dont know why they don't do what other El Pollo Loco does (online pick up through drive thru, substitute chicken for avocado, etc...) but I no longer plan on coming to this location anymore. Not only because of today's trip but also due to some stingy employees and often dining into dirty tables.

Seriously though, so many drive thru fast food chains like Starbucks and now even McDonalds let's you pick up online orders through their drive thru. Not to mention other El Pollo Locos in town has done it for me...this location needs to keep up."}
{"text":"It's Pollo Loco, so it's never going to be terrible. Food was on point with no complaints. 
Problems here were service and waiting time. We ordered lunch around 1145, so we figured we'd beat the rush by at least 15 minutes. There weren't many people in the place and we were able to get straight to the register. 
But after we ordered it seemed like a really long wait. As I looked over to the other side of the restaurant I noticed two employees who ordered and got their meals before us. Seemed awkward to me that as people started coming in these two looked like they were in lunch break too. 
If your in the lunch business I don't think you would take lunch at the same time as your clients. From reading some of the reviews it looks like this is a trend here. I may be back, but not when I'm pressed for time. It's apparent they have some timing issues."}
{"text":"not impressed!

ordered 3 tacos al carbon at 1.49 each and total came to 6.47.  

$6.47 for three tacos?  \"you didnt want the combo?  they want us to sell the combo.\"

i didnt ask for a combo.   cashier gets a manager and they started talking in spanish in front of me.  they had a little attitude afterwards

cashier, manager and food was disappointing.  

 i wont be back."}

{"text":"You can do a whole lot better for the price here. I came here for the first time ever because it was a late night and Chipotle was closed.

I ordered the Ultimate Double Bowl with chicken. 

Here is the description from the website: \"Double up on a double portion of delicious citrus-marinated chopped chicken breast or carne asada on top of authentic pinto beans, rice, cabbage and garnished with sour cream, shredded jack cheese, avocado slices and pico de gallo salsa.\"

1. The chicken was so overcooked. Parts of it were \"grilled\" (aka burned), and incredibly chewy.
2. Shredded jack cheese? Really? ...Because there was none.
3. \"Citrus-marinated\" - Hardly. The chicken was pretty tasteless and wasn't marinated in anything.
4. Tiny tiny glob of sour cream and tiny glob of salsa.
5. Mostly beans, rice, and chicken...pretty bland.

My stomach was in knots for the rest of the night after this meal. The quality of the food was just plain poor. I probably won't eat here again, but I try anything twice just to be fair. 

As far as the service, it was good. The drive through was incredibly fast and everyone was relatively friendly."}
{"text":"I like the healthy tasty food they prepare (broiled chicken) very much and i like the cilantro dressing, but some times it takes forever to have your order ready..."}
{"text":"Purchased chicken from your restaurant because the ad on TV showed  real good looking meat. When I got it home it was nothing like I expected, and nothing like you showed on your TV ad. It had black  (burned ) skin so hard I couldn't chew it.  What happened to thr sample you show on TV
I probably should have checked it before I left."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco chicken. This location is hit or miss if you get good chicken. The lines in the drive thru are always super long during lunch time and in the evening so be prepared to wait. On this particular trip I was especially peeved because they did not give me salsa. I don't know if I will come back to this location."}
{"text":"My dine-in lunch visit was A-OK. The classic chicken burrito combo (includes tortilla chips and a drink) was a great value at $5.00. The burrito was packed with plenty of chicken, rice, and beans. A toppings bar was available, but it was not being refilled so a couple of options were gone, and mild and medium salsas were not available. The dining area was spartan, but clean, and the service at the counter was efficient and fast (my meal was ready in about three minutes)."}
{"text":"worst el pollo loco ever! Slow service, they never have anything, and I am always missing something that I ordered."}
{"text":"Aside from the overly cooked chicken (which is safer than the other way around), I think this is a great place for lunch.  The avocado salad is wonderful.  The chicken is great once you put it in a tortilla and add salsa (since its dry otherwise).  I think for the buck, this place is wonderful.  There is variety and the food seems healthier than your typical fast food lunch joint."}
{"text":"Food was incredible.  I had the avocado salad and it was excellent especially for fast food.  I agree with others that the service was not up to par but the food made up for it.   This particular pollo loco needs better working registers, better training and coordination."}
{"text":"This is 1 of my FAV places to eat but unfortunately I must give only 2 stars to this location due to lack of consistency & competency. They're real friendly (well, most of them ) but they NVR get an order right!! Now pls understand I also had to have close to 10 bad experiences for me to even mention it but it's ALWAYS something! I'm sick of driving all the way back for my forgotten items or calling just to let them know but then nothing changes. I'm done with this location"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is fresh & delicious- plus my order is ready & not a lot of waiting. These people know what they're doing & they do it well! Flavored are on point & the creamy cilantro dressing is so good I could main line it! Lmao! I didn't try them for a long time as I assumed they were just another Tex-mex southwestern place but I regret it because I was so wrong! If you haven't been here try the ANYTHING! LOL
You won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"The service at the counter was poor. The order came out Wrong. The rice had hard rock like pieces in it. The soda machines had no carbonation in more than one soda and no ice. Worst of all..the restaurant was DIRTY. Staff wiped the food with a dirty rag in to the floor. The whole place smelled sour. Very disappointing !"}
{"text":"When I want fresh and healthy fast food, I go to El Pollo Loco.  The chicken is served piping hot, having been taken right off the grill.

El Pollo's chicken is flavorful - deeply marinated in citrus and herbs, then flame grilled - just love that crispy skin!  Another plus for me is their chicken is farm-raised, and hormone-free. 

For about 5 or 6 dollars, I get the 2 piece chicken combo that includes tortillas, 2 sides and a fountain drink.  (Look/ask for a coupon.)  My favorite sides are the spicy tortilla chicken soup and the crunchy coleslaw, but there are lots of sides - rice, fries, beans and salads.  Some other chicken dishes are the tacos, burritos. and bowls.    

It is a bright, clean restaurant with fast, friendly servers - I love it!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying \"I love Pollo Loco!\" BUT I would NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ONE!!  We were at GCU in Phoenix, AZ and wanted to go to a Pollo Loco because we do not have Pollo Locos in our town. 

In my opinion, this place DOES NOT DESERVE to be in the Pollo Loco Franchise! From the outside it is apparent that this store is run down. When we went inside, we got the same feeling. But we love Pollo Loco's food, so we were willing to go forward with our order. We ordered and sat down. The minute we sat down, we knew something was wrong. It was hot and stuffy. We got our order and took it to our table. That is when we really became uncomfortable. It was so hot in the restaurant, that we started sweating. We were trying to enjoy our food but it was just so uncomfortable. Some people next to us overheard and told us that they had complained to the manager but he told them the a/c was broken and just blew them off. I went up to tell the manager and he said the same thing. I told him that they should have put a sign on the door so people could decide whether they wanted to eat there, in those condition. He did not offer to comp the meal, not even to give us a refund so we could go to another place that had working a/c. Mind you, we were in Phoenix and it was about 110. It felt like it was over 90 degrees inside the restaurant! 

I got the district manager's (DM) info to call him and let him know what a terrible experience we were having in his restaurant. He explained the a/c was out, someone had been called to fix it and ok. I told him, there is another customer at the table right next to me who was also upset about how hot is was. He said \"yeah, I know. I already talked to them. He just DID NOT CARE. I told him \"Ok, I just wanted to let you know because the other customer and I were both going to do the survey to let the company know how bad our experience was. Then he said what can I do to make you happy. I said \"nothing at this point. 

OK, no problem. Chalk it up to a bad experience. But then, I noticed a broken window with a wet floor pylon right next to it. And, I wondered.... Has someone also been called to fix that broken window or is this how this particular store is run - things break down and they just let them go to save money? 

So, I took a picture of the broken window, the dirty salsa bar, and the dirty floor behind the counter. This is where it really went south and got weird. My husband and I left the store and were driving down the road when we get a phone call from the DM that I had just spoken to. He says \"I talked to you earlier and I want my manager to comp your meal\". I told him it was too late because we had already left. This is when he told me \"i just want you to know that this Pollo Loco is incorporated and if you write a review on trip advisor and some other review site, then you will be getting a phone call from our lawyer. I asked him if he was threatening me and he said no but my employees said you were taking pictures we have you on camera. I said \"good.\"  He said something like - if you use those pictures, you will be getting a phone call from our lawyers. I told him good-bye. I called the 877 customer service number. Told the customer service rep what had happened. 

About 10 minutes later I get a phone call from someone who says they are from corporate in California.   He starts the conversation out well, concerned, apologetic.  Then he starts to defend the situation regarding the broken down a/c and the manager and DM.  Then he tells me something like, I did review the videos and saw you taking pictures in the restaurant and just want you to know that what the DM said is correct.  He goes on to say something like \"this is private property and you can not take pictures.\"  I told him that I thought when they opened the door and invited guests in, they gave up their right to call something private.  He explained that they had already had a case where a disgruntled customer posted a bad review along with pictures was sued by Pollo Loco because some employees in the photos were under 18 and did not want their pictures used.  I understand but that was not the case in my situation.  Our conversation went on and then he went back to the pictures.  I stopped him and told him he did not need to repeat his threat.  I ask his name and title.  He told me he was Security Guest Service.  Does anyone know if this is a legit position at Pollo Loco?

I do not know what is going on with this Pollo Loco????  I will never return to this location.  I call out the CEO of Pollo Loco to do an undercover boss at this location!!!!  Hit like if you agree."}
{"text":"For being in the nicer part of town this place was kind of dumpy. I happened to spot it while on the look out for a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat during my lunch hour. It's actually located in the Albertson's shopping center.

When I went in the place looked disheveled. The salsa bar had not been wiped down, there was drippings everywhere. It looked as though the dining area had not been wiped down either. 

Next, I wanted to keep on their \"value menu\" so I ordered a taco al carbon, which they are pretty good. I also ordered the value menu side salad. I specifically said \"side salad\", which to me would indicate the fact I want a SIDE SALAD. Well, I didn't get a side salad, the cashier charged me for the salad that is $3.49. I didn't realize it until I sat down and looked at my receipt. But by this time I was just like, \"Eff it, I'll eat a bigger salad\". Nothing wrong with more veggies in my opinion.

Food - eeehhh. The salad was not cold like a salad should be. It was kind of strange temperature-wise, like maybe the salad had been siting out and someone forgot to put it back into cool-storage. Or maybe they're running their temps for the salad prep station too high. Either way, it was not good.

I'd say be wary of the salad items here... something fishy is going on..."}
{"text":"Oh oh El Pollo Loco! For the longest time I have ignored El Pollo and I am sad that I have. This El Pollo is not in the best part of town and I am sure this review food-wise can go for all El Pollo Locos in general.

I did the drive-thru here and there was a bit of a wait, even though I seemed to be the only car there. It was probably about 10:30 PM on a Thursday night. However, the lady working the drive-thru was nice. 

Here's what I ordered and the main reason I'm writing this review. Chicken tacos and tamales! They were delicious. What I loved was the simple, yet flavorful taste of the meats and the tortillas. The tamale seriously was amazing. I almost thought I was eating a tamale not from a fast food establishment. As a side note, I believe they only do the tamales around Christmas time.

I have had their chicken on occasion as well and I declare it to be much better than KFC. If I'm going to get a \"fast food\" chicken I will definitely pick El Pollo Loco over the Colonel."}
{"text":"Ecstatic to get one near the house... food was great not what I ordered but tasted really great. It was just a hassle to complete my order...when you order a taquito and the worker doesn't know what it is to give you a simple yes or no its no longer on the menu well than... ignorance becomes time consuming to explain to the worker what exactly a taquito is... who doesn't know??? Well apparently it's on the catering menu thank goodness so you'd figure someone would have a clue, then for micheal to also be rude well kids will be kids... sticking to the rainbow location at least I know I'll get my order right and better customer service... but overall the food was great at the location. It was a great laugh afterwards..."}
{"text":"Staff was knowledgeable about the catering menu, polite, great customer service, got my order right in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Fire grilled chicken...Do I give them an extra star for having healthy eats? I don't know. I don't like giving chain restaurants more than 3 stars!

This place seems pretty authentic...they have an orchata machine. I don't think I am a fan of that rice, cinnamon drink combo though.  Hey, to each, their own!  

Concerned with the pricing versus portion size however.  I hate paying a premium price for anything, and getting a little bit of product in return.  I don't like paying that much and possibly feeling hungry afterwards.  I could have gone to another chain restaurant, and eaten off the dollar menu, and ensured myself a full stomach.  

Good taste and skin crunch to the chicken. You can taste the spices on the chicken, which is always a plus in my book. Bland fowl...is well..fowl!  Sorry, had to do it!  Sides are decent in taste, presentation, yet not portions. Macaroni and cheese actually tasted as if they put some time and thought into it.  Corn cake had nice texture and sweetness.

All in all, not a bad place.  If it is around, I would make stops here on occassion."}
{"text":"Dang! I haven't been to an El Pollo Loco since I grew up in Cali as a teenager. There are quite s few around the valley, but had never stopped to check one out until today when I was so hungry after my Second Target in two days. All that clothes shopping takes a lot out of you lol. Anyways, I decided on the drive thru because one of my girlfriends had come with me and her babies (both under 3) were getting tired. Service was great and very fast. I was unsure what I would like so I ordered s couple things. They have a great value meal chicken al carbon taco they looked yummy so I asked to get that as a meal. They obliged and stated it would come with a drink, chips and 3 of the chicken al carbon tacos for around $5. Super deal! I also ordered a chicken pool bowl that comes with chicken, rice, tomatoes,onion, cilantro. It all was so good, very filling, and I wasn't left with that blah feeling after you eat fast food. All in all I thought for the amount of food I got it was a great deal. I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they have an El Pollo Loco nearby!! I've been saying for YEARS that they should open one in the southwest area! I love coming here because it's my healthy alternative. It's so easy to eat unhealthy around here because there's too many fast foods! By the end of the day, I just want to pick up food quickly and go home. El Pollo Loco offers that for me. Looks like they're brining the big cups back for salsa because they had these little dinky cups that only fit one bite. I guess I go at off times because it's not as busy as the other El Pollo Loco's can get. Going there tonight!! Can't wait :)"}
{"text":"Chicken was overrated and service was poor.  With so many other choices in the area, this place rated poorly."}
{"text":"I tried this place fir the first time ever, and man I can say they did not disappoint. My chicken was very moist with a nice flavor. The sides I chose the norm rice and beans (black) were delicious. I loved hoe the had the little \"salsa bar,\" for you to mix and match at your disposal.  

The food though on the pricey side, to me was worth it, for it to be on the \"healrhier\" side of fast food if that's a thing. I'll be coming back in the future if their is ever a time I'm not interested in slaving in my kitchen. Lol."}
{"text":"My walking distance chicken fix. May be my favorite fast food... maybe... 

I will say though: I'm not a fan of the fact that the double chicken bowl comes with a regular amount of chicken depending on the day. Just throw some chicken in the bowl and quit being so stingy haha (or else don't advertise as double chicken). It shouldn't be so bi-polar all the time. 

That's basically the only thing I order ever from there. So once that becomes a more consistent thing, I definitely want to re-evaluate and give this the 5-stars it deserves for a fast food place. But the content of the bowl only matches the title 50% of the time right now."}
{"text":"Crappiest food ever felt like it was microwaved sauces are bland no real flavor ..not even comparable to the ones in California which are ten times better with a better taste ordered the chicken bowl with avocado yet theirs no avocado on the bowl that I ordered ...chicken was not cut right either it looked liked they pulled the chicken into strands"}
{"text":"Tried it twice and was left highly disappointed both times. First I got the Tostada Chicken Salad. My \"go-to\" item on menu. Got home. Barely any chicken on it. I counted 6 pieces of cut chicken. 
Decided a week later that I would give them another chance and ordered the 2 piece combo with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. I went inside this time and saw that the dining area was terribly dirty so I had no place to relax while waiting for my order. The chicken was wimpy and somewhat dry. The mac n cheese was a watery consistency. No complaints on the mashed potatoes. 
Needless to say, I wont be returning."}
{"text":"I had Lunch here yesterday and was really looking forward to my salad as I would have one for lunch in CA all the time. It was a bit of a drive but I reminded myself of how delicious it would be... I stood in line and then waited for my food patiently. My number was called & I was very unsatisfied with the presentation of my salad! It was not at all what I was expecting, the size alone was ridiculous with only a few pieces of chicken. Next came the disappointment with the dressing which was runny and not at all the flavor I remember. I will no longer make this drive for lunch!"}
{"text":"EPL, as I call(ed) it back home, came to Atlanta as only a tease.  It opened 3 locations that offered healthier, more inspiring dishes than what say, KFC has.  Then out of the blue, all 3 locations closed.  WTF!?!  I need my crunchy chicken tacos!  This had been a crushing blow to my love of Mexican fast food.

So as we were driving around Dobson Dr. near Mesa, I saw a logo that looked familiar.  It was time we met again- I saw an EPL!  Of course we went in.

I didn't even look at the menu- I told the friendly cashier I wanted 8 tacos and 2 drinks- she looked at me like a glutton- but she didn't understand where I was coming from- as I tried explaining, she just laughed.

The dining room- a decent size.  The salsa- more flavors than I had seen!  The drink machine- served coke!  Now, to perfect the experience, I just needed the tacos...  And then they arrived!

It was like finding a long lost love and being reunited.  It was that wonderful.  I should have asked if they deliver across the US- I would even consider it!

It was just so wonderful to be re-united again..."}
{"text":"Always on point! Always quick! Never gets my order wrong. A solid overall place to get a quick meal when you need to. I never go inside so I couldn't tell you about the inside much. It looks very clean though from the drive thru perspective."}
{"text":"Coral and her team provide outstanding service and take care of their customers! Food is fresh and taste great!"}
{"text":"Chicken citrus avocado salad. I did try this salad because I like everything that's in it. Glad we had coupons. It was ok it just seemed like more lettuce than what the picture looked like. I like really good thick salads so if I am going to pay 8 dollars for one it better be a mega salad. It is El pollo loco so they could have put a bit more chicken on that sucker. Maybe a few more slices of avocado. Well it was tasty though. I really like el pollo loco the chicken is bomb. Wish they had one closer to me. :(  I am still a fan though."}
{"text":"How many times can you say no cilantro and you get home and there's no onion but a ton of cilantro. But seriously this has happened so many times it's so dumb. The girl in the drive-thru was doing so many things when I pulled up I understand why she can't take an order correctly. Also waited 25 min. Can't they just hire more people?

I called to let them know, ya know thinking they might actually care to take the time to do things right(prob crazy for thinking that) and I asked for the manager and she said oh uh yes speaking. There must be no managers."}
{"text":"Food is OK for fast food. But they keep messing up orders. The biggest thing that bugs me is they never heat up the tortillas enough, always to soft and still almost raw. They ask if you want salsa, then don't give it."}
{"text":"2 stars because the workers are not very bright and I've been coming here since they opened... I'm already at the drive-thru and 3 different people have spoken on the intercom. Don't they drug test? Apparently not. And these people want $15 minimum wage?"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going to El Pollo Loco. Their. chickens are tiny, I have never had a chicken breast that wasn't dry, and the way the chop them up there are little pieces of bone where you wouldn't expect it. Their salsa bar is mediocre at best with the mild salsa looking almost the same as the pico de gallo. They are blah. Their side dishes are good but the corn has red peppers which doesn't work. What I do like is the flavor of the marinade they use on the chicken. It is unique and I wish I could buy it, however it just isn't good enough to make me go to El Pollo Loco anymore. I wish they could figure out how to cook chicken so it came out moist."}
{"text":"Decent food, good prices, horrible service. Order came out completely wrong. Took the food and receipt up and explained what was wrong and they informed me what I had ordered was indeed correct...but it wasn't. They took the receipt (big mistake) and told me they would \"fix\" it and bring us the correct food. After 10 minutes, they forget. Ended up talking to the manager and since they had a few other people in line with similar order screw-ups, they just refunded us our money and we left, half-full and with no desire to ever eat at another El Pollo Loco again."}
{"text":"Jess is the BEST! She was so accommodating with us. She went above and beyond on her job. Great customer service. Thanks so much Jess!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Ever had a shrimp salad with unpeeled shrimp? Its disgusting and the tostada shell well about the same. I will never return"}
{"text":"The food and prices are good. But every time I go in there, there seems to be seedy people arguing over a taco just to swindle back money. Just creeps me out a little bit."}
{"text":"On vacation in Vegas June 4-6. First stop Signature resort. Second stop call Lyft and head to Tropicana ave for the best chicken in the world. Start off with a four piece meal with rice and beans and tons of salsa. Even after several years since my last visit  nothing has changed. When other restaurants increase prices and shrink portions, El Pollo Loco is still the best value in chicken. We had three locations south of Seattle but for what ever reasons they didn't survive. Perhaps you can bring a franchise to Seattle or Burien WA. Regardless I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal ever. First the chicken was way overlooked.  I ordered a 2 piece all white meat and the wing had a about zero usable meat and breast was cut at a point that made it smaller than usual and was so dry that I ended up throwing the whole thing out. haha I ordered extra tortillas, as if there would have been enough meat (had it not been so dried out) for more. The clerk actually showed me the \"plate\" prior to take out and when I commented she beelined away from me towards the back of the kitchen. I had no extra time to waste, so I rushed home just to cut into the small amount of food, and found out how over cooked and bad my food really was. I have ordered this meal before and it was always plump and juicy. The problem really was when the person walked away from my comments. In my book, that is a no-brainier. Bye Bye El Pollo Loco"}
{"text":"I really should've listened to my friends and coworkers who said that the company isn't what it used to be. Definitely regret it. First it takes forever to get our food with only 1 other customer and a full staff behind the counter.
I finally get it and I find a hair in my Mac n cheese. Gross. I toss it because I'm not taking it back just to get a special one returned to me.
They give me no utensils so I go back up, there's a guy in line waiting to order. No one has helped him and I continue to wait just to get a spoon or fork, everyone in view was just walking around slowly behind the counter or laughing/yelling and overall just messing around. At least 4 people saw me and the other customer waiting there but did nothing. After awhile I just sit back down. It isn't worth it. The food was unbelievably expensive and the quality was trash. You could go to Taco Bell and get the EXACT same thing for a better price. The only positive thing I could find was the salsa was decent. Other than that this place is trash. It's a big waste of space in the Safeway parking lot as if the parking lot wasn't a big enough cluster, it's even harder to maneuver with this big wasted space of a building in the middle of it. I don't mean to sound dramatic it's just a total lack of logic."}
{"text":"Went in to use the restroom and felt like I should buy something from them since I went in and used their facilities. The guy who served me did not care to acknowledge me right away and when he finally did it was after almost walking away.  He clearly has poor customer service.  When he returned he still ignored me until he finally asked for my order. After I paid for my order he then did not have change for me and was gonna make me wait for him to go find some so I just walked out with my drink. Having experience in restaurants and customer service, I feel this could of been handled much better. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"I spend every February vacation out west with my folks (I'm a teacher and they snowbird in Phoenix) and always make sure to make at least one stop at an El Pollo Loco.  This year I happened to choose this one and was not disappointed.  I love their chicken tostada salad and their spicy chipotle burrito was great.  The salsa bar is by far my favorite part of the chain as I love lots and lots of salsa on my salads and burritos and this way I can take as much as I want without an annoying waitress looking down her nose at me!

The only reason I'm knocking them down to four stars is because the actual state of the restaurant itself was pretty dirty.  I was glad that I was taking my food to go as I don't think I could have found a clean place to eat if I had tried.  However, I will continue my tradition of ordering from at least one El Pollo Loco when I'm out there next year."}
{"text":"I love el pollo loco their food is amazing however this one is the worse. The cashiers giggle to each other rudely the whole time and then when I order a side of mashed potatoes and don't get them it's upsetting. When I order a 3 piece I want good pieces not a wing that has one strip only of meat. Anyways called to let the manager know and she wanted me to drive back to just for the mashed potatoes I'm not saying I want extra but as a general manager myself I always throw something else on to show customer appreciation."}
{"text":"Apparently they forget to add chicken to the chipotle chicken burrito. I'll remind them next time"}
{"text":"Seriously, this restaurant continues to have issues. This past week, the MANAGER got my order wrong. I have decided to go to a different store just to escape the incompetence at this one."}
{"text":"The panhandling is out of control at this location.

While in the drive-thru, a bum, (or hobo, take your pick) will sneakily wait for you to roll down your window as you approach the speaker box. Then, before you can place your order, the asshole interrupts your well prepared sonnet about a number three and a diet coke asking for money. How fucked is that?
This caused me to roll up my window, (like any good American) relying on my overly tinted windows to shield me from his view. 
Unfettered by my sly window moves, he simply refused to shoo. 
This caused me to roll down my window and bust-out my best Spanish where I warned him to move away from the vehicle. I even said it like a cop to scare him.

Sadly however, the only thing I know how to say in Spanish is \"Cuanto de su hermana?\" or loosely translated, \"How much for your sister?\"
It worked.
He probably thought I had the crazy or something...who knows.

Eight pieces of chicken will cost you ten bucks.
It's pretty tasty stuff.

PS. I also know how to say \"Esta mota es mierda\" (This weed is shit)"}
{"text":"What a dump!

nobody is ever there  if and when we go, but the food is always over cooked, or small or burned,  and the service always stinks, even the  manager said \" well we have a large turn over of employees\"  LOL  

All I can say is I get a craving now and again for it, and the salsa bar, but I have been doing very low carb, and it didn't taste good, but actually looked okay. weird right?

anyhow I am over the cravings for anything, I am on low carb, I get no cravings, and food doesn't matter, health does, and eating here is not healthy!

I find id quite funny that the general El Pollo Loco's get 2 and 1/2 stars , but this one got 3, maybe not very many reviews means mine can bring it down where it belongs on the average! 

UGH YUCK GAG!"}
{"text":"Wife and I having dinner here for the first time.  It was quite busy.  Dining area was clean, staff friendly, kitchen appeared clean.  However, the bathroom was disgusting.  Food was just ok.  We did have to ask for our table to be wiped off and was left sticky.  We'll probably be back....  Just use your bathroom at home!!!!"}
{"text":"way better then taco bell, to me this place is the best mexican fast food joint out next to robertos in las vegas.  they are well known for their chicken but not too long ago they updated their menu with more good and tasty meals. everything on the menu is good but their is a green sauce they have that they make with i think celantro that you can pour over everything that makes it that much more tasty.  wish there was an el pollo loco here in hawaii.  everybody loves chicken so i know they would deffinently be an instant hit out here."}
{"text":"I've visted El pollo Loco on Shea & Scottsdale and they were much better.


This location:
Thermostat by the door said 93- WTH?

I used the App on my phone to order. After I sent it and Paid on app I went up to ask for my drinks because it was so hot. The short Hispanic woman working register said something about \" You have to order $7 worth\" I said \" I ordered $40 worth and already paid on my app, I know my food won't be ready we just want the cups.\" \" She said, You ordered online?\" I said \"No, I ordered on my phone app.\" My phone is in my hand and I'm waving it. \" You ordered online?\" Nope, on my phone app....This is repeated, maybe 5 more times. El pollo loco has an app or you can order online from their website. She finally just looks at me and says Yes, you ordered online.   Lady, WTF?? If I hadn't already paid, I'd leave. This is so uncomfortable. She goes into an office comes out and hands me our cups.

Food is ready in a few mins. Half of it is good. the other half- No.

Bean rice burrito has a few pieces of rice that are so hard, you just know that rice has sat around el pollo loco since the place opened.

Chicken bowl had the driest chicken. Chicken that was old not over cooked.

So I will stay clear of this location"}

Where the 2 dollars of product ??? They gave it to me in the little Salas size container that's the biggest rip off but shame on me for trusting and not checking!"}

Ordered a quesadilla with chicken as well... the results: 12 pieces of burnt chicken, salad had beans in it, lettuce in salad wilted, avacado in salad was old, no salad dressing, quesadilla did not have chicken in it, then... to top it all off... there was a hair in the salad! Called the store, no answer. Called the survey hotline and spoke to a live person. Ugh.. not eating there any more!"}
{"text":"I always had written this place off as another fast food place but the food is incredible. Food quality is way ABOVE title of \"fast food\"!!! I could literally eat the classic chicken salad everyday and in the last month, pretty much have!!! If you haven't tried them in forever, you need to go back, quality for price is completely ABOVE \"average\"."}

{"text":"So we went in tonight to get a replacement order from a couple weeks ago that they royally screwed up on! We got a little bit of an attitude at the drive-thru regarding it they made us pull and park for 15 minutes before we got our food their reasoning is because other people have larger orders and they were all behind us and drive-thru so we needed to wait longer. Yet again say makes more mistakes! When my daughter went in to ask them to finish giving me us are complete order they tried to argue with her that we didn't have the missing items on our original order my daughter explained look at the receipt and no there it was listed they gave her her soda with plenty of attitude and when she asked can we have our sour cream that yet was missing again they argued with her again rather than look at the receipt and the girl at the counter was told to put the sour cream in a container. A mind you when I originally place my first order I paid extra to have a Coke and a half sour cream! My daughter was treated very rudely! Now mind you it wasn't a mistake that we had made it was the first time around! I feel their food is overpriced and the very least they can do is when they make mistake is correct it and not treat the customer in such a disrespectful manner! We will not be going back!!"}

But last night we arrived at 8:50 and was rushed to order in the drive thru, only legs and thighs were available, and was given cold tortillas because \"they were closing.\" I understand that, but on the drive thru window it said dine-in and drive thru hours are open until 10 and it was barely 9 o'clock. We had a friend try to order who was in the car behind us and was told they couldn't order. On top of that they forgot to put one of the sides in our bag so we had to drive back to pick it up, luckily we had noticed when we were still in range of the restaurant."}

Really affordable and extremely valuable, but it's fast food chicken so remember that as well!"}

We didn't receive the tortillas that came with a meal so after going in and waiting in a long line for them came home to also find that the 2 dollar bowl of rice we payed for wasn't in the bag either.  We love their food but I also don't like just giving money away so we won't be eating here again"}
{"text":"Bad.  Stay away.   Unless you like dry chicken and empty tacos.  Go elsewhere.   Not worth what they charge.  Better off staying hungry."}
{"text":"Not the juicy chicken from the commercials at all!!

Since the opening I have gotten 3 Under 500 salads of the Double Chicken Avocado! The first was was great and the cilantro dressing ruled.  My only issue was my chicks. Was dry. Ok they just opened give them a break. The second time I went to get two salads one for me and one for a friend  the Chicken was DRY AGAIN and THEY GAVE ME THE WRONG DRESSING. so when we opened the bag it wasn't the cilantro dressing! So, they need to not over cook their chicken and get it right with your dressing! I'll give you one more chance and then after that if your Chicken is dry I will not come back!"}
{"text":"Worst first experience. I ordered a 2 piece chicken and asked for a leg and wing, I was ignored and they gave me a leg and a thigh and the thigh doesn't even look appetizing. On top of that we had asked for condiments (we were in the drive through) and they told us we had to pull around and get out of the car if we wanted condiments! What's the point of a drive through at that point?! On top of that the tortillas weren't even warm and were dry and stale, not exactly what I was hoping for, I was hoping for at least decent food. And on a less serious point, we weren't given silverware for one of our meals, seems like no one really cares about actually doing their job here. I guess I'll eat my Mac and cheese and beans with my hands?"}
{"text":"Exceptionally unfriendly service at this location in particular. Not common for El Pollo Loco. Considering I was helped by Silvia, the shift leader, this doesn't speak well for this location."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place a good review. The service was good, the food came out fast (we went through the drive thru), and the price isn't too bad. But half way through the meal my wife found a wire mesh (like the ones on the faucet in a bathroom sink) in her tostada salad. Not only is this level of neglect dangerous, it is just gross. What if that had been in a child's food? I don't think we will ever be eating there again.

Update: I talked to the manager and he offered a full meal replacement. My wife and I went into get the meal and they gave us a very hard time about it. We decided to dine in this time, and sadly more than half of the tables are dirty, both trash cans are overflowing, and the salsa bar is half empty. On top of all that they messed up my wife's meal replacement and gave her the wrong thing. The worst part about this is that they aren't even busy. This is a case of pure laziness. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"ADDENDUM: I just had the chicken tacos from here. They were pretty flippin' good! The tortillas were deliciously soft, the chicken was tender, and the basic stuff they put on it (onion, cilantro) were perfect. That is all."}
{"text":"Oh, man, I really like El Pollo Loco most of the time. If I feel like eating a ton, I'll have the Ultimate Pollo Bowl with sweet potatoes and a churro. If I like being healthy, I get the salad with a ton of the guac salsa instead of dressing. That versatility is something I love about this place, especially bc most other fast food places fail in that regard. 

Having said that, this Pollo Loco has been somewhat inconsistent for me. There've been time where I've gotten food from them and it's been perfect EPL: good, moist chicken and delicious salsa. But the last two times I've been there I've gotten OK food... almost to the point of it being bad. Still, the majority of times I've been there it's been great, so I haven't written them off just yet..."}
{"text":"I eat here on a very regular basis. My wife and I absolutely love the food here. I consider this the best chicken made. Tip: make sure you ask for the chicken extra juicy, it makes a world of difference. The manager Joseph and assistant manager David are always ready and eager to help. They great us with a smile and fast service. I can't say enough about this place. Come and enjoy for yourself."}

{"text":"Was here last night and the service was not good. The woman who took my order was rude. I have her name on my receipt but I'm not going to mention it for legal purposes. It starts with the letter \"C\". She was snippy and dismissive. No manners whatsoever. After the transaction she closed the window and then opened it again very quickly when I lingered for one second to check my order because THIS store has messed up my order before, giving me beans when I did not order them and giving me corn tortillas instead of flour ones. She was snippy and said \"You checking your order? Why? I thought I gave you everything correctly\" or something to that effect. Maybe they were pissed because I was using my discount and El Pollo Loco gift card. Not going to return to this location. The one on 51st Avenue in the middle of the hood is way better than this one. And the food tasted cold too at this one."}
{"text":"The other day I tried this new Pollo Loco here in Scottsdale and the drive thru line took FOREVER! You'd think they would have hired some experienced employees for the launch or train the newbies a little more. It was a sh* show and everyone seemed very disorganized. Please management help them since it should be quick going through the drive thru. Anyway.. I ordered the double chicken bowl and it was very good. I didn't know it only came with two tortillas so just a heads up there. No other comments.. just make sure you're not in a rush when you visit this location. :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a low-carb dieter since you can get 8 pieces of chicken with no sides and it will be a hearty meal (with leftovers) for two.  I also appreciate the fact that they have sugar-free lemonade and ice tea available.  I loved their new tropical habanero sauce.  So spicy!

This particular location was not the cleanest but ok for a fast food place.  The person at the register seemed friendly enough so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Fantastic Drive through. .. fast friendly service. Juat a good drive through Experience. ...will update on food when get home.

Eating The Chicken Avocado Salad. ... Yummy!  Thank you El Pollo Loco for Good food, good service at a good price."}
{"text":"I am so Pissed off anything I say will be vindictive.  This place Tues. June 20th 2017 @ 8:45 pm has really Pissed me off from the drive through girl to the cook... wow I already said too much...I'm just not coming back. It's not worth it anymore total pain never a good experience and I didn't even get to eat... what a crock!"}
{"text":"The classic chicken salad, rice, & beans were great! Love the creamy cilantro dressing. Yummy churros too! The service is fast & the people are very friendly & helpful. Will come back soon! Best El Pollo Loco i've eaten at so far!"}
{"text":"This location is filthy! Salsa bar is empty, dirty tables, trays laying around, bathroom had tp on the floor. Not to mention the chicken was dry. I don't understand why the workers couldn't clean nor restock when it was nearly empty in there. Overall a bad place to eat. Find yourself a clean and stocked El Pollo Loco. Avoid this location!"}
{"text":"First time at this place since moving to Henderson. Very disappointed considering I'm in Henderson not the hood. Went inside. Place is filthy. The condiment stand was disgusting. The floor was filthy. I ordered the chili lime shrimp tacos, poorly made. The shrimp was so tiny. I get bigger shrimp from the lunch truck that comes to my job on Fridays. Same price and the shrimp are huge blasting with flavor. I will never ever dine at El Pollo Loco again."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat and just got out of the gym. I grabbed some chicken that always hits the spot. They had a new jalopeno chicken sandwich that didn't look to healthy but looked good. The sandwich was ok but the chicken is always good."}
{"text":"Very excited this new location opened up. I've gone to the one on McDowell in Goodyear and I would not recommend it to anyone. But this one, I've been to on many occasions already since it's opened. My family enjoys."}
{"text":"$5 for a drink and original pollo bowl (rice, beans, chicken). Not a bad deal for a fast food place. It reminds me of a cheaper Chipotle. Definitely get the avocado salsa!"}
{"text":"I was here on Day One and I feel they've been pretty consistent with both food and service. It's nothing special considering it's a chain, but there's nothing to complain about either.

Overall, I'm glad this location opened up. It is very convenient for me!"}
{"text":"The meal itself (Well, what I got of it) tasted fine. The chicken was tender, with good marinated flavor. The sides were plentiful, and the salad was huge. 

Unfortunately, they did not include course 3 of the 3 course meal that I ordered to go, and did not realize this until I got back home. In addition, they were going to overcharge me on a coupon deal I redeemed (Get 4 free tacos) had I not noticed that they only took off the cost of 1 taco, not 4.

The salsa bar itself is a nice idea, but the station itself looked grimy, especially the lid and tray area. The pico de gallo looked really old, and appeared to have a strange foamy appearance, so I steered clear of it."}
{"text":"El pollo loco literally means the crazy chicken but I'm vegan and that's why I'm writing this review. When I don't feel like cooking or I am tired after work I always stop here for black bean , rice , and guacamole burritos and a big order of broccoli  . They are always so kind and gracious when making the adjustments to my order and I appreciate it so much. The burritos are so good and filling not to mention cheap :)"}
{"text":"Here is the deal - I love El Pollo Loco in general.  We eat their chicken often, but this place is consistently slow, slower than the other locations - and it was really bad tonight.  So bad, I had to write about it.  I waited in the middle of the drive through line (where I was stuck, or I would have left) for 20 minutes because they ran out of chicken.  I was getting fairly frustrated and was considering never coming to this location again EXCEPT the drive through guy was so nice and apologetic.  

I didn't take it out on him - he was just the messenger - but he was immediately apologetic, gave us 10% off and a free side.  He was doing the best he could.  If the owner of this chain happens upon this review, I hope he/she will take some time to properly thank the young man who was doing what any owner hopes employees will do - care about the customer."}
{"text":"Horrible bought broccoli as a side order and the broccoli had bugs it was completely infested don't recommend this place for anyone they don't wash the produce"}
{"text":"Ok, I hope it wasn't just a fluke, but today, for the first time in years, the Customer Service and Quality food has returned to this location.  I can't remember how long it's been since this location has achieved putting out great fresh tasting chicken, but I was quite pleasantly surprised with both the food and the friendly service today.  
I have to assume this location is under new management, and to whomever is listening, thank you."}
{"text":"The restaurant was just OK.  The customers are not greeted or thanked.  No military discount advertised or offered.  The restaurant looked dated and run down.  Nothing special to see here."}
{"text":"Just a note, it has been over a week since I went on the corporate website and still no feedback.  Also, the local EPL never commented on my review.  Obviously ELP doesn't care about the bad reviews & comments."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!! This new el pollo loco location is beyond wonderful! The outside of the restaurant as well as the inside looks modern and clean! I love that this is right next to where I work! I can go to dinner as soon as I get off....it's great! The staff here is so sweet and friendly! Luis has exceptional service. Chicken as well as the sides are very tasty and satisfying. I had the chicken tenders meal with mac n cheese and cole slaw....very good! I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"This location is always awesome, very clean and the workers are always so super sweet. El Pollo Loco has the best chicken el carbons ever!! Love this location"}
{"text":"This is my 1st visit and will be my last.  They say first impressions are lasting well yes! Yes they are.  The place was not clean the bar where pico is was disgusting, and i thought to myself someone needs to clean or change the pico.  Then i went to look for a table and couldn't find a clean table, i had to clean one myself.  Not sure if i will another location a chance probably wouldn't be fair to X them all out.  But it will take a minute for forgiveness.  My husband did not enjoy his food at all. His chicken wasn't hot and they had his plate of rice waiting on the counter where other patrons are over his food.  Bad food changed his whole attitude lol i guess hunger and disappointment makes u a beast i will buy him a snickers"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  I was super surprised at how good it was.  It is not cheap.  It is also not fast... At all.  I think the first time I came here I waited 20 min during the lunch rush.  Next day it was slightly better but not by much."}
{"text":"I always forget about how good the food is at this chain. Clean and healthy-ish, especially when compared to my Quicktrip taquito & soft pretzel diet that I am on multiple times each week.

The food always has been fresh and hot for me and the quality is fantastic for the price.  I've gotta stop in more often!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  Too bad the restaurant doesn't match their prices or quality of food.  I'd say their burritos are comparable to Chipotle.  This was my first time here and will not be going back.  Mostly I just felt like there are so many other places with just as good of food that are priced much better and have a better environment, so why would I come here?  Overall, poor value... $7 for just a decent burrito?  No thanks.  Not here."}
{"text":"I love pollo loco but seriously they don't know how to make anything on the menu correctly at this location /:"}
{"text":"How you goin to get rid of the stuff quesadilla wtf get the fuck out of here that's the best fuckin thing on menu fuck"}
{"text":"Doesnt open in time its 9 and the dude said 10 mins  come on man wtf this place needs to get its shit together.... Its supose to be open"}
{"text":"A fast food chain that is fairly consistent for their grilled chicken.The menu is edging toward pricey, the orders are sometimes mistakenly executed, and the bathrooms are just barely a notch above a truck stop. It's becoming more difficult to patronize this location."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru at approximately 10:45pm. Keep in mind, I never eat fast food, but I had never tried El Pollo Loco's food before & I heard that there are healthy and inexpensive options on their menu. 

When I drove up, I attempted to place my order and I must have sat there for approximately 2 minutes before I was acknowledged. After I attempted to place my order, the person at the window answered \"we don't have enough of the ingredients to make that dish\". I tried to choose another option and was told again \"we don't have all of the ingredients\". The worst part, was that after I was told that neither of those options were available, he said, \"We are closing soon. You have 1 min and 58 seconds to place your order.\" I was beyond appalled and extremely disappointed. Needless to say, I told him to forget my order and drove somewhere else to get my late night dinner. 

I added 1 star because I mentioned this unfortunate experience on Twitter and El Pollo Loco promptly replied, which is a plus in my book. Unfortunately, this experience was beyond unacceptable and first impressions last a very long time."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero star rating, I would. I've been here three times now ever since they've opened and each time gets worse and worse. 
Each time that I have been there, I've had to wait more than 10 minutes before someone finally comes and takes my order. Mind you, this place every time I've gone, is never busy and I'm always the only one waiting in line. 
Sometimes in the middle of the order they'll just turn around and start talking to the cook. So basically what I'm trying to say is, they have the absolute WORST customer service.
Not to mention the many times they've given us overcooked chicken that's been sitting out for so long. It's overcooked and it's not hot - it's pretty much just chicken jerky at this point. Each time I've called about it, they'd tell me that it had just gotten off the grill and is freshly hot. I've been to plenty other El Pollo locations and I know when the chicken is freshly cooked. When I bring the chicken back to show them, they just say, \"oh...yeah that's overcooked.\" No shit that its overcooked! 
Three times now. I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but never again will I go back there."}
{"text":"Three stars mostly because its added to the very short list of places my kids(gluten sensitivity) can eat....otherwise probably wouldn't be my first or second choice for fast food. The chicken was way too dry but I also noticed that we came in at the end of the \"lunch chicken\" laying on the grill. As soon as we were leaving they started a fresh batch! Bad timing I guess."}
{"text":"The manager is so rude here... don't come here never coming again. Dark red hair maroon shirt. Chicken Taco didn't even have chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Southwest Bacon Salad I've ever had! The staff is awesome so you just have to come in and try their exceptional food!"}
{"text":"El Pollo loco is the Spanish word for crazy chicken. After spending hours hiking in Fletcher Canyon then driving across the valley, I felt like an el pollo loco. I was dying of hunger in a part of the Warm Springs corridor where there really isn't many restaurants. After a few year hiatus of dining in an El Pollo Loco, I'd choose this one as my post - hike dinner.

  On a Saturday night, it was calm. A line was nonexistent. I ordered the two piece breast and wing that included two sides and two corn tortillas and a small drink (self-serve refills) for less than  $9. The chicken was good but not GREAT. I'd take Raising Canes or broaster chicken over this in a heartbeat. Regardless, I have nothing bad to write about the chicken. The two side dishes that I complimented the chicken with were rice and cole slaw. I enjoyed the side dishes as much as the three star chicken.

   After leaving El Pollo loco filled up and no longer feeling like a dying of hunger el pollo loco, I walked to my car with the impression that my meal was good but short of the greatness of a Chick Fil-A or Raising Caines."}
{"text":"I have not caught El Pollo's (translated as the Crazy Chicken in Spanish) act in a couple of years. I had no plans to catch it's act today. But when your an active Yelper funny things can happen. What happened was that I was in a nearby Starbucks reading some of my Yelp friend's reviews. While reading my Florida Yelp friend Rachel F's recent reviews, her review on a Pollo Tropical in Florida caught my attention. She was saying how it reminded her of a West Coast chain named El Pollo that she missed. From living in Orlando, I remember that El Pollo Tropical reminded me of El Pollo Loco. Rachel F's review and pictures convinced me to toss my Starbuck's cup in the trash and motor over to El Pollo Loco. 

   This El Pollo Loco stands off Stephanie Street in the Walmart Neighborhood Market in the heart of a fast food chicken zone that includes Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, and Raising Cane's. The majority of the chicken chains came after El Pollo Loco which was built in the mid 2000's.

  Although El Pollo Loco is more than chicken, I have always ordered the two chicken combo. The two chicken combo that I ordered was a breast and wing. It included a small fountain Coke beverage, two flour tortillas, and two sides. The two sides that I chose were cole slaw and rice. I'd pay Jonathan $8.54 for the meal. 

   Jonathan who represented El Pollo Loco had a good attitude. This included asking me how my day was going. After my wallet became slightly lighter the beeper he presented me with made my hand slightly heavier. It went off a few minutes later when the meal was ready. 

  The meal came on a black disposable plate with a plastic fork and spoon. I have mixed feelings in regards to what was on the plate. The chicken breast was a generous size. I enjoyed the citrus-marinated and fire roasted taste that El Pollo Loco promotes. The problem that I had was that it seemed to be that the main meal was a chicken breast and chicken bone. In the picture below, you will barely make out the chicken wing. Before touching the bone, I brought the tray to Jonathan to inquire if they accidentally served me a chicken leg with the breast. I never recall the wing being all bone. He confirmed it was the wing. If El Pollo Loco is serious about serving this in hyper crowded fast food chicken market, they are really El Pollo Loco. Writing off the chicken thigh, I enjoyed the side dishes of cole slaw and rice. To enjoy the two corn tortillas, I added a couple of cups of hot salsa for flavor. 

   Based on the fact that I paid for a chicken breast with wing and got a chicken breast with bone and that I am more impressed with some of the nearby competition, it would be El Pollo Loco of me to rate it four stars. I rate it three stars because it is a solid fast food restaurant that satisfied my El Pollo Loco craving."}
{"text":"Love El pollo loco. Excited to have one open close to home and office. Which then lead to disappointment. Been a few times now. Service is horrible, none of the orders have not been right. Went today decided to go in to save time and ensure my order was right. Got a 3 pc combo. 2 breast and thigh - 8.89 Cashier tried to charge me extra for the breast. Charging 10.69 fir the combo. Stating I had to pay fir the breast. Showed her on the menu. 3 pc. 2 breast, thigh, 2 small sides and small drink. Cashier then tells me the manager would have to help. Well if she was a manager or leader in any way it did not show today. I would say she was over promoted. She could told me I was paying for the drink, then the extra tho d breast. Which the drink was included and I did not order a third or extra breast. She opens the register gets the difference in cash and leaves it on the counter for me to pick up after assuming and asking if it was my change. Now here's the worst part manager did not check my order. Got back to the office and opened my combo to see 2 legs and a thigh. My sides were to be mash potatoes and broccoli. I got potatoes and corn. Not only did you over charge me you didn't even get the order right. Now I paid for a 3 pc breast and thigh and got 2 legs and thigh which would costed 6.89. I ask El pollo loco to give this team training and a manager to run the business correctly otherwise you just might be closing one of your newest doors due to loss of customers. FYI as I waited for the manager to TRY to correct Tony order each and every person son that was in line before a d after I (at least 7 customers) all came back to the counter as their orders were wrong. Manager did not take control or even coach her team to ensure it didn't keep happening. GET IT TOGETHER!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst places to get tacos. Got take out. The crunchy taco was disgusting. Shell was burnt. There were only 5!!! BURNT & TINY pieces of little chicken buried under a pile of lettuce. If I wanted a salad I would've got a salad from some place else. The worst part was the taco itself was in pieces when I took it out of the foil so I ended up just throwing it in the trash."}
{"text":"It's El Pollo Loco.  Unfortunately, during the summer they aren't that keen on cooling the place to make it a pleasurable dining experience.  Also, at sunset, there is very little window shading so the sun blinds you."}
{"text":"Got the chicken with mac-n-cheese, rice, fajitas.  The sauces are amazing and the chicken is fresh.  I love this one in particular because it's clean here.  If you are an athlete or a clean eating foodie. I recommend this place to try. Don't hesitate.  Take it from me this one won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Although it was hard to find even though I have seen when on the 101. Google sent me to the parking lot across the street. When I got there it was like most others.  Really clean, food temperature is hot when served. Had the 3 piece dark with 2 sides. Love the corn and side salad which I wrap up with chicken in the Tortilla."}
{"text":"Love this chain but drive through gets really backed up sometimes. Great food & can be healthy depending on how you order!"}
{"text":"Truly unmemorable food. For a place that claims to serve a Spicy Chipotle Burrito, I'd like to know where the spices were. The salsas that were tossed in my to-go bag...I wished I had taken a picture of them. Water, tomato \"pieces\", some lame spices, all stretching the limits in a bad way of what can be considered to be salsa. And as part of the meal deal I ordered a fountain drink. How can you mess up Sprite? They found a way. It was so disgusting I didn't even get out of the parking lot before it was spit back out. 1 star. And even that's a stretch.

Edit: This location was visited at approximately 6 pm on 3/23/12 and with people in Denver and LA talking about El Pollo Loco I was hoping it would be good. My expectations were not high, but they still disappointed me. My apologies for being negative but I call it as I see it."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp salad here I come here and other locations because it's convenient and when I just need something healthy and fast."}
{"text":"I have a family of 6 every time I've tried to pick up dinner here they don't have chicken or the wait is over 20 min. I'm sorry but this is not good business I don't think I will come back to this location. 

Tried giving this place another chance. Still no chicken"}
{"text":"I have never been inside, only use the drive thru. I ordered single combos and have also ordered dinner for the entire family. They have never rushed me through an order or have they messed up an order. Their food is always good and tastey. Very good location."}
{"text":"I like to eat here at least 4 times a week cause i don't like to eat crappy food and it is the closest place to my house, after tonight i am officially done. I go here way to often 2 hours ahead of closing and they have no chicken and refuse to cook more because they are lazy. What are you even getting paid for? Why even stay open that late then? 
Chipotle just gained a new customer ill just leave it at that!"}
{"text":"We live 4 blocks away and we are here at least once a week, for the past year. We never have issues here...customer service is quick and polite. Food is ALWAYS delicious. 

This is our favorite LV fast food joint and this location never lets us down."}
{"text":"not too shabby. first time here and you dont expect fresh food from a fast food restaurant. they were very nice and patient as i pondered through the restaurant to see what they were all about. i chose the #10 meal with chips and a drink and added a chicken taco al carbon on the side. it seemed really small when i got it but it was full of flavor. if i imagine going to a taco truck, the tacos are sorta the same size. it was foiled up so it seemed smaller. the burrito was awesome! esp when you drench it and pour 4 different types of salsa all over it. their salsas are actually legit (better than some authentic mexican restaurants that i've been to). they were sparse on the chips but i decided not to complain about it since it was my 1st time. food was good, chips were small in number, but i'd come back to try their grilled chicken. my friend say she go CRAzaaayYy over that chicken! El pollo loco babehhhh."}
{"text":"Busy place with a lot of traffic.. the price is right but the presentation and quality of food is subpar..  had the the two piece combo (breast and wing) with two sides.. the chicken just didn't look or taste good.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"First time here, brand new, awesome and delicious! 

Service was great, will definitely be back.

5/5"}
{"text":"Our mistake was ordering the quasadillas; which looked great in pics, but came out nowhere \"stuffed\" as they claim on the signage or pictures.

The food was decent and the salsas ok; but if I hadn't eaten their chicken from other locations, I would never be back.

My recommendation is to order the chicken, which is freshly cooked on the grill and stay away from the goofy new dishes they are pushing."}
{"text":"I usually don't have too good of an experience here, but sone past visits have been much better. The pair that helped me today, were so polite & professional, and very prompt. The food's hot & everything. Very pleasant atmosphere today. Very clean, as well. Great job guys, especially Luis & Jeselia. Thank you for a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Dirty! That about sums this place up. Walked into this place because I was in the area and I had not been to one of these in years. The food is okay, but once I had ordered my meal, I began to notice how dirty the place was. The floors had dirt stains on them and no one had mopped up. There was a small bucket sitting on the service counter that had a rag in it an some type of cleaning solution for wiping down the tables. The trash cans behind the counter were viewable and they were full and had trash laying on the floor around them, and the final things I noticed were the condiments bar and the drink area were dirty and had not been wiped up in quite awhile.
Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite. Yummy healthy food. Service has been amazing. I'm so glad they opened close to us."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Pollo Loco but this location changed that. Granted, it was my first visit here so maybe it was an isolated case (hopefully.) Nonetheless, I have to speak up about how horrible my experience was. The people's were okay but NOT the food. There's was nothing fresh. The chicken was edible but all the sides and fixings were old and stale. Sorry, I won't be coming back here. I'd rather eat at taco stand down the street."}
{"text":"We got at least 10 pages of El Pollo Loco coupons in the mail a few days ago. Decided to use them for lunch. Went inside to order and had no expectations whatsoever! I knew what I was about to get!  So, we ordered the 10 pieces of legs and thighs with flour tortillas ($10 with coupon)
and two large soft drinks for $1.99 each .
Soon after we sat down, our order was already ready on the counter, packed in the to go box, despite the fact that we ordered to eat at the restaurant. Asked for plates so we could share the meal. Well, never received the plates! We ate from the white to go box. 
Chicken was absolutely tasteless, so bland, no flavor at all! Also very small pieces. Almost like cornish hen! I'm not accelerating! 
I remember when chicken tasted very yummy at El Pollo Loco, well at least a while ago.
I was craving fire grilled chicken and saw their advertisement in the mail. I fooled myself to go eat their food once again! 
I don't think I go back soon."}
{"text":"Unclean store, litter all over. Unfriendly staff who don't speak English well. The food is pricier than Chipotle and not as good. This particular store is worse than the others in every way."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken Cobb salad. Love the fresh salsas. The spicy avocado salsa is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Despite my lack of check-ins, I've been to this location at least a dozen times in the last couple years and i really like them. I've never had a problem at this location. Let me say that again, this location! I have had food poisoning from the location on baseline and mcclintock. Anyhow, this location is always really clean and the staff are very friendly. I've never had an issue with bones like others have stated and the food is always fresh. I like the ultimate chicken bowl and the avocado burrito is really good too. The avocado salsa is good too!  Plus they have cherry coke! Win!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day for lunch and was really surprised at the quality of the food and reasonable prices.. I had a cobb salad that was excellent and my friend had a burrito that he really enjoyed. If you are looking for something fast, reasonable, and good food, I would highly recommend this. !"}
{"text":"I just went threw the drive thru and ordered a Mexican Cobb salad, i got home sat at my table mixed up the salad took about 2 bites and realized I had a hair in my food  took it out started looking around and found more hair mind you my hair is up in a ponytail and I have blonde her this hair was dark down  disgusting"}
{"text":"Where do I start. I mean pollo loco is pollo loco. I usually do the whole drive thru deal but this time i decided to come in and sit. Customer service is ok as expected but thats not my issue here. I was afraid to eat or even breath without sucking in GNATS i mean they are everywhere.  I kept having to wave my hand over my food so they wouldn't land and have a field day on my food.. it was pretty disgusting.  And to my surprise my boyfriend notices the wall right behind me and its full of gnats just hanging out. And a whole bunch gnats hanging out by the salsa bar so im pretty sure we had some gnats take a dive in the salsa. DISGUSTING! i mean they have to notice this. Pretty disappointed, makes me wonder how sanitary they are in the back cooking.. looks like we won't be coming here."}
{"text":"I visited this location during a busy lunch rush and was pleasantly surprised how fast the drive thru line moved. My double chicken salad was superb and flavorful and the drive thru girl(not sure her name, blonde hair very pretty) was professional and very sweet. I will be returning! Thanks for the delicious crazy chicken!!!"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I were looking for a place for lunch today and saw an El Pollo Loco restaurant on Tropicana that had a large sign in the window that advertised 10 pieces of chicken legs and thighs for  $10.00. We went inside and quickly decided that it was a great deal after looking at their menu prices. We went up to the cashier and placed our order and was promptly told that they were out of legs and thighs!!!! I asked the cashier if they were substituting anything else for the same price and she said no. I said how long will it take to get the advertised special, she said 20 to 30 minutes!!! I was in complete shock and disbelief!!! A restaurant that sell NOTHING but chicken was out of ANY kind of chicken is ridiculous!! I asked her again could she substitute something else and she again said no! We drove across town to the El Pollo Loco on Stephanie St and they had plenty of chicken as all El Pollo Loco restaurants should have. Needless to say I will NEVER go back to that particular restaurant. I wonder how many other customers were told this today."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. I used to come here a bit but after the last couple times I've changed my mind. If you don't have certain cuts of chicken please don't lie to your customers and charge them extra!!! This happened too many times, just let the customer know and they'll be fine. Plus the customer service here went down hill almost instantly! Went to the drive through and I got stared down by some low life who worked there, I was so shocked to get this sort of treatment since I was paying quite a bit. I felt robbed, not gonna lie. I understand if the customer is being rude, I work in retail so believe me I've dealt with some assholes. This is why I try to be the best customer, but people like these guys are just useless and should be replaced with people who want to work. I'm done ranting but just to sum it up, don't waist your time because obviously you're waisting theirs."}
{"text":"I've been there many times and the food has always been tasty and hot. The condiments are very fresh and the sides are also very tasty.
I will keep going here when I want great food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"First time at a pollo loco. I wish we had more in Texas. Nice 5 dollar deal with chips and drink. Self serve drinks, salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco! The people who work there are so nice. I'm so picky with my the way I order my bowl and they get it right every time.  The inside is kept tidy and clean.     
The tostada salad bowl is amazing.  It comes with rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, pico de gayo, sour cream, and chicken.  If you don't want something on your bowl, you can ask for it to be on the side, or not on at all.  They make a creamy cilantro dressing which tastes really good with the salad.  Along the side, next to the drink fountain, there is a salsa bar.  I usually get the rojo salsa and the spicy avocado salsa.  I love an extra kick in my food.  Another item I like to order is the churro.  Totally reminds me of growing up in S. Cali. every theme park I had gone to, I had to have a churro. 

I like to come here once in a while to quench my craving for the tostada bowl.  I guess you can say estoy loca por El Pollo Loco :)"}
{"text":"My go to for chicken breast and salad, except my salad has been wilted and less than appetizing the last few times I've gone. :[ please keep the lettuce fresh."}
{"text":"If I could give the restaurant a zero I would. I had a horrible experience and they kept getting the orders wrong. I asked for no cheese and they gave me my salad with cheese. I asked them about it and the lady went back and just picked it off. The service took forever and is not worth the time. The food is not even mediocre and lacks flavor."}
{"text":"We were in the drive thru and after ordering our food we could see an employee handling the cash and then putting his hands inside the bowls prior to scooping the rice in it. As we arrived to the pick up window another employee was scratching the back of her neck and then handling the drink cups. Yikes!!! We cancelled our order and informed the manager. My hope is that they are re- trained on proper food handling and sanitary practices."}
{"text":"They call you order by name which can get confusing when there is more than one person with the same name. As for the food, I've seen better."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I have been waiting for this restaurant to open close to my part of town for a while. This is a brand new El Pollo Loco and as far as fast food Chicken places go this place is great. I was greeted right when I walked through the door and the person taking my order was super friendly. There was no lack of friendly service and you could tell by the full tip bin that lots of other people agree. I love the fact that you can see the grill and prep area. The sound of that meat sizzling makes my mouth water like a Pavlov experiment. The condiment station was clean and so was the dining area.

It could be the cooks or it may just be because its new, but the chicken just tasted better than any of the other El Pollo Locos I have eaten at. I even managed to convert someone who was not into El Pollo Loco food into a fan.

Good food, good service, good prices and a clean restaurant. That's more than enough for me. I'll be back here frequently to see how things progress but based on this first experience I am a very happy camper."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a quick snack. Customer service was friendly and the food was good. No problems."}
{"text":"I usually don't like chicken, but when i do, its Pollo Loco. I love their dark meat, so juicy and flavorful, and especially their skin, so crunchy. Some people may say the skin is a little salty but i think its just perfect. I don't usually get anything else but the chicken, but i have tried some of their other items in the past. 

When it comes to sides, i love their fries because they are soft and squishy. The beans are pretty good as well. the only item i am not a big fan of is their spanish rice. I think its a little dry and doesn't really taste like real spanish rice should taste like. 

They also have a new under 500 calorie menu. I've only tried the Chicken Enchiladas but i thought it was a great deal, came with two enchiladas plus rice and brocoli. Also the Chicken tacos, 2 tacos, with guacamole and pico de gallo.

Very affordable, efficient, and can be healthy if you choose the right options."}
{"text":"Another visit to the Crazy Chicken with afternoon munchies after Jimmy Johns delivery shut us down  due confusion on their boundary lines.  We walked in and two people in front of us and it took the cashier 10 minutes to take their orders.  He also had issues taking ours and needed help. Is there a 101 cashier course they can take?  Hate to be a Bitter Bob but when they only had 10 wings I almost lost it.  Then we had to watch our food sit ready Togo on the counter before they gave it too us. We bought $50 in chicken and the food was great but really can't these guys get organized to deliver Customer Servive!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken but failed on wait time and forgot coke slaw, salad dressing, tortillas. And beans were all juice and little beans.  Better step it up and get more employees.  Could be a gold mine."}
{"text":"Came through drive-thru around 8pm and ordered a 16 piece meal and a double chicken tostada salad.  When I got home, I was missing eight pieces of chicken.  I called and talked to Elizabeth and told her of the mistake.  She asked for the receipt number so she could pull up her copy.  She put me on hold for a few minutes and came back on to tell me that I DID receive my entire order because the employee was positive they had packed it.  I told her no, the employee was wrong.  She then said she would have to look at the camera.  Again I was put on hold for maybe a minute,  then came back and said we will give you another eight pieces.    No apology, just attitude.   I drove back and this time, I went inside.  I handed the receipt to the young man and explained what happened.  He handed the receipt to Elizabeth.  She never came over to apologize, in fact she didn't even look in my direction.  I know we are all human and can make mistakes but to give a paying customer attitude for a mistake made in your establishment by your employee is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The service here was great.  I say that because we arrived here about 10 minutes before closing, on two occasions in the past 6 days.  Even though they were already cleaning up and putting things away, the employees still managed to get us some food and send us on our merry way.  The reason we arrived so late is because we were on a road trip and by the time we got into town, all we wanted were some salads and some chicken.  Each time we were here, we ordered about 5 salads and a lot of chicken (ordering for 10 people).  Never once was there a grimace or a sigh or an odd look as if to say \"don't these customers know we are closing soon.\"  

Thanks El Pollo for putting up with us and feeding us right before closing time!"}
{"text":"I didnt feel too good for 2 days after grabbing the tacquito's for lunch, too greasy so I prob wont go back."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh ! Hard to believe it's fast food ! They keep this location always super clean .. love the decor .. we loaded the app today and got a FREE Original Pollo Bowl !!!"}
{"text":"Got a message from EPL through yelp asking me to file a complaint through their website. No."}
{"text":"Great place for chicken. I come here about 3 times a month, Love the corn and black bean sides"}
{"text":"First time here. I'm disappointed!   They forgot some of my food and my lemonade was water. The rest of the food was good and they were friendly. I tried to call the number on the receipt and they wouldn't answer  so I'm just out my money I guess. Not sure if I would ever go back and give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Just got a bunch of tacos that were smashed to pieces and burnt. Tasted disgusting, barely edible. They couldn't even roll them up in foil correctly because there was loose food all inside the plastic bag. It was a total mess. Never going to el pollo again."}
{"text":"When u order a avocado chicken burrito and u only get one chunk of avocado in the whole thing. 2nd bad experience. Next time I'm just going to taco bell. At least it's cheaper."}
{"text":"First time I have ever given a 1 star ever as a review. 
It is rather saddening. I go to El Pollo Loco every so often, however, a different location. Came to this location as it is closer to Chinatown area.
The 1 star is due to its El Pollo Loco taste. The chicken has a good seasoning and spice in addition to its charbroiled taste.
The wait was horrible. Do not expect a fast 'fast food' place. If you are ordering their chicken, you should expect at least a 20-30 minutes wait time. While waiting, I even saw my food laid out in the open (box opened) getting cool before they actually called my name. My chicken ended up only warm. 
The saddest part is they ran out of forks. How do you run out of forks?!!? Especially during lunch time. We were eating there at the location and asked for plates and utensils when the worker told us, \"Sorry we are out of forks, we only have spoons and knifes.\" 
It really is a shame that I have to give a one star, other El Pollo Loco locations are more efficient. Just this one tends to be a lot slower. Definitely something to beware of."}
{"text":"Order two double chicken salad and my entire salad the lettuce looks old and the pico (tomatoes) looks old. It seems like a few times that I have eaten here the double chicken salads they are serving is the fresh and up to par. This is a shame because I use to always eaten here and since the salads are still looking old I won't be eating here again. The entire team should be aware the salads they are serving to customers. I will not be eating here in the future."}
{"text":"I just picked up some Pollo Loco at the Glendale restaurant I received excellent service from the counter person named Michael he was very personal very excellent service I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I had ordered a two piece combo chicken dinner to go  when I arrived home and I opened up the containers I saw that my two pieces of chicken had no skin on it I believe my food was tampered with and I've complained about it but have not received any reply I'd be very careful in going to this restaurant... today I was contacted by the district manager his name is Willie ..he was very apologetic about my experience at the Goodyear Pollo Loco and he was very sincere and wanting to resolve the issue which he did and informed me that a new general manager was assigned to the Goodyear Pollo Loco to remedy any problems which may exist as a loyal customer Of Pollo Loco I will return to the Goodyear restaurant"}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience and meal at El Pollo Loco. Lunch was not good today. First, I had to take the chicken back because it was undercooked. Then I had to wait at the counter as they cooked the breast longer while the rest of my meal sat at the table. (they should have brought it to me or given me a different piece).  They were very understaffed; one young lady behind the counter and a manager who seemed focused on the drive through and indifferent to customers in the restaurant. Also, there was a measly amount of dressing on the salad. Lastly, the garbage cans were full which is kind of gross. EPL is a personal favorite. I hope it was a blip for this store on this day and is not indicative of a downhill slide for the chain."}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming here thinking things will be Different? Today I ordered a family meal from \"Sebastian\" who was so busy chatting with the other workers about non-chicken/food topics that he said the \"F\" word right in front of me as he was taking my order which was rude! When he handed me the food, I asked for a couple of the larger red and green salsas which they keep in the back and he handed me two empty containers. As Sebastian would probably say - wtf??"}
{"text":"Tonight I brought dinner home for my family from this El Pollo Loco. I had their chicken Cobb salad. It was not like a real cobb salad especially because I found TWO lettuce cores and one large very dirty piece of lettuce in it. Please see the pictures. There is no quality control at El Pollo Loco, I guess. I don't think I will be back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I decided to try the shrimp tacos and a coke. They up sold me into a combo which added chips. The chips were awful threw them away. The tacos were so hot they were uneatable. I picked the shrimp out to eat after wiping the hot sauce off. The corn tortilla was thick and awful so I threw it away. Drank the coke. Pretty expensive meal when the only redeeming quality was the coke"}
{"text":"S L O W !
I like El Pollo Loco, but when I walk in and nobody esle is in line and it takes awhile for the girl at the registure to acknowledge me and longer for my food to arrive...my desire to retrun declines. I'll still frequent El Pollo Loco, just not this particular store."}
{"text":"this location is Not closed..i dont know why it says it is, you also cannot check in here..but go anyways, you really cant beat the pollo here."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I visit el pollo loco all the time. I don't eat much fast food so it's one of the few spots I can grab quickly and it be halfway healthy. I usually do the wing lovers which is all wings (4) and a side which I get black beans for like $6 sometimes they don't have enough wings so it's not available but usually it is. I visited the Az mills location this morning at about 10:30 asked for wing lovers and Roberto the team leader told me they didn't have any wings ready. I knew it was early so I said okay what pieces do you have. He says any piece you want. I told him I wanted wings so he says I can buy wings at regular price but no specials. Now I've never heard of this but fine. I buy 3 wings and a side of black beans which still comes to $6 and some change so I'm confused but whatever. Well when my wings come they are HALF a wing. I look like what's this? The wings are literally cut in half. Now keep in mind I said I come here often and get wings every time. I go back to the counter and ask Roberto why are the wings cut in half he says that's our wing lovers. Now keep in mind #1 I didn't order wing lovers because Roberto said they didn't have wings and #2 that's a lie because I've never seen a half wing. He lies a third time and says we always cut them like that. I become annoyed and just ask for a refund so I can leave because there is not much you can do with a liar. I'm not sure why Roberto didn't just want to give me whole wings like I wanted and like they serve them every day. Maybe he's having a bad day. I've come to this location plenty of times and never a problem. Roberto took my rating from a 4 which I would give it to a 1 because I don't know if he's hustling wings, harbouring wings or just in a bad mood but he ruined my drive thru lunch. Won't be back. At least not to this location. Roberto is a liar you guys don't cut your wings in half bad for business Roberto!!!"}
{"text":"Well... reading the reviews I was hesitant to go here but.. I decided to give this location a shot because I am nearby. Well should have listened to the experiences of others because I had a bad experience as well. Went through the drive thru took a while, even though there was no line. Received my food went home they forgot the sauce that they charged me 59 cents a piece for (and I got 6) and missing half of the chicken. plus the food was eh especially the chicken which was dry and tasted like it was left out for a while. Next time trust the reviews!"}
{"text":"I'm so pissed and disappointed at the service that I received tonight I pull up to The drive-through speaker to someone playing their bull s on a cell phone and then it goes to a girl then I go to a guy need to go to a girl and not a for people nobody could help us place that order so I went to the restaurant I yelled at everybody because they're so unprofessional there they played some kind of skit from a cell phone that says I haven't seen you in a long time what's up The Mexican lady tried to claim she doesn't understand English so I don't know why she's working the drive-through if she doesn't understand English so obviously she was playing stupid. Kid that claimed he was a manager didn't do crap about anything! A$$holes a girl  has got to eat! I just filed a report for corporate so anyone else needs the number here it is 18773754968"}
{"text":"Weird drive through layout.. in the Frys shopping center.. customer service was good.. 

I had the double chicken avocado salad.. under 500 calories.. Chicken was dry and some ends were burnt .. they left this on the grill way too long. There wasn't enough salsa or dressing to moisten the chicken.. who ever chopped this chicken for the salad should have removed the burnt ends, not serve them to the next customer..

The little salsa containers are a joke, they are barely filled .. I poured two on my salad (see pic).. no flavor or maybe not enough so I could taste it .. 

Disappointing.. won't be back here.."}
{"text":"One of the bests HEALTHY fast food places is the U.S. The staff are very friendly and helpful to first time patrons. Everyone in Vegas is nice to tourist. The portions are generous and you get free chips and salsa with your order. Oh and get this, the have Vitamin Water at the fountain and its the same price as regular soda. (included in the combo) Mind Blown!

I don't know how they get their chicken so juicy and I don't care! I just love it :)"}
{"text":"That was the strap to the high chair I had to put my daughter in ! The cleanliness of this place is horrible ! When I asked the girl at the front for someone just to wipe out the chair she asked me just get another one. ! No clean it it's your job !"}
{"text":"Went to this location last night, got a pretty simple family meal that comes with 2 sides...AND SHOCKER...one of the sides was wrong.  I asked for rice and mac&cheese, got rice and beans *bleh*.  I think I'm going to just start tracking the \"mess ups\" on Yelp!  So sad...it's LITERALLY every time I come here, something is wrong.  First time, missing a burrito that I was charged for, second time no chicken on my salad when I asked for no pico...third time no tortillas in the bag, and on and on.  This was my SIXTH VISIT!  0 for 6 is pretty sad...Too bad there isn't one closer to me.  All I can do is laugh...it's hysterical."}
{"text":"I love fast food but this is the kind of place where it's clear that management makes a difference in the franchise. The food always tastes great and every employee there has always greeted me and treated me nicely. I'm a regular here and it's for a reason."}
{"text":"Just had some of the driest f'n chicken with a side of customer service with an attitude.  Never again..."}
{"text":"It's 118 outside and the a/c doesn't work. No acknowledgement from staff. I'm sweating while I eat!
Water on floor and when asked if they knew, they said yes and walked away. 
They finally mopped floor, and left trash under tables. 
Food was great, as is usually the case, but this location is horrible!"}
{"text":"Great food for the healthier side of life people like myself but want to grab food quick......"}
{"text":"I was excited to order Pollo Loco because last month we had a good one served by our friend in Henderson. My husband just ordered a take out in this store and their chicken here was the worst ever! It was very dry, chewy, burnt and bitter! And the pieces, legs and thighs were rather small."}
{"text":"Good by Taco Bell! If you want a fix for inexpensive mexican food this is the place! 

I had the double chicken avacado salad tostada and wow! It was huge! And the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful. Can't go wrong with avacado.

They even had a homemade house dressing and salsa. I had a hard time eating it all.  The best part was the price! It was about $6 and it filled me up.

This was my first time. I'll be back lol"}
{"text":"We just go here for the bowls.  We tried the kids menu and our kids liked the chicken and burrito. The portion size was a little small and the chicken was a little dry.

We love the avacado bowls. We get the chicken and shrimp and the mango chicken bowls.  The bowl is not oily and the vegetables taste fresh.  We love their creamy lime cilantro dressing! We will never get tired of their bowls!"}
{"text":"Jesus, Long wait for one...had to repeat my order multiple times and still shorted me items. Will not be going back to this location again. How hard is it to make sure all the items are in the bag??? Love paying for food I don't even get to eat."}
{"text":"Although we lived very close to an El Pollo Loco in Las Vegas, we only went there 2 or 3 times in 15 years. The food was good, but the price seemed a little high. This EPL opened up last summer right near us. We got a coupon with the newspaper and decided to give EPL a shot. 

My wife got the Baja Shrimp Tostada. She liked it even though she only ate about half of the tostada bowl. I got a Fajita Burrito. It was quite large and was good. There is much more rice than I liked, but I would rather have too much than not enough. 

We would have given this ELP 4* instead of just 3. However, we also ordered an Avocado Quesadilla. While it had a lot of tender and tasteful chicken, as it was supposed to have, there was zero avocado. Very disappointing. 

The drive-through service was fine and the sauce we were given was good. Mistakes happen, but you would think with a product called Avocado Quesadilla, they would remember to put on the avocado."}
{"text":"My food came out fast and perfect. The cashier tried to to sell me but wasn't discouraged when I said no. This was the cleanest el pollo loco I have ever seen in 20 years of eating at them. Even the trash cans were being wipes down between taking orders. My food was perfect. Every chair bench and table was clean, which I have never seen. I wish this location was closer to my home."}
{"text":"A great mix between an authentic Mexican taco restaurant and a high quality barbecue spot. We got in around 4 and the smell of delicious chicken greeted us. The lady serving us and taking our order was pleasant, bilingual, and able to help us pick something to try for our first time here. The salad was crisp cool and fresh with plenty of pollo. The burrito exploded with flavor and was enjoyable all the way through.
If you aren't in a chicken mood I see that they also offer carne asada. But I haven't yet tried it. It does get a bit more busy by 5:30 on the weekday so try to get there a little early."}
{"text":"I just left for lunch and I get the same thing evey day. Today they didnt even fill my salad bowl. I am going to have to get a 2nd lunch. I can't believe I paid $11.31 for this."}
{"text":"Food is awesome the chicken and steak tacos are very close to Mexican street style maybe better and the chicken soup is the best. I eat hear alot but recently had a bad experience in drive thru and inside, employees don't know how to split orders and the guac sauce i asked for never made it in my bag and i didn't have time to go back as i was on a lunch break"}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I first saw an El Pollo Loco being built near my house!  I am from Cali and this is/was the only \"fast food\" joint I would visit!
As a non-meat eater, I always order the BRC (Beans, rice, cheese) burrito with a side of their Mexican corn (delicious!).  This was my third visit - but today I received the most soggy, moist and watery burrito ever!  It was actually gross!  I ate one  quarter and threw the rest away!

I don't want this to be a diss on all El Polo Locos'.  Usually their brand has high standards of quality.  My belief is that it is this particular location - they are having a difficult time recruiting and maintaining quality staff.  

I hope they rectify this issue soon - so they don't ruin their brand with this one rogue location!

Hope this location improves soon!

Peace!"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of El Pollo Loco locations and this one is about average.  On the day I came is was clean, which is important, and not overly-crowded even for lunch on a weekday.

For those who don't know, the claim to fame of the El Pollo Loco chain is grilled chicken, marinated in citrus and cooked over an open grill.  Although the breast can get a bit dry, this is a great way to prepare chicken.  You end up with crispy tasty skin and moist meat.

One problem - sometimes a bird is undercooked.  The wing in the one I got had a small uncooked area.  It is hard to get the entire chicken cooked properly, and a lot depends on the skill of the one doing the grilling.  That is going to vary from day to day and location to location.

The chicken may be 4 star, but the sides are disappointing bland and just not tasty, and about all that is left are the tortillas and sodas which are ... well, they're just tortillas and sodas like anyplace else.

I did notice a list of interesting desserts, including tres leches cake, but was too full to try it."}
{"text":"It's fair for the most part not to expensive tasty good stuff tho my first time there I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I received a code for a free $7 entree.  I tried to call to place an order but they were so busy they asked if I could wait 5 minutes.  Hell no, That is way too long.  I said I would call back.  called back in 5 min and the phone was constantly busy so I got into my vehicle and drove there. This was at 6:30 in the day and was over 100 degrees outside.  I picked up the mango shrimp, chicken platter.  I had asked if I could just get the tacos and she said that for about $1.00 less they would add beans and rice. OK so if I save that I can always not eat the beans and rice, right?  I drove home in less than 10 minutes and took the platter out of the bag only to find it to be cold.  It also was not as pictured as there was supposed to be more than 1 slice of avocado.  Could it have been due to a free code I was using?  I do not know. I only know I would be quite hesitant in ordering there again"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with service or food and we live down the street and have eaten here a several times. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  The order was ready before I could get done at the salsa bar!  Horchata is a beverage choice!   I thought flan was a dessert choice,  but maybe it was taken off the menu (haven't been to one in a long time) or I'm  getting it confused with another place.   They offer churros.   Overall experience was nice.   The shrimp avocado  burrito was good.   The seating area was clean.   I would return."}
{"text":"I use El Pollo Loco for catering - yes - catering.  They deliver and the food is great, healthy, on time, and easy.  The chicken in particular is really good."}
{"text":"NOT a fan! The service was very poor and when I got my food, the contents of the burro were cold... The place isn't exactly clean or classy either.. Somewhere I'll be avoiding in future."}
{"text":"I went to this Pollo Loco last night and Ordered a Steak Bowl and found out that was temporary. :( sad panda. 
I was so looking forward to it. last time I ordered it in December they had ran out of Steak, but had just enough for my companion to have it... so not only did I get to smell its deliciousness... I got to see it up close and not have it. then... realized my chicken bowl while still beign good came topped with onions.. sad panda
well this visit: I ordered a regular ORIGINAL BOWL with chicken. with no onions, pico - but with tomatoes and the register guy offered me cilantro alone, yes I will take that. 
What I GOT: 
an ULTIMATE chicken bowl w/ sour cream, guacamole, cheese, (that i didnt order) missing the tomatoe and cilantro that I did. 
ah well.. they gave me the more expensive dish and negated the stuff I wanted. ah well what are you going to do.. eat half since they have me an extra 500 calories on my bowl from the sour cream, cheese, and guac. . and took off the lite calories like tomato and cilantro. . 
sad panda
I still ike pollo loco but i dotn know how to be more specific when ordering but to speak slower? write it down? point to pictures? maybe theres a # system I can use?"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, the cashier uzi is not the friendliest I would rather drive to another location. The management skills here from the managers is very poor I highly don't recommend to come here if your looking for a nice and friendly welcoming from your local restaurant."}
{"text":"Popped in at 9pm tonight, 
Joseph was courteous and friendly, and made my experience feel personal and welcoming!!! He exceeded all my expectations, and anticipated all my needs BEFORE I even asked. 
He helped me through the ordering process with a smile and great attitude. 
My meal was perfect. Hot. Correct. And
Delicious. I will be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Worse El pollo loco I ever tried!!!!! I will never go there just because of this experience that I had. I took Rancho burrito with chicken and what I got???? A lot of rice instead of chicken. Staff doesn't know how talk to customers. Sauce bar was empty. Worse place ever!"}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious! I'm a huge fan of their mac&cheese too. I've only been to this location once, it was a Tuesday night around 6:30. It wasn't really busy, but the tables seemed dirty (the floor under the table was awful). We had ordered one of the family meals and asked for a couple water glasses. They said they were out and grudgingly gave us one soda cup for three people. That's a little ridiculous. It's not our fault they were out of water glasses, there's no need to be all grumpy about giving us cups. We really did only want water. That's a minor issue, I know, but it was frustrating to need to share one cup between three people. We can't drink soda right now, so we weren't going to buy a soda cup just to get some water. 

Apart from the stupid cup issue and the slightly dirty appearance, it was fine. The chicken is always amazing."}
{"text":"If I could I would give them no stars....for just now opening they're not doing so good. I sat at the drive thru speaker for about 20 minutes and was saying hello and trying to get someone's attention and no one came so I left and when I was passing the window a male was standing there talking with other employees with his head set on.....not very good customer service for just being open. Maybe better training or better employees......"}
{"text":"Ordered the half chicken meal... got the smallest pieces, the 2 piece meal had more chicken... the wing didn't have any meat on it, just skin.

Don't understand how the food prep or cook could see that this is acceptable!"}
{"text":"My favorite here is the Ultimate double chicken bowl.
I have them make it with only chicken..rice and beans.
Skip the other non Mexican stuff. Probably have it every 2 weeks. Excellent...Only 4 stars as the booths are worn out and need replacing. More attention needs to be given to all aspects of cleaning."}

{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for months! Today I had a long day at work and thought I would pick up chicken from this new place for dinner! I went thru the drive thru and all the staff I interacted with was very nice. When my boys came home and sat down to eat they go \"don't buy this chicken anymore!\" I thought the same when I ate my double chicken avocado salad. Not a fan"}
{"text":"Worst pollo loco so far. I gave them a try a few times thinking maybe I just had bad luck. But nope! The food is always bad. The chicken it so bland and flavorless."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars!! This location is horrible... came here to the drive thru Monday for a wing lovers for lunch ... get back to work to eat it and unfortunately it not edible ! They sold me chicken jerky ' I'd would've rather they said they didn't have good enough wings for sale instead the sold garbage! I call the restaurant back to see what they could do spoke with a woman manger and was told to come back with the week and they would replace.... no problem! I get here on a Wednesday only to be told they have no record of anyone calling ... HOW CONVENIENT!? Yeah I see the low rating is there for a reason! Go elsewhere!! Better yet cool at home! You get exactly what you want!"}
{"text":"When Myra was the manager this place was tip top!
Now it's a dump. Filthy. Grilled chicken is always delicious but the place is so dirty and completely unmanaged. Drive to a different one. Find out where Myra went. Ick!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  The chicken was tasty.

Service was WAY too slow, and the guy at the register didn't even give me a number which didn't help at all.  I remember coming here in the drive-thru a few years ago and it taking a long time then as well.  The taste is good here, but not distinctive, and for the money I can't say it's a great deal either.  For this kind of upper tier fast food Mexican (as compared to Taco Bell or Del Taco, which is lower tier), Rubio's blows it away completely

Doesn't suck at least.  Nice to try for a change every once in a while, but not my first choice when looking around for something to eat."}
{"text":"The Chicken and Avocado Rice Bowl is a nice addition to the menu. The size is generous and filling for the under 500 calorie option. I still prefer the grilled chicken.... In this category for fast food chicken bowls El Pollo comes in first place but next time I will eat the chicken!

What I loved... We were given a buzzer for when the food was ready. This was genius because I have never liked waiting with the crowd when it is busy. 

Three Stars I am not sure how El Pollo can change this, but the salsa bar is always a little messy. Unless someone had the job of watching it for every spill, with the volume that they do it would be difficult to keep it clean. We also chose the cleanest table we could find. For the price point, that is something that could be done better."}
{"text":"Poor management.  We walked into a very crowded restaurant.  Tables, bathroom and salsa bar were dirty and needed lots of attention.  We informed the manager the trash was overflowing, his response was, \"alright.\"  We watched him joking around with employees and we approached him again and just pointed at the man who was going to take it out.  He waited until the designated employee was available to throw it out, instead of taking it out himself."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food restaurants around las vegas, regardless of it being a fast food. Its fresh and healthier then eating a Mickey D fry or burger. I usually just order the 2 piece meal. This restaurant beats KFC, Church Chicken and Popeye in my books. 

Service is prompt it being a take out and with there friendly smile. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat chicken or craving for chicken."}
{"text":"Super clean El Pollo Loco location... Like crazy clean. Food was solid. Don't know what all the really bad reviews are four. It was one of the better El Pollo Locos in the valley."}
{"text":"Had chicken 3 pcs dinner combo with soda

Total $ 8.35 vs KFC $ 10.70

food: good
service: very good
discounts: seniors, vets, etc"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food.  Just a little pricey but always delicious."}
{"text":"I normally love their food but this was the first time in this location I did ordered  Chicken and Avocado in a bowl dish, the chicken was so dry it was almost impossible to eat it, my friend went to complain to the manager but for some reason he was not present. Next time I will go to the one on Shea and Scottsdale as previously the chichen there was very tasty."}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times in the last couple months. Everyone is so nice. I tend to have difficult orders and they always fill those orders without problems. I was having difficulty carry things to the car and an employee and the manager both offered to help. They are all amazing and I love going to this one."}
{"text":"Muy bueno pollo y carne!"}
{"text":"Excited this is less than 1/2 mile from my home.  Fresh, delicious fast food.  Great salads."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst location we've ever been to. If you're going to close your drive thru 15 minutes before closing time 11pm then change it to 10:45pm."}
{"text":"Great fresh food...not stingy with the salad toppings plenty of chicken plenty of avocados plenty of everything fantastic salsa bar!!! Great customer service we will be back."}
{"text":"A step up from usual fast food, the chicken is marinated and the sides are mostly healthier.
 I love the new Tostado bowls. I get them without lettuce, cause, well, lettuce. 
 The people are friendly, and other than forgetting the avocado once, get the drive thru order right.
 Parking plentiful now that Borders is gone.  (Sob)
 They have a salsa bar, and I like them all. The bar can get a little messy, and the outside is never spotless.
All in all, four stars, understanding that I hold fast food to a lower standard than most places."}
{"text":"This place was one of the worst el pollos I have eaten at. No clean tables to sit at, the trash cans in the place had nasty gunk all along the top on the outside and the salsa bar was scary. The salsas looked anything other than they had been prepared that day as advertised. The chicken I had was slimy and pink in the inside. Pretty much turned off to this establishment."}
{"text":"Drove over and they said a 20 minute wait for a 12 piece chicken... wtf. All you sell is chicken!!!! Lame and never again."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly, but everything else was terrible. The chicken was bland and dry. The broccoli seemed like it was microwaved, not steamed. The rice was dry and crunchy. The salsas were also bland for the most part. I was hoping for a little better from El Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"Positives:
-Freshly cooked, moist meat, cooked directly in front of you.
- Good prices
- food quality better than taco cabana
-Free wifi
- fast service
-Large menu
-rewards program for customers
- catering provided

Negative:
-Low parking
- not fresh hot sides
- wilting salad
- bland beans
- instant potatoes

Low parking, odd turn at drive though with parking next to it, which would result in difficulty backing out from the already sparse parking when the drive through line is long.
Not very convienent in and out vehicle wise due to low parking and drive through exit still requires an exit through the parking lot again.

Good prices for the quality of food, of which the meat is cooked immediately in front of you. The hot sides are prepared and left to sit in pans in a heating bath, so I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for fresh.

Free WiFi, though I am always weary of public free WiFi though.

They offer a rewards program through an app, so if you are a regular customer, it would be beneficial. For every $1you spent, you get 1 point, 100 points = $10!

They cater, my hospital therapy department had them cater one of our lunch meetings, and the chicken was moist and flavorful, being the best part. The salad was partially wilting, the mashed potatoes were instant, and the pinto beans were bland."}
{"text":"Since we really like El Pollo Loco we went back last night around 7pm.  The staff is very friendly, and it seemed that their was lots of management around.   But I just cant seem to get over the fact that the chicken the past couple of time was way over cooked (dry & deflated is the best i can describe it) I just cant recommend them at this time. So disappointed  cause we really like their chicken"}
{"text":"Now for fast food I must say El Apollo Loco is one of my favorites, but my visit today fell short of expectations,  got the 1/2 chicken combo for $10, but I think the chicken was malnourished, cause it was so small I left hungry.  also had the pinto beans amid broccoli which was tasty.   as for the chicken it was over cooked and dry, such a shame.  I would probably come here more often, but have had same issue before.  this location is the closest to my home and still drive 15+ miles to get my El Apollo loco fix.   glad they are opening a new one in the Goodyear area.  let hope quality/quantity is better.

Now for the service the staff is very friendly and prompt, that is one of the reason I have continued to come back. If this stars were based on service only they would have got 5 stars,  but because of cost vs. quantity I will not go higher.

El Apollo loco get bigger pieces of chicken, your price of a meal is not on the cheap side so stop getting such small chickens"}
{"text":"This experience was awful today. Usually it's nice but today it was extremely hot. My cheeks are flushed from the heat.  I asked the employee to pull down the shades but he forgot so I did it myself.  Them the Mexican music station was staticky and kept cutting out.  Then a homeless guy walks in and starts begging from people and the employees are too much in their own world to notice he even walks in. Homeless guy leaves snd starts begging from people in cars in parking lot. Employees are too busy chopping and talking in Spanish to pay attention to what's happening to customers.  

The bathroom always stinks so that is nothing new.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love love love their food, but the employees never get your order right! Today I went in the drive thru and ordered the double chicken tostada. There was no avocado, sour cream, cheese or dressing with it.  I didn't even want to eat the salad after that. It was way too dry. I love el pollo loco but they need employees who are more capable of taking simple orders."}
{"text":"Good service and great food!! Not greasy or overdone, delicious chicken and fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"last time i come here always mess up my order i ordered a shrimp chipotle not a bean n cheese burrito and they charged me extra"}
{"text":"Two stars since it was fast and efficient.  I order the corn chowder.   Too salty and  Bland, hardly any corn and no corn flavor.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"I live close by but I haven't been here in like 5 years because El Pollo is really overpriced and meh for what you get. I visited this past Saturday because our other choice restaurant was packed.

The positives:
- genuinely nice people at the register
- food didn't take long
- the tortilla chips were seriously impressive
- place smelled wonderful because of the roasting chicken

The negatives:
- overall impression of the food was of mediocrity. I had the chicken avocado salad. The chicken was really dry. I understand that they'd use leftovers for salads like this, but this chicken had definitely been kept on the warmer too long. The amount of chicken was good, though. The greens were primarily iceberg lettuce and therefore tasteless. The provided dressing was surprisingly good, but it can only do so much to dress up cheap, bland iceberg lettuce.
- filthy restaurant. It was half empty and all of the empty tables were dirty. I grabbed some napkins to clean up the least-dirty window seat so we had a place to sit.

So... this visit really affirmed why I haven't visited El Pollo Loco in years and why I won't return unless it's a last resort."}
{"text":"I guess it's okay if you don't need anything special apparently if you need anything that isn't a regular menu option you need to call ahead 20 minutes so we went elsewhere. Customer service was horrible they were incredibly rude to us. Just for wanting extra thighs"}
{"text":"Aiesha (sp?) was terrific!   Great food as always and the best service I've ever had at an EPL!   :)"}
{"text":"I still have fond memories of El Pollo Loco when they introduced their spicy orange Fuego sauce. It was so good, I could've poured it on a flip-flop and eaten it. Sadly, the Fuego sauce is no longer to be found. And I was hugely disappointed in the quality of the condiments available in the salsa bar.  Upon my most recent visit to this particular restaurant, I found the salsas to be watery and flavorless. I had stopped in to try their new fish tacos and was disappointed. Not only were the fish tacos unappealing and tasteless, but the equally unappetizing salsa couldn't do anything to improve the flavor.

I also ordered a individual piece of chicken and found it to be as I remembered... delicious! So I don't know what is going on with El Pollo Loco's menu nowadays, but they can still do their chicken right. I am once-bitten, twice-shy about coming back here, but if I do, I will stick to the chicken."}
{"text":"came into El Pollo Loco for chicken at 9:00pm (an hour before close) attempted to order half of a chicken but they stated they were out of chicken. I was confused and asked, \"if out of chicken what do I order? Isn't this called the crazy chicken?\" The gentleman then stated, \"oooh we still have chicken but only for burritos and stuff.\" Still confused cause thought they continued grilling chicken for everything. Ended up having to order a burrito and saw chicken on the grill grilling when I pulled up? 
still confused and not very satisfying"}
{"text":"Yo I'm butthurt as fuck. All I wanted was some chicken, black beans & rice. Got the chicken but everything else was just fucked.. like yo I just want some freakin black beans & they got me fucked up with these pintos. Also, DID YALL NOT COOK TORTILLAS??? Because this shit raw as fuck lmao. Like I get it, working in restaurants can be stressful but damn just double check the bag of food before you hand it out the damn window."}
{"text":"Growing up on the east coast, I am a EPL virgin and finally got around to trying it today after living in Vegas for a few years. I saw the Chicken and Street Corn bowl on their menu and thought it looked surprisingly appetizing for fast food and gave it a try. I should have known better than to trust staged fast food advertising photos!!

The bowl was decidedly less presentable as it slid back in forth in the plastic to go container it was packaged in from all of the grease/oil in the ingredients. They also forgot to put the chicken on my bowl, so that was very disappointing. Besides that huge oversight, the seasoning of the ingredients was better than expected and the avocado was ripe, but it was a cardinal sin to leave off the chicken when it was the only protein on the entree and chicken is also in the name of the restaurant! 

I'm sad to say that I have no desire to give EPL another chance and will stick to my east coast chicken offering of Chick-fil-A when I am craving fast food!"}
{"text":"Gerald was so AWSOME!!! He came to our table and greeted us asked us if we needed anything and talked to the baby like he was a pro!!! He even came over to say by to us when we left"}
{"text":"It's a chicken chain, but I prefer this grilled up chicken to KFC. It's one of those chains I'm guilty to like because it's simple and chains tend to be consistent.

Unfortunately, first few times I went here the chicken was undercooked.

Recently we tried to go early since the last few times were near to closing and this time it was cooked just right.

Hopefully it's got its consistency down, but it still averages out to 3 stars from the experiences at this branch."}
{"text":"You'd think all El Pollo Locos are pretty much the same right? Well, it looks the same, but it's definitely not the same. At all. 

My family eats EPL often because we are always in a hurry or we all come home late from work/school, so we just order things that are nearby our home. This is one of the first times that I have eaten at this location, and it is not good. 

I ordered at night through the drive through 2 hours before it closed. The service was fast. The chicken was warm. We asked for sauces, but they didn't give us any. We brought it home. The chicken at this location did not have the signature taste that EPL usually has. It was actually quite flavorless and not that appetizing. 

Most fast food restaurants usually already start at average ratings, but sadly, this one starts below."}
{"text":"The new chipotle is great!! Super fast and friendly drive thru last night!!  Love the avocado salsa!!  And than you for returning French fries to the meals!!  My super picky eater 10 year old lady bed her chicken strips too!! Thank you adding those too!!   Super, super!!"}
{"text":"Website would not accept my valid coupon. I found out no delivery available until after I placed the order. I had to call to find that out. Good food. Better go in or drive thru."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down.  The chicken is seasoned well the salads are off the hook good..luv this place for baked chicken"}
{"text":"The flavor was good but the burrito has full length chicken bones in them. The size of your finger.  Beware!!!"}
{"text":"No beans!!!! So I was craving el Pollo loco, chicken rice and beans. Pull up and ask for a 2 piece meal with a side of beans and rice and I was told they didn't have any beans. Then my husband ordered 2 bean rice and Cheese burrito and they said they have enough beans for that.... What?!?! They are very tight with the sauces, even when I ask for extra they only give like 1 -2"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to review chain restaurants but I have loved El Pollo Loco since birth! I feel like this is a great alternative to eating fried chicken. I find myself able to eat a full meal with out the guilt that comes with eating McDonalds or Popeyes or any other fast food. If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too). Even if its just the two of us, I love taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I love their salsa, so much that we can never go through the drive thru bc I have no shame and need about 15 salsas :). El Pollo Loco is my fast food of choice!
P.s. the staff is super nice, they messed up on our order and took care of our next meal!"}
{"text":"I love my Chicken Sald with the cilantro dressing, and there new carnitas tacos. ummm. ummmm, ummmm, ummmmm, ummmm!
I've been getting the same thing for a long time until the taco came out.  lol  I usually stick with what I really like."}
{"text":"The wait at the drive thru is RiDAMNdiculous, so long you would think they are slaughtering the chicken back there or cooking them with the Damn sunlight(This is Vegas-that  last scenario is perfectly plausible). However the food is off the chain.Loco chicken doesn't get better than this.I recommend this particular branch highly just bring a work Tablet and get some graphs done while  waiting in the driving thru. Two thumbs up from me-Loco for you El Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"Going through the mail: junk...junk...ju- whooaa - grilled stuffed bacon guac and chicken mushroom quesadillas... in high def images that make the mouth water so hard that even the worst marihuana cigarette-induced dry mouth is no match.

So yeah I went. This is a great spot for some fast food since they have healthy and fresh options like chicken and rice, guacamole, salsa, etc.. And yes I tried all three stuffed dillas and they are great...

Fuck there goes my mouth again"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend was exited to know that they have an el pollo loco in summerlin. So we been coming most of the times. I've always give them the benefit to correct the mistake but today I've finally had it. First thing walking in here I feel like I'm in a ghetto area. You would thing they would clean up the place by it really dirty inside.   I order a 3 taco meal and my taco was cold. So brought in up to the front  and the manager she told its supposed to be that way. I'm not idiot taco are not cold and it hurt my tooth. She went ahead and  give me a new one after she went to my table her remarks \"I hope that's warm enough for you\" she said it in a sarcastic way.  2nd thing as we were waiting for our meal I had to asked someone to clean the tables yea she did halfway done. And the drinks has no taste at all. It wasn't even busy but they couldn't have employee to walk the area and clean."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest El Pollo always fresh food and fresh salsa bar! 
Some of the others are not as clean as this one.!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of this restaurant chain and will continue as a customer. Went to this location at 9:40pm on Jan 3rd for a Chicken Salad and I guess the cashier, Jessica wasn't too pleased to have customers so close to closing. Very unpleasant personality, ... even when we tried being overly friendly ... but everyone else was very nice. Food was great as usual."}
{"text":"I learned that chicken is not meat when I visited my first El Pollo Loco recently.  Observe the following exchange:

\"Can I have two hard taco's with cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please\"

\"Two chicken crunchy taco's with only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?\"

\"No, two crunchy taco's with no meat, just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans please\"

\"You don't want meat on the taco's?\"

\"Yes, like vegetarian taco's.  Just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans.\"

\"So only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?\"

\"Yes, no meat, I want cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please\"

*pulls to window, pays for food, pulls away.

*swings back to window, hands bag back to employee.

\"Is there a problem?\"

\"Yes, these taco's have chicken on them.\"

\"I know, we always put chicken on them.\"

\"I asked for no meat.\"

\"It's only chicken though.\"

\"Can I have a refund.\"

\"You don't want them?\"

\"That is correct, I'll just have a refund please.\""}
{"text":"Always fast drive thru service, love that they offer salads under 500 calories . I don't like to eat fast food but if I'm on the go I prefer to eat here."}
{"text":"When there are more employees than customers, service should be excellent. Food was great, the problem was I waited 10 minutes for refill on salsa counter. Most everything empty."}
{"text":"I could not believe how tasty this food was!  We just landed and were heading out of town, so we wanted to eat something good, but quick.  Not only was the food great, it was super fast!  And the staff was very friendly.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good fast food!  We had tostado bowls (me and the 11 year old) and the other half and the 8 year old had giant, stuffed burritos.  Everything we tried was great!"}
{"text":"It is as decent as any other El Pollo Loco, which is to say it is a decent place one can get actual food in a drive thru. They don't hide mystery meat in breading here. The chicken is all grilled and tasty here. I myself get avocado chicken tacos, though the one slice of avocado is predictably stingy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best chicken in town! Being on a low carb diet, it's hard to find fast food, endless options here! Their salads are also delicious."}
{"text":"This is the worst EL Pollo Loco I have ever been to! They didn't have half of the normal items on their menu, I couldn't even order chips and salsa to go. I was also told they didn't offer guacamole which is funny being that it's on posters all around the restaurant. The employees had no knowledge of what food they served and apparently the lay guard barrier was just too much for the guy taking my order. (Which is also funny because I speak Spanish) They should close this location down as it doesn't ever seem busy anyways and bring back Fazzoli's!"}
{"text":"I have to come inside the restaurant to make sure that my take out order will not be another mistake. Well, The gentlemen that took my order seems to have a hard time understanding my English. My order was speedy and no mistake this time. I am looking forward in the future of a service crew who can hear well when taking my order."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco but this is my 3rd bad experience with this location. It took 45 minutes from the time that I ordered at the drive thru teller to receive my food and drive away. with only 3 cars ahead of me why 45 minutes!!! I could of cooked it myself at home. I ordered the family meal and  my enchiladas were not cooked cold as ice. The churros were hard as a rock to the point that you could not bite into them. Cold flour tortillas and the chicken did not seem to be cooked to the EL POLLO LOCO standards skin was soggy and did not seem fresh. Corn tasted like dirt and was overcooked to point of being rubbery. The only decent thing was the beans. So I waited forever to receive food that was not eatable. Everytime I go to this location it is the same thing!  My hungry family ended up eating Peanut Butter and Jelly because the food was so bad. $25.00 spent and completly unhappy not to mention 45minutes of my life that I will never get back. 

Never Again after 3 times of super bad service I have learned my lesson."}
{"text":"we ordered togo, there was just us and another couple eating there. we waited 25mins and still no food! i finally went up to the cashier and asked how come our food is not ready yet?!? she looked at me like she didnt take my order and asked for my receipt! she talked to the manager and everyone else.. They forgot to do my order!! i was so pissed i asked for my money back!!! they gave me my refund and also my order for free! so... food was pretty good, a bit salty for my taste, and service was bad! will not go to this one again."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is always fresh and great tasting. Very healthy and reasonable priced, we go here a lot."}
{"text":"Sticky drink station and the bathroom smelled like urine and fecal matter because someone didn't flush... And no one checked the bathroom... Ever feel like every restaurant or store you go, you're complaining about something?"}
{"text":"There new Taco plate was terrible. It was suppose to be three tacos instead I only got two tacos. The rice and beans were very cold. The counter girl couldn't explain why and actually had to keep going back and asking someone for help. I wish Raising Canes would open up soon in this area."}
{"text":"I odered the Chicken and Kale salad....Where's the kale?  This is all arugula and some other backyard weeds! I'm disappointed to say the least. Get it together El Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"This was out second attempt at getting chicken. TOTAL FAIL. I did get there close to closing around 830ish, so I understand. I wanted to get the 10 piece meal (legs and thighs) with 2 large sides for $20. Well, all they had left was wings and white meat. Wings are a no go, white meat I'm all about but the boss likes thighs. So, I walked out chicken less."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices, and the service at this location is good. 
I love the new Jalapeño Chicken Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I ordered a handcrafted mango shrimp bowl and what they gave me look like someone's left overs . Or at least that's what it looked like!"}
{"text":"S'okay

Was happy to see the old Costa Vida place get a new lease and the chicken concept sounded good. 

Have visited their drive-through twice now-- tacos once and burrito the other time. Okay on both visits. Nice service staff, though a bit slow. The meats are moist enough but are bland to my taste. The big turn-off for me are the avocado and cabbage/lettuce mix they use. Neither taste fresh.

I saw that they have chicken basket type meals. Will try one of those if/when I go again and update my review."}
{"text":"I hardly ever eat at El Pollo Loco, but when I do..it's for their pollo bowl. Their pollo bowls are not only cheap, but super filling as well! It comes with rice, beans, chopped pieces of chicken, salsa, onions, and cilantro. That's everything you need in one $5 bowl! 

If you are in a rush, this is definitely the El Pollo Loco to visit. Not even 2 minutes after I placed my order, they already had it prepped and ready for me to take to my table. I have never seen service so fast at a fast food restaurant before! I know they prepped it right after I ordered because the kitchen is open and visible behind the cashier. The pollo bowl tasted perfect and I would definitely come back here if I ever need a quick lunch or snack."}
{"text":"Got to be the worst El Pollo Loco! Gave up using the drive thru years ago as they routinely foul up the order. 4/10/2018 approximately 4:15pm I walked up to the order counter to place on order for a family of 3. There were 4 people behind the order counter talking about nothing urgent, while ignoring me. Finally a tall Mexican looking dude with a black mustache says to me \"please wait, we'll be right with you.\" Then they proceed to open the cash registers and play with the money in them. After a couple of minutes of this non-sense I left and spent my money elsewhere. And people like this think the deserve to make $11.00 an hour? I will never go back to this store!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Pollo and will continue to go there, food is fantabulous, but this location needs to get it together! The last 3 times I've gone my orders have been wrong. SUPER annoying.

1. no chips when I ordered chips and guac
2. ordered shrimp tacos and got chicken
3. no broccoli in my bowl when that's literally the staple

Lol. What the frank?! Anyways... word to the wise, check your orders!!!"}
{"text":"We don't have El Pollo Loco on the East Coast, so I made it a point to visit one after having been in Vegas so many times...

Had the chicken tacos and enjoyed them. 

Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Not a very friendly menu for a person with gluten intolerance but the chicken was *very* good although practically the only thing I can eat. The reason for the low rating was this location had horrible AC and bad AC in the dead of the Phoenix monsoon season is not a place to enjoy a good meal. The \"atmosphere\" was positiviely soupy between the kitchen and what seemed like a swamp cooler."}
{"text":"The only thing that pisses me off worse than the food is not being able to get a hold of a responsible party to take what they got coming. Pollo Loco sure your right you'd have to be as crazy as a chicken to eat there. Freakin menu looks like smorgasboard, as long as you like chicken and I do. However it would be great if the food that you got looked a little closer to the picture shown. BTW let me let my loyal readers in on something, its not a trick, not a ploy, its straight out demanding to be served what your looking at on the menu. This goes for any restaurant, at least in the United States. You can reject any order mearly based on the fact that it didn't look like the picture on the menu...the restaurant wont have a leg to stand on ..trust me. If they print \" items may differ from picture shown in tiny ass print on the bottom of the menu \"...then they got you, you know as well as I do no one does that. I like extra lettuce on my food and I use this tactic when I need to. Back to Pollo L., so I hit the drive thru for a half chicken combo. Yo might think well jeez that's a pretty hardy lunch, but for a chicken lovin blackman it was just a tease. Especially since it was as though they selected the scroniest chicken out of the bunch for me . Heck one would think, when the employees saw the brotha comin thru they would be selecting the hardiest pieces for him that they could get their money grubbing hands on. Choose rice and corn for my sides, rice was a little dry, corn was good. I ASKED for red sauce they gave me green...just the site of green sauce makes me wanna yack. So I got where I was going made it back home ate on the way...now its time to reach a manager or anybody by phone. First call got recording, second call ditto, third call network message\" the number you are attempting to call cannot be reached \". Folks if you are hard working want your moneys worth and don't like padding somebodies pocket whilst they lay on some secluded beech sipping drinks with the little umbrellas in them. So they wont answer the phone get back in your car and go TCB. In my culture that translates to \"take care of business\". So that's what I'll do and don't think its beneath me to march up in there with a sac of bones, some bit off tortillas and used napkins. YEAH I ate it didn't like it and your gonna try again. They don't want me calling corporate...them guys don't like their umbrellas ruffled, \"know what I mean ?\""}
{"text":"Used to be better.  Terrible experience for my family.  Dirty tables, with a full work crew here.  My family and I are getting ready to leave and the staff is laughing and giggling instead of cleaning.  They got my order wrong, Pinto beans instead of black beans and flour tortillas instead of corn,  like I requested.   I went up and asked for corn tortillas and the girl gave me more flour tortillas.  They forgot forks for my kids food and then we realized they forgot our churros too.  By this time I was getting really tired of walking back up to the counter.   It will be a long time before we come back."}
{"text":"This place consistently gives you sub par food compared to other locations.  I have to travel out of the way to go to El Pollo Loco even though this is the closest location. I gave them multiple chances but the last time they gave me all burnt chicken. No more chances. I'm done."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years and forgot how good it is. Their $20 3 - course family meal is not only a good value, but incredibly delicious. The grilled chicken seems so much more real than fried chicken elsewhere. And that Pizza appetizer they give you with the meal is excellent."}
{"text":"I love the chicken and the other food choices are also good. The tostada salad and meal bowls are great. El Pollo loco is a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I used to eat at El pollo loco often, but stopped going. However, I tried it again recently and am back to being a regular. 

I used to stick to their tortilla rolls with the creamy cilantro dressing for an inexpensive meal, buy now I almost always get an overstuffed quesadilla. The chicken fajita is my favorite!  

I also love the churros. They taste great and are nice and crunchy and cheap!  

The staff is friendly and the newer locations have pretty nice decor."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! On Monday April 27th, the shift leader waited in my daughter and me. She wasn't listening to me as I ordered so I had to repeat myself multiple times. I ordered the carne asada tostada, and she asked if we wanted chicken or beef?!! As if I didn't know what carne asada was! Really?!? There was some discussion about the tostada - it was frustrating as the carne asada was a specific selection on their menu. I also ordered a shrimp bowl, and again she asked if that would be chicken or shrimp. Seriously?!? Finally I had to tell her that nothing in our order contained chicken. After our order was complete, she followed us to the salsa bar, and stood right in the middle, moving back and forth, blocking us from getting to the selections while she wiped here and there and straightened this and that. Couldn't she wait until we were done?!?!! So we had to out wait her. When we were finally able to get some salsa, she sent one of her coworkers over. After a few minutes of generally getting in the way and reaching across us even after being asked if she could just wait a few minutes please, she then went back to her coworker and started whispering in her ear. Are we now in grade school?!?  I seriously doubt I will be going back there, especially to eat in. We got our food to go and left. The food was ok but not enough to overcome the lousy service. I recommend only using the drive through if you must get their food."}
{"text":"A few days ago was my first time at El Pollo Loco. I wanted to check it out since my friend had recommended the food. And it was delish!! 

I went through the drive through on a weekday evening around 10:50pm (10 mins before they close). I'm always nervous about going to places that are about to close since I expect the people to be in a hurry to get me out of there, but even through the drive though, the person was super helpful! He gave advice on what people generally like since I hadn't been there before. He let me get a bottle of water instead of a fountain drink without throwing a fit or overcharging me. And, since they were about to close, he gave me lots of extra corn cake, which I have to say is pretty much the most delicious thing ever. I am obviously now a huge fan. I got the mango something salad (awesome). My husband got the chicken avocado burrito (even more awesome). No more Taco Bell for me! They've even given Chipotle a run for their money, and I'm typically a huge Chipotle fan."}
{"text":"This was my first time at El Pollo Loco and I was not disappointed! I've heard good things and thought I'd try it out. I had the avocado burrito and I would definitely recommend it! It was packed with flavor and had a good sauce. Pretty good for a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Love me some Crazy Chicken :)  the fact that I can get good for you food fast is always a plus here.  The grilled chicken is moist, delicious and the service at this location is always pleasant .  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The cashier was great, she was friendly and prompt. The rest is downhill. The restaurant itself could probably use a deep cleaning. The food took quite a long time to come out and my tacos were wrong. We take them back, tell them the issue.....wait....wait and wait some more. The tacos come out and they're wrong AGAIN. Same exact issue,  so back they go again. I continue to wait and wait again and the tacos come out correct but the chicken is pink. Over it. We just left, too irritated to argue over this terrible meal. I wasted $20, but I'll never come back."}
{"text":"This location would receive 5 Stars but every time I go thru the drive-thru, they rush me and never put everything in my order bag. I end up missing items that I have paid for and I never feel like dealing with getting my stuff back. I'm a regular here and I didn't think I'd have this issue but I do. The dine in service here is good. They're very polite and at tentative to my service. The inside is vey very clean and stocked with condiments."}
{"text":"this location is the worst el pollo loco ive been too, the BRC costs $2.50? sup with that, its 1.79 at the one by my house and DOUBLE the size of what they gave me! Theyre rude here, take a long time, prices differ (??) and the portions are small, or dry. Salads are wilted also."}
{"text":"Second time at the location and they still don't have crunchy taco ... I don't get it how hard is to make a crunchy shell .... well last time I come to this location"}
{"text":"2 pics combo leg. One of them is just like the size of my thumb, and the chicken skin is not as crispy as what I have had in there other restaurants."}
{"text":"Had the shredded beef bowl. AWESOME! Perfect rice, well seasoned pintos, tender and lean beef all with a citrus-cilantro-mint sauce to tie it together. Chicken soup would cure the worst of colds!!!"}
{"text":"Rudest drive thru employees - Mary, I think her name is, has zero customer service and personality. She seems like she's annoyed the entire time. This is now the second time we've been to this location and both times they didn't have the tortilla soup we wanted. Her response was \"we stopped serving it tonight\" so when we got up to the window we asked what time they stop serving it and rudely she replies \"when we run out\" and shut the window. This location needs to hire some friendlier people. Until then we won't be back. I rather drive farther for better service."}
{"text":"Well this is usually my fav chicken place 
But this location wasn't as good as San Diego branches. Chicken was old and dry and very very small tortillas were hard (flour) Mac and cheese was mushy and oily obviously been sitting for a while and it took forever to get our food with maybe 4 people in the whole restaurant! I'm sure there were more employees than customers"}
{"text":"5 Stars for fantastic value, very friendly employees, restaurant was very clean and food was great. 

My Dad and Brother recommended this location. They raved about the $5 bowl meal and great service, so thought I would check them out. 

I got the $5 Mexican Caesar Pollo Bowl combination. Came with a bowl loaded with rice, caesar salad, El Pollo Loco's famous chicken, cilantro and tomatoes, plus a drink and choice of chips or tortillas. I choose chips. They have a salsa bar with mild, med and hot sauce plus a guacamole salsa that is worth trying. It also includes jalapeño peppers, minced onions and fresh cilantro.
The chicken was perfect and the whole meal more than filled me up. Someone may look at the bowl and say it doesn't look like a lot, but in the end, I couldn't eat it all. Of course, I did visit the salsa bar and loaded up my bowl with tomatoes, onions and cilantro. 

You won't go wrong by coming here for good food, friendly service and good value. I will be coming back again for sure. 

Note: Other options include the $1.69 street tacos and the $20 family meal pack. They are both dog gone good. Before you assume... no, I don't work here."}
{"text":"EPL is my back up low carb fast food meal when nothing else sounds good. 3 chicken legs and a loco salad sets me back less than $5 and is healthy and low carb. This is the EPL closest to my house and I have yet to have an issues in my 20 or so visits to this place. The drive through can be slow, but inside is always very quick!"}
{"text":"Went here and tried to us an El Pollo Loco gift card. Manager came out and let me know they were \"updating\" their system at 1130a in the afternoon and I could not use my gift card. 

They asked me for another form of payment. Why would I pay when I have El Pollo Loco money?? 

No signs were posted on the door or anywhere else to make someone aware before you walked in. 

Left no food after having walked here."}
{"text":"I bought the $10 deal of 5 each legs and thighs. Each piece is so dry I can barely chew it enough to swallow. The food at this location is usually amazing but this is very bad. I'm going to figure out how to cook the rest of the 7 pieces. I'm not going to throw them away. I gave 2 stars only because the flavor is good."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Reminds me of the post office.  The more people in line the less cashiers they have.  It took about 10 minutes to take one order.  I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The avocado salsa the only redeeming factor.  The quesadilla with avocado was a mushy blend of nondescript diluted avocado sauce and tasteless dried out chicken rolled up into a burrito that was flattened by a brick.  Inedible, Taco Bell or the freezer section of your grocery store is far superior to this slop.  Will never return"}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all. I went here with my mom and the first thing she said when we walked in was \"does it smell like roaches to you?\"... We decided to stay since it was getting late. The place was dirty (water spills on the floor, sticky tables and chairs) and the food was flavorless. We got the 2 pc combo, one with rice and black beans and the other with mac n cheese and broccoli and i couldnt even finish my meal cause it tasted plain like no seasoning or something. So if you like flavor try something else."}
{"text":"Can this place get any more disgusting? I sure hope not. First impressions are always lasting ones and I can tell you this was the final time for me dining at this pollo loco. Not being able to find a clean spot to sit at in a somewhat empty dining room, not good. I can say we must've just missed the lunch hour rush, because the place was not crazy busy. I'm talking every table was filthy, full of food. Not only the tables but the floors. Literally every table had food caked beneath it. It looked as if a 1 year old child got a hold of the food and threw it everywhere. We were there for a good 30 minutes and not once did any of the employes come out to wipe the tables or sweep the floors. All I could think of was if its this filthy in the front, I can only imagine how filthy the food prep area is. Called the manager and he gave a lame excuse about not being to mop because it was unsafe at that time. Hmmmmm have they ever heard of a broom? Wiping tables down to make sure there is a clean table for your patrons to sit is the \"safe\" and sanitary thing to do for your customers. The lack of cleanliness was just the beginning, the final straw was the hair in my daughters chicken. See ya pollo loco."}
{"text":"The appearance of the location was not what I am accustomed to seeing for this location.  Plus my chicken didn't look appealing."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'll probably never visit another El Pollo Loco after my experience. After placing my order, I sat in the nearly empty dining room drinking my drink waiting over 15 minutes. I finally went up and said I was happy to pay for the drink but would like a refund for the food. The general manager Salvador refunded the food but would not return my original receipt. When I asked for him to write his name on my refund receipt he took that also. I couldn't believe how I was being treated as I was very polite and soft spoken. He kept pointing out to me the company is a franchise. I suggested I might call the police regarding him taking my receipts from me and he still would not return them. He asked me to leave. I have never been in such a situation. I sat outside drinking the drink I had paid for looking up customer service on my phone when he came and told me to leave the premises or he would call police. The customer service rep was very apologetic and took a report. I hope no other customer experiences the treatment I endured!"}
{"text":"If allowed I would give negative stars. This place needs to close to protect El Pollo Loco's reputation. Dry chicken and old and you can barely swallow it. Needs to be improved or needs to close.  

Went thru drive thru and got the worst meal alive. Dry Spanish rice and the tortillas aren't fresh. Will not go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"This is utterly the worst pollo loco ever. I've been in Vegas one year and they have yet to get a freakin order right. That should cover it"}
{"text":"I feel I'm generous with the 3 stars because they haven't given me problems in the past but recently is a different story. The last 3 times I tried to come here 2 times being around 10 pm at night and they run out of chicken.. It would be understandable if it was like 15-30 min before closing but an hour like really?? And then I come again at 5pm today and out of chicken. The service is not the friendliest.. People working the drive thru talk with such a tone like they are just miserable.... Will come back but please get it together."}
{"text":"so just got my food and looks old and dried up fries taste nasty  dont get the new chicken fingers"}
{"text":"I'm usually good about looking at restaurant ratings before I visit them but I didn't this time and wish I had.  The two and a half stars given by yelp for this establishment are very accurate.  Getting in and out of here was easy even at lunch time however I had some trouble with my order.  I ordered the chicken taco salad without sour cream or beans.  Paid and sat down and waited for my meal to be prepared.  Shortly after I sat down my meal was ready and I went to the counter to pick it up.  As I examined my salad, what is that I see but sour cream.  I tell the woman who gave me my meal  that I had ordered my salad without sour cream. She looked at the receipt and said no you didn't.  Ok, we don't challenge the customer but ok I'm in a good mood.  I say I did order without the sour cream.  So she takes the salad back to the preparation area and I can see her explaining to the person about the sour cream.  Then much to my surprise and shock, I see this person with gloved hand reach into my salad and scooped out the sour cream and replaced it with more lettuce to fill the spot.  I was extremely shocked however I figured since the person had on gloves it was ok.  Should I have pushed the issue about making a new salad? Absolutely however shouldn't food service know that if the order isn't right fix it to the customers satisfaction.  The moral of this story, first I won't be eating here again, and second shame on me for not checking the yelp rating first."}
{"text":"Went to this el pollo loco because the one that's less than a half mile from my home is awful, and I refuse to go to it. 

Well, surprise surprise...this one is just as bad. Messed up my order, overcharged me, forgot items. 

I'm thinking this is a company-wide problem. It seems that El pollo loco employs lazy, sloppy, unprofessional workers. 

I'd say \"avoid this location and go to a different one\", but I'm beginning to believe that they're all bad."}
{"text":"This is the worst El Pollo Loco location ever. They overcharged us by about $7. When we pointed it out, they refused to refund the money. Theft, pure and simple.

Calls to the corporate line--who promised to contact the franchise owner--were never returned. 

They never get orders correct either.

I'd avoid this location like the plague. Bad, dishonest employees, and apparently uncaring owners."}
{"text":"It a new year and like many of us . . . it's time to try and eat health for a while.  And since I had recently seen an ad for the under 500 calorie bowls I thought I would try one . . . I ordered the Black Bean Bowl.

The Bowl it self had a very good taste . . . but was way too running for my liking . . . and the broccoli was way under cooked.  The service was okay but could have been faster.

Even though this trip was not very good . . . I will probably stop in to try another one of their under 500 calorie bowls sometime down the road . . . after all even two stars for something healthy is better than one star."}
{"text":"New Pollo Loco! Had to try it while they still care. I got the 2-piece meal (Leg & Thigh) with mac & cheese, pinto beans, and flour tortillas. Everything came out very hot and tasted good. So they definitely still care & it will probably never be that good again, but I enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Got the 2 piece (leg & thigh) meal with mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, and corn tortillas from the drive thru. It was quick and really tasty! Nice work, Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"THIS EPL needs works. it was very messy when we came in. i'm fine with a little mess in a chaotic place but this place was empty. not a single trash can to throw my try into bc they were all overflowing. yikes.

food is fine. like any other EPL. we had been traveling and would have liked just a slightly cleaner place to have lunch."}
{"text":"I have never been to El Pollo Loco before so I had no idea what to expect. Was it going to be like Taco Bell or Del Taco? Turns out,  it's completely different than the aforementioned fast food joints. When I walked in there was a huge grill behind the counter loaded with, suprise, pollo. It was unexpected because the chicken looked fresh and of supermarket quality. Plus there was just a shit ton of it. I also liked the fact that there was an actual salsa bar. 

I had a coupon for a stuffed quesadilla combo that came with a drink and chips for $5. I ordered the quesadilla enchilada style - it was pretty substantial and tasted better than I expected. The wait time was longer than I would have liked. It took about 10 minutes. And they gave me a buzzer for my order. WTF? A buzzer for a fast food joint? Anyways, since it took a little long for me to get my food,  they gave me a free brownie!

Customer service was great. I think I was greeted 3 seperate times. This is a brand new location, and you can tell the employees are still getting the hang of things. All in all, El Pollo Loco is a bit pricier than say Del Taco, but the food is higher quality."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I wish I had never got out the car. The inside of this place is disgusting. Dirty. And always check your order because the last two times they forgot my tortillas and my dessert. I won't be back. And I plan on contacting corporate. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is much better alternative to some fast foods like BK or Mcdonald's. The food is refresh and almost gourmet at a very reason able price. I tried it for the first time and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Decent food, okay prices. The place isn't exactly clean but they're as friendly as others in fast food. I'd probably come again if I'm in the neighbourhood and wanted tacos."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice but the chicken did not taste fresh it was dry, not near as fresh as other El Pollo Loco locations, I will try it again and give another review as I am a big fan of El Pollo Loco"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location many times the food is consistently fresh some times a tad to slow but always very fresh chicken...."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pollo Loco locations for years. They're fast food, I have no unreasonable expectations any more than I would expect to find a gourmet steak at a burger joint. But this location seems to be striving for a new low. It noticeably dirty to the point it made me uncomfortable to eat there. The service was s-l-o- w, but worst of all the food was a major letdown.

I had the chipotle chicken avocado burrito. Since the store was advertising avocados everywhere I had a mouthwatering taste for them. The large and heavy burrito was sorely lacking in two major ingredients, chicken and avocado. I had first-hand experience with knowing what's inside ... as soon as I lifted it the entire contents slid out of the bottom onto my plate because they don't know how to wrap a burrito.

There was a lot of rice, a lot of beans, a few lonely hunks of cubed chicken, some raw cabbage and a very few ultra-thin slivers, not of rich tasty avocado meat, but of dense pulpy avocado rind. That's right, RIND. There was no actual avocado meat to be found in the entire burrito. The person who \"hand sliced\" the avocado totally missed what part of it they've supposed to serve. The pictures they use to pitch the product are totally fake.

This location is a fail and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru on the way home from work.  This was my first visit at any El Pollo Loco.  I should have checked my order before driving away.  How some can order one thing, receive another and be charged for something different than what was both ordered and erroneously received is beyond me.  :("}
{"text":"I think El Pollo Loco is crack crazy chicken during late hours. I ordered a kids combo and it was yummy. Prices are decent and for what is considered fast food, there wasn't anything fried!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Service here continues to decline. Had my roommate go grab food. No chicken pieces and it was over an hour to close. Ordered a Chicken Avocado burrito with no cabbage, and it was mostly beans and cabbage. Only the benefit of it being close and these being slight inconveniences are what even have brought us back."}
{"text":"Rude nasty and expensive. The upgrade to the chicken breast was horrible. It looked like a thigh.. asked for cole slaw they didn't have it. No butter for the tortillas. I spent $18.00 dollars. I could have gone to KFC an d got a lit more and better quality. Mgmt better get with the program. I will go to the one on east Charleston."}
{"text":"Tried two different kind of tacos. The el carbon is very plain, no taste unless you count all the onions, they use soft corn tortillas for the shell and they sure are small. The crunchy taco was better but the lettuce tasted funny.  Also small in size."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite location but I have tried it a few times because it is close to home. The employees are nice but when I ordered salads from here the last few times they ingredients were skimpy and the veggies seem wilted in the salad. I think management needs to check the food for quality control to make it as consistent as the other restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered a small mash potato for almost 3 bucks and only got half a scoop. Not very happy."}
{"text":"Went through drive through at around 7:30pm Saturday April 12th. Got a family meal. Chicken was on point but the rice was dry/old and the beans were waaay too spicy. Like not a random piece of jalapeño spicy but sitting in jalapeños all day spicy. Had to throw them out, kids couldn't eat them.

I go to the Ft Apache location all the time and never have this issue."}
{"text":"Went here around 10ish and the drive thru lady was so RUDE!!! First she kept asking if I was ready yet with my order even though I told her give me a minute I'm looking.. Once I got to the window and got my food from her attitude having ass, I asked her for salsa and she looks at my and says \"ugh, oh my god\" rolls her eyes.. Turns around and walks away.. She is so lucky I was feeling sick that day or I woulda jumped through the window and beat the brakes off that bitch.. Horrible customer service and they were out of chicken!!! How the hell are you out of chicken at a chicken restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"The worst fast food organization I have ever been to. Horrendous invisible management. I have never been there before and I was asking questions about the food. The manager looked away and gave me one word answers. They forgot to give me the rice in my order. When I get home I called them and they told me they'd CATCH ME NEXT TIME. I will NEVER go to this restaurant again!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent FRESH Mexican food. We enjoyed the new Layered Mango Avocado Salad and the Double Chicken Mango Tostada. Both were a very pleasant surprise!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I can give it no stars I would. My mother and I and my daughter went to this place to eat yesterday we had one by our house but we was going to go grocery shopping at winco so we went here. We order but the main manager took my mom order she didn't look happy. We sat down to wait for our order and this young black women gave my mom her food witch it was for here but she packed it in a bag we ordered two tostada salads and a mac and cheese on the side she repeat the order to my mom my mom asked nicely can she have four dressings for our salads (WITCH THE MAIN MANGER SAID IT WASNT A PROBLEM) the young lady gave my mom only two my mom said again can she have four all together she looked at my mom and rudely said u want four my mother said yes one isn't good enough so she told my mom it was 50 cents each my mom got upset and told her her manager said it was ok while she was taking her change out the young lady said oh she did well that's all I needed to know u can have it. (NOW MENTION WHAT EL POLLO LOCO CHARGES) so I walked up there grabbed the food and walked away we sat down started eating the young lady came to clean was so loud talking to a customer said she's the best in here that they always call her in cause she haves no kids and that Nevada people r so mean and rude then cali because she was from cali I feel some was directed to us. (MENTION I WORK AT A FAST FOOD) all that is uncalled for... then she walked up to us asked my mom if she can take her plate my mom said she wasn't done because my daughter was eating the rice she looked at my mom and said i know I asked if I can take the plate so my mom responded with the same reply then she walked away. Dropping the wet signs loudly also. So we finally was done and left while walking out the manger was giving me this look i simply just looked away said to my mom we would not be coming back to this place... I know how fast food works I work at one I could have reported them but I also know how that works they don't do much. I was looking for her name but they didn't have a name tag. Will never be going here again."}
{"text":"The pieces of chicken are TINY!!!!!!!!! My 8 year old kid could eat a WHOLE chicken based on how TINY the pieces of chicken are that they serve!!! I went through the drive-thru and didn't know how tiny the chicken pieces were until I got home!! I literally had to make additional sides to compensate for the LACK of chicken in order to have a complete and filling meal for two adults and one kid!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before trying the new location.   If you are going to eat here you definitely want to order inside, and watch them put your order together.   Hopefully they can get some real management in there and get this location up to speed.   They won't last long in this neighborhood if they don't!"}
{"text":"Terrible, overpriced food. My \"chicken\" burrito was just beans and rice. That must have been one skinny chicken."}
{"text":"There were no specials. We got 9 pcs of chicken w mac n cheese, mashed potatoes w gravy and tortillas. Their green salsa was delicious. Their mashed potatoes was a little runny, the mac n cheese was really good. I took 2 stars away because the chicken was over cooked, my drumstick had hard pieces and was chewy like it had been sitting there. I went at 1140am and it made me think it was left over chicken from the day before, heated up. Hmmm??? Probably won't go back unless I eat inside so I can return my chicken."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco has to be one of my favorite fast food restaurants. This is the only place to get an actual healthy lunch or dinner. The prices are great and the salsa bar is amazing! I wish I didn't have to drive like 20 miles round trip to go here."}
{"text":"I love El Pollo Loco. It is one of my favorite \"healthy spots\" for lunch. This location i s closest to my house but still far away. So when I go here it is exciting and a treat.

This location is not the cleanest, especially the bathrooms. But I am willing to overlook that because I know they are super busy and I have never had a bad meal from here.

But when I went for my last visit it was early. I checked their website to see when they opened and it said 9am-11am. I jumped in the car for my mini road trip and when I arrived they were closed. The sign said they opened at 10am. WHAT??? Of course I went crazy in the car, full of sadness and anger. There was no way I could wait over 30 minutes. I just came from the gym and I was starving.

I had to leave and go somewhere I really didn't want to go. This is a simple mistake that should not have happened and they should fix right away. Now  I will have to put them on speed dial and call before I come."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION!!!
The food was only average
The restaurant was dirty
It was 85 degrees in the dining room and the woman at the restaurant said she couldn't turn it down :-(
To top it all off...I called the manager the next day to report that someone had fraudulently used my credit card the day after I used it at his restaurant.  I wanted him to know, just in case there was a pattern.  He was argumentative, not helpful or concerned at all. I have no reason to go back here."}
{"text":"Is there a way to insult the great culture and food of Mexico any more than just the existence of Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, and Del Taco already have? Why yes, there is. The chocolate nachos at El Pollo Loco. And yet, I have given it 3 stars, because it is marshmallow and chocolate syrup and served to me in my car and I am weak. I understand that I deserve your judgment, but try to forgive me. It's marshmallow sauce in the car for under $3.00."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that I rarely eat fast food and only tried this place due to a coupon and co-workers recommendation.  Was absolutely amazed at how great the food is here, and LOVE the salsa bar (especially the green salsa!!)  

Everything is GREAT on the menu, and the service is awesome.  We actually became regulars at one point so the staff got to know us!

The only negative is that the prices can get to be steep, almost as much as a regular restaurant after ordering an entire meal.  So at times I wondered why I didn't just go to a regular restaurant and have nicer atmosphere, better service, etc.  Guess this is why I haven't been back in a while, but still haven't forgotten how great the food is and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Price is good but compared to other stores this location is just okay. They tend to under cook my quesadillas and they sometimes forget things so check your order before you drive away."}
{"text":"Came in a 4pm today. I was the only person in line at cash register. 2 girls behind register refused to acknowledge me and instead chit chated about their personal lives. 20 people in line waiting for food. Walked out."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place!

My better half and I decided to dine in at this  hell hole at approximately 9:28 PM on July 9, 2015.

If we had read the reviews prior, we would've never gone into this place for the second time since we've lived in Henderson Nevada. 

We walked in and were not greeted, it felt as if we weren't welcome because we got there 35 minutes before they closed.

Even though it felt strange, I just assumed it was my imagination, until the woman that took our order was acting a little off. I didn't really care because I was hungry. 
I was polite and courteous and tried to make the best of it. We ordered two avocado chicken burritos and chips with salsa. The food wasn't all that bad, it was a bit wet, but not over-the-top gross.The employees were gearing up to go home and they removed all the salsa and left it sitting out at room temperature on the counter where you pick up your food. That was the first strike. The second strike was when the manager creepy lady started sliding the chairs around to sweep the floor and making way too much noise. I wanted to stand up and hit her with one of the heavy chairs, that's how bad it was.

Oh yeah, the food trays were wet and dirty and there was no ice in the soft drink machine.

These people that work there really come off like their miserable and my wife and I will not be going back, ever again.

I took pictures of the receipt and the dreadful woman that made us feel uncomfortable. I'm not the type of person that's shy or complains a lot, but this place sucked! Also, why is it the two times that we've been there we've never seen an African-American, American Indian, Asian persuasion or a garden-variety white person working? What does that tell you?

Bottom line, stay away from this place! I've been reading other reviews about salmonella poisoning and the dirtiness, it's true. The tables were caked with leftover crap food and the floor was dirty. Instead of using a broom all the time, try using a wet mop ya freaks!"}
{"text":"THIRD TRY ... I place my order and the lady working the grill yells over they ran out of chicken and its gunna be a long wait to cook more. What a friggin joke. Three times Ive been here and ALL THREE TIMES they are out of food. This place is literally a friggin joke.
----------------------------
Gave this place yet another try and once again a fiasco. Came in at 8pm they told me they ran out of food, except for 2 chicken breasts. So I ordered those and then they gave to someone else. I waited and they told me another 15 mins. Absolutely rediculous. No management on site and employees running the place who are clueless.
-------------------------
Came in on 2/7/18. Like the blind leading the blind. Line is out the door (see pic). No employees know how to operate cash register. Line not moving so I walked out."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and nasty. Its got a 70s retro design which is cool. But food everywhere on the floor a d tables (see my pics). Staff was friendly but they were preoccupied with personal chit chat and service was slooow. I have had major stomach pain since eating here a few hours ago."}
{"text":"I got 2 Grande Chicken Avocados Tacos.  They were just ok.  I was expecting a lot more for the \"Grande\" title - I was left pretty hungry and they were not so flavorful that I was willing to spend another $3 for another one.  As far as fast food is concerned service was fine and the food was ok, price is a bit high I think - there are other Mexican fast food places I'd go based on taste, cost and quantity.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at El Pollo Loco Restraurant!  I ordered the 8 piece family meal, I knew what I wanted with two of the items.  The counter person suggested Mac in Cheeze.  WOW! It was very good.

The restraunt was very busy, but clean and the customer service was fantastic.  I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This location is consistently horrible at getting your order right. You order black beans, they give you pinto. You order a salad? Good luck finding salad dressing in your bag. I've even complained on the website and have heard nothing back, which makes it even worse. Get some decent workers or retrain the ones you have."}
{"text":"! I went there because I like the tostada shell. I asked for all, except no chicken, nothing with animals on it. I told them I want more beans instead and never got it! The manager came to the window and says that they do not have animals there, they have chicken! I just smile back since stupidity is hard to cure! I also mention that I am VEGAN. She looks at like she never ever heard that world! How embarrassing!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this location opening, we have been to this location now 3 times and twice they have been missing some item. Today my husband ordered a chicken avocado burrito for me and as usual they say \"we ran out of avocado\" ... I don't understand how they can run out of the products they put on the menu. Very disappointing!!! If this happens again, we will stop trying and have to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Love the selection, food and the amazing service. The people behind the counter are fun, energetic and have great manners. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to go to this pollo loco since it opened. I finally stepped in and ordered the salad I always get, the chicken avocado one, and as soon as i opened it i noticed the tomatoes looked old so i moved them around and saw they were moldy! This grossed me out! Never coming to this pollo loco again!"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is fast food, but in comparison to other equivalent places, it's pretty dang good!

I came through on a quick lunch break and ordered the chicken avocado taco platter and a side of chips and guacamole. The platter rang in at $6.49 and the chips and guacamole were $2.49. For the price, I thought what I received was excellent! The taco platter came with a side of tasty rice and beans, and the two chicken tacos were very good. When comparing to other fast food chicken tacos, I thought these for sure took the #1 spot. The salsa added just enough flavor without being too spicy or powerful. The guacamole had large chunks of actual avocado in it (not that mystery green liquid kind from a bag) and the chips were thick. 

The service was very quick and pleasant, and I had no issues with my order. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. I would return here for a cheap taco meal before venturing off to another fast food place... and would love to return to try some of their other options."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I learned we were finally going to get an El Pollo Loco on this side of town. I Visited this location during its first week of operation and was more than impressed with the speed and quality of service. The food was cooked just right and came out almost immediately even though the place was packed. I've been back several times since they opened and every time I am left beyond satisfied with the service. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. When you are finished someone comes and picks up your tray for you. Even the lunch time cashier, Kimberly seems to do a far above average job of taking your order correctly the first time and keeping the line moving regardless of its length. This is doubtlessly my favorite El Pollo Loco location in town and it is perhaps my favorite restaurant in town because of the high level of attention to detail and friendliness that comes out of what one would expect to be just another fast food location."}
{"text":"Saturday evening stopped in Pollo Loco after getting some groceries and asked
the clerk if they could get two salad bowls out quick. he said yes five
minutes tops. 20 minutes later I pick up the food disappointed on how long it
took. Then when I got home, found out I had the wrong bowls, not what I
ordered. and also the wrong dressing I had asked for ranch and they gave
cilantro. Later when I called it rang and rang after many many rings someone
answers and say, \"what do you want?\" Very unprofessional then can barely
understand him I asked if he could put someone else on. Spoke with the manager
and told her my situation. She seems somewhat in different finally asked me
what do I want. I said I have a minimum I would like my money back. She just
said she would take my name and leave it up front so I could come in and get
another equivalent meal. Not what I want. I am extremely disappointed and
probably will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is a great roasted chicken meal.  If you don't have time to do it yourself, then coming in to pick up one the meals combos is  not a bad idea.  The prices are reasonable and the sides are not so bad.  But the best part of the meal is the tortillas, they are unbelievable.  My husband and I often eat low carb and so buying a meal allows us to eat the chicken, but smelling the tortillas will often be too tempting, so we always ask they do not include them, thus eliminating the temptation."}
{"text":"Love the grilled chicken.  You can walk in and see the grill covered in chicken and see and smell the flavors in the air.  You can buy combinations plates or by the piece. My husband and I enjoy getting an 8 piece with sides, and love those tortillas.  The condiments bar has fresh cilantro and two types of sauces.  Really like the food."}
{"text":"There are 8 people working behind the counter and are still messing up orders. It is not busy here. The dining room is almost empty and drive through is steady but not busy. Jason one of the employees is busy trying to talk to a girl at the register while customers are waiting to order. I ordered 4 plain chicken tacos for my kids, chicken and cheese only. Opened the wrapper and it had chicken, cheese, cilantro, and onions. The order was supposed to be for here and there is to was bagged up.  There was a guy in front of me waiting to get his order. It was sitting on the counter, it just needed to be bagged up. Other customers after him were being taken care of. Finally he had to say something so he could get his food bagged so he could go. Management needs to do some work, but then again there was a manager here when all this was taking place."}
{"text":"This is the second location and they have No TACOS AT ALL... lol it's almost funny at this point because the woman says \"I will have them tomorrow\"  how does that help me at the moment?!?!? El Pollo Loco is a JOKE"}
{"text":"They had no crunchy chicken tacos.... seriously?!?!?!???????  I had to drive to a different location. I am so disappointed"}
{"text":"so I went tonight to get a 8piece family meal of dark meat 2sides tortillas,salad and chorro's for dessert. for only $20, cant beat the price. The only problem I have had is the service. the one gal made the chicken,and sides, put it on the take out counter for over 5minutes and was NOT WEARING gloves,,,also while I was waiting on the chorros I had them remake my chicken hot and fresh, she has attitude behind it.than the cashier guy takes over puts all my stuff in the bag,and ask where is my salad so I told him to place my order under the heat lamps. he did. I got the salad,and my bag and went home. came home,and looked like slimmy spit all over the salad!!! the pico cilantro,and onion salsa bar was nasty, looked slimmy. the girl said it was probably just water, since when do they water down pico sauce? !!! I will be calling corporate,and the health department!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect in terms of quality but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken was fall off the bone tender and juicy, I could have gone for seconds. The service was friendly and swift. Overall, a much better experience than Boston Market and a great value."}
{"text":"Some stuff was left out of our order, but they made sure to take really good care of us to make up for it :)"}
{"text":"Usually very good!  But this time was not good!  Be careful when you order from the drive thru. We ordered the family dinner. Wanted all dark meat. Received 2 breasts. White meat. Plus they did not include our churros.  And all the sides were about half full in the containers!  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"As others have said, normally, I am a big fan of El Pollo Loco, but not this location.  

On one occasion when we dined in, I was almost afraid that we were going to get food poisoning, based on the general appearance of the restaurant.  Few of the open tables were cleaned, the salsa bar had large spills all around the salsa containers and the napkin holders were all empty.  Luckily, the food was OK and none of us got sick.

Our most recent visit was to the drive-thru Saturday night.  We ordered 2 of the tostada salads and a chicken burrito, as well as churros.  My husband specifically asked for extra salsa, as we like to use that as salad dressing on our salads.  When he got home, they had provided only 2 each of the green and the pico de gallo, for 3 adult entrees!  The chicken in the tostada salads was burned and not properly cut, with almost whole pieces dried out and full of gristle.

I wish this EPL was as good as other locations in the East Valley, specifically the ones at Arizona Mills and on Baseline and McClintock in Tempe.  Hell, even the ghetto EPL located in a strip mall in a questionable area of Norwalk, CA consistently produces better product than the Goodyear store.

PLEASE EPL Management, check in on the Goodyear store, give the employees better training and produce the quality food and service we've come to expect from EPL!!"}
{"text":"Tried to order a three piece leg and thigh combo and apparently they ran out.  Isn't chicken the speciality here?  It is called El Pollo Loco correct?  What kind of chicken restaurant runs out of chicken??"}
{"text":"I visited this location every week and their service is always fast and friendly. My husband and I eat here all the time because the food is fresh made daily, you can feel the fresh taste on their salsas, rice and beans which is what we always get. I have tried their salads and other food items but I would highly recommend the grilled chicken, the flavor of it is so good! I honestly feel like I don't have to cook any more because I can come here and eat this food every day!"}
{"text":"Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10 piece meal was pretty burnt and undersized. The other half of our order was cooked properly and we enjoyed it.

However, the cashier was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than serving paying customers."}
{"text":"Went back for round 2 and again chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"It's still open! The review below is BS. The usual Crazy Chicken, hot, fresh and everything was good! Don't get me wrong, it's still fast food, but pretty healthy compared to the alternatives."}
{"text":"Meh... That definitely describes it and especially compared to some other EPL locations I've been to. Not too friendly and the food wasn't too hot along with an empty salsa bar."}
{"text":"went last week to pick up some dinner. I haven't been in along time. Not sure why but this place is great. Excellent food and friendly staff. I may just back for dinner tonight"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this location! 

I rely on The Crazy Chicken for my low calorie lunch needs. I went through the drive through on a Friday and received great service and delicious food. 

I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This location really sucks. I never see anyone other than teenagers at this place which can be fine as long as management is strong, which clearly it's not. Half the time they are out of certain foods and when they do come through the food is sloppy and lacking. Tried the new fajita tacos and they were nothing like the picture. Each taco had about two pieces of withered bell pepper. My son got his usual drumsticks and mac n cheese and it was really gross, had a powdered taste to it but the location in Gilbert has amazing mac n cheese. Not sure what's going wrong here but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pulled up and automatically asked if I would like family meal with $3 add on by some lady, I replied I'm not sure yet let me look at the menu, no response. I looked and stated I have a question waited for a min before response and a man responded \"go ahead\". No personality almost like he was annoyed. I asked a question and got a monotone response from the gentleman. I ordered a combo and a soup also asked for the green salsa. No total was given, before I drove up to the window.  When the guy finally came to the window he asked again \"any salsa?\" I replied yes the green as I stated before. He handed me the food and when I got home I was only given two small, like super small, salsas for a meal that definitely would need more than that. For the price you pay for the portions and service, not worth coming again. I like to be treated will kindness and this place did not deliver. Sorry if they were having a bad night but never ok to not be kind to every customer. Please work on that el pollo loco team. It's ok to smile after a rough night, you never know who will be you next customer"}
{"text":"Pretty new so it's clean and it's not always busy. Fast service just put out wet floor signs when you see puddles around the place."}
{"text":"Today I went to elpollo loco I ordered cheese in a burrito got no cheese and then asked for a quesadilla and they gave me chicken wings overall bad experience 

ps I was in the drive though and I'm 9 years old!"}
{"text":"By now I think most people have eaten the food here. Yes the food is good. I love the chicken here. It's the best non-fried chicken in town. Where I have issues is the service. Of the many times I have gone here I have always had problems with my order. When I go to drive through the speaker is hard to hear out of and they have a hard time hearing the customers. I've never had a good experience there. 

Today I ordered my food through the app thinking it would be easy and no problems. Ha! So I get there and they can't find my ticket. After a few minutes they find that the manager has my ticket in her office and they say that she is talking to my wife on the phone. I give the cashier a confused look and he gives me a confused look right back. After a few minutes the manager comes out of the office and is still on the phone with \"my wife\". In short, she is confused because she thinks that the person on the phone is me and they had uber food and even though i told her several times that the order was mine and I'm picking it up and even showed her my confirmation number she was still having trouble understanding what was going on. After a few more minutes they started to put my order together. Huh? Isn't it supposed to be ready already? Isn't that the reason for ordering on the phone for pickup? So anyway I got the food and took it home and it was delicious as always."}
{"text":"i would not even give them 1 star if i didnt have to...there food is very small prtions the prices are way to high....the customer service is not very friendly the chips are always stale..very very unhappy and will never go there again....."}
{"text":"I've always loved El Pollo Loco. How can you not love yummy citrus marinated flame grilled chicken? sooooo gooood and getting hungry just thinking about it. Salsa bar is great and my favorite is the avocado salsa...I heavily douse that on everything. The pinto beans are a good side, along with the side salad (which is huge!), but have never cared for their rice, it is always a lil on the half done side and taste just like instant rice that they microwave or something. You get 3 tortillas with your combos and I like to make lil chicken tacos with them. For dessert you must get the churros...2 for 99 cents and they are always cooked to order and so yummy and fresh!"}
{"text":"Had the classic chicken ranchero burrito today. It was pretty good although it lacks lettuce, tomatoes and other such items I enjoy in burritos. The salsa bar is impressive and I enjoyed the pico de gallo and chips. Overall, good meal for a good price."}
{"text":"A great El Pollo Loco. Open only a short time, this restaurant is located in a newly constructed building. That means clean restrooms, all new seating... very nice. 

Great service this day. Much faster than the El Pollo Loco located at Shea & Scottsdale Road. Salads fresh, veggies well prepared, chicken hot off the grill; all you can hope for from this chain. It's wonderful having healthy fast food alternative in this area."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, but this location is not among my very favorites. On this day, for example, they were out of the hottest salsa at their salsa bar. A shipment tomorrow was expected. And the drive-thru was closed. The workers are very nice, but they struggle with special requests. Today, I ended up with both sour cream and guacamole that I had requested be held.

Why keep coming back? The amazingly healthy menu for a fast food joint. They have a great under 500 calorie menu. Lots of choices (always five, sometimes as many as 10 total) with lots of flavor. I'll definitely be back. The friendly staff will take care of me even if my order is screwed up the first try."}
{"text":"An inconsistent location. Sometimes prompt and nice, sometimes not. When El Pollo Loco changed their menu a few months ago, this location refused to even consider making the discontinued item, a sharp contrast to two other El Pollo Locos I frequent. The food here is nicely prepared, however, and remains a relatively healthy fast food alternative."}
{"text":"What distinguishes this El Pollo Loco from most others is its spacious dining room. The staff here also does a nice job of maintaining the salsa bar, an area in which some locations fall short. 

Located on the back side of Arizona Mills shopping mall, near some other restaurants that have closed, the location offers a quiet break from the chaos of the mall. It's also easily accessible if you are passing by and not visiting the mall itself."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is one of the best, if not the best, fast food options for calorie and fat conscious diners. Their under 500 calorie menu has expanded to approximately 10 items. The ones I've tasted have all been filling and flavorful. 

The variety of sides is fantastic for fast food or even semi-fast food. I don't remember steamed broccoli being offered at Chipotle. 

The restaurant is also kid friendly. What kid doesn't want a chicken leg and their choice of sides like mac & cheese. And did I mention they have chocolate churros? 

I really like this location. It's not particularly new, but it's clean. The salsa bar is always well maintained, The staff is friendly and is very patient with customizing orders in strange ways like my family is prone to do. 

Update 1-23-15: Second thoughts about this location. Dirty & mostly empty salsa bar (the entire 45 minutes we we there), empty napkin dispensers (entire time), a double chicken wet burrito that was dry and unrecognizable - and they screwed up our order. Reducing the rating to three stars, hopefully temporarily. Giving three stars due to positive past experiences, but tonight was a one star night."}
{"text":"So tried this place for the first time and overall it was pretty good. I like the fact that it is cooked over open flame right there so you can actually see it is fresh..@ Certain places the food you eat can be somewhat questionable. ''is it really chicken?\"...  got a family order which came with three large sides. The sides are typical of what you would get at like KFC or something similar mac n cheese, rice, beans, veggies etc... Everything comes with fresh tortillas too.. Which i really like and i gotta give it up for their spicy avocado salsa. Chicken was good..Flavorful. it is a chain restaurant so it is a typical fast food place so nothing special inside but i have to admit for being a fast food joint the place was pretty effin' immaculate even all the salt and pepper shakers were all lined up perfectly on every table( don't ask why i notice these things i just do). but hey the way i see it if the environment is kept clean, then the food must be well prepared as well.  your alright in my book crazy chicken."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Today i went for lunch and the price i paid ($7) for a 2 piece combo meal was waaaayyy over priced! The chicken pieces i got were tiny. More like half a thigh & leg. The black beans and veggie's  i used to love. THink they switched up the black beans brand and im not a fan. The veggies were hard, not steamed. Overall im disappointed with the changes. I dont think I'll be going there as often anymore"}
{"text":"Ordered a double chicken tostada salad and the rice was hard and uncooked. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Dear Pollo Loco, why ask for what type of tortillas we want if you will not include it on the order? Same goes for salsa and salad dressing...
I placed an order via drive through to find out I was missing my churros, salsa, tortillas and dressing. The bad thing is that this is the second time they forget part of my order and I find out when I get home. I should have learned my lesson and checked before taking off but I figured it was a one time mistake.

I was thrilled a new location near by had opened buy they just can't get it right! Also, the chicken seemed deep fried instead of grilled. It was so overcooked that it appeared to be  chicharron style. 

Please train your staff on how to treat customers and how to pack an order."}
{"text":"On 7/24 in the evening, I order a 10 piece family meal and a chicken avocado taco (single not platter).  When we received the food our drive through attendant \"Manny\" informed us they made an error and gave us the taco platter at no extra cost.  What he didn't inform us of was the fact they stripped out 2 pieces of chicken from the family meal to manage the cost of their mistake!  All this with a goofy grin on his face.  Not coming back for hair brained service like this."}
{"text":"This location kind of sucks. Stingy in portion sizes.

Didn't have the menu lit up In drive thru the last time I went.

Once my tortillas were forgotten and although I was polite about the matter, they refused to give me any when I went back. Guess bad reviews are better than giving up a tortilla that probably cost them 30 cents"}
{"text":"This location is convienent for me. People there are friendly. Place can get busy and wait is usually a little linger than I like but meals are prepared at time ordered so the freshness makes up for the little extra wait time."}
{"text":"I tend to order their avocado and chicken burrito. If you go at the right time, the food is always fresh and well made. However that's the problem. Finding the right time. The consistency isn't there on the quality. For the inflated price they charge, I expect perfection every time."}
{"text":"If there were NEGATIVE STARS, I would rate this a -5.  This was my first visit to an El Pollo Loco and it will be my last - not because of the food, but the poor customer service provided. The associate who took my order and served me at the window was rude and beyond approach. He was rude and abrasive when I was ordering at the intercom. Being my first visit, I was not familiar with what was included in meals. While I should have walked into the store instead of going drive through (because it was the first time I was there), I was unable to due to having small children alseep in the car with me.  After each item I ordered, he was short and rude. He made me feel like I was wasting his time and I felt rushed.  Then coming up to the window to pay - there was no hello, no how are you, no how is your day going. It was - $7.32.  Then he takes the money and walks away.  Much later, he comes back and asks if I want salsa.  I say - yes.  It was not him, but a woman who later bags my food and asks the same thing, if I want salsa.  I say - yes.  As I say this, I see him standing next to the bag of food and he glares at me and tells the woman (who is bagging my food) - no she didn't she told me she didn't want salsa. Then, they both turn and look at me.  Now, understanding that the staff is a bit younger, a bit inexperienced with customer service and providing a lasting impression - I try to take it with a grain of salt and not say anything.  As I am driving off with the food, my child (who I thought was asleep in the back seat) says to me - mommy, why was that man so rude to you? Did you do something wrong?  My intention was not to get anyone into trouble.  But I could not, in good conscience, leave that type of treatment and not address it - especially when my young child could detect that behavior was rude.  If a child could observe this interaction and understand that it was rude and inappropriate - why/how can this associate not know?  He clearly wanted to make me feel like I was burdening him when I was ordering the food at the intercom and he wanted to continue with the same attitude when I was at the service window.  I understand that ONE ASSOCIATE does not make a business and is not the sole representative of the company.  But I can firmly tell you - that I will NEVER be visiting another El Pollo Loco again.  I will share with my family and friends my displeasure and I assure you - there are many places to go around our neighborhood - we don't need to spend money at an establishment where young punks snap at you when you try to order food.  This was, by far, the WORST experience I have EVER had with customer service.  And the sad part is, the food was not bad - but because of the poor service - I will NEVER return. For medicore food and bad customer service - I paid almost $10 for an individual meal - so sad."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas, I often sent a silent prayer of thanks to the franchise restaurant gods for plunking an El Pollo down minutes from both my house AND work! Chargrilled chicken served in a variety of ways, along with a surprising number of side dishes (for a fast food chain, anyway) that is tasty and good for you AND your wallet. 

My personal favorites are the Pollo Bowl (chicken, beans, rice, pico de gallo, onions and cilantro all done up nicely in a bowl) and the Twice Grilled Burrito.  Muy Bueno!

Now if they would just open one here in Dallas......."}
{"text":"So, my belt was getting a little tight, so I decided I had to do something about it.  Low carb diet, here we come!  El Pollo Loco is a mighty fine place to get a fast food meal, that is pretty healthy, and decently priced.

I drove down here for lunch the other day to get a couple of chicken breasts.  I ordered 2 chicken breasts and my total was around $6.00.  Not bad for some delicious chicken that has no carbs!

El Pollo Loco's chicken is fantastic!  The breasts were a decent size, crispy skin, moist and flavorful in the middle.  Their signature marinade is delicious!  I have to figure out how to make this stuff on my grill at home!

I have been back a couple of times in the last week, and will continue to do so.  Oh yeah....if you sign up for their app, you get a $7.00 credit towards a meal!  Score!  (Shameless plug.....if you do sign up for their app, you can use an \"invite\" code.  I think you get another free coupon...so if you decide to sign up for the app, send me a message and I'll give you my invite code!  Win, win for both of us, right? lol!)"}
{"text":"Disappointed in this one!  

I went online to browse their menu and saw that you could place an order online.  I decided to do so and set my time for pickup at 12:45.  I drove down, parked and walked inside.  Chaos ensued!

I walked up to the counter and told the lady I had placed an order online.  Deer in headlights!  She went to another coworker...deer in headlights!  Another one...same!  Finally she went to the manager on duty and he went in a back room and found it.  To cut them some slack, I believe their \"online ordering\" is brand new, so maybe they didn't get trained on it yet.  Anyways....the manager came up to me and asked me what time my order was for.  I told him 12:45 (It was 12:43 at the time...I was a few minutes early).  He told me that the way it works was that at the time specified, a receipt would pop up from the register and then would get sent back to the cooks.  WTF is that?  If I am ordering online, I want my food to be ready at the pickup time...not start to be made at the time specified.  They definitely need work on this process (I did get a feedback email from them about the \"online ordering\" process, and I left them an honest and detailed feedback on it.)!  The manager made my salad and I was on my way.  About that.................

I ordered a double chicken avocado salad.  Sounded fantastic!  I took my salad back to work, and opened it up.  The avocado was brown and nasty.  I am not even sure how the hell they can serve that.  I HATE when you get a brown or spotted avocado.  That is a key ingredient in the salad, and it was presented all nasty and bruised up.  I tossed that to the side and threw it away.  The rest of the salad was pretty damn tasty.  Some of the lettuce was a bit wilted, but overall the salad was fine.  The chicken was really tasty, and the cilantro dressing was good as well!  Minus the avocado, this salad was a good \"fast food\" salad and I would get it again.

Overall, not too impressed.  That online ordering system is a pure disaster as of right now, and then brown avocado really turned me off.  Not sure if I am coming back to this particular location again.  Meh..........."}
{"text":"The food is great, but I can't understand how a chicken place NEVER has any chicken ready!! It's 6pm on a Thursday night and I'm waiting for my chicken again! What kind of chicken place doesn't have chicken ready during dinnertime?!? It honestly makes no sense!!"}
{"text":"Slow service as usual for El Pollo Loco, the cashier was very friendly, the staff is new and probably needs more training, saucers spilled out into bag twice and when I brought it to the cashiers attention he proceeded to give me more sauces that had already spilled in the bag."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting El Pollo Loco for a couple years now.  It is a great quick option for something fast that is mildly healthy and low carbs (if you order right).  They recently went thru a renovation and really improved the interior.  Service is always prompt and friendly.  

Menu is pretty basic, they have added items like tacos ect.  The tacos are very good but not healthy at all.  The main menu item of course is chicken and they offer a few choices of family meals with 2-4 sides.  I recommend the loco salad with the avocado cilantro ranch, yum, yum.  

The chicken is not fried and is grilled but has a nice crisp to it, and served with corn or flour tortillas. You may doctor up with chopped onion, salsa and cilantro.

If you are in the area and need a quick dinner - Give El Pollo Loco a try"}
{"text":"Double-check your order if you're going thru the drive-thru!!! I was scammed out of 4 pieces of chicken with my order and I never got a receipt!!!! I didn't realize until I drove home from this location!!! Not cool!"}
{"text":"They got my sons order wrong...bf had to go back inside to get the right stuff and they didn't give us the tortilla chips we ordered with our salads and they gave my bf a quesadilla instead of tortillas he ordered. My salad would have been good if it wasn't made up of the core of a head of lettuce and brown avocado with cold chicken. And now I won't crave El Pollo Loco anymore lol. You guys are saving people's diets one customer at a time Haha yay !"}
{"text":"Very Rude Service..... I was asked How can she help me then I begin to order and she walks away and totally ignores me  
I will be contacting the general manager"}
{"text":"a little pricey but, DAMN, that chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with The Crazy Chicken, really.  Their marinating sauce is unique and tasty.  When I have family in town I always get a meal with some sides and everyone ends up happy and stuffed.  They have sweet potato fries which are much better if you ask for them well done.  The burritos are excellent if you don't feel like making your own chicken tacos, and their selection of sauces goes perfect with any of their meals.  I could eat here once a week."}
{"text":"There was a few cars ahead of me and I got in and out very quickly. Customer service was good, she was very nice, I'm only giving 3 stars because I got a avocado burrito and the avocado was HARD af and they didn't throw in any napkins or salsas when they usually do so it was very inconvenient because I was eating this in my car before heading to work and it got messy."}
{"text":"Why the hell am I totally addicted to this place???  I usually get the 3 piece breast/wing combo but substitute the last wing with another breast.  (notice a trend here??).  I usually get the pinto beans and fresh veggies along with flour tortillas. 

Its weird...everyone can remember the best steak they've ever had, perhaps the best sushi but NEVER the best chicken.  Not that I am saying this is the best chicken I've ever had.  It isn't...nothing comes close to my mom's roasted chicken :)

I guess I go here since its so close to my apartment and the fact that it is a bit healthier than standard fast food fare.  Why go to Taco Bell when you got this place?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food chain in town since I can order stuff that isn't god awful for me.  I haven't eaten a big mac since the fall of 1994! 

2 piece breast/wing combo with a double order of steamed veggies always makes for a reasonable lunch...health/pricewise.  I could have the spicy avocado sauce with almost anything...might give corn flakes a try :P"}
{"text":"Love me some el pollo loco! The chicken is wonderful, and I'm a sucker for their Mac and cheese! You can miss me on their other sides though. Just gimme the chicken and cheesy delicious noodles! Mmm!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I was parched one hot summer day so I stopped by for some diet coke.  I've always steered clear of these places because frankly they look sketch.  No one wants to eat somewhere called \"The Crazy Chicken.\"  Nevertheless, decided to get food because it's impossible to resist while you're staring at the pictures on the drive thru menu as you wait for them to take your order.  The guy in the box introduced himself by name (nice touch)!  They have big windows throughout the drive thru so you can see what's going on in the kitchen and watch them not spit in your food as they make it.  Luis did a great job on our chicken al carbon tacos and rice, bean, and cheese burrito off the value menu.  Better than Taco Bell meat pump.  Also, their selection of salsa comes in plastic containers not ketchup packets.  All in all, pleasantly surprised and definitely converted.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving a fast food restaurant a four stars because of its great location and always great service. 

Drive through is always quick, inside is clean. One negative I'd say is to maybe check on the restrooms a bit more.

Overall great store!"}
{"text":"My bad experience at El Pollo Loco Friday night about 8:15pm. I went through the drive-thru with the kids. The screen lights were not on and no one responded to me. I drove up not sure if they were open. That's when rude Liz said \"I was just saying hello when you drove off and if we would like to order I have to go around.\" Ok sure no problem.. I started my order again with the attitude she stated they were out of chips and I can pick a side. I asked her if I can choose any side and she said yes they are all right in front of me. So I ask the kids Liz the cashier made it a point to say I'm waiting for you to tell me what you want. I wanted something else after that she told me she could not do two transactions but i didn't ask for a separate order. That's when I just told her I'm going to pull up and speak to the manager. Liz literally opened the drive thru window saying first of all. I said never mind I'll go inside. Yessica the manager not any better justified her attitude because they are under staffed and said she heard they way she was speaking. Yessica made my order she said they now do have chips. She did not apologize at all or show any type of empathy for how I was treated. It is appalling to me to have experience such bad service from a well known chain. I was shocked and disappointed to have been treated this way. The end result was the manager Yessica making the order and serving me a burnt quesadilla. It's just sad how ignorant/careless people are customer service is key."}
{"text":"Not sure what it is with this particular location but they just can't get it right here. I like El Pollo Loco overall but this location is bad. Like a lot of reviews chicken dried out over cooked. We have tried a few times since this one opened thinking it would get better but just doesn't."}
{"text":"In the world of fast food (drive thrus) El Pollo Loco is one of the better choices in my opinion.  The food is less greasy and there's a salsa bar.  Need I say more?  I'll say it again: SALSA BAR.

I'm not big and I don't need all the food in most combo meals so I made up my own.  I got couple drumbsticks ($1 menu) and a coleslaw.  Washed it down with the Cola on tap. I through down some pico de gallo with most bites and called it lunch. Exactly what I expected.  Chicken and coleslaw via the drive thru.

I'll be driving thru again next time I need me some chicken."}
{"text":"Just spent  23 minutes in the drive thru line, not happy. They might need some guidance in handling a lunch rush."}
{"text":"I realize \"this is fast food\" and not fine dining.. I get it...but I feel my complaints are legit. Over the years, El Pollo Loco has earned my respect as a well run fast food place. Great food at a great value. I've even utilized their catering services throughout the years with great success. There's a huge difference between having a crappy meal and having a crappy meal at a place you know is not a bad place.

Last week, my mother and I stopped at this location to bring home some dinner. First of all, the young man at the cash register was a mumble mouth. My poor hearing aid-clad mother thought she had to get new devices... I assured her it wasn't her ears... the dude talked like he had a mouth of marbles. We had to ask him to repeat himself EVERY...SINGLE...TIME...HE...TALKED... Furthermore, he clearly did not understand the menu offerings... we had to explain ourselves repeatedly and finally found something and pointed it to him so he understood what we wanted to order. FRUSTRATING.

The food... the chicken we were given was way - way - WAY overcooked. We were watching the \"cook\" put it in the box and we were incredulous that someone would deem it edible. It was BLACK. While we were waiting for our food, two other people came up to the counter with burnt chicken. It took forever for mumble mouth and his buddy to realize that they had a pile of people building up with burned chicken. When we showed him the food, he was unconvinced that the food was even bad. I wouldn't have fed it to my dog! He tried to strike some deal - 2 new pieces for 3 burnt ones. We flat out told him \"No, we think we should get all new chicken\". He started throwing attitude our way. My mother, fresh off of a 3.5 hour flight almost went postal on this stupid kid. Meanwhile Senor Grillmaster was flapping his jaws behind the grill, burning more chicken. 

I've been to several El Pollo Locos around the valley and almost always get great food, great service and great prices. This location will not get our business again."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the food at any El Pollo Loco.  

What disturbed me is that out of the 5 employees who were preparing food, only ONE was wearing gloves!!!  Including the cashier (who was handling drink cups and salsa containers in addition to cash), the guy chopping up the chicken for burritos, tacos and bowls (sharp knife, cut potential) or the people preparing tacos and burritos and bowls, they were all handling food without gloves.  Only ONE woman was wearing them.   This is completely disgusting and unacceptable.  I can't believe this is within the standards of the SNHD. 

I will NOT be back to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight 10/3/13. Just a regular el pollo nothing special and nothing bad. The workers were very courteous and asked me how my day was going. I had a 3 piece meal and a great time. I'll be back to this location.

 Oh and I bought a Mac and cheese on my way out and it was nice and fresh!"}
{"text":"Good ole el pollo loco comes through all the time. I always get the family meals here and my entire family is happy when I bring home the delicious chicken and amazing Mac n cheese.
Their customer service is great and I have no complaints on the quality being delivered from this location.
Thank you el pollo loco staff for always being consistent with your delicious chicken."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is hardly on my radar, if ever.  What brought me in today is the free pollo bowl you get with a drink purchase just by using their rewards app, so I was out the door with a drink and chicken bowl for $2.26 (price of lg drink+tax).  I asked the girl at the counter if they had salsa available to which she answered but did not tell me it was a serve-yourself bar at the end of the counter.  By the time I was finished, I noticed it.  Disappointing because my bowl definitely could've used some extra flavour but that's just me being picky.  The customer service was good and the store kept decently clean.  It could've been cleaner.  7/10.  I peeked at the pricing on other menu items just for the future if I decide to go back and everything is actually priced reasonably.  The bowl smelled/tasted fresh, so A+ on quality ingredients.  I hate that cheese and fajita peppers are extra though.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is tasty and they have an under 500 calorie menu that is very good. I really do hate the long wait here at lunch though. It is not fast food and the setup is awkward. People are stepping all over each other as they wait for their food. Hate that..."}
{"text":"This is one of the better locations in the valley. True that sometimes they fail to clean the dining room but the food comes out fully cooked and tasty. The service is hit and miss but they've never been rude to me."}
{"text":"A great experience here tonight. The atmosphere was calm, the dining room is clean, and the service is on point. Beware of the salsa possibly a little too hot but the food has always come out good here for me and my family. If there's a mistake, just kindly let them know and it'll be fixed for you. Shoot all we did tonight was mention that the avocado salsa was super hot this time and we were offered to have our meals remade. Thank you for your customer service. We will continue to patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"This location usually does a good job on their food. I've rarely had an issue here. The quality is there with the flavors but sometimes the chicken pieces are smaller than they should be. Value over quantity is what I respect in the fast food business. I'm not a McDonald's type of person anymore because I'm not 5 years old. The food at El Pollo Loco is geared to be a healthier fast food option and I appreciate that. And that avocado salsa is great so long as someone didn't overdo the jalapeños or add to much water."}
{"text":"I decided to give this new El Pollo Loco that recently opened near my house a try. I went through the drive-through about 20 minutes before closing and ordered some chicken. The girl said, \"We're out of chicken\". Out of chicken?  Isn't \"chicken\" in the name of the establishment?  How can a chicken place be out of chicken and still be open?  Pretty sad. Here's a tip, turn the lights off and go home if you have no chicken!
Anyway, I went to KFC where they have chicken!
By the way, I give KFC 4 for their chicken!"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco for a quick bite after my business partner and I had a meeting restaurant was clean tried the shrimp tostada and it was delicious fast service and friendly I'll be back when I'm back in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Awful.  The chicken is so burned we can not eat it.  Very dry, skin is black.  The cost was $23.20 for an 8 piece meal and none of the pieces of chicken are edible.  I wished I could post a picture of the chicken because they would go out of business tomorrow.  It has just be remodeled and what a total waste of money.  Terrible food, and the drive thru was so tight it was hard to make the turn to get through."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me! This is seriously getting sad! Every time I come to this location, I never know what I'm going to end up with! The tacos were cut short of their insides and then I received the wrong quesadilla ugh!!!!! So annoying! Why oh why can't you people follow the instructions for the amount of food that needs to go into a taco!!!"}
{"text":"Great new option in Ahwatukee. Fast food, but a huge difference to the typical unhealthy fried stuff.
We have tried several options on their menu and have been very pleased each time. Great service, great staff."}
{"text":"Man Jesus take the wheel. The manager her (young African American female) is not pleasant at all. She was rude and condescending. I don't frequent El Pollo Loco much and she would be a reason I would never go back. If she is working that much she needs to go home. She started to take my order then stoped walked away and sent someone else to take my order. Now if anything maybe she realized she was being rude because when she sent Liliana it was like night and day. Liliana was nice and smiled. She made me feel like she appreciated my business. If anything she should have been the manager. Thank you Liliana and to the manager take a vacation because you obviously need it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there's no option for zero stars, today the customer in front of me walk away because the extra charge and lack of customer service of the Asian female manager, I asked for 8 piece chicken and I asked all thighs and she wanted me to charge 1.79 on top of the 9.99 for each one!"}
{"text":"MEH.   This place needs to be better maintained.  The dining room is always dirty.  The staff taking your order are not very friendly.  The chicken seems to be skinnier and smaller at this location when compared to CA locations that I love so much.  

I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of crazy chicken, every other time I've had it the chicken is dry.  Today I grabbed a meal to take home for the husband to have some lunch and when I tried a piece I was jealous of his chicken!  It was moist and flavorful. perhaps another chance I will give them, next time."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here last night and will not be returning to this location. My boyfriend and I went through the drive thru with our 8-month-old daughter and the girl running the drive thru was rude from the very beginning. My boyfriend asked for Flan and she said very abruptly \"We don't have that.\" He politely replied \"Oh, you don't offer it anymore? How come?\" She rudely raised her voice and replied \"No, ask someone else I don't know! I don't make these decisions.\" So I was already irritated. Then we got up to the window and she had a horrible attitude and when she gave us back our change she threw the money at my boyfriend. This is NOT customer service! There are plenty of other people out there who deserve a job and would be better suited than her. That almost ruined our night."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is my favoritest of allll fast food chains. I can eat BRC burritos (short for beans, rice and cheese) everyday and be a happy girl. Ask for extra green salsa. They make all their salsas in house, but the green one is full of cilantro and is super delicious."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco is some fine fast-food Mexican cuisine. One of my favorite things on earth is the BRC burrito.....beans, rice and cheese. Super simple. I load it up with the green sauce, full of fresh cilantro. 

Some things on the menu can be a bit pricey for drive-thru meals, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"It's your average fast food joint, nothing too special here except that the menu offers something different than burgers. The food was OK, not amazing, not terrible. It's great that they have healthy items so I'll be back when I'm too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain, El Pollo Loco is one that is a healthy choice and I'm not ashamed to say I'm a fan.  I come here often for lunch during the work week when I want something fast and good for me.  I was on a BRC Burrito and side salad kick for a while when I was avoiding meat, but lately I'm a fan of the Skinless Chicken Breast meal.  I also like places that have nutritional info available so I can check out healthy options before I get there and you can find that info on El Pollo's website.  The staff is always friendly and the food usually comes out quickly; if it doesn't, you know it just means they're grilling up more of that crazy, good chicken."}
{"text":"paying $5.50 for a chicken burrito or any of their burritos is not worth it! el pollo loco? more like pollo NO loco. they fill the burrito with everything except chicken! i literally had maybe 2 pinches of chicken in my burrito. and this isn't the first time! 

service sucks. they always forget something! either the salsa, napkins or tortillas! why ask me what salsa i want if you don't even put it in the bag every time! 

my advice: avoid this location, but if you have no other choice, make sure to check your bag to see if you have everything. 

also. why get rid of the shrimp? pl"}
{"text":"Well this is the 3rd time I have been to a Pollo Loco for some reason I forget how bad this place is. This location had a great friendly girl at the drive through, but did not give me corn tortillas as requested and gave me flour. Chicken was extra dry and don't expect ketchup or barbecue sauce for chicken because they only give you salsa which is just as bad as chicken. Pretty their potatoes came from a box and corn from the can. Anyway, fast food at its finest."}
{"text":"I came in for chicken. I was told they had no chicken. This is on a Tuesday night at about 7 o'clock. WTF!? Tables were dirty, no cups for salsa, and the salsa bar was a mess! Not impressed at all.... You can do better, crazy chicken!"}
{"text":"It had been years since I stepped foot into an El Pollo Loco.  I ordered off of the under 500 calorie menu-getting a bowl with Chicken, Rice, Black Beans, Pico de Gallo and Broccoli.  I must say, I don't eat enough veggies and crunching on these green trees made me feel like my cholesterol was rapidly improving-but it is still hard to reconcile broccoli in a Mexican Chicken Bowl.  My hubby had the 2 piece meal-and he said the chicken was tasty-though the pieces were more appropriate for a kid's meal-must have come from a petite chicken!"}
{"text":"We're all done with this particular El Pollo Loco. The one we go to in Tucson is usually very good. I was 50 / 50 going into this transaction, not with quality or any like that by simply getting the order correct.  I went through the drive through. The lettuce on my wife's salad was kind of gross and the chicken tacos were suppose to be shrimp tacos. That was the fifth visit there and I've held off on writing the review. We're always looking for something quick and easy with the kids before we hit the road. Can't risk it any more....

Fast forward 5 minutes to my inlaws house avocados taste spoiled and tacos are cold."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have a higher review rating. I like this pollo loco, it's Very clean, and the guy even gave me a $5.00 coupon just help me out on my bill. Will definitely be back for some more chicken!"}
{"text":"Hope no one else had to go through the illness my wife and I did for 48 hours! I wanted to update that while still beyond doubt whatever caused this food poisoning came from here, the store manager has been in contact with me and was very courteous and prompt in her response.

I understand that the bacteria could have come from one of the workers who came into contact with our food, and not the food itself. I feel its worth mentioning that I have dined at this restaurant plenty of times before with no issue at all.  Hopefully this was a one off. My review was just to hopefully prevent anyone coming into contact with what we did that night."}
{"text":"I've visited this Pollo Loco about two-dozen times since review one. This place isn't bad, nice alternative to BK and Mcdonalds, not to mention Fillibertos. But the reason for the 2 stars is the Maricopa health reviews I found (link at bottom). Now they've gotten much better  since but the results look rough. WTF was an FBI inspection needed at a fast food place? 

The quesadilla here just flat-out sucks. It should be their premiere item, instead it costs 5-6 bucks and is just way too thin. It almost feels like a half serving. I also tried the steak quesadilla which was 6.50 by itself (no drink) and it didn't fill me at all. The BRC burrito is a buck and contains just as much food. THE END

{"text":"This el polo loco is very clean and the staff is excellent. 

I'm confused by the lower stars from other reviews? 


I've been to many different el pollo locos and this is by far the best one I've ever been to.  
The young man working the counter is friendly and even answered questions we had. 
He was eager to help and had all the answers. 
The salsa bar is clean and offers many choices. 

We came here for lunch around 11:30 and it wasn't busy at all. 

The bathroom didn't have a mirror that was weird to me but it was a very clean bathroom!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE El Pollo. The chicken is so tasty, the Pollo Bowls are so good and the service is excellent! We have been dining here at least once a week for years now."}
{"text":"RACISTS! If you think white people don't experience racism, COME to this El Pollo Loco to see that we do!

Let's get one thing straight. I freakin' love El Pollo Loco. The salad they have is fresh to death and I've eaten at this location, and recommended it many, many times, but never again will I eat at this location. 

Last night, 2/25/11, my dad, youngest sister and I stopped in so I could get my usual 2 piece chicken meal with 2 salads as the sides with the cilantro dressing. I get this every time, so I know what I want when I go in. 

Not a single customer was in the restaurant eating, nor was there a single soul at the cash register. From what I could see, there were 4 Hispanic workers, 2 girls, 2 guys. 2 guys and a girl were to the left of the grill (or, stage right, if you will)  and the guys were just talking. One of the guys, who must have not been on the clock, kept looking over at us, but not saying anything. The other workers, looked over at us, but ignored us. They didn't say anything, didn't come over to ask if we wanted to order, nada. 

After 5+ minutes of standing there, being ignored, I was getting ticked off. Clearly they knew we were there, but they for d*** sure weren't going to serve us. The guy with his shirt over his shoulder, the one who looked like he was off the clock, walked past and said, \"oh, he'll get your order.\" Both he, and the guy he was talking to and pointed out, then bypassed the registers and went to stand and talk some more, without taking my order, behind the door that is visible in the picture posted here by somebody else. 

F- this place. After waiting and waiting and waiting and NOBODY acknowledging us or taking our order, we all walked out and my dad went over to KFC to spend way more money ($20+) than we would have spent here. 

I loved this place and preferred to go to this location because they have carbonated water as an option on the drink fountain, but no more. They can f- their racist, white hating, selves. I'm taking my business elsewhere. 

If I were the manager or owner and I saw this (check the security tapes to verify my story, we left at 8:20 PM, fyi) I would fire every single employee that was working the line during that time."}
{"text":"Pretty good. First time here. Wasn't overly impressed in a town that specializes in Mexican food. The cashier looked like he could use some ediquette classes, he was very unhappy and blunt. I don't need a maitre d at a place like this but a smile and some information about my order would be nice. 

The salsa bar is good and was a great addition to the tacos. I will come back, but not craving it."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place is close enough to my office to stop in for lunch. Not only was the food and service excellent, the wait was comparable at lunch time.

Oftentimes, food establishments are flooded with people around the lunch hour. And while there were quite a few people walking in, my service was prompt and friendly.

In fact, when they had a simpler solution for my meal, I was called up and given options, I chose, and then got my food within a minute. I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular stop for lunch during the work day.

On a recent visit, my El Tradicional burrito had a pretty nice sized bone in the middle of it. Yes, I found yet another bone in my chicken from two different chains now.

This time, instead of being a big chunk of bone, it was a nice sized rib by the looks of it.

I tried calling the store to let the manager know their staff should be a little more careful, no answer. I know how busy they get during the day, so I figured I would call a different time. No answer. A different day, before the daily lunch rush. No answer. Fill out a form on the corporate website, receive only an autoresponder email. Next visit in, I brought the bone and receipt, manager was too busy to step away.

Oh well, I'll keep eating there, the chicken is pretty good. Will have to see if I have already filled my quota of chicken bone incidents for 2012."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered has been fresh and very tasty.  I really like the salad on the $1 menu.  They recently increased the portion and now charge $1.69 for it, but it is worth it.  It comes with a cilantro lime dressing that I love.  The side choices are OK, I am still trying to figure out why macaroni and cheese is on the menu, but it is delicious.  The service is always quick and friendly (I have only ever been to the drive thru)."}
{"text":"If there is a supervisor/manager, they're not doing a good job of it. The food meets el pollo loco standards but the service is poor. I honestly wonder if they train the employees for the drive thru. Simple things such as remembering salsa (especially at a Mexican restaurant), utensils, or even salad dressing. I have been there a few times and my girlfriend orders a salad and they always seem to forget the dressing. Also, repeating my order or being told to \"hold on\" multiple times mid-order is irritating. There seems to be no training or demonstration thereof."}
{"text":"I normally really like El Pollo Loco for their grilled chicken thighs and sometimes I get a salad as well.

Even though the place only had 3 customers inside at 11:30am on a Sunday, I passed up 3 dirty tables before settling on one near the back door.  Um docking a star because of that.

Our food came out quickly which was good, but the chicken was too spicy and so was the medium salsa.

Its OK to have a local flavor for a local restaurant but chains should be consistent in their recipes."}
{"text":"I'm sincerely disappointed with this location. I'm a regular guest at this location and time after time I have given them chances to get it together and make it right. With no exaggeration they have almost every time missed something on my order soda, churros, salsas, tortillas etc and keep in mind these are all different times I've visited this location. Today was the cherry on top! I asked the female who took my order a question about a taco and she rudely responses to me and I asked her to repeat her self and she did in the same tone. I responded that's all I wanted and drove to the window. Once I'm at the window she doesn't greet me, takes my card and gives me no receipt and to top it off she doesn't gives me or even asks me if I wanted salsas! I believe in second chances but after several countless times of screw ups I've had it. If you guys are in the business of losing money and losing clients then your in the right one for sure! You guys lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I use to love to this chain when I was a kid. Now as a adult, I decided to try it again and believe me, I won't be back.  I have gave this location 2 chances and horrible experience. Is there management here? Is there training here? Never again."}
{"text":"Waited in a line that didn't move for 20 minutes. Then waited to order. Waited for 15 minutes at the speaker. Honked. Called out. Cars in front of me gone. I drive around the corner thinking it was broken and another car still at the window. I get up to the window and tried to order and I guess it was too confusing. They couldn't do it!! I left with no food. Stupid people. The last time they shorted me two tacos. Before that no dressing for salads. Always wrong!! And every time I go I spend $40. No more."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times, because it's close to my home and I like the chicken. But over half the time, I don't return home with everything I purchased.  That's an unacceptable percentage. I don't want to have to remember to bring my receipt the next time, so they can make it up to me. I want what I ordered, at the time I ordered it!!! And never an apology. They need to learn to say sorry when they don't do their job right!

After waiting in the drive thru for 15 minutes for a simple order, I got home last night without churros I had paid for. I wanted something sweet for dessert. I ordered it and paid good money, why doesn't it end up in my bag?! This happens over and over, so there's some breakdown in their system. And often, if I don't ask for my receipt, that's missing too. Then I don't get to add points to the app towards a free meal. Mistake always in their favor. Never extra chicken in my bag!  How much money are they ripping off from their customers?!"}
{"text":"They will sell you a combo even though you didn't want chips. They are always looking to rip off. :-("}
{"text":"Maybe it's because they're new. Service was so slow in the drive through. No salsas were offered. Two napkins with a family meal. And, you know, it's not cheap. The specials that you see on national ads aren't evident. The chicken was over cooked. We'll try once more since they're so convenient."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The food is decent, but going through the drive through, they won't give you more than 2 or 3 little salsas. I said I wanted a large side of salsa, and that I would pay for it. I was told they aren't allowed to do that anymore because it takes too long and makes the drive thru slow. I let them know they could either get more salsa or they could refund my order, whichever they thought would be faster. She got more salsa. 
Suggestions for management: put salsa in a pitcher in a refrigerator and when someone orders it, pour it into a container instead of having your employees go spoon it out of the salsa bar with your tiny useless spoons. That would be faster and your customers would also be satisfied. 
I'd rather wait longer in line and get the food I want, than for the line to be faster and me not end up with the food that you have for sale, yet refuse to sell me.
Needless to say, that was my last of many visits. I'll drive further to a different location if I want to eat there again."}
{"text":"I feel that this is a mixture between like Taco Bell and Chipotle. The food here is actually really tasty and they have some really good sauses but in my opinion is a little pricey for the amout of food you actually get. Its somewhere i would go again but only of im not on budget"}
{"text":"Finding good chicken that's cooked fresh and not fried is hard. That's why I love el pollo loco. I can get a chicken bowl without rice to get shreds and keep these gainz brah. 

I go here all the time. Order food, get food, eat food, fart in car, and go about my day. Why would someone write a yelp review for a fast food joint? That's because it was special today. An el pollo loco employee's customer service display wowed me. 

This young man seemed to love his job. He genuinely seemed to love it. I can see him becoming a CEO of something someday. I hope gets a scholarship or something. Usually it's busy when I go in. He helped us with a smile, tried to upsell with a smile. We sat down ate our food. It was slow and I watched him clean the dining room, cleaned the salsa station, and came by out table and asked if he can take our empty tray and take care of it for us. He did and I looked at his name tag. I was really appreciative that he did that, at a fast food place.

Wow. I hope his bosses see this and tell him about this yelp review. Patrick you are the man."}
{"text":"Food was good, basically what you'd expect from Pollo Loco but we had to wait 28 minutes for our food  and when it arrived the order was wrong. I'll give it another shot and hopefully the service will be better."}
{"text":"There is nothing like walking into El Pollo Loco and actually seeing the chickens grilling in back.  The smell hits you as soon as you walk in the place.  I guess it makes me feel good to see \"fast food\" actually taking its time cooking.
I love the chicken bowls.  I always substitute the pinto beans for the BBQ black beans.  YUMMY!
And, if you so desire, you can order tortillas on the side and they give you a choice of corn or flour.  Both are really good!  Chewy, stretchy and don't fall apart when you use them to eat.
The restaurants are always clean and well-kept.  I've been to a few different locations."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday 7-7-15 around 6pm through the drive-thru. Drive thru lady was friendly.  I got a half chicken combo with black beans, rice, an extra side salad, and....drumroll please....tres leches cake.  I've never had tres leches cake before and it's one of the best things I've ever had in my mouth. There's only two things that taste better than that cake."}
{"text":"Review is for CRAIG ROAD STORE.  I like El Pollo Loco and love their Tortilla soup.
This location is close to my daughters and I have given it more than enough 'tries', but they FAILED OVER AND OVER. It doesn't matter if I eat inside or go thru the take-out, this place sucks.

SERVICE AWFUL, you tell them something is needed, or not working or empty..NO RESPONSE, NO ACTION, NO \"I'M SORRY\".

FOOD, they are \"out of chicken breast\" !!! WTF? I think the drive thru kid was just too lazy to take an order.  Next time, \"out of Tortilla Soup\", (more than once) !!!
Next time, inside \"dining\" experiences consisted of: sloppy, not too clean looking,  the ice machine was empty. Staff notified (by each customer) no response.  So the show was just  watching people's responses to no ice, one at a time discovering this, hearing them tell staff..no response-ever.  Then- the tea machine shoots the tea out towards you, not down into the cup.  Again, no one cared or did anything about it. (they probably secretly laugh at each smuck that gets tea and jumps back from the spray) No sauce choices at sauce bar, no lemons, no straws, no sweetener.  (One kid spent about 3 min out back looking for sweetener...slowly walked back to me with ONE sweet and low! HAHA !!!  Where the heck did he pull that out of???  I gave him a buck for the 'effort'.  He was the only staff that in all my visits ever did ANYTHING service wise.
I drive across town to ANY other location and will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION. oh, BTW...I wrote the company website, it's been over two months, I guess they don't care that one of their franchises SUCKS."}
{"text":"Ordered food for a graduation party (35-40 ppl).  Food was ready when requested.......hot and tasty.  They provided LOTS of plastic utensils, serving utensils, disposable plates and napkins.  

I had not been to this restaurant in many years, but when researching local restaurants for catering I found the menu to be impressive and the pricing to be very reasonable.  We had some guests with dietary restrictions (GF) who were happy they could indulge!  I will now be a more frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"I only come for the food. I've allied pollo Loco and they all taste the same and that's good.  The service here was just ok, but like I said, I'm here for the food."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to eat at places such as El Pollo Loco.. Especially with my eating habits and their lack of options for me. Anyways.. my coworker and I stopped by for lunch (because it's close to work and I was out of time). I got a $5 bowl (just beans and rice), which tasted fine, for the most part, she got the street tacos.
 
They gave us some salsa with our order: 2 red, 2 green.. The green was tasty but the red on the other hand I'm sure was rotten.. The containers with the red salsa in them were bloated and ready to explode, which led me to believe they were no good. Sure enough, they exploded upon opening and the smell was awful and so very sour. It was disgusting. Definitely threw those away!

Needless to say, my stomach and my coworkers stomach is upset, 3 hours after consuming less than half of our food. My food had pico de gallo on it, so due to the way I feel, I'm guessing the tomatoes in the pico were bad as well. 

Guess that's why I choose NOT to go here normally.. of course the one time I do, I get sick. Thanks, crazy chicken. You can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa, jerks."}
{"text":"Love Love Love the new healthy menu! So much to choose from. I'm glad they are next door to my gym location.
The drive thru is hardly ever busy and the staff is always so nice and answers any questions you have about the new menu.
I ordered two shrimp tacos with avocado, two for 7$. So delicious and healthy with the wheat tortilla and cabbage. I was full after just eating one. And the shrimp are medium size(not bay shrimp!), and so flavorful.

Definitely give it a try if you don't have time to sit down for lunch and want a fresh healthy option."}
{"text":"Absolutely a joke. The chicken they serve seem to be half servings. Mac n cheese is always cold along with the mashed potatoes. If they happen to serve hot it's over heated n over cooked. The service is terrible. When u ask for something additional they sigh and act like you're such an inconvenience. Wish there was a better one close to my work."}
{"text":"Pintos tasted spoiled.  tortillas were ripped to shreds.  salsa was bad.  chicken was dry.  mashed potatos were good.  i like EPL.  This was my 1st and last time at this location."}
{"text":"Chicken is good . Tostada bowl was disgusting . Black and brown avocado and an uncooked jalapeno topped ot off . Pineapple salsa looked like it was expired . Threw the thing away as it was take out . Never going back ."}
{"text":"NOpe. 

This place has messed up my order more than once.
The food is good sometimes, but i credit El Pollo Loco in general for their food being good, but each location is responsible for the service and quality, which this place lacks.
A few months back, they forgot one of my items, had to go back and get it. It sucks but mistakes happen. 

So I went there recently, and Im not sure how to feel. I ordered a Mango grilled salad, with chicken. I did not see a single mango... Leading me to believe I didn't get the right salad.... Second, the bottom was saturated in bean juice, and there was hardly a tablespoon of chicken... The idea of the salad, and what I did get tasted pretty good... So much room for improvement. It seems like they are pre packed, and just sit there waiting to be ordered.. Not fresh. 

Speaking of not fresh, the red tomato salsa in the little round cups.
 I got a few in my bag and decided to put some one my salad. WHOA mistake, it was ROTTEN, it literally tasted like an old dirty tomato, and dirt. It smelled of a molded vegetable. I almost threw up.

Get your shit together."}
{"text":"I love their chicken, this location has drive thru and huge parking spot shared with Albertsons. 
I got breast and wings take out and it looks like a leftover food, because of how they presenting the food in the box. Would be better if they plate a Togo box nicer, something you would expect from big chain franchisees. You know, it taste better when it looks better!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am only giving two stars not because I do not like this place but because of a particular instance.  I went over for dinner around 6pm on a Friday night...the parking lot was packed.  I walked in and placed my order.   I started to look around and there were like 7 different clusters of people.....it seemed like some poor man's group therapy deal where a bunch of wackos met on Meet-Up.  Wackos can be cool but wth are they doing taking up the space in the restaurant?  Also, usually I have lunch and not dinner.  1000% different.  At dinner all the table were dirty and the place looked pretty bad.  Maybe they were waiting for the group therapy session to clear out.  But, the lunch crew runs a tight ship.  Kick out the weirdos and give me the lunch crew and I give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"We went through the drive through at this location at lunch time and they said that they were out of flour tortillas (?)  What?  Not the first time this kind of thing has happened.  Not wasting time here anymore."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy the food from El Pollo Loco. I always get excited when I see one. Decided to try something new the shrimp avocado plate was very disappointed when I had crunchy rice was not cooked right the shrimp and other stuff was great."}
{"text":"I hope they consider making an El Pollo Loco in Hawaii...

It tops KFC, Popeyes, Churchs.  No joke.  

The chicken has a marination like no other.  Like it says on their poster...If they tell you what they use they would have to hire you (don't quote me on that...all I know that it is something to that concept)

Service here was ok also.  

I would definitely recommend this place if you are wanting to eat some good chicken."}
{"text":"Gross!! I came here to have lunch but I'm totally grossed out by the bathroom and the fact a bug almost ran over my foot while I was waiting to use the restroom...  I guess I'm headed to the next closest El Pollo Loco cause I can't eat here..."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Staff is rude! The place is dirty and they don't know what they are doing. On multiple occasions they have forgotten items in my order, which I didn't notice until I was already home. I swear to never go back!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't like to review chains but this is as a warning! I've been to other El Pollo Locos that were good but this one always has burnt chicken, we've gotten chicken bones in our meals two different times, and have experienced wrong orders."}
{"text":"I come to this location at least once a week. 

I really love their salads, and they are a great size and when I have a $5 coupon they are are great value. The cilantro dressing always taste fresh and delicious. 

The only reason I give this place 4 stars and not 5 would be the chicken... crazy this place is called el pollo loco but the chicken most of the time is super dry and just meh. When it's diced or put in dishes you can't tell as much because the sauces and other components are helping the taste and texture but when I get the family deal with drums and thighs... ouch not good. 

But I do love them salads... mmmm, just had one... I'm gonna nap now. Zzzzzz"}
{"text":"I live nearby and was hopeful that this new location would be good since not all their locations are. 
Yay!  This location is great!!  Chicken is juicy and flavorful.   I really appreciate that the carry out order comes out on a tray and they review everything to make sure it's right before bagging it.   Friendly staff and reasonably quick.   Great for a good cheap meal that the whole family likes."}
{"text":"I've been to several Pollo Locos in California and they were always good, so I was looking forward to going this new location close to home.  But this one is a \"Pollo No-go.\" 

Got carry out for the family and they made three different errors in in making the order.   (missing dressing for the salad; added shrimp- that we cannot eat; wrong beans).   Plus the chicken was too dry.   You simply can't afford to mess up the chicken when 'pollo' is the name of the restaurant!

I called to complain about the mistakes with the order.   The guy on the phone gave me his employee number and said that he would \"take care of\" me next time I come in.   What does that mean?  Shouldn't they take care of every customer?   I'm not too eager to go back. 
I filled out an on line survey that asks if you want to be contacted.  I said Yes, but haven't heard back. 

Even though this is a new location, their management seems to not care or are just too disorganized to function well."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say we love el pollo loco. Was happy one opened close to us. But I'm beyond irate and so done with El Pollo Loco now. If I can give this review negative 5 stars, I would! Three times our family members been sick from eating El Pollo Loco. First was my mother in law. Few months later it was me. Then just a couple of days ago was my 2 year old!!!! This is the last straw. Having a two year old throw up non stop until she got rid of all the nasty food, was the scariest thing ever. After all the El Pollo Loco was gone, we fed her some clear liquid to try and hydrate her. Nope, nothing was staying down! She kept throwing up until 4 in the morning! The worst and scariest experience ever! So I really advise everyone, especially those who have little children to stay away from El Pollo Loco. Especially this location! Disgusting!!! El Pollo No-No!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this El Pollo. The quality of food is always very high. The service is quick and courteous. 

When we are in need of some flavorful grilled chicken and fresh made salsa they do not disappoint. 

If you have not tried the stuffed quesadillas, they are full of chicken, avocado and amassing sauce."}
{"text":"Two words: Hell. No.

I have never been to an El Pollo Loco, but I've heard good things, so I went to this location to check it out last night. I ordered the kids pollo bowl with tortilla chips, which is essentially rice, beans, and chunks of chicken.  As soon as I took the lid off, I knew something was wrong.  Was it supposed to be a soup? Because my bowl was SWIMMING in liquid.  I assume that it is from the container they keep the beans in, but it's like they didn't even bother to drain the liquid before they threw the beans in there, and now my bowl is more than half-full of bean water.  The tortilla chips were on par with Taco Bell.  

I might go back to try their chicken on the bone, but never again will I order a bowl from this place.  Gross."}
{"text":"I remember El Pollo Loco from living in California. Since I've seen this location under construction for some time, I was surprised to find it open today. Looks like they will officially open on Monday 6/12/17. Today, they were in the midst of training employees and giving food/drinks away for free. What a great idea! I ordered double chicken bowl Togo and it tasted yummy and so fresh. It came with fresh tortilla and salsa/guacamole. I will return when they officially open, thanks for the food!"}
{"text":"Just had to wait for ~15 mins in the drive through because a customer wanted to talk to the manager about a complaint in the drive thru.  I was a little annoyed they didn't tell them to come inside but I do not know the situation.  What I really liked was I pulled up to pay and get my food, didn't say anything, however the manager gave me my food on the house without me having to express I frustration.  I have always had good experiences with this el pollo loco but this one made me want to come leave this review!  Thank you for being conscientious of your customers!"}
{"text":"I want to like this location, we go here often but they never get an order right. The food is good but the staff does not pay attention or act like they care when they mess up. Last visit they left out an entire side, all the hot sauce we asked for was missing, they gave me an inedible soda water instead of sprite, and we had no way to eat our food because we were given no utensils at all. Too bad."}
{"text":"its been over a year since I've had this pollo! 

I dont eat fast food often but when I do I make sure to take advantage of the coupons which is what  brought me
in today! I got an 8piece chicken w/ tortillas and the mango chicken tostada all for around $11. 

their chicken is still bomb.com (is that saying still used? bomb.com) ahahhahah!

anywho, make sure to try   their green salsa made with avocados."}
{"text":"Worst place to come eat.  My fist time here to this location and the last time.....
Kids running around no one tells them anything. Rice hard tastes a day old, pico de gallo no flavor also tastes old, chicken tooooo dry, flies flying everywhere. Location dirty and very loud. I DO NOT RECOMMEND This location at ALL...."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru just before 5pm and kinda slow but they was busy I guess inside. normally drive thru goes pretty quick. did know what, o eat healthy so El Pollo Loco it is. Great Chicken Taste!"}
{"text":"This place was nice. The assistant manager took our order and gave several good options.  We got the combo that includes sides and drinks. The food came quickly and it was tasty. The mash potatoes and gravy was especially good. Overall a nice dinning experience."}
{"text":"Rude staff no manager present. I am the customer. I pay your bills. You are serving me. Act like you care a tiny bit"}
{"text":"I usually love El Pollo and get decent quality for a fast food place. This location though is terrible. This is the third time my salad has been wilty and gross. Bummer that this is the only one close by me."}
{"text":"The absolutely stupidest run restaurant 4:30 pm and they have no chicken ready.  Management is useless and could care a less about customer service.  What a joke."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I like going to El Pollo Loco because their meals are pretty good and decently priced. But the last few times going, the customer service has been absolutely horrible. 

I get the drive thru you can't really hear, but you don't have to be rude. Also don't rush the customers when they order, sometimes it's hard to decide what you want. It's been common in a lot of fast food places and even restaurants lately of employees giving rude customer service. Trust me I work on food as well, but I could never be rude."}
{"text":"Staff is extra friendly and treat you like you are at a good friends home. They do everything possible to make you feel welcome. The food is already delicious in el pollo loco but the friendly staff made it taste better. Thank you"}
{"text":"Super nice employee and good Mexican fast food. I didn't get the dressing I asked for but clearly just an oversight."}
{"text":"Okay.... No. 

I normally really like El Pollo Loco. Normally, the chicken is pretty good and it is decently priced, allowing you to fill up on relatively little money. Today, however, I experienced a not-so-great version of their service.
I went through the drive through and asked for a chicken and cheese quesadilla, ONLY chicken and cheese, and a cherry coke. The drive through took forever, as it normally does, and when I finally got my food, I continued on my way to work. Upon inspecting my food (as I always have to do due to my picky-eaterness) I found sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. *shudders* I also ordered a cherry coke and received regular coke. On top of the food mistake, they wildly overcharged me for my meal: a $4 meal was somehow $9.
So, I went back to the restaurant, but this time I went inside. I waited my turn (again, it took forever) and told the lady at the counter of the mistake on my quesadilla (I didn't even bother with my drink.) The worker looked at me and said, \"Oh, you don't want it?\" To which I replied: \"No, I can't have the stuff inside of it... I wanted only meat and cheese. I was also overcharged.\" The worker then turned to her manager and explained the situation. When she was done, she said: \"okay, they're making you a new one\" and went to help the people behind me. I stated \"I was also over charged for my food.\" The worker turned to her manager, and then turned back to me. She said \"We'll just put extra chicken in your quesadilla.\"
.....................   Okay, side note: Dude, really? Really?

So I told the worker, \"I'd rather just have the difference of what I over paid.\" She looked like she didn't know what to do, and finally the manager agreed. So I finally got the difference of what I over paid, and when I stepped to the side, I looked up to see the manager giving me a dirty look. 

1. I know I am the pickiest eater known to man, but if I am paying for food, I don't think it's too crazy to get what I want.
2. It is not my fault that whomever made my food messed up.
3. The MANAGER is giving dirty looks to paying customers... not a very good sign.
4. I was polite about the mess up and STILL got attitude... The worker was okay, I am more miffed that the MANAGER gave me attitude when I was just asking for the mistake to be corrected.
5. I doubt I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love El Pollo Loco and I was so excited when this location opened since it is close to my home. This location seems to get something wrong every time I go. I've been here quite a few times since I love the food, but so far I have been short changed, I've been given the wrong order, I'll ask for no onions and get onions, they have missed one of my sides, one time they were out of chicken, once my salad was frozen, and the last time I got attitude from the girl at the drive through window when I asked for salsa. I keep hoping they will get it together. But unfortunately, I've been avoiding this location now."}
{"text":"Poor food and very expensive prices are a bad combination. This location is new so I can forgive the staff, but they certainly need much more training.  It is a chain and I cannot forgive badly done food or outrageously high prices. 

The chicken was dry and flavorless.  This had to be the skinniest chicken I have ever seen. $14 for a single, skinny chicken is crazy pricing. 

Clearly the owner never bothered to see the roast chicken options in the area. Costco or Sam's Club sell you huge, juicy, whole chicken for $5. Grocery stores are a little more.  I don't think I will ever go to El Pollo Loco again. I assume this store uses the same recipes and chicken suppliers as the rest of the chain. It is not good food."}
{"text":"Got the 2pc combo with corn and mashed potatoes. Very good! Place is clean, staff was nice."}
{"text":"What the heck was I thinking to come here! The coupons make the food look so great and when you get there, it looks like a tv dinner and some of the dishes taste like one.  We came because we got the coupons for $5 entrees: 

chicken enchiladas- tastes like a tv dinner
chicken salad- didn't come in a tortilla bowl, chicken was very dry, salad taste like from a cafeteria

2 piece chicken plate with tortillas- chicken was dry and small

The only thing they have going for them is their salsas and clean seating area. The workers were nice too, but the food... Well, I just don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Last few visits have been good so figured an update was in order. After my complaint to corporate I haven't witnessed the cleaning chemicals being placed right next to the food so hopefully it was addressed. Service has remained friendly."}
{"text":"Has been much better lately. Customer service at the counter could be a bit more friendly but nothing too bad. Chicken has not been burnt my last few visits and has tasted very well."}
{"text":"Very good location with friendly staff who always make sure to greet you when you come in the door. The food is great and the staff always seem helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"When I last went here my soda was flat and I did not get the dressing for my salad. The workers sound like they are in a hurry to get your order and send you on your way. How about you take the time to be more efficient so you may have happier customers! Pretty disappointing experience maybe next time I'll go to Del taco down the street instead of here."}
{"text":"I only wish the manager's of Any business with the care of their own parking lot keep a clean place and civil no idios parking like they do on the onw front yards in they onw house's"}
{"text":"I almost lost faith in El Pollo Loco, I was super excited that they were in the neighborhood . When they first moved in everything was fabulous good quantity, hot food, and quick service. Unfortunately over the months they seem to decline. I placed a call to the district manager his name is Joe extremely accommodating to his guests, I have been back twice this month and both times received five star service! If you've had a bad experience with El Pollo Loco within the past six months give them another shot the new general manager seems to be putting order into this restaurant and it seems to be on its way back up to five stars again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this El Pollo Loco location lacks quality, customer service and order accuracy.

I live super close to this location however now find myself traveling further away from home to ensure a good experience. 

The staff has a bad attitude and they often get my order wrong or leave something out that I paid for.

When there is an issue that is their error and not my fault they never apologize or make it right. The staff almost seems resentful when they make a mistake on my order.

The Manager does not speak good english so it is hard to communicate with her regarding issues. 

The last time I was there around 7pm, keep in mind they close at 11pm. The cashier Ivan was arguing with me because they were out of chicken breast (white meat preference). He said I could wait 30 minutes and he informed me that they have guidelines to follow that Corporate makes on cutting back on chicken that is made???? I am not sure how that is my problem as a customer but ok?

I will never understand going into a chicken restaurant and them being out of chicken? 

This location has a bad attitude and does not care, avoid at all cost!!!

You have been WARNED!"}
{"text":"Ivan is an Amazing Awesome employee at this location. If this review was only about shift lead Ivan than I would give 5 stars, unfortunately his crew canceled that out. 

I have an issue EVERY time I visit, rude crew members that mess up my order too often.

This most recent bad encounter was with Kimberly via the drive thru. There was an issue with my order no fault of mine and she responded with attitude. She was in the wrong as verified with her shift lead and yet all she could do is roll her eyes and walk away from the window.

I am tired of being treated like crap and argued with in a hostile way when they continue to mess up on my orders.

I really am not returning to this location ever as it is not worth the aggravation. I will drive further and visit the sahara/decatur location."}
{"text":"Absolutely not happy about the to go order I just got 30 min ago I got tge (big bowl avocado chicken no rice ) the guy said to me its a big bowl everything is double so when I got back to tge office all I saw was soupie beans 6 little pieces of chicken some corn and 3 slices of avocado ...not even near anything double and thats for a bowl of bean soup for 8$ ..not going back there! !!"}
{"text":"Well another fast food place that management does no training of the employees. I sent the food back because it looked like someone threw up in the bowl and plate. The shift leader Bryan asks what's wrong with the food. I told him it doesn't look anything like the pictures in the marquee or the adds. He said it has all the same ingredients.  I ask where. He showed me how he places everything on the plate and bowl. He took them both back and remade them .I watched him do it this time. He threw everything on the plate and bowl . No wonder it looks like it did.   Watch out for the hordes of flies in the dinning room."}
{"text":"I love pollo loco. It is all delicious. The salsas are fresh. They fixed the drinking fountain area which used to always smell like sewage from the drains."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give more stars, but I can't at this point. When they are on, they are the best El Pollo in Vegas, but when they aren't, it's pretty bad. Messed up orders, food is not good, and the employees have issues. It's almost like 2 different restaurants. When they are good, the entire experience is good. When they are bad, it is entirely the opposite. Hope they can find the magic of when they are good and keep it."}
{"text":"Do you like expired chicken? Well, this is the place for you.  Either they don't throw out the chicken thats expired or they by almost expired chicken and dont use it in time. 

Food suppliers have specific dates of expiration on chicken. El pollo loco is too good for that lol

Respect the chicken? No, respect the health dept"}
{"text":"Best avocado dressing in Tempe! Customer service is on point. My favorite Pollo Loco. They also have a low calorie menu that has options, not just salads. The double chicken salad has lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Always busy!  Very friendly staff.  If they make an error, they will make it right.  Love the menu selection.  The chicken is cooked right there on large rotisserie burners.  The cilantro dressing is to die for!  Love the little salsa bar!"}
{"text":"The best place for fast food Mexican all fresh made  food this place has very friendly staff great burritos"}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco to me is quazi healthy Mexican fast food.... Wow... was that a mouthful. What I mean by that is their chicken is grilled, not deep fried and they have a pretty healthy menu when it comes to fast food restaurants. 

Nothing to spectacular to say about this location other than it is the closest Pollo Loco to my house and I tend to go through cycles of either loving this stuff or hating it. Go figure."}
{"text":"Quick. Fast. Fresh and always Delicious!
This is definitely my go to for fast-food. The only one that's not as bad as all the others"}
{"text":"I love the chicken tostada salad, delicious.  What I don't love is the nasty  attitude of the girls in the drive through.  You can tell she totally loves her job.  Fake it till you make it!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. The worst $10 I've ever spent at a restaurant. They should rename this place \"El Vegetal Loco\" seeing as how the burritos and tacos are 80% vegetables (Mostly raw onion). My chicken burrito was basically a bean and cheese burrito with just a small bit of sour cream on one end. What miniscule chicken that was in the burrito was bland, tasteless, not an ounce of seasoning! You couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"While the customer service at this location is always pretty good, I almost never get my entire order (unless one specific girl is working the drive thru window, but I haven't seen her for a long time). Usually it's my tortillas, but the other night they forgot an entire chicken breast. 

Worse, though, is that I have not had well made rice from this location in at least a year. The rice is what made me a El Pollo fan many years ago, and it's always a disappointment when it's not made correctly. It's almost always soggy--once I had rice so soggy that it congealed into a weird rice pudding kind of thing. But lately they've managed to make their rice even worse by failing to properly mix the seasoning, so I often find giant chunks of seasoning in my soggy rice. 

I'm probably going to start going to a new location, like I should have a long time ago. This location is just so close to my house, but I'd rather have the inconvenience of driving a little further than missing food and crappy rice."}
{"text":"I was excited they were opening a closer one to me. Normally I go to the one on Charleston. I went and brought the 3 course meal . Spend $35 dollars,  was asked what kind of tortillas I said corn please. They forgot the corn tortillas. I asked for extra avocado on the salad which I got charged for they said they would put it separate, they didn't!!! They also put maybe like five tiny pieces of chicken in the salad looks nothing like the picture. The actual salad looked like it was half empty. And the avocado was brown with a bunch of seasoning on top of it to cover it up. I would honestly take a picture of it but its kind looks disgusting. The chicken was fine. What's funny is that since I had asked for extra things I actually tipped the guy that was the server in the window. But it's fine I will be driving the extra mile to the Charleston location .You would think that a new chain restaurant that just opened up would want to make sure that they are serving the freshest best looking products to make sure that they can build a customer base. Hopefully they get their act together because I was actually looking at the other reviews and they have similar things like the fact that they put moldy tomatoes in the salad. That is disgusting"}

2nd time there craig road location 
2nd time all bean rice and tortilla in a CHICKEN burrito"}
{"text":"Well I thought the food was AWESOME. I just got a simple taco al carbon. But added avocado. It was great! Especially for being gluten free! And man they make paying extra for that avo worth it! They didn't skimp a bit!
They were a bit short handed so I felt bad because they were obviously swamped and trying to work everything out. But when they get swamped and are short handed, customer service takes a hit. 
Nothing awful, they were all fine to work with. Just not as \"pleasing\" as I guess you'd assume to get. But that's ok!
Still plan on coming back because it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I like the food here - but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  For instance, today I ordered my first Online order, so I came into get it.  The counter clerk merely gave me my food with no drinks.  When I asked about the drinks, she looked at the computer and said oh you had a water.  Then I said no, I had iced tea.  On my order on my phone it very clearly states iced tea - the water was with the kid's meal.  I felt she was quite irritated with me; when I asked her if I had to come in or could pick up my online orders via drive through, she seemed even more irritated, coming close to rolling her eyes.  It's quite upsetting as it is hard to find places where you can pick up high-protein meals via drive through."}
{"text":"just spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break to redeem my free birthday meal. a man was screaming at the manager because he found plastic in the salsa bar . he fished it out and threw it in the counter while the manager yelled back at him and wouldn't give him a free meal. she gave up and walked away....instead of removing the salsa the man just put his bare hand in. no one changed the salsa in the 20 minutes I was there. they were too busy talking shit about the man in Spanish loud enough to be heard in the dining room. I will say that the cashier Jennifer held her cool and did the best she could in spite of the whirlwind going on around her."}
{"text":"ordered their 3 piece combo.  Chicken were super tiny and very dry.  We will never go back to El Pollo Loco. It's not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 5 and lost my appetite. The floors looked like someone dumped a trash can out on them, the tables were all dirty like they haven't cleaned them all day. There was only two tables being used too with the drive through blocked off by cones so it's not like they were too busy.. the little sauce station was dirty with sauce and stuff splattered across it. I was kind of ashamed for the people working there for the lack of care that was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and was disappointed with the customer service the so call manager or supervise. She was rude!! I dont know who she was since i know her name badge wasnt hers since it said Rafael!! She needs to learn customers service."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and they always have the best customer service. For example, today Isaa helped me and the food was done quickly and she was very nice. Always worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Not really fond of the place but the hubby loves it.  Close by and we get some decent coupons in the mail.  The family dinners are OK but I miss the tropical elements El Pollo Asada had.  The salads are mediocre and I have never gotten one that I ordered.  Always a mix up.  The new bowls are not so good either.  All in all the place is average.  The staff is not friendly but they aren't rude either.  The wait time is long and mix ups common.  It is a very average establishment which we visit when the hubby has a Jones for it and I can deal with a mediocre meal.  It is a shame because it is close to us and it has such potential.  I like El Pollo Asada much better and wish they hadn't been chased out of business by this boring restaurant chain."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas luncheon yesterday and ordered their $130 family pack. The lady told me that we would get a 15% military discount. So after tax I was expecting a bill of around 130. We got there and the guy tells me 152. Fine print on the receipt said 15% discount up to 1.50. Really?  I was mislead. I asked for a total and she told me she could nor ring it up until I came in. We had a limited budget so luckily I had an extra 20 in my own wallet.   Food and sides were good I just wished they would not have mislead me."}
{"text":"Very disappointing place. After reading reviews I see I am not the only one. The first time they opened they had great food and quality but since then all dropped rapidly. Bad workers and bad quality and you get less. I always hoped it would get better but every single time it proved me wrong. I decided that the yesterday visit was my last. Ordered a Chicken Tostada and got a horrible taste of chicken and rice that tasted like nothing and was also hard. The tostada wasn't good either. Threw half of the food away. It's just not the money worth anymore."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and great food.  Went through the drive thru. Had a few questions and the guy was very helpful.  Food came incredibly fast and was really great.  They even included salsa's without being asked.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Saturday night at 9pm, you're not sure if you have enough chicken and you don't close for another 2 hours? The drive through line wasn't long but the wait for just a response to make sure if you have enough chicken was just plain ridiculous. Then the wait for the actual food now. Someone help this place. I swear with the amount of time I waited they must have killed live chickens, plucked all the feathers , and then grilled them on the spot. And they're out of flour tortillas as well. And the other orders after me? Still had to make sure there was enough chicken also. Who the heck is managing this joint!?"}
{"text":"HEALTH HAZARD

How is this place open to the public? Dirty floors, tables, chairs, bathroom, salsa bar, employee work stations. Dirt, trash, and crumbs everywhere! Behind the counter on the kitchen has weird crusty stains. No soap in women's restroom! Ran by teenagers! This place is the worst!?!"}
{"text":"I usually get the 2 pc combo but today I tried the Double Chicken Fit Plate.  Wow, it was great.  I love the chicken but know I shouldn't eat the skin so this took that temptation away.

Their Under 500 Calories menu is looking good and I'll try more of those options.  El Pollo chicken is the best."}
{"text":"Dining in at a fast food restaurant is not something I enjoy, but it I will do it from time to time when taking the food to go just won't do. This location is pretty busy and on the few occasions I have dined here, it gets loud and a little hard to hear your own thoughts, much less the conversation form your dining companion. 

The food is that of any other El Pollo Loco and they keep the place relatively clean with a well stocked salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love me some Pollo Loco, but this location is S.L.O.W! I came here around 1:45 thinking the lunch rush would be over by then but the line for the drive-thru still looked quite daunting. I decided to wait it out anyway since I was craving some of their spicy avocado salsa. 

I waited in the line a good 15 minutes before I got my food and was on my way back to work. Not horrible, but still a little longer than you would expect from a fast food drive thru during off hours. Service was still friendly and efficient once I actually got to the window."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new addition to the area and it is quite welcome. We stopped by on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and the place was popping. The drive thru line was extremely busy, but I could not be deterred. I wanted healthy food on the cheap. 

The line went pretty quickly and they gave me no troubles when I used a coupon I had. The service was fast and efficient and they were very courteous and apologetic about the line. I'll be back. So glad we have another fast food option around the area that isn't fried food oriented."}
{"text":"Pollo Loco is usually my go to lunch spot when I'm in a hurry and want something relatively healthy on the go. This was my first time at this particular location and they were packed at lunch. Given the long wait and large amount of volume they seem to serve here, I thought the food would be fresher. That's usually case when there is high turnover. My chicken was dry and you could tell it had been sitting there a while since it had been grilled. They forgot my salsas, so I had to eat them plain, which was even harder to tolerate since the chicken was so dry. 

Service was friendly and I'd probably stop by here again if I'm in the need of a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I enjoy the chicken at El Pollo Loco. I do not enjoy the wait for the chicken at El Pollo Loco and I was admittedly indifferent to the hair that I found on my chicken at my most recent visit at El Pollo Loco. I had waited for ~ 15 minutes for 3 chicken breasts and a wing (no sides, no drink) so I decided to pull the hair off my chicken, remove the portion of skin that the hair was sitting on and have at it. I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary."}
{"text":"The manager for tonight on Tuesday August 22nd 2017 manager on duty with Brenda and she was working drive-thru and he closed at 11 I got there at 9 and I actually special order and she would give it to me have to pay for something I didn't really want so unsatisfied with the service"}
{"text":"I would give it less if I could.  Nothing like ordering a skinless chicken breast meal an they stick it all in one container so when you get home your salad is hot and wilted.  The portions have gotten a whole lot smaller.  This used to feed me after the gym but now I need to find something else to eat."}
{"text":"If I could give them a 0 star I would. I ordered the chicken tostada  with no chicken and or sour cream pretty simple right! The irony is that I placed the order with the assistant manager whom also prepared my meal and didn't even make it correct. It was wrong. I placed a second order while waiting for my remake and they made this one wrong also. The second cashier was very rude and had an attitude problem. The dining area was filthy like it hadn't been cleaned or swept all day. One of the employee's vomited in the men's restroom as I entered I could hear him and he didn't even bother to flush the toilet. My whole experience here was horrendous, granted I don't expect 5 star dining, but I will never eat here again. Poor management."}
{"text":"I frequent El Pollo Locos at least twice a month.... and for about 6 or so years. Unfortunately the one on Lake Mead & Jones will NOT be one I stop at again. Tables dirty, NO iced tea (mango or regular) so no good low carb alternates except water, guy who took the food from preparer was told twice to get it together, (my food was just sitting on the counter) didn't put utensils in my to go bag and there was only myself and another couple in the place. ???? Waz up guys??? On the plus side- young lady sup/manager was pleasant. She deserves a better crew!"}
{"text":"Cold food, slow service, incompetent staff, you-had-one-job type of deal. I understand toppings will make your food a bit colder but my shrimp tacos were stone-cold. Was-this-even-cooked?-cold.

Chicken burrito was fine, but my shrimp sat there too long. If you messed up the burrito and remake it, you're going HAVE to remake everything again. Where are your standards?! 

$15 an hour you said? Lol. Yelpers need to start coming down hard on these business. Get managers to thin the herd, owners need to take responsibility with this epidemic of terrible service and sorry excuses."}
{"text":"Don't go to chipotle! Come here!!! Amazing deals, fun staff, best salsa bar, AMAZING GRILLED CHICKEN. I personally recommend the $5 chicken burrito combo, comes with chips and a drink too. It's so good I dream about the next time I can come back once I leave."}
{"text":"Del Taco? Get the fuck outta here.
Taco Bell? No way in hell.

Hands down the best fast food Mexican restaurant on the face of the planet.

The stuffed quesadillas are out of this world delicious.

The Chicken Tacos al Carbon: quite the tasty street taco.

I can only assume the other stuff they sell is excellent too. Red salsa is ok, but the green salsa is where its at.

Happy feasting."}
{"text":"Why is it that customer service is dead in the fast food industry yet they want $15 an hour for something you should get $7 paramedics get $15.  I go into this store and ask for a family meal and request 4 wings with my 10 piece leg and thigh meal.  The cashier can't punch in the order due to lack of training and the manager tells me he can only do 2 wings.  Now they are for my mom and she only likes wings so I push for 4 and end up with 3.  I thought it was a managers job to solve the problem not negotiate a less than desirable solution.  Didn't offer anything to make up for it not even a soda."}
{"text":"Came here to try one of their salads. Chose the shrimp avocado layered salad and was disappointed to only find one small piece of avocado inside the salad. The salad was not the best but the dressing was really good. 

Also, I got two crunchy tacos and when I opened the foil one of the tacos didn't even look like a taco. The shell of the taco was half soft and some of the chicken was tough to eat."}
{"text":"Never let down by EPL!  Reliable for a quick, affordable, tasty, and potentially healthy (depending what you get) meal.  I always go with the 3 piece white meat combo: 2 whole breast, a wing, 2 sides, and a drink for less than 10 bones.  Can't beat it!  Why get a greasy fake burger at Icky Mickey's when you can have whole white meat that isn't cooked behind an iron curtain.  Love that they're grilling whole chickens in plain view!  We live nearby so they're our GoTo family spot when we need something quick and cheap."}
