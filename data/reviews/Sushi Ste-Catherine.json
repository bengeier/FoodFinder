{"text":"Service lamentable, sushis insipides où le riz domine et le poisson insuffisant. On vous charge $1 par morceaux non consommés dans le forfait à volonté donc attention."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an insult to Japanese food , expect the lowest possible quality of frozen Ingredients that smell horrible , top that up with totally careless staff who has apparently been taught the art of ignoring clients, stressed clients complaining and a bill that isn't related to what is advertised , we were 4 , two of us suffered symptoms like some sort of food poisoning , honestly the sigle worst Sushi we have ever been to in the entire world."}
{"text":"Came there for lunch. It was not a pleasant experience. The food was so-so, however staffs were so rude. Even when we asked to see the  manager, his behavior was cold and indifference.
The food is below average and the staffs are unfriendly. I really do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a friend who wanted all you can eat sushi but I didnt. So I thought I would order from the menu and she could take all you can eat. But no, the manager told us that if one person is eating all you can eat then others on the same table have to take it also. So, not having an option, I went along.
The waiters were slow and unresponsive, and took an age to take our orders. Then another age to bring the food, but wait, they brought us the wrong food twice before getting it right.
The sushi was below average - for the price they charge ($26 for all you can eat) it is definitely not worth it. I will not be going here again. The ice cream was the best part of the meal... 
And lastly, their credit/ debit card machines were not working so we had to pay in cash.

I am changing my earlier review as I went back when I was hungry for sushi and their sushi isn't bad! Actually I enjoyed it this time. Service was slightly better but we had to ask what each dish was as we weren't sushi connoisseurs! We had kids with us and they enjoyed the fish filets and fries. The ice cream was still the best part."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service awful. Waitress would never come to table, talked on their cell phones, ate while working. For those prices would have expected better."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The sushi was not fresh and the rest of the food was mediocre at best. Not worth the $28 dinner price."}
{"text":"Tres belle experience
Les sushi sont tres tres bon et une grande varieter de choix
Les plat arrive rapidement meme pas 5 minutes entre les service
Personnel toujours present courtois mais pas trop souriant (pas grave jai quand meme bien manger :)
Je le recommande a tous les fans de sushi."}
{"text":"I went Saturday 7 January 2017 at 12:30pm, to this sushi @St Catherine Montreal.
I ordered a sushi salmon crispy and inside to that sushi I find a human blond hair, I talk with the waiter and she said ok and she didn't bring another plate as the same order what I was ask for, second I ordered a fry calamari and you know what, I find another human gold hair, I call the manager of that restaurant and he told me:  \"Oh no is not a hair is a bamboo from your chopstick\", but how? It was se second order, I was really mad.
In my first order, I ask for 4 dishes, they bring only 3.
In my second order, I ask for 6 dishes and they took 45mins to bring me 1 dish the famous calamari.
Then when I ask for my 3 order, the lady bring the paper and we had to wait 45 mins more and never bring us, by the way in another tables they orders was really fast and very served. I ask again the waiter and she said \"I don't know but if you don't like you can pay and leave 15% tips and them go and eat in another restaurant\"
As a costumer, I didn't believe what she said... then after 30mins they bring 3 different dishes... 
The worst! The manager brings a MISO SOUP and by \"accident\" all the soup was over my clothes!!! OMG what a kind of disaster! Also the manager oblige me to give the 15% TIPS. Why I should to leave the TIPS if the customers service was AWFUL!

I don't recommend this place to anthers people"}
{"text":"Sushi et autre plats pseudo asiatiques à volontés .  Pas cher mais ne pas s'attendre à de la fine cuisine ... Le service est vraiment exécrable . Nous avons demandé  du thé qui n'est jamais arrivé. La majorité du personnel ne parle pas français . Le cerise sur le sundae : il faut payer un dollar par sushi laissé dans l'assiette et ne prennent pas interac ... Bref un Resto de merde"}
{"text":"If you're one person, they make a fuss about sitting at a booth, even if they're all empty. Sushi and sashimi are not bad."}
{"text":"good?
sushi
dragon eye roll
shrimp tempura and other tempuras
avocado roll
red bean ice cream
general tso's chcken

medium:
handroll, normal roll is better than handroll
teriyaki beef or grilled beef,a bit old
odon noodle,flavourless

bad?
the service, there was this one waitress that we gave the order to?we talked to her in english?and she complained to another waitress in french something like they are so annoying why they ordered again even though it was only the second time we ordered. she was  also very rude toward a lot of other asian clients, i said that because she smiles and talked all the time with other clients and if you were there you could clearly see the difference. plus the rude waitress was asian too so wtf was that. p.s. shes the one with dyed  medium brown hair and muscles

anyways im usually not a picky person about restaurants, but the service was so bad and Im not going back again even though the food was ok"}
{"text":"Hummmmmmmm, miam!!! Buffet à volonté de sushis! Ils sont excellents, mais il n'y a pas que cela. Le service est super. Les serveurs ont de l'humour, le sourire et la gentillesse qui vient avec. La décoration est bien accueillante!

Moi je dis OUI!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here with family for all you can eat lunch special. The bill came to ~$55 for 3 adults which is reasonable considering the amount of food we ordered. The sushi was nothing special, and the udon was either too salty or too sweet depending on which one you got (we had spicy beef and vegetable.) The waiter kept mixing up our order and we ended up with a check on our table but at least 5 of our items hadn't shown up. The only thing that salvaged this experience was the grilled salmon neck, it was very good and had a delicate flavor. I would only recommend coming here if you're looking for a place to fill you up with a large variety of dishes, the food was definitely not quality."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for the price. Portions are small, but it's all you can eat. Sushi and rolls are all geared towards salmon, but no tuna is available."}
{"text":"So where do I start.....Food was ok. Went here for the first time, but next time I will avoid it. I did not mind that I had to wait for a free table. The place was busy and it's understandable that a little wait for a table is in order. When we got a table though the restaurant, was becoming less occupied, to the point where there were several tables free. Their attitude towards you though, changed for the worse after a few orders filled. They were giving us odd looks and they made us feel like we were pushing it. Basically they were the ones deciding for us when it's time to stop eating and leave. I found this extremely rude, because the restaurant was not busy anymore at that time. So bottom line don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Pour un sushi à volonté, j'en ai essayé beaucoup, celui-ci est pas si mal. Les sashimis sont limités, mais assez frais. Le prix est raisonnable pour ce que le menu offre. 

Décor/ambiance: Ce n'est pas un très beau restaurant, car il essaye de maximiser l'espace, alors les tables sont collées, il y a peu d'aération. Toutefois, les tables et chaises sont dans un bon état, noirs et propres. C'est plus un restaurant pour aller avec des amis que pour une première rencontre.  

Menu: J'y vais surtout pour les sashimis de saumon, vivaneau, boeuf, etc. et les nigiri d'anguille. Le choix est limité, mais suffisant. Le service est rapide. J'aime aussi les côtes de boeuf. Pour les makis, ça va, ils mettent trop de riz et le riz n'est pas particulièrement bon pour du sushi.  Sinon, ils ont quand même un assez grand choix de menu : moules, nouilles, soupe, brochettes de viandes, dumplings, salade d'algues, saumon ou viandes grillées, etc. Ainsi, pour ceux qui n'aiment pas les sushis, il a moyen de bien manger. 

Prix: Pour manger du poisson cru, je crois que le prix est très abordable, soit environ 25-28$ plus taxes."}
{"text":"C'est pas pire, ce n'est pas horrible, mais ce n'est pas wow ! Bonne nourriture, les prix ne sont pas trop élevés. Assez bien pour passer un souper entre amis."}
{"text":"Very bad service!!! We were thrown out by the manager and told us not come back anymore because we didnt gave them a good tip. How would you give them a good tip if they never smile at you, they don't know the good that they're serving to the customer and they're rude when getting your orders. Never go to this place. Grrrr!!!"}
{"text":"This place kept bringing us food we did not order (the biggest food item on the menu, mind you), in effort to have us pay for what we did not order- as, you are charged a dollar for every piece you don't eat . For example, they brought us \"Sushi Pizza,\" which was not ordered, massive, and honestly, offputting. This happens on the regular, as it happened to my sister the last time she was there and she called that it would happen again. I suggest taking a picture of the order list you fill out before handing it over to the server, so you can have evidence of your order WHEN they bring you unwanted food. However, a better suggestion would be going to literally anywhere else. Also, we found a hair in one of the sushis and had to argue about whether it was a hair with the server, which is absurd, because it was. The beautiful stoners working at Mcdonalds have more integrity towards the people."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But they constantly didn't bring something or \"forgot\", and when they were bringing rolls they were hand rolls or something not what we ordered. At the end they rushed us, said give your last order and when they brought the bill it was 3 dollars more for no reason. Waiter lied something. I would go somewhere else. This was our first and last time here. People just don't know how to serve. I understand it is end of the day but this was ridiculous and rude. And while I was eating they said cash register is closing now so pay now. Really?"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Thai & Pho (it still says it on their receipt)

I always confused this place with Tokyo Sushi next door, but never again for 2 reasons:

1), it's the one on the corner
2) It's very likely the worst AYCE sushi downtown

We arrived around 8 and asked for a booth, they said they're closing a section and sat us in the worst seats in the house, right next to their fridges and faucets for kitchen staff.

I had the noise and smell and the washing of mops inches from my face.

The food went from good (Sashimi), to pretty bad, the sushi rolls were very small and lacked any flavor, we had to ask for wasabi and ginger (never got it).

The non sushi items also went from good (shrimp tempura and vegetables) to forgettable 
(pepper beef), it was a really hit and miss affair.

You will get full for about $35 with tax and tip on weekend evenings, but for us, it was not really from the sushi.

They offer takeout and delivery with (blacked out specials), the flyer gave me a chance to study their menu, their prices are insane.

Since they run a lot of sushi joints in the city, their menu's look very similar (Sushi Crescent, St-Denis Sushi, Sushi St-Jean), i've had some of them and they were not this bad."}
{"text":"Good taste, customer service and price for all you can eat. Restaurant was packed. If I come back to Montreal, I will go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely not bad sushi for the price. I got a lot in the takeout sushi set, and it was worth it. Too much sushi, so I shared. The sushi sets are definitely worth sharing. 
The interior decor includes dimmed lights and lots of tables squished in. The place was packed Saturday night around 5:45pm, and their takeout business also wasn't bad. 

The service was alright. Could've been friendlier, but it may have been because they were so busy."}
{"text":"Standard all you can eat. Definitely gets the job done. Everything is fine just nothing special. Decent selection and price."}
{"text":"It is a horrible restaurant that made my experience visiting this city so suck. The waiter and waitress are rude. They gave us the wrong order twice. Also they gave fake seafood like imitation crab no actual real seafood and charged 25 while we didn't touch the food. I think the food inspectors should really come here and check it out. Thank you"}
{"text":"A sushi buffet place run by Chinese. Sushi rolls are small, taste bland, plus the service is horrible. We ordered a bunch of rolls and the waitress forgot at least 3 items, plus she forgot our drinks. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! 
Went for the all you can eat. The food was alright, nothing special, nothing terrible. The service, however, is slow and pitiful. When it came time to pay the total after tax was $19.53, I put down a $20. Before I even had a chance to do anything else, the server pushed it back at me and said 'Sorry, tip's not included'. Um, pardon me? I said 'Well I only have a twenty so...' and pushed it back.  She scowled at me, taking the bill, money, and the candy they usually give you after the meal! WTF"}
{"text":"Worse sushi ever. Have been twice as I thought maybe my first time I was unlucky. 
The service is always rude and impolite, you have the feeling that you are so unwelcome that you finish leaving early and going somewhere else, as I did with my friend, and another couple too that finished going to another place a block away.
Food is mediocre, the rolls was not even well rolled. The calamar have lots of oil in the plate and they served as is. We needed to be asking all the time to the waitress to come pick our orders. Definitely not going back!!! If I could give a .5 star I would... very unpleasant experience both times (summer and now during the fall)"}

{"text":"Fantastic! All-you-can-eat sushi concept, similar to a buffet, but you order small, individual servings of everything that you want to try. Everything that comes to your table is freshly prepared, unlike a buffet, where the dishes have been sitting out for who-knows-how-long. GREAT and Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience but not that bad either. Fairly satisfied with the food and service. Sushis are okay but lacks the Ahaa moment upon seeing them. Must try Popcorn chicken and Mango ice cream here. May visit again."}
{"text":"Go here if you want rude service, terrible sushi, and over  paying for bad quality. Server cannot speak proper English and doesn't really know their menu. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Horrible. This place is dirty. I don't really like the crowded environment, and this place has been fined by the provincial government due to the dirty environment in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had the guy yell at me to \"WRITE ON PAPER\" when i wanted to order a diet coke. Then he left. Yeah you could say they lack finesse."}
{"text":"Ça vaut une étoile j'y suis aller avec ma copine, on dirait que la bouffe était mal fait que ce n'était pas frais... j'étais vraiment insatisfait pour une personne qui mange n'importe quoi et qui n'est pas difficile je ne vous conseil pas ce Resto de all u can eat"}
{"text":"Food is alright not the best but a tad better than other all-you-can-eat sushi in Montreal. One big complainer is the super shitty service and the staff arent friendly either."}
{"text":"Sashimi is not fresh 
Hot food is average 
Waitress doesn't smile 
Waiter is average 
So if you are looking for a place for sashimi , this is not the one. However if you just want to have variety of Asian hot food. It's ok."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! went there during lunch time for the all you can eat menu. Found a hair in my sushi and I decided to just forget about it. While I was paying my boyfriend went to the bathroom and when the receipt printed the waiter said \"you know the tip isn't included\" I said yes and he said \"are you going to leave it aside\" I said no I don't think so. When my boyfriend came back he didn't let us leave and in front of everyone the waiter addressed my boyfriend saying \"hey you know it's mandatory to leave tip in canada\" (he probably thought we were tourists because we were speaking a different language) to which my boyfriend replied \"I'm Canadian and it's not mandatory\" after that we left in awe. I check my bank account and they charged me extra money for a tip I did not want to leave!!!"}
{"text":"Better off walking 3 minutes to the McDonald's down the street, my friend got food poisoning"}
{"text":"Not a great place if you are expecting decent Customer service. Waiter slapped glasses of water on the table with \"whatever\" attitude. They forgot specifically mentioned \"no egg or seafood\". Food was average."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Unlimited Sushi that are very good (Come on its UNLIMITED!)
- The freshness of food is always top notch and very good selection of other foods too.
- Price is very good for lunch times
- Convenient location downtown and restaurant looks decent

Cons:
- Service (Often slow, grumpy cat would be impressed with the lack of smiles, they often mess up the order so feel free to tell them)
- No sashimi on lunches but can't really complain for the price

BOTTOM LINE: If you love to stuff your face with awesome tasting sushi and not mind the lack-luster service than this is the place for you. If you are in a hurry, don't come here either. It has great value on lunches but much less worth it at night (despite that I come from time to time for salmon sashimi). I eat sushi once a week and been around the block, this is my go-to place for a place friendly on the wallet."}
{"text":"When you are hungry and don't know what to eat, Sushi Ste-Catherine will get your stomach full but taste is nothing special. This Sushi AYCA has large menu of choices expect for anything that has Tuna (In May 2017, I don't know if it's si). The price is $16.99 for lunch and $24.99(M-T)-$27.99(F-S&Holiday).

Sushi here in Montreal is like \"French portion\" which is like half of a roll and smaller portions. Luckily they are in smaller portions so you can try more varieties choices in the menu and the since the everything was just okay. Dinner definitely have more choices but overall if you want something very delicious and fancy then try elsewhere. 

Service is okay (you get what you order but don't expect too much communication since most of them seem emotionalless with the customer). Ice cream is included but the green tea & red bean dud not taste authentic:("}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Sushi Ste- Catherine because our usual all you can eat sushi place was closed for the holidays. 

Upon arrival, the \"maitre d\" didn't say hello or advance towards us. He just gave us a look and went \"2?\" rather rudely. He pointed to a center table and we asked if we could get a window seat as 3 of the tables were free. He says no and pointed to the middle tables again. We once again said we wanted a window seat and he barked back \"5 minutes\". We wait and see the waiter clear the table. We stood there and the \"maitre d\" didn't even say anything about the table being ready. I had to stare at him and he simply pointed at the table aggressively after a while as if to say \"duh you can go\"

We get to our table and the waitress comes with water. No hello. Nothing. We place our order on the paper and ask for a Ginger Ale and an Iced tea. 

The drinks arrived and they were completely warm and the Ginger Ale was flat. We asked a waitress if she can give us another. She had a plate in one of her hands so she then took our drinks and dunked her fingers in both of our beverages to carry them to the counter. 
She added a couple of ice cubes and brought us back the drinks she had just put her fingers in. 
The drinks were still warm and now full of her germs. 

The food started to arrive and 3-4 items came that we never ordered. I finally told one of the waiters that I ordered spicy salmon and not this weird oily grey fish that he couldn't tell me what it was. He told me \"It's a mistake but it's ok.\" I told him \"No, it is not ok and I dont want to get charged for not eating it so please take it back\". 

The rice was ultra sticky and warm- the fish was not fresh, and you could tell that most of the stuff had been sitting out for a while. 

One of the cooks left the prep area with her gloves, made herself a tea, kept coughing as she was clearly sick, didn't cover her mouth and didn't change her gloves upon returning to the kitchen. 

Near the end, my boyfriend and I decided not to complain anymore. My boyfriend ordered a green tea ice cream. The smallest smallest quantity was given to him. Suddenly, the bill arrived and while my boyfriend was still eating, the waitress came with the machine and said \"Ok, ready to pay?\".

My boyfriend looked at her and said \"Can I please finish my food?\"

We ended up leaving right away. After paying 58$, my boyfriend decided not to tip which is something we never ever do. 

This place is a disgusting mess. I don't understand why people still go there. 

Both my boyfriend and I were sick upon returning home.

Don't ever bother yourself with this place. It should be shut down."}
{"text":"Been going there for a year now! Was hard to find the perfect sushi restaurant with a buffet style here in Montreal after one of my favourite location was shut down years ago! The food are amazing and fresh. The taste which is hard to describe make my mouth \"watery\".  Ordering the item with number really simple and pretty fast to get your order. They serve beer such as Tsing Tsao and unlimited soft drinks with not extra cost. Good for groups (reservations) ambiance is amazing right next to Concordia University. So that means it's always busy, down side it's busy so you have to be patient to get a seat.     Table service really quick. I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"bruhhhhhhhhhh
the amount of times i've come here in the last 2 months to satisfy my sushi cravings and the amount of food i order each time could feed an entire nation for a millennia

quality of food is 7/10, it's basically a step up from buffet sushi but there's a lot of variety and the teriyaki is pretty good
sushi itself is average, about the same as the stuff you'd get from a sushi shop 
tempura is delicious but I haven't exactly had 5star tempura so I can't compare it, tasted pretty good to me

service is 5/10, i've never encountered the automatic service charge save for one time a couple years ago but I was there with 3 other friends, and we probably seemed like the bunch that wouldn't tip to a quasi racist chinese cashier
but the service isn't super great, orders get mixed up, and I can tell how certain employees might be less receptive of certain people

overall 3 stars because I love the place so much just from familiarity, but a pretty average ayce sushi place for a decent price in a good location."}
{"text":"The service is really bad but the food is great. They forgot things that we ordered. I think its a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"Horrible service, Rude waiters and always mess up your order. They are racist and throwing dishes when you comment about their attitude. I kinda understand your feeling sometimes customers are rude. But this place is seriously racist and said horrible thing in Mandarin behind their customers . Never come back"}
{"text":"Went during lunch. Typical AYCE restaurant. Good: Grilled eel sushi. Everything else wasn't bad but pretty average."}
{"text":"Agréablement surpris par les sushis, c'était très bon

Le personnel n'est pas vraiment jasant, mais quand même courtois."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. It was my first time there and, I must say, for an all you can eat sushi, this place is pretty good. As always, sushis are filled with more rice and veggies than fish, but they are still quite good. The hot food was good too. Tried some skewers, general tao, and other meat dishes. None of them tasted bad, but none were particularly good either. 
Service was okay, they were really efficient, even though sometimes they seemed a bit rude, but it was not really a problem. 
For what you pay, I really think that the place is great."}
{"text":"If they could get zero stars, I would give them such a rating. When we walked in, it wasn't too busy, and the 'host' seemed both aloof and was hobbling about in a very careless fashion. They have two stations, one for sushi prep, and another for hot foods, yet all the seated patrons were receiving food one dish at a time at an excruciatingly slow pace. When our host finally seated us after we had awkwardly stood there (waiting to be seated) for ten minutes, once we sat down, after another ten minutes, the host brought us waters in what could be the filthiest glasses on record. After waiting another twenty minutes, the servers had still not come by, either to check up or to even take our order. One server came to the table next to us to fill up waters, but clearly couldn't be bothered to attend to our table (even though the place is pretty small). My normal policy is to wait at least ten minutes before getting someone's attention, and by this point, we had already been there over half an hour, without any service whatsoever. While I wanted to give this place a chance, the already lackluster experience motivated us to leave, and so we did. Of course, since no one had attended to us, no one could be bothered to notice that we were leaving. If other patrons' plates were any indicator, heaps of greasy food remained on their plates as they were leaving (please note that this restaurant charges you if you have food leftover on your plate). Glad we left then."}
{"text":"Hilariously bad.  I signed up for yelp just to write this review.  They make you stand there for 15 minutes avoiding eye contact before finally sitting you.  This is my second time there,  and apparently it happens every time.  Then they strangely forget things in your order hoping you'll just get up and leave.  You're paying the same price no matter what so they don't care if you eat less.

On my second trip near the end of my meal I ordered some salmon.  They apparently took my order but ignored it.  Then 15 minutes later after nothing I ordered something else because I was hungry.   Then  ten minutes later they came by to ask if I was done with the plates in front of me.  I said yes so they took everything away.  I was still waiting for 2 orders. One from 30 minutes ago.  We decided to wait  5 more minutes before leaving. 

They say all you can eat,  but if you wear out your welcome they will give you worse and worse service until you leave."}
{"text":"Un petit restaurant à volonté de Sushi et d'autres plats japonais, il est situé juste à côté de la station Guy-Concordia. Malgré les différents avis que j'ai pu lire sur cette place. Personnellement, je l'adore. J'y suis allée deux fois avec des amis avant de pouvoir laisser mon avis. Je préfère largement celui de sainte Catherine, que celui de saint Denis. Les servantes sont plus souriantes et aimables. Le service est beaucoup plus rapide. La nourriture est meilleure. Il y a toujours quelques oublis dans les commandes ou de repas non-commandés mais ils se rattrapent vite et s'excusent. Le buf teriyaki, les crevettes tempura et les Sushi dragon eye sont vraiment succulents."}
{"text":"Summary: horrible service, mediocre food. I came here because the restaurant I wanted to eat at for Japanese ramen, was closed between lunch and dinner. I was starving so I walked across the street to Sushi ste-Catherine, because I figured they would have ramen and the outside looked big and modern, unlike a hole in the wall or mom and pop shop. The restaurant had about 8 people inside and many open tables. I stood in the entrance and just sat down after waiting for a few mins because nobody acknowledged me. Finally someone came and gave me water and a menu. I realized the menu said all you can eat sushi and soda for $20 some dollars. I went up to the cashier and asked if I could just order 1 thing and she gave me an a-la-carte menu. Of course no one came to take my order until I had to stop someone waking by, and ordered spicy beef ramen and a Sapporo beer (they only had 2 selections of beer). My food came out really quick but it was soba, not ramen!!! I was so hungry, I ate it anyways, and didn't complain because I'm sure no one would of cared. As I ate and read a book I was surprised in the amount of people that came in to eat with such bad service. The 2 booths behind me kept complaining as well. The soba was okay. Normal flavors. Nothing to rave about. When I paid ($14), I gave the server a MasterCard and she looked at the card like she's never seen one before, and then told me they only take Canadian cards. Luckily I had cash. Not worth your time, trust me. There are so many better options on the same block."}
{"text":"Food is just as disgusting as the attitude. I was told I have an option of a buffet or pay per dish, I chose a buffet option then this rude Asian came up complaining I ordered too much food and that I have to pay more now. Then he started complaining that I wasted his food and apparently should have finished everything. I told him why don't you say that on the menu then ? And why should I force myself to eat something that doesn't taste good? Anyway, I'm only sorry I didn't check reviews before going there, they ruined my mood and night at the end but even in the begging of the night, all these unpleasant sour faces like they all swallowed a lemon or something. It's just not a good fit by all means in such a beautiful city like Montreal!"}
{"text":"Found this place before reading the reviews because my friend and I wanted something quick to take out. I got the shrimp tempura as appetizer then the sesame beef. My friend had the pad Thai chicken. The shrimp tempura was good but the sesame beef was awful, I ate two pieces and couldn't eat more. The pad Thai barely had any chicken in it but it was average. I don't think I'll be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten all day. I stumbled across this spot after freezing walk up St Catherine. I walked in because \"all you can eat\" sounds good when you haven't eaten in awhile. Came in no one greeted me just met with a blank stare and sat me at a four person table. Didn't bother to ask me if I wanted anything or advise on how the \"all you can eat\" worked there. The waitresses were extremely unresponsive and almost seemed annoyed when you would ask for something. The sushi was ok, definitely didn't make up for the bitchy attitudes that experienced. There's several other sushi spots in Montreal that you can choose over this place. I won't be coming here again and neither should you."}
{"text":"Its ok , standart, standart, standart, standart, many choices, many tables, standart, standart.."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Not only was it dirty to the point where I had to clean off my own booth, we all got severally sick after eating here. The sushi was plain and unappealing, the waiting staff took forever to get us anything we ordered and were rude. The waitress was either indifferent or really didn't care about her work and the service was terrible. The utensils and plates were also dirty with food still plastered onto the plate. I will never step foot in this establishment ever again."}
