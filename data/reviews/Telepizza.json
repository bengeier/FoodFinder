{"text":"Pizza is always a three-way tradeoff between price, taste, and quantity. The right combination creates the perfect value for your dollar. Telepizza has a quality slice, but lacks the quantity to make the $4 slice worth the price.  Predominately their pizza succeeds in the all-important sauce deartment. Rather than go with a typical, mild tomatoe sauce, Tele opts for the more flavorful and spicy to waken your pallet. An adequate portion of well balanced toppings carries the slice through.  With a more traditional offerings of slices and a crispy crust, this pizza is typical of a traditional pizzeria. However, I could use more all-around: more sauce, more toppings, more pizza!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say Telepizza is the most alluring pizza place on the College strip. They've got a better decor, a better location, they serve much more than just pizza, they have a decent seating area, and you can get alcohol here!  As for the actual pizza itself, it's pretty standard. If Supermodel Pizza and Gino's Pizza had a child together, it would be Telepizza. The crust isn't too thick or too thin, they have a decent selection of toppings, and if you want to order a fresh one to go, you can see into the kitchen and watch while they make your food.  Prices are standard but, like any pizza place, they have the occasional deals that can entice you enough to procrastinate grocery shopping at Dominion down the street."}
