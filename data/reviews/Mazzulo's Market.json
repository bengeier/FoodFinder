{"text":"I have been shopping at Mazzulo's for more years than I can remember.  Many have raved about their Pepperoni Bread, and for good reason.  Their Reuben Bread is just as good.  I love their chicken sausage.  It's fabulous on the grill.  Leftovers (if there are any) are great with grilled peppers and onions over pasta.  Their world-famous Crab Dip is world-famous for a reason...I also love it as an open-face sandwich on an English Muffin, topped with a tomato slice and broiled.  Their pies and pre-made items are all wonderful.  Try adding their Italian Wedding Soup meatballs to your own home made Chicken Noodle Soup.  This is a neighborhood gem.  From Frank and his wife, and now Brooke and her family, you will be well taken care of."}
{"text":"5 stars without doubt.  Great cuts of meat and they make awesome sandwiches to order. They place is very clean the workers take pride in the store. The pepperoni bread is hands down the best I have ever had. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"If you need nice meat cuts for a party, this is the place. Excellent quality and I think you can special order more rare items. The sandwiches are terrific and there's always something new to try. Nice job."}
{"text":"Vegetarians be careful! They claim that they have vegetarian friendly items like lasagna, but they cook the vegetables and maybe the noodles in meat stock. We were considering using them for a catered event so they made us samples, my husband got very sick from eating their samples and we had no idea why. The food quality was awful, but there is no way soggy bland food made him sick so I called them to get an ingredient list and sure enough even though we met with them and told them we needed strictly vegetarian options they cooked everything in chicken stock and didn't seem concerned about the mistake. They didn't even bother to apologize to us; they just said that would make us new samples without chicken stock, we kindly declined and informed them that we would not be needing their services for our event.   I was beyond disappointed, they didn't seem to care about the ethics issue of feeding vegetarians meat for health or religious reason let alone those who eat that lifestyle by choice. I could maybe understand the mistake if we didn't clarify, but we very clearly stated multiple times that we needed a main course fully vegetarian option. Muzzulo's Market does not care about their customers at all. If they did there is no way this would have happened or they would have immediately tried to remedy the issue instead of approaching it as Meh, whatever, so you want another one without meat? Outrageous and embarrassing."}
{"text":"We love the wedding soup meatballs from the freezer.   So good saut√©ed in a little olive oil.   We also really like the pepperoni rolls and the mini meatball rolls.    My son doesn't eat cheese so I call ahead to order a few without cheese and they are always make them fresh to order."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVED the pepperoni bread. Ate it in the car cause we couldnt wait...it was hot!  Bought a whole tenderloin  for a dinner party and it was perfect. And we cant say enough about the crab dip. Served as an appetizer and everyone raved about it.  Friendly and helpful staff as well. Will go back often!"}
{"text":"Mazzulo's has great meats and a super-friendly staff.  I would recommend the finely trimmed and individually wrapped boneless chicken breasts and also the ground tenderloin.  If you have never made a meatloaf, tacos, or chili with ground tenderloin, I recommend you give it a shot.  It will blow your mind.  Last but not least, don't forget some warm pepperoni bread."}
{"text":"Nice, clean little place with a wide selection of meats, sausages, pre-made pies, breads, soups, and a deli. Frozen and fresh items abound.   The sausage was really good, amazing, I don't think I have ever had hungarian style sausage but it was delicious. Also like the frozen eggplant, already breaded which makes a fast meal. Prices are reasonable, not inexpensive by any means, but decent for this neighborhood.   It did take a little while to get someone to notice me and wait on me to cut meat, etc, and to operate the cash register. Also, the hours at this place are really limited (only open until 6) which makes it hard to stop on any weekday."}
{"text":"Their Pepperoni Bread is phenomenal. Everything I have ever bought there has been magical to my taste buds."}
{"text":"I bumped into this little gem of a store a few years ago.  It's a 25 minute drive from our house, but I make it at least once a month as the bakery items, fresh meats, frozen baked goods and produce are the best around - fresh and tasty & employees are very knowledgeable and helpful.  I try something new each time & I've never been disappointed.  It's like a little European market and grandma's bakery all in one!  Now if they'd just get another store in the Heights it'd be perfect!"}
