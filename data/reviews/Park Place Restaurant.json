{"text":"My favorite local breakfast place!  Omelet and home fries are my go to.  If for some reason I don't fee like eggs, which is rare, I go with the chicken and rice."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for dinner.  just 5 minutes from the mall in pineville.  The place looks nice both inside and outside.  Hubby chose one of the special blacked grouper.  I had the mariated chicken tips on a bed of rice with grayy on side came with grill peppers and onions.  Both was good.    Came with rolls and corn muffin, my meal came with generous fresh salad, soup (chicken soup)  and 1 side ( green bean).  nice portions for the price of only $ 7.95.  Service was excellent.  Will be back to try the breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"Tasteless food what wasnt greased waitress lisa worst ever slow needs people skills and says shes manager ! Dont go if you want good service and good food take money to mcdonalds better price service and food ."}
{"text":"I went in with my 4 year old.. Just because I know most family diner-type places have food that he will eat... My waitress was fine, but did not check on us frequently to see if we needed anything. My biggest concern was the waitress of the two elderly women behind us. She was SO unbelievably rude to these two women, and then to top it off, she would roll her eyes every single time she walked away from their table. Just blatantly and unnecessarily rude.  The food was ok. Diner food. Nothing special.  I just wish I got that waitresses name."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Food is delicious and you get heft portions. Service is excellent and the owner comes to your table and greets you with a smile. Will definitely hit this place up again for breakfast when I visit SC again."}
{"text":"The food is good, if you can get past the pedophile on staff that is!!! No stars. Used to go there all the time but now I'm worried if he's going to try to kidnap my little sister and lock her in a basement somewhere. We've complained many times, now he just stares...constantly"}
{"text":"Family style restaurant located off of Park Road near the Black Lion (almost to Highway #51). They have daily specials at reasonable prices. I had the chicken pita and it was delish!!!! I am always looking for a restaurant that has good vegetables and basic dinner items at reasonable prices.   Comfortable seating, diner style interior. Large menu with burgers, pitas, salads, beef tips, chicken tips, meatloaf, bar-b-que plate, spaghetti, etc.  Not quite sure why Yelp said this is in Ballentyne - its not!"}
{"text":"Park Place really falls under the heading of \"your home restaurant\" the same way as you have a home church or bar.  If you're driving by 51 and 485, stuck at CMC Pineville, or just need a good place to eat, this is the place.  If there is anything unusual about the menu, it's the depth. No matter your tastes, you'll find something you like; and it'll be good. I have yet to be disappointed there.  Eggs in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a filling dinner. On those days when I'm out and hungry, there's no better place to go.  When I tire of burgers and chicken fried steak, there's the Greek salad or giro. I like their chicken livers -- they're always good. Breakfast is breakfast. I order the way I want it, they cook it like I tell them and I eat it. That's worth a star all by itself.  The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. The wait staff are attentive without being clingy . . . unless you're a regular . . . then everyone from the owner on down stops by to say 'hello.'"}
{"text":"As far as food goes, it was great!! SUPER HUGE PORTIONS for a small price. homey atmosphere and quite welcoming, the only thing I didn't like was that we had to wait about 5 minutes before someone even glanced out way, Had to grab someone to come help us out. Mistakes happen, rest of the experience was awesome and food was delicious. (try the texas fries app!!)"}
{"text":"This place, the old Courtney's, is just as much a staple restaurant in Charlotte as any other. (Beef n Bottle, Price's, etc)   So allow me to summarize.......This Place Is The Shiznet for Blue Plate Diners in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Lord, where do I begin?  I have only eaten here once, but that was enough.  My father and I had breakfast there last summer mid morning and during the week so not at all busy.  We were seated promptly, asked what we would have to drink... and the wait began.  Finally a server reeking of just returning from her smoke break acknowledged our presence and took our order.  We also noted that we were still just waiting for our beverages that someone said they were going to get.  And we waited...  By the time our food finally arrived, I was out of water and my Dad coffee.  The waitress forgot our toast but would \"be right back\" with it.  Before we could say anything, she retreated to the kitchen as someone was calling her in the back.  She was never seen again.  And we waited...  Finally as we were finishing our meal, another waitress came with the check, conveniently while both of us had our mouths full so we didn't have a chance to ask for a refill or where the missing toast was.  Not a single word was even spoke.  We got up and paid to find the cashier on the phone having an argument with someone.  Never offered was a \"how was everything\" or even a note of the total due while still engaged in her heated conversation.  She just took his card and swiped it, laid the receipt down, and kept as she was before we approached her.  Maybe this was a one off experience at the restaurant, but it hasn't resoundingly wanted me to rush back since there are so many options for breakfast in the area.  I personally know someone who worked there a very short time leaving because of wage and tips (hint: be thoughtful of your customers and that may change).  I pass by the restaurant frequently, and they always seem to be hiring signs out front so this could be the root of the problem with high turnover of any possible quality staff."}
{"text":"Just what you'd expect from a Greek diner. Has a wide menu of diner standards, really great service and they make at least some of their desserts on the premises.  Good place to bring kids, reasonable prices, and the place is quite clean = worth a visit if you happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"Normally my best friend and I go here at least two times a month for breakfast. The food and service is good at a low price, and it's very close to us. Today we ordered our usual, eggs with toast and our individual sides. My best friend had a hair in her food. The owner and other services came up to argue with us saying it was the string from the egg. I do hair for a living. That was a hair. Then our server apologized repeatedly and took it off of our bill despite us saying we'd pay for it. She comes back, embarrassed, 5 minutes later to tell us the owner said we needed to pay for HER TOAST. We went up to check out, with the owner, and she said one meal with corn beef hash, two drinks, and QUIETLY said toast as if we weren't supposed to hear her. Unfortunately we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Totally awesome lunch specials!!! And these are only $6.59!!!  We decided to try something different today and opted for what we hoped would be some good home cooking!!! And boy were we glad we stopped in! They have awesome lunch specials and it's sooo much food for such a great price!  Our waitress was awesome! We told her it was our first time so she offered us tons of suggestions! I decided to try the porkchops, rice and gravy and macaroni and cheese and my friend got the beef tips over rice, fried squash and macaroni and cheese. Super yummy!!!  The porkchops were fried perfectly! Two big porkchops on top of a piece of break, the gravy was delicious and the mac and cheese was so creamy!  My friend's beef tips were coated with a very delicious seasoning! The gravy and onions and peppers were really a nice touch to add tons of flavor! And this was my first time trying fried squash but it was delicious! Crispy on the outside and super tender squash inside....YUMMY!!!!  Overall, this place gets an A from me...its worth it for the amount of food that you get and the variety that they offer! I cant wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was very good. Got the Chicken tips over rice special with coffee. The coffee was great as well. I will be back and recommend you visit as well."}
{"text":"Basic Synopsis: Clean, inexpensive, old-school, diner.  The waitresses are simply the best: accommodating, very friendly, efficient, and cheerful.  Food is solid.  Nothing to write home about, but it's consistently good, fresh, and portions are generous.  Prices are very reasonable.  Why only three stars?  There are those in management that treat patrons as fellow peers, instead of paying customers.  How was your meal? (I really don't care, but I'll ask anyway)  Food took to long to come out? (Better luck next time)  Park 51 gets enough things right, that I am a regular, if casual, customer.  The place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, since I've never been. It's a basic diner nothing fancy or anything. Good to run in for a quick bite. Food was okay."}
{"text":"This was all right, but probably won't be going back soon. If I'm getting up to go to breakfast, it really needs to be worth my while. Park Place is serviceable if you are looking for the basics. My biscuits and gravy were pretty bland. The bacon was good... then again, when isn't bacon good?"}
{"text":"Great local diner. Waitress (Tara) was amazingly helpful. Food was typical diner food. Great selection. Very fast too. And kid friendly. And clean!"}
{"text":"This place belongs on Kitchen Nightmares with Chef Ramsay.   We went there for breakfast today and it was terrible. We should have known by the ripped up menus that were falling apart that this wouldn't be the best meal. The wait staff was nice but the food was not.   My husband and I ordered the ultimate omelette, steak omelette both with home fries and biscuits with country gravy. The waitress didn't know what country gravy was so we had to explain it to her. I also overheard the table behind us explaining to their server what poached eggs were...seriously? But back to the food...everything in the omelettes were very obviously from a can... the canned mushrooms were the worst. The steak tasted old.  The home fries were disgusting. they tasted like they had been sitting around for a few days and then thrown on a dirty griddle. The biscuits were from a can and the gravy was made from powder...and made very poorly.  All in all I just wanted to get out of there. We each left more than half the food on the plate because we just couldn't stomach it. I've never been to a restaurant in Charlotte where I couldn't eat the food it was so bad.  I don't know how or why it has so many 5 star reviews on Yelp. This just makes me even more skeptical now that Yelp reviews have let me down for the third time.  BTW NOT A GREEK DINER!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, food came out fast & was delicious! Portions were also good. Only thing I would change is the cleanliness, our syrup bottle was filthy and our table hadn't been wiped down. To be fair, it was during a lunch rush so I understand."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast and it was fantastic!!! We couldn't believe how quickly we got a table, drinks, food and the check. This place is very efficient and keeps the flow going. We came in at 10 am on a Sunday morning and walked out by 10:45!!! Delicious food, great prices and pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  I had the eggs Benedict and my wife a ham a cheese omelette.  Both were off the charts good.  For the price, food quality/quantity, and excellent service you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Great place.  Greek owned and operated and very convenient to Carolina Medical center in Pineville.  My 97 year old dad is taking daily oncology x-rays so Monday - Friday we have breakfast here.  He only wants to breakfast here as he, and I, really like it.  We have also prior to this treatment schedule had lunch here, which is also very good and a terrific deal.  The menu have just about everything.  Lots of options and portions are great:  three-egg omelets, hash browns (real ones with crispy side), endless coffee (which is not watery or weak), traditional American fare with Greek items like gyro meat and feta cheese in dishes.  And their baklava pastry is excellent and I take some home most mornings.  Service is great.  Friendly, capable wait staff who are always checking on you and will readily substitute to personal tastes.  Lunches and dinners are full meals.  You get your main course, with starch and veggie but also include soup or salad and bread.  I have to remember this when I take on a lunch because dinner later is out-of-the-question.  I have to soothe my wife with baklava...and that usually works (so far).  Prices are more than reasonable and they offer specials daily.  A special full meal lunch might come in at $6 - 7.  Hungry?  Just wanting to EAT?  Go to Park Place.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and just an overall friendly environment. The food was okay and had a decent portion.   FYI: this is a low key diner with silent moments, which is awesome for people who don't like the rowdy crowd."}
{"text":"This was probably the first place we ate in Charlotte after moving here from New York. I didn't expect much as it was right across from where we live, and in my experience, the places near me were always just ok (I chalk that up to not making six figures and living in the ritzy places). We have only been for breakfast, but we eat here at least once a week. The service has always been amazing. We've had a different server almost every time we've been, but they have all been super friendly and make sure we have as much coffee as we want and we never feel rushed, even when they are busy. My go-to is usually a waffle with strawberry sauce and bacon (they have the best bacon, it's crispy, but not burned...perfection). I had a Benedict on Saturday and it was also amazing. We've also never had to wait for a table although the place almost always looks full.     I hope we can go in for lunch or dinner soon and check out what else they have to offer. It's so nice having somewhere close to us to go and have coffee and plan our day, the food is great, but the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all this would have been a 4 or 5 except for the fact that I found something in my sandwich which did not belong there - a hard red plastic tab (pic attached). It looks like the ones used to hold plastic bread bags closed. I wouldn't even be posting this expect I spoke with the manager about it, just as a courtesy, and he claimed there was nothing in their kitchen made of red plastic. I even offered to send a picture of the object which he declined.   I really was just trying to be nice and help out. I didn't ask for a replacement or anything. I am seriously disappointed and concerned at his refusal to look into the issue and his claim that the 1 inch hard plastic tab somehow materialized in my sandwich outside of his kitchen."}
{"text":"The food was just OK....  But the customer service SUCKS!!!! Our waitress today acted as if she hated her job,  and the woman who took the payment wasn't much better.  The owner is lucky that it is a great location otherwise I'm sure they would be out of business! Not going back!!!"}
{"text":"2* only because the wait staff is good.   Something has changed after years of eating there was our thought last night....for the WORST.  Now as I logged into YELP, I see what. It was obvious!  Squash, which I always loved was thickly sliced, limp, inconsistent in temp and the batter was not good at all.   Pork chops soaked through the bread. Still tasted good, but appeared to have a film over them. Also very fatty compared to what they use to be.   My husbands chicken fried steaks batter looked flat, greasy and the taste reflected that.   Manager was not concerned in the least. We even know now that he LIED to us after reading COMMENTS in Yelp. He said nothing has changed and that this are cooked like they always have been.   No plans on returning. Well wait to see what opens after this place closes once more people catch on.   Thanks for the new location in Rock Hill."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the breakfast here.  The best Belgian Waffles!!!   They are light and crispy with the most delicious taste.   Of course my husband like it that they sell Neeses Livermush.  We have always had good service here too!"}
{"text":"I am so full. Whew. And for only $8. This place has amazing breakfast and their bacon is so crispy and delicious! I got the super breakfast which had 4 slices of French toast with strawberries and cream, 2 eggs (poached), hash browns, and a biscuit.   Our waitress Annette was on it!! She refilled our coffees, creamer bowl, and waters every few minutes. Our food came our quick and all of our orders, substitutions and all, came out correctly.   Quick, cheap, and a ton of food. One of my favorite breakfast spots when I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Thus place is doing so good that they didn't need my business. Not only did I get seated after others that came in after me.  No one wanted to take my order. I know someplace wants my business   Last visit was 5 stars. It just shows that if you're not a regular or with one be prepared to be treated second class."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and comfy. The staff is is friendly. The only thing I have to complain about is the home fries in the breakfast special. Their breakfast special is eggs, potatoes, meat, and bread for like 5. DOLLARS!! It's awesome but the potatoes are always dry. They have no seasoning on them. It's so disappointing."}
{"text":"Oh my is all I can say! The food was so good. I had a complementary cup of homemade vegetable soup, tossed salad with very yummy ranch dressing, I chose the chopped Sirloin with onions and gravy, fried squash and cornbread. I ordered a 50/50 mix of sweet/unsweetened Iced Tea that was she prepared it just right. Susanna our waitress recommend it she was constantly checking back and and making sure the drinks were never empty! The restaurant was clean, the employees were pleasantly polite."}
{"text":"Food is common Greek restaurant/family style restaurant.  The owner is friendly and always greets us.  Portions are very hardy.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"This was mine and my wife's favorite place to eat. Bill and his partner decided to open a new restaurant in Rock Hill and sold this restaurant. The new owners retained most of the staff, but changed the way the food is prepared and served. Sad to say their changes are not for the good; we have eaten there several times, under the new owners, and each time our food was poorly prepared and in many cases served cold.  I will go back from time to time, hoping the food   Returned and tried it again. Tough corn bread muffins , over cooked, greasy and over cooked hamburger steak."}
{"text":"Food: All three of us ordered different dishes, but all three tasted like they were cooking on an old greasy grill. Nothing to write home about.  Decor: Friendly, neighborhood restaurant with comfy seating, comfortable lighting, and reasonable noise level.  Service: Wait staff is attentive and informative, but not skilled at arithmetic.  Recommend that you add up your own bill."}
{"text":"Diner food and there ain't nothing wrong with that! Without even reading the menu, my eye caught the specials board and I had the two eggs and pancakes special With coffee and tip, well under $10. A pretty good deal for a nice sit-down breakfast.  I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here quite a few times! Service is always fast and friendly, and the food is great! It is also very reasonably priced. I live right by here, and anytime I have guests I always suggest heading over for breakfast! Definitely a place I will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I guess I wasn't as impressed with this place as other reviewers.  The service was excellent but compared to another similar place in the area, the food is good but not enough to get the 4th star.    On my first visit there, the server gave some recommendations and also told us what to stay away from for the lunch specials.  The lunch specials are typical meat and 2 veggie plus soup and bread.   I tried the meatloaf with mashed taters and green beans.  The soup was potato and was good but not exceptional.  The meatloaf good but it was a little salty and lacked a bit of flavor.  The mashed potatoes were a bit thick and lacked flavor.  The corn bread was moist and flavorful.  The menu is extensive and has pasta and typical diner fare.  You can also get breakfast up to 4pm.  Nice!  I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could.  3 is average and I thought the service made up for the food but it wasn't quite worth the 4-star rating."}
{"text":"Park Place has recently changed management!!  The food comes out much faster and it tastes better  :-)    The wait staff now consists of experienced waitresses that are fun to interact with and know what they're doing.  The previous owners used to \"churn and burn\" through waitresses so often that they never got the hang of things and it really detracted from the customer's experience... that's why they had the \"now hiring\" sign permanently displayed.  That sign is now gone = HUGE improvement  :-)"}
{"text":"The menu is a combination of what you would find in a Greek diner, with Southern favorites mixed in.   The items are fairly mediocre - institutional quality delivered on a truck.  Prices are extremely reasonable and the staff friendly and experienced.   Desserts are pretty pricey and only average"}
{"text":"One of my favorite simple, inexpensive dining experiences whenever I visit Charlotte.  So good I keep on coming back each time.  I always get the pancakes, grits, bacon, biscuits, and eggs.  Full American breakfast.  It's never once let me down."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  It has a diner feel that I really miss (being from the NorthEast).  The food isn't the most excellent food I've ever had, but it's really good and consistently so. The price and portions can't be beat either.  We usually find ourselves in here for breakfast at least once a month.  The service is always great.  You can ask any of the servers anything and they help you with whatever you need.  That alone is worth coming back all the time.  To be fair, I've only ever ordered breakfast from this place, but that is because I love breakfast and if it's offered, I'll order it over lunch or dinner.  The service is excellent and the food consistently really good. We will keep coming as long as they keep having delicious breakfast on their menu."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast for a diner type place.  Ambience is nothing but the food and service was good."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, the food is always delicious and you won't go broke eating here. The serving sizes are hugh, no matter what I order I always seem to  have leftovers.  If your hungry, this is the place you want to visit.   The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, plus the staff is super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I used to really like coming to this restaurant.  Traditional diner type restaurant with something on the menu for everyone's tastes.  From chicken fingers, sandwiches to a meat and vegetable plate. All ages, lots of families,  as well as a mixture of the after church crowd. Casual environment.    It has changed owners recently and unfortunately not too much good has come from the change.  The wait staff doesn't last long here. Even though I knew this before coming, my mother really wanted to come here for their lasagna today.   It's a rainy day, 11:30am on a Sunday and they are semi busy at the time of our visit.  Even though they aren't at max capacity, it did take our waitress Melanie about 7-10 minutes to come over to take our drink order or acknowledge us.  We placed our drink order and even though we were ready to order our meal, she turned on her heel and started chatting it up with the table next to us.  It turns out my friend Melanie is a chatty Kathy and just likes to catch up with some tables more than others.    The owner walks around talking to customers and our waitress was flustered that the owner was speaking to the table next to me because she wanted to take their drink order.  She expressed this to me, after I got her attention to bring my mother Parmesan cheese.   Our food was super slow coming out.  For comparison's sake, there was a couple that was sat 10 seconds before my party of two and they were done with their meal before ours came out.  I had to track my friend Melanie down for some crackers, drinks weren't refilled and I ran out of coffee.  Never came back to check on us during our meal.   It wasn't a completely bad or terrible visit. The positive to it was that the Food was solid.  My eggs ordered over easy, bacon and toast were good although they were a tad on the not  warm side.  Although in my opinion,  it is hard to mess up breakfast food.    Mom reported that lasagna was delish.  Lasagna is made with ground beef and served with garlic bread.  Good deal for the price of $8.95.   Going into it - If you know there's a good chance that you're going to get mediocre service - you will be ok.   For me though, I think bad service left a bad taste in my mouth.  It will be a long while before I decide to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Your basic Greek Diner with something on the menu for everyone.  For breakfast they have great Eggs Benedict. Overall good home cooked food at reasonable prices and filling portions.  Blue plates for lunch and dinner. Oh yeah and great service."}
{"text":"This place is in line to become one of my \"go-to\"  eateries for a good basic breakfast. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable. I wouldn't call it high end but when you need the basics \"hot & now\" I think this fits the bill. My only reservation is that their grits could benefit from being served in a slightly more solid (vs loose) consistency. Even with that small issue it's a good find and I ll definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Great home cookin' style food and large menu. Wait staff is nice however hostess and the cashier at front register almost always sour and rude. Got sarcastic remarks when trying to order take out. Too bad cuz food is good but rude staff is enough to make me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Park Place in Charlotte to eat lunch today was very disappointed !the chicken pot pie was not eatable my granddaughter ordered a sampler platter and every bit of it was so hard that she couldn't eat it She tapped it on the side of the plate and you could see how hard it was .We've been very disappointed since they changed managers and they have all new cooks who obviously are not following the old Park Place recipes. None of their soups are eatable now their salad is still fresh !But many of the dishes have been very disappointing I would give them a one-starat best!!! We tried to explain to the manager that we've been very disappointed in the food and all he had to say was well just don't come back then. He is very Haughty walks around like he thinks he's all that and plays grab ass with the waitresses"}
{"text":"I woke up early in need of some good food. I wanted to try the Midnight Diner buttttt they had a line out the door. Went to another place sat ordered drinks only to find they didnt serve breakfast (passed 11:00).  Welp. We ended up here. (Usually our 1st or 2nd option, I was near center city at the time which is the reason I started out at The Midnight Diner)  We come here at least 2 a month. Love the food. Great TEA.. Not too sweet. Great prices. Friendly Ppl (patrons & employees). I've never had to send any food back.  ThIS time I was stuck on what to order. (When that happenS I just narrow it down and ask the waitress to pick.   The choices I narrowed down to was  THE FAMOUS \"GYRO\".  the PANCAKE COMBO.  THE CAROLINA SKILLET (see pic)  Food was great as usual,"}
{"text":"This place was very surprising.  It's not fancy or anything special from the outside, but inside its different. Everything was neat and organized upon walking in and we were greeted right away.  The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.  The prices are fantastic!!! Two HUGE breakfasts for $18.  I was so happy with the quality of the food.  Everything was cooked wonderfully.  I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I are here a couple of times a month for breakfast. The service is generally pretty good and the food is cheap and decent. Today, there was a hair in my food. The owner tried to argue with me and tell me it was a string from the egg, but it was elastic and thicker than a string for the egg would be.  The waitress took off the meal from my check. I was waiting for my friend to be done and she came back, super embarrassed, because the owner told her she had to charge me for the toast.  Lol, won't be back. Not at all how you should handle customer service."}
{"text":"My favorite for breakfast & lunch.  Breakfasr specials come out quck and are affordable.  Huge menu options plus daily specials.  Try the fried squash!"}
{"text":"Such a random variety of food, but everything is delicious! From Italian to German to home cooking and breakfast. There is something for everyone to eat here!"}
{"text":"Park Place is a good stop for breakfast and lunch, with a great menu, great prices and fast service. It has been a few years since my last visit, but everything seemed consistent with what I remembered.  Everything I have ever ordered, breakfast only, is always good, but service can be hit or miss. I read new management is in place and you can definitely see some improvements, and there are definitely some regulars, whom the hostess and waitresses seem to always acknowledge. I will definitely return to check out the lunch menu, the club and fries looked great."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is my spot. I have only had breakfast there quite a few times because they are the only place (besides shomars but they stop making at a certain time) that makes homefries, not hashbrowns but homefries. Cooked up with some onions, eggs with cheese and some turkey bacon, topped off with either a decaf coffee or apple juice......................can you say YUMMY. Plus they have daily specials which makes it even better. Love me some homefries and this is def the place for me..............;-D"}
{"text":"Love this place. Servers are always polite and quick to fill up your coffee. The food is consistent and delicious. Nothing fancy but we always enjoy our breakfast. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Craving for some comfort food?   This is your place.  We never leave unsatisfied.  Food like you would get at grandmas.  And a pretty hefty helping too.  The have daily specials that we can even order in the AM when we come on Sunday mornings.    The pancakes and the french toast here are awesome!   My nieces can never get enough of them. It's a great popular spot that cam feel a little crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"I had not been here in years.  A girlfriend, her daughter, and I went for dinner last night.  It was around 7:30pm and not crowded.  The girl who waited on us could not have been more apathetic.  I assumed there must have been some back story on her circumstance for her to be such a horribly bad waitress.  We waited between 5 and 10 minutes after having been seated for her to greet us.  She behaved the entire time like we were a total inconvenience.  We had to flag her down for drink refills and to bring my salad.  She brought me the wrong entree (fried not broiled, and perch not flounder) and never apologized.  My table mates were almost finished eating when I received my meal.  And while we sat visiting after eating, she never once asked if she could get us anything or offered us drink refills.  My meal itself was average and edible.  My friend said the chicken noodle soup was very good.  Unfortunately the owner/manager was roaming around but never asked how we were doing or noticed the poor service.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!!! Clean, quick, delicious! My eggs were perfectly over medium! Corned beef hash was great. Lorna kept our drinks filled without us asking. My son's waffle and hash browns were delish. My husband enjoyed  a sausage omelet. It was my 3rd time and it's been consistent every time!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge menu for all the picky eaters out there! I love that they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had a turkey club sandwich & fries, it was very good. My mom had the fish sandwich and said it was really good as well. Looking forward to coming back"}
