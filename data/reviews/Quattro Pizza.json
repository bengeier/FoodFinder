{"text":"Great new pizzazz!   The pulled pork BBQ pizza is unique and delicious. Had the chipotle ranch wings, which needed the fried zucchini and mushrooms to cool off my mouth.  Yum!   Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is modern and fun. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was over at Duffy's beer warehouse and decided to give Quattro Pizza a try. Had the Italian hoagie, two slices of pizza and a side salad. The Italian hoagie was very good, with their house Italian dressing. Only complaint was the hoagie could have been baked a bit longer. The pizza was ok, maybe because I got the pre-made slices that were sitting around and were somewhat dry. Would probably try a small pie the next time since it would be fresh out of the oven. The salad was good with lots of olives although the lettuce was too wet and a bit wilted. I'd give Quattro a 3.5 out of 5 for the food, 5 out of 5 for friendly service."}
{"text":"They're not terrible and they're not great either. The food is mediocre at best. The first time I got a pizza here it was really great not greasy (but then again I didn't get a meat topping) and the crust was cooked to perfection, however I thought that I would wait until I wrote a review. Well they really went out the the way to prove that that one time was just a fluke. Every time after that the crust was tough.
 And don't bother with the free crust flavoring it's just an oily tasteless mess with the exception of the cajun spice which isn't spicy it just will give you heartburn.
  If you think that you might catch a coupon in one of the stores menus don't bother the owners cut them out. So if you want a possible coupon you will have to buy something first and maybe you'll get one that was stapled to a pizza box.
 But seriously if there were a pizza shop even just one tenth of a mile closer I wouldn't go out of my way to get to this one without a coupon.
 One month after my first review they raised the price of a large one topping by $5. This is the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and sandwiches. I really like their buffalo chicken. The set up was really nice to bring my family for an afforable night out. Much better than our usual eat n park trip."}
{"text":"Best delivery close to my house. Started ordering when they first opened up and figured why not always looking for a new place close that delivers. So far everything we have ordered has been great. My 2 highest recommendations to order are the pac-man (chicken stuffed without the Cole slaw) and the pepperoni rolls. Both are amazing! Pizza is also very good. Give it a try you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome new pizza place!  We had the Pulled pork BBQ pizza at a friends house and had to come visit the restaurant.  The wings are fantastic.  These are the honey mustard and chipotle ranch.  Zucchini and mushrooms are delicious. Ron and the staff are very friendly.  Taking home a buffalo chicken Hawaiian pizza for our halftime party.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat. The restaurant is beautiful and clean. I went there with my wife and two children where we enjoyed our dinner. I forgot to take pictures of my order since we started eating without stopping lol. We ordered four big pepperoni pizza slides for the kids, a 12\" Hawaiian pizza which was incredibly delicious and 20 krispy wins with the sauces on the side. Something really cool is that the fountain drink machine is available for refill. I 100% recommend this place and next time I will upload pictures."}
{"text":"The pizza is good here. NY style, good cheese and sauce ratios. I had the plain and the white. The plain was better than the white. You can add toppings after the fact as well, but I never find that to work out for me. The crust was good but not exceptional. But I'm not a pizza expert, so one of you so inclined will have to weigh in on the dough!

Both slices were good, and for two slices plus a fountain drink at $5 it's a fair deal. The staff/owner(?) was very polite and the pizza was rewarded super quickly. 

I'd come back for a plain slice for sure. But I do enjoy the NY style of pizza. 

Also, the place is nice looking and clean on the inside. But it's brand new, so if you're reading this 5 years from now, and it's not, well, look at the date. 

Ok last thing, why 4 not 3? Because I like encouraging new places. I'm out here frequently, so if they start under representing I'll make sure to update, I promise."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't terrible, but not amazing either, very mediocre. It would have been better if it was cooked properly: very doughy/clear uncooked dough layer, cheese and sauce were good, tangy not sweet. The worst part........when we picked it up a guy working was leaning directly over the slices (sold by the slice) and was coughing all over the pizza! Be more cautious about good safety by not coughing on pizza and cooking it all the way. Perhaps has potential."}
{"text":"I go to quarttros for lunch quite often very good Italian hoagies and excellent pizza."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try tonight. We got a 12\" 6 cut pepperoni pizza, a steak and cheese \"special\" hogaie, and motzarella sticks. All three were the most unremarkable we have ever eaten. I mean there was NO flavor, no taste, no nothing. The cheese sticks were mearly warm with no pull, the pizza was flavorless sauce with processed cheese and greasy pepperoni, and the steak hogaie was by far the worst of the three. Smashed flat, dry over cooked meat and very little cheese, WHY was there pepperoni on a steak and cheese? WHY? Well not somewhere we well be returning? to."}
