{"text":"Buffet even if you purser off the menu it not fresh, prices are average. Chestermere lack any good place to eat"}
{"text":"Um, just a slight correction. We ordered butter chicken the 2nd time around and it was very...different. Butter chicken was just ok, the typical sweet, creamy sauce. We figured out that we didn't have butter chicken after all the first time. Didn't get around to asking what it actually was so ask for their suggestion instead! The rest of the food was still very delish, great naan."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience here.  Food is quite good, especially the Chicken Korma and the Naan bread.  I have arrived there a little late and they have no problems serving customers even super close to closing time.    The only issue is that the server is a little quiet and hard to understand.  He is still very polite, unobtrusive and on top of customer service (water, suggestions, etc).  I haven't tried the buffet, but looking forward to it someday!   I would highly recommend New Tandoori King Restaurant and Sweets."}
{"text":"Nothing is fresh we ordered off the menu and we had hard old potatoes, mushy vegetable and tough meat? Place is empty I understand why."}
{"text":"I am from the UK and this is the best Indian I have had. I have tried nearly every other Indian in Calgary and nothing compares."}
{"text":"Great Indian food in a friendly family run restaurant. Good size portions with a lot of variety of meats and veggie dishes to suit all preferences, the only thing we hope for is that they will add more spicy menu options in the future."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. I order butter chicken, coconut rice, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken sometimes a veggie dish too and it's always very good. 1 complain is the chicken in the butter chicken. It's dry. Friendly awkward service you would expect from An empty Indian restaurant! 4 star!"}
