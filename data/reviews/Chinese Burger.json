{"text":"One of our favorite places to grab a quick bite to eat -- make sure to ask for the burger to be extra spicy! Service is always really fast and helpful. We took my classmate here and she was excited to have some Chinese dishes that reminded her of home :-D"}
{"text":"They are called \"Chinese Burger\" so I got what they specialize in. I had a cumin lamb. For $5 + tax, u get a lightly toasted bun with lots of meat stuffed inside. It makes a good snack. 1 is not enough to fill you up so you better order 2-3, or add something else. For this price, I personally think the value is just average.  Taste wise the flavor is very deep and I love it. My only complaint is the massive amount of oil that leaks out of the bag if you are getting takeout. I took it home (a 10 min drive) and by the time i arrive, the paper bag they put it in is already leaked through. It can create a mess.  I wouldn't mind coming again. It makes a tasty snack. For $5 there are better bangs for your buck but it's alright."}
{"text":"Despite their window being covered in dust this place make bomb food. The black bean noodles were ok, a little on the salty side but nice texture, very chewy. Would highly recommend the little \"Chinese burgers\"  good flavor and I like the toasted bun."}
{"text":"I went there alone on Friday night to grab a quit bite. It was a nice decorated small store. It was quite quiet for a Friday night. There was only one table there except for me.  I ordered the cumin lamp Chinese burger and the duck soup rice noodle. i think the lamp burger taste pretty good. the texture of the bread was crispy outside and soft inside. lamp was good, but i think the seasoning was a little bit salty for my taste. i loved the ducked soup as well. you could tell they did use a lot of material and spend effort to make the soup flavourful.   Overall, the taste were what I expected. In terms of the Chinese burger only, i think they have better taste than most other similar restaurants. However, I think they are a little bit over priced for most items except for the Chinese burgers. Most of the burgers were 4.99 each, which is pretty average. The duck soup is 8.99 before tax and tips, way too pricy for its tiny portion.   Anyway, I would recommend their Chinese burger but not other stuff."}
{"text":"The chinese burgers are good for a snack. I would prefer the softer baos for the bun instead of the toasted ones they have which are rather dry. TheIR meat is full of flavour"}
{"text":"I had the cumin lamb burger. I was not impressed, the burger was not very spicy, the meat was dense, the bun was  hard and overall it was difficult to eat. There was a huge puddle of oil at the bottom (see pictures).  I had a bite of the original chicken burger and it was much better than the lamb burger, because the chicken was more tender and voluminous making it much more satisfying to eat.  There isn't much room to wait but fortunately it wasn't busy when we went. Overall, you might need two burgers, or a burger and something else to be satisfied."}
{"text":"I don't see much to improve here Price is good and their food is great Burgers are kinda average sized and somewhat space in meat but make up in flavour. I would recommend getting two burgers here.  Atmosphere is very nice and rustic and the people are nice.  Would eat here again.  I recommend their cumin beef/lamb burger.  Generous in flavour with cumin 9/10"}
