{"text":"Awesome smoke house. Check it out after some chinook shopping. 
Now open evenings.

Super cheap, super flavorful.  If you like Palamino or Bookers, you have to try this place because it just might edge those places out."}
{"text":"I first moved out to Vegas about a year ago, and one of the highlights of the move was the opportunity to eat Steven's BBQ. His ribs are the best ribs I've ever eaten.. Hands down. Where are you Steven? Come back to the office. We need you!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor and super quick service, closest thing to Texas style bbq I have seen in Calgary.   No surprise this place gets busy at lunch!   I tried the manwhich, beef brisket and pulled pork with pickle slices on a fresh bun with side of potatoe salad.   The potatoe salad with sliced potatoe, not cubes or chunks, might be better than my mom's but I wouldn't dare tell her that!   Next visit the \"barnyard\" sandwich will definitely be my choice with the slaw and cornbread Bring and appetite, you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Love these guys! So friendly like family and Their bbq is always falling apart tender and the flavor is spot on. I never have cash on me but when these guys come around to the Eastern and St Rose parking lot by Lowes I WILL take out cash to get some of their delicious food! The Mac n cheese is AH MAZE ING! the potato salad is so yummy! the bbq ribs are my favorite I could eat those babies all day! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"The delicious smell of BBQ will hit you just as you walk in what appears to be a little hole in the wall. Guaranteed to be crawling with men. The is cave man food at its finest. Menu is simple. Beef or proc sandwiches in 2 sizes with sides of macaroni salad, delicious sweet corn bread, coleslaw or beans. All homemade, super delicious and super fast. Lots of bbq sauces to choose from to customize your grub. No plates no bowls. Everything is served on a cafeteria tray with a liner on it. If your looking to impress your stiletto wearing girlfriend this is not the place to take her. BUT, if she drinks beer and appreciates meat, this is THE place."}
{"text":"The plan was to park, run in, order takeout, and carry on with my day.  

Which I did.

But it was exiting Holy Smoke, and climbing into my vehicle, that I started reflecting on the previous few minutes a bit more deeply than any other takeout purchase in recent memory. 

Something simple had made an impression before I had taken a bite.  And simply put, it was the smokey aroma that greets you when you walk through the door.  

I realized that a lot of my favorite things and places are associated with that smokey slow cooking...  and when I stopped daydreaming, and got down to eating, Holy Smoke definitely didn't disapoint.

The real-deal briskette was made better by my choice in sauces (which I will eventually try all).  And the fact that I could taste the meat with as little, or as much, sauce as I choose.  

The beans, coleslaw, and potato salad sides all have the 'homemade\" authenticity I like.  

And I also appreciate the buck-a-bone ribs.  You can top off the meal with a few of these, just to get your fix.

This place is well worth a visit.  I know I'll hit it every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork in calgary.  You won't be disappointed by this gem hidden in an industrial complex."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!
My favourite after work or Saturday afternoon place to go when I'm looking for something meaty and juicy. Their pulled pork always fills me but I can't resist getting a rib or corn bread & baked beans on the side. Fair priced for delicious food, and my favourite part is picking my own BBQ sauce so I can make it as saucy as I want (very!). I've only ever had the pulled pork but my man insists the man-wich is the way to go. Always friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus, y'all. The south has risen again!...in Calgary?

The delicious aroma permeating this unassuming bit of SE business park transported me back to my time in Tuscaloosa. My mouth was watering the entire time I stood in that line (although there were plenty of customers, it was moving at a good pace) contemplating the menu. The fact that I was the only female present out of the ~40 customers inside and eating outside gave me high hopes that I was going to get tasty, messy, abso-frickin-delicious bbq.

Everything on their menu looked good. My coworker I hold in very high regard when it comes to matters of the tastebuds approved of my selection:

- Pulled pork (reg): safety. It's never failed me yet, and it didn't disappoint this time either. The flavor of my hefty stack of meat was good, but it needed the sauces I liberally applied to make it juicy enough for my taste. (Wow, talk about food porn...)

- Coleslaw: I'm usually not a coleslaw person, but it looked to be the fan favorite based on my incredibly obvious lascivious stares at the trays of diners eating inside. It was fresh and homemade, lightly dressed and absolutely delicious piled on top of the sandwich as a nice balance to the pork. 

- Sweet tea: this may sound horrible, but I really wanted their sweet tea to fail so I could continue to safely and confidently assert that no one but southern mommas truly knew how to make good sweet tea. Honestly, it was pretty damn good, the best I've had outside of a state that was part of the confederacy.If only Calgary had balmier summer nights and more porch swings...


I plan on going here again except on an emptier stomach and longer time frame to savor a manwich (not THAT kind of manwich!) or maybe their brisket and a few pork ribs. Best bbq I've yet had in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Holy batman.... No Holy Smoke.. in the food court of Deerfoot Mall what a treat, i was not looking for it but found it and was hungry. I knew something was up when  walking through the the mall doors..... you could smell the place..i dont believe a smoke pit is there. 
I ordered the 1/4 smoked chicken  potato salad and one rib... ( buck a rib how cool is that) and a pop. total a little over $10  not bad.
 The guy at the till explained some of the sauces you can add and i tried a rib sauce for my rib and a spicier one for my chicken..  I did like the dry rub on the rib and would not add anything to it it was good  untouched. The spice  one i added to a corner of my chicken had a nice kick that was pleasant.  The potato salad was good not mushed but full sliced of potato the meal was like i have had in the deep back woods of the south no plates or boxes ( unless take out)  just piled high on wax paper on your tray., nice touch but i have seen how mall staff \"clean\" the trays and they are all shared with every vendor, i will ask to get  my next order \"togo\" .
Holy Smoke is a welcome addition to the food court choices although i don't see Deerfoot Mall as having high foot travel i think it will do well and capture  the market."}
{"text":"Yummy! My hubby has been talkin this place up for months now and today I found out why. Since it was my first time, he ordered me exactly what his usual is, the manwich, 2 ribs, mac salad, & cornbread. 

I found the meal to be too much food for me and he ended up finishing half of it. The ribs were ok, I found it a bit tough although very flavourful. Not a big fan of mac salad usually so I also found it ok. 

The manwich, that was money! The pulled pork and brisket combo worked really well. The meat was very tender & juicy with just enough smokiness to make it great without any sauce. I tried the house, sweet, teriyaki, & mustard bbq sauces and they were all very tasty, however, the house was the best imo with the manwich. 

The cornbread was the best cornbread I ever had! I could taste something sweet and rich in it but couldn't put my finger on it until my hubby said condensed milk. 

I'll definitely be back at holy smoke! Best bbq place in cowtown!"}
{"text":"After a few try's I have had some great food here lately, as my last review stated, I was disappointed, but glad I gave them another try... Obviously just an off day, sometimes that's all you get is that one try, glad they I gave it another try and will be back... Good job."}
{"text":"A beautiful meal on a beautiful day. Saw Wendy P's review and was instantly interested. 

It is very tough to find a decent BBQ place, most either try to use sauce to simulate the smokey flavor or overcook the meat. 

Holy smoke holds up to it's name very well. Had the pulled pork sandwich, pork ribs and the oh so amazing corn bread. 

The pulled pork comes in a dinner bun along with some cabbage salad, they complement each other very nicely. The pork is slightly smokey, moist and goes very well with any of the 15 or so sauces available (the garlic honey is especially good if a bit spicy). The salad gives it a good crispness and mellows the sweetness of the sauces.

The pork ribs can be ordered in any number you desire which is always appreciated. The dry rub gives good heat without ruining the natural flavor of the ribs.

Last but certainly not least was the corn bread. Eating this piece of decadent goodness sitting at the picnic tables in front of holy smoke on the first weekend of summer weather will stay in my memory for a long time to come. It was simply everything you think of for corn bread, light, moist and oh so buttery.

The decor may not be much and your meal comes on a lunch tray but overall, holy smoke is finger licking good."}
{"text":"I stopped by this BBQ place to check it out. I couldn't get in last time as they are closed on Sundays. I tried the Pulled Pork (~$6 for small, $9 for large) sandwich with 2 ribs ($1 each). It wasn't the best pulled pork but it was decently good. The ribs are a good side thing to order and they sell them individually for $1. They have a nice selection of sauces to go with the sandwiches and ribs. I will try the beef brisket next time as that seems quite popular as well. Overall it's decent food and not too hard on the wallet. I will be back for lunch - only thing is it's in an industrial area and not so easy to find."}
{"text":"Had lunch delivered by Skip The Dishes, brisket sandwich, beans, and cornbread. The sandwich was good, had coleslaw on it as requested and I chose the original sauce as I've never eaten there and wasn't sure what to pick. It was pretty good, smoky but thin and was super messy. The cornbread was delish and baked into the cutest little baby loaf! The beans? Not my favorite. Could be preference but the cinnamon reminded me of apple pie and once I thought it? I couldn't stop thinking it. I'd probably stick to Big T's for my bbq fix in the future."}
{"text":"As you open the door to Holy Smoke get ready to be punched in the face by the sweet smell of a wood fired smoker BBQ. 

In a similar food style category to the Palomino, this quaint smokehouse is a fantastic spot for the mouth watering flavours of BBQ'd pork, beef, sauces and all the fixins

Overall, i had a great first experience at Holy Smoke.  The Manwich will fill yer belly and I'd give'r a 5 star rating, but havent tried their ribs yet.  

Next time, I reckon.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Holy Smoke once before, and after seeing a BBQ place featured on Triple D (Diners, Drive Ins and Dives) last night, I couldn't stop thinking of Holy Smoke pulled pork sandwiches. So, I added Holy Smoke on to my list of things to do today. I've been on a three week unexpected vacation, so my to-do lists are getting pretty thin :)

I got to HS around 11:15 am and ordered the small pulled pork sandwich, macaroni salad and black cherry soda. It came to just under $10. There are at least a dozen different kinds of sauces to try on your sandwich, I was a bit overwhelmed and just went with house sauce. The meat is great without the sauce, but if sauce is available, I will always add it! The sandwiches come with coleslaw on top, which adds a crunchy texture, and the buns are soft. The macaroni salad is good too, nice and creamy.

I don't know much about how smoked meat is suposed to taste, this is the first smoked meat bbq place I have eaten at, but I think Holy Smoke is A+. A great addition to Calgary, different from typical quick-lunch stops, and very, very tasty!

Two recommendations for lunch-break visitors:
1. Sit outside if you have to go back to work in an office. I left 2 hours ago and I still smell like a camp fire. 
2. Try to come before 11:30 am if you don't want to wait in a long line. They get really busy right around 11:30 am."}
{"text":"Shockingly Good! Great rib that are not covered in sauce. I would have never tried a mall bbq place if I had not read about this place on yelp. Lots of great sauces to try. Try the coleslaw also as it is fresh made. Super friendly also."}
{"text":"We had the large chopped beef brisket, large pulled pork, along with 2 ribs, with a side of coleslaw and potato salad.  And top it all off with one orange pop and one lime pop from The Pop Shoppe.

I really like the atmosphere, it's filled with license plates, everybody that works there are friendly.  The place just opened a couple months ago, so everything is still very clean and tidy.

At this place, you add your own sauce to taste.  The meat is a little too bland for my liking.  I wish they had more flavour to it so even if we don't add any sauce to it, it's still very good.  The meat is EXTREMELY tender.  I prefer the pulled pork more, and the boyfriend likes the chopped beef brisket more.  The ribs are fall off the bone, LITERALLY.  The ribs are a little small, but I believe it's worth it.  The sauces are all a little too sour for my liking.  

The drinks are so carbonated, the boyfriend wish we had ice cream, the pop was best for ice cream floats!

I think I would go over and over again, but it is very filling and meaty, so I don't think I should go back too often.

Highly recommended =D

Service: 5/5 amazing service

{"text":"Hey guys
Went there today nearing closing time only get rude service. Yes it was close to close but we still had 15min. The food is prepared so it's not like it took a long time to prepared. Maybe 2min. Anyways this place was really good before the management changed. I will not come back to this location.  16ave is much better.
Oh and the worst part about this experience was that while we were eating they turned off half the dining room lights!!!! How rude. I did tell the man that it was rude and he could have waited 5 min. He had nothing to say.  Our stay lasted 7 -8 min. We would've stayed onlu 10min but they ruined the whole experience.  2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Think I just had holy smoke for the last time .
One sandwich and the tray was a puddle of grease by the time I was done , also the bun was soaked with grease as well. It's too bad I love smoked meat but at 12 bucks for just a sandwich is pretty pricy but the grease just kills the deal.
They would be so much better off if they would drain some of juice."}
{"text":"Favourite fast bbq place in Calgary, delicious pulled pork sandwich and great different flavours of sauce. Would also recommend the vanilla milkshake here made of hard icecream even more then peters. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I work at California Pools of Las Vegas on Eastern & St. Rose. We know what it means to strive for customer satisfaction, and I'm more than happy to give a great Yelp review when it's well deserved!! I first met Steven months ago when he came around to the office on a Friday afternoon letting us know he had BBQ. Once I tried it, I was hooked! My favorites are the brisket, hot links, and mac & cheese. Absolutely delicious food, and Steven's smile and upbeat personality make it just that much better. 
We got lunch from Holy Smoke BBQ last Friday for a company meeting & to celebrate my birthday (10 of us). Everyone was well fed and enjoyed it thoroughly!"}
{"text":"I can not stop going back for more! This places does a three kinds of sandwiches (brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken) or a combo of two or three. Wow! The sauces are homemade and so many choices! From apple to horseradish BBQ flavours! They are smoked at the same location (16ave NE) also has southern side dishes (chili, Cole slaw, corn bread) give Holy Smoke a try! I'm on my third trip in three weeks!"}

\"It's all over Town\"
702-773-8654

The newest fashion in town for the dining crowd is Gourmet lunch wagons. I grew up with lunch wagons when I worked on the docks in Brooklyn and over in Newark. They were a way of life. This is how hard-working longshoremen got hot, fresh made, comfort foods to keep up their strength and keep them warm or cool inside as they threw around 200 lb. sacks of coffee beans like they were tissues.
In California and across the mud in New York, these wagons and trucks have evolved into just about every kind of food style in the world. Here in Las Vegas I have become acquainted with Steven, who operates HolySmoke - \"On Site BBQ\".  His Nephew Lee assists his Uncle' with the methods used for old smoke taste and smooth BBQ sauce. They drive around to certain spots each day to sell off what they have smoked the night before and in the morning. Their big white pick-up truck pulls along a trailer with a very large steam cabinet where all the smoked goodies are still gathering up extra smoky BBQ flavor.
You can find out were they will be stopping during the day or where they are headed next by giving Steven a call at (702) 773-8654. The menu is usually Brisket, Pork Ribs, chicken or a hot link dinner at $8.00 with two sides and a dinner roll. If you are one of the lucky ones, Steven may have turkey legs or turkey wings on the trailer that day. That is probably the best BBQ meal I have ever eaten. The Guys also have Pulled Pork, Hot link, Brisket, and Chicken Sandwiches for $6.00. There is always Mac and Cheese that is better than your Mama ever made, Greens, Baked Beans, and Potato Salad. As a side with a sandwich your choice is $2.00 a serving. Two sides come with the dinner. They will also offer you napkins and the old knife, fork, and spoon picnic pack so it is truly an anywhere meal. Steven changes things around sometimes to keep everyone on their toes. He will also talk with you about special requests. 
While you are out around town all day give Steven and Lee a call. They will make arrangements to be somewhere that you can meet them during their daily run. You won't be sorry. This is really fine home made BBQ with smooth luscious sauce.

{"text":"I have no idea what all the hype is about this place. After reading the reviews, my husband and I decided to try it out since we are both carnivores.

The place could have been a little cleaner and set up better. The frosted glass at the counter and its height made us feel that they were trying to hide something. I don't and never will understand the idea of using old hubcaps for wall decoration. The wooden stools were too low even for my husband. I had to stand because I'm shorter than he is and I couldn't easily reach the counter to eat from.

I will warn all the readers, as Jeff C. has said, that this is a \"takeout joint\" and not a proper sit down restaurant. Very few stools, no tables.

My husband ordered the Manwich (Brisket and Chicken) with a chocolate shake and I got the brisket burger and water.

Ok, let's start with the meat. Must have been dry smoked, it was all dry. Not tender and juicy as I have read on some of these reviews. It wasn't even very tasty. It was a little tough and cold. I think it had been hiding behind the frosted glass in bins all day.

The buns were white bread. Not the healthiest option but at least they were soft. They need to give the customers more choices.

The variety of \"pick your own sauce\" was good but the flavours didn't blow us away.

Now the milkshake. In a word, YUCK! Tasted awful. I don't know what they used to make it chocolate but I don't think it was chocolate. That along with the fact that they started my shake and left it in the machine for over 5 minutes while they prepared some take out orders for phone customers.

We never did get that water either.

All in all, Meh! Won't likely go back. I plan to try the Ogden location sometime to see if it is any better."}
{"text":"Simply awesome....we need more independent restaurants like this in the city.  Less emphasis on the peripherals and more on the food.  Basically they don't waste time making a nice sit down restaurant because it is not necessary for this kind of food.  So far I've only tried the Manwich because it is so deadly, but I'm definitely going to try the ribs next time (only a buck each).  Its busy for lunch but they seem to be pretty much prepared for the rush so don't let the long line fool you.  This will definitely be a regular haunt for me."}
{"text":"- The ribs are great, super tender.  If that's all that you want, then you're golden.  
- The pumpkin cornbread is really just a dessert (which would have been nice to know). 
- The coleslaw is good - crunchy, vinegary.  
- The potato salad was a bit heavy on the mayo, I'd suggest you avoid it
- The sauces are generally good, so have a taste and grab the ones you like since the ribs are unsauced (rib sauce, sweet apple and jack daniels were all pretty rich and tangy)
- The Barnyard is a sandwich, in case you were wondering - we expected it to be servings of the three main meats (smoked chicken, beef brisket and pulled pork), but it was a big mash-up of the three. It was good, but it would have been nice to taste them separately - I couldn't tell you which component was best.  I'd recommend just getting one of the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is a stand out in a city full of wankers that prepare garbage like shitty roast beef sandwiches and claim it is \"southern BBQ\". I'm still amazed that a city like Calgary has inhabitants that think about crappy hamburgers and hotdogs after the letters \"B B Q\" are uttered. 

Again, with BBQ, I like to just order a bunch of meats and some bread by the pound, but that is not done here. I made a scene but the staff were really cool with it and even asked why I do that. Which was a first for me in this city. They were curious and it shows they are passionate about what they do, which is rare for this city. The layout of the place is ok and not very good for efficient BBQ serving as the cafeteria style is SIMPLY THE BEST as the customer knows what he is getting. And it's an efficient way to freshly serve brisket and ribs. 

ANYWAYS....so I calm down and get a brisket sandwich. I ask for the moist cut and they happily comply, although a little confused as to why I may want the greasiest, most delicious slice of the brisket. Whatevz. I also ask for it neatly sliced, but I am told they only shred it here. Uh oh. Everything was going so well. This is a bad sign: at MINIMUM a BBQ place should slice from the brisket to order. If the person carving has some sort of skill, you won't lose much time. But even it takes longer, who cares? What are you in it for? Money, or serving good food?

Out comes a decent sammich. Bread was a burger bun and impeccable. As it should be. There are tons of sauces, too many actually. We're talking about at least 12. 

The cut of meat is amazing, the brisket is great buuuut... slightly over smoked. Not terribly over smoked, but just slightly. Oversmoking the brisket gives it that super salty taste. There's also an immense amount this weird clear watery grease that prevailed in my friends' lean sandwich. And I mean immense. Puddle on the wax paper plate immense. This suggests it was held in a heater for a bit instead of taken off the cut and served to us. Which is a sin. It was probably sliced and held for a few hours. I know that BBQ is hard to serve fresh during the not-so-busy times, but there is no excuse for serving it out of a heater during a lunch rush. I wouldn't mind waiting a few more minutes to get a fresh cut...and I doubt many Calgarians would mind either. Actually, Calgarians would because most do not know what good food is.  

I tried the chili, which was great although it lacked spice. I paid $2.50 and got a little urine sample sized cup. I found the portion size hilarious but I forgot that I'm presently in west scandinavia. 

It is obvious that the owners here have been to BBQ places down South and they are trying to bring that quality up here. They got some ways to go, but they got 80% of it down. I will return without doubt, and I look forward to this place moving into a building more suited for a BBQ establishment. Like a shack in a parking lot near a church in an industrial park. Ahhhhh Texas.....

I suspect (sadly) that this is the kind of place that would cook a brisket 3/4 and store it so that way they can quickly smoke another one instead of turning customers away because there is no food left. 

By TX standards this is a 2 star BBQ place, but by Canadian standards it is for sure a 4-5 star."}
{"text":"This is an awesome hole in the wall. I also drove past it and never noticed it until recently. This is a MEAT place. I got the Pulled Pork on a Bun and it was sooo good! You have your choice of a dozen sauces and of course a selection of beer. 

Vegetarians need not apply."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, good beans, good cornbread and lastly, good milk shakes, hat more can you ask for?"}

{"text":"On my way to visit a friend housebound with a newborn, I asked if she wanted me to pick anything up on the way over and she'd been craving BBQ and wanted some brisket from Holy Smoke. I was skeptical how well brisket sandwiches would hold up for take out (soggy, messy buns!) but they transported really well!

I'm not one for smoked meat but the brisket was really good! Not an overwhelming smokiness, and the meat was really tender and juicy.

I'm glad I gave Holy Smoke a chance, now I'm open to the idea of trying more smoked meats."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Read great reviews so I tried it out. When we got there my wife said she has been to the South location and it was really good.

We ordered 2 pulled pork and one brisket.  All 3 of us said it eas very dry. They even asked us if we wanted BBQ sauce on the pulled pork. I said yes.  Ate it in the car and it was so dry that I had to drink lots of liquid.  I also found a big piece of fat hanging out of the sandwich.  Not good.

I gave it 2 stars because the corn bread is amazing. Not dry like most. Very moist. Had some in the car and turned around and went back to buy a dozen more.

Maybe I will give them one more chance at the South location."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoked chicken sandwich with macaroni salad.  The chicken was very good, the only thing I didn't like was the woman working in the back making my sandwich didn't have gloves on, and she had long finger nails, so I don't know how clean her hands were and she was man-handling my bun."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Holy Smoke for a quick lunch this week. We each ordered the beef brisket sandwich with no sides. I usually try to order lower fat items to save my arteries and so hoped for the best with this order. The meat was very tender and exceedingly delicious so I searched for the secret in the sandwiches interior. There it was, a large nugget of beef fat. Using two plastic forks I extracted the culprit and replaced it with an extra helping of their hot BBQ sauce. With this improvement completed, I finished the lunch guilt free.
This spot seems to be gaining in popularity and by noon it was full. The stools and bar at which one sits may no longer be big enough for the crowd. Expansion time?"}
{"text":"There aren't any standout BBQ options in Calgary, but this was good, honest food. Had the chicken and ribs, and the chicken was actually better than the ribs. Dab a bunch of different sauces on your tray and try them all.

Yes, most of the sauces are vinegar-based. You won't get that Memphis-style sweet taste if that's what you're looking for.

The rootbeer shake was really good, but a little overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Had lunch with coworkers and we were introduced to Holy Smoke BBQ. This place is small but packs a lot of flavour in their food! I ordered The Barnyard, pretty much all the animals at the barn is in this sandwich. Pull pork, Beef, and chicken.  It was big and it cost $14.99. A bit pricy but i couldn't decide which meat i wanted so i got all 3! I also got the corn bread.... IT WAS VERY GOOD!!! Highly recommend! 

Lots of different sauces you can use. I really enjoy this place and will come back when I crave meat."}
{"text":"The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because we've eaten there so often lately that I'm sick of it!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times now, pretty stoked to say they have amazing food, at fair prices. Always tastes/feels home made :)"}
{"text":"A pigsicle for a buck.

This is real BBQ.  Briskets, beans, ribs, slaw, and cornbread are all on the menu.  There are also a wide variety of sauces.  

This is a hole in the wall with great food.  If you don't have time to get to Memphis, or Kansas City or the Carolina's then go to Holy Smoke."}
{"text":"If your quite hungry and looking for a take-out or a casual eat in place then Holy Smoke BBQ is a great choice! The ambience is casual but not lackluster - gingham and fun decor. The smoked chicken sandwich, is delicious and, the large is quite substantial. It was about $11.00 and worth it! Other offerings have been popular with friends and family so i do not think you can go wrong. The service has been pleasant, efficient and quick. They offer a generous variety of sauces and a prep station so you can customize flavours to your liking. The apple bbq sauce is my favourite. Good on you Holy Smoke BBQ!"}
{"text":"As a girl from Alabama, I love barbecue! Holy Smoke's pulled pork sandwich is the real deal. That gets 4 stars from me from the get go. The beans and slaw on the side are also delish. Now if I could just convince them that 1) Cornbread should NOT be sweet 2) Cornbread is NOT served with barbecue and 3) Peach cobbler or banana pudding are the two ubiquitous desserts for barbecue (and they have neither). :)"}
{"text":"I was lucky to be at the hair salon when Steven was going around asking if anyone wanted food. My hair stylist was excited that he was there...so I had to try it. I haven't found really good BBQ since moving to Vegas, so I'm always willing to try a new place.

I ordered half ribs and half brisket with a side of Mac & Cheese. It was the best Mac& Cheese I have EVER had!! It was delicious! The ribs and brisket were both very good and the BBQ sauce made it even better. Not only is the food good, but Steven (the owner) is very friendly! Prices are low too! 

1/2 ribs, 1/2 brisket, 2 side= $10


Delicious!

{"text":"The brisket sandwich was very good. It was a shredded beef, but very tasty. Being from Texas I am used to sliced brisket, but this was good. The sauce selection is good also. Good potato and macaroni salads. I will visit again"}
{"text":"Ah! Finally a fantastic home style BBQ place that is as delicious as the smell that hits you upon walking in the front door. The menu is simplistic and has the basics that any BBQ place has, but they have a few specialty items like the \"manwhich\", and the \"barnyard\" that are both delicious! You truly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. After you decide on what kind of BBQ you want you get to choose sides. The potato salad and cornbread are probably the best two sides I've ever had at any BBQ place EVER. The potato salad is a perfect combination of creamy and flavourful. Honestly, it was life altering good! But just when you're feeling like it can't get better they hand you your red tray of meat and you get to head over to the sauce bar. The sauce bar, let me tell you, is this magical place where anything is possible. There's about 15 different types of sauce that you can add to your tray to flavour your meal anyway you want, and spoiler alert... they are all fantastic! I know it's just a matter of time until we are back there again!"}
{"text":"Hello, meat sweats! If you are a carnivore that enjoys their BBQ meat, you will enjoy a trip to Holy Smoke!  If you aren't a lover of meat (especially of the smoked variety) you will want to give this place a miss.

Holy Smoke is easy to miss - tucked into a business area just off of Blackfoot Trail SE. The space is small, filled with folding tables & chairs. Far from pretentious.  Generally speaking, the patrons are friendly (good thing as you may need to share a table - beware the table hopping hipsters though.)  It is often busy, but they have a quick turn over in terms of traffic.

I have had both the beef brisket (large - WAY too much for me) & the pulled pork (regular size & much more of a human sized serving.)  The ribs looked quite good - surprising for me to say as I am not a rib lover.  I had a bite of their hot link & man does that pack a punch!

They have countless sauces you can add to your sandwich, so if you find your food not seasoned quite as much as you like, there are options galore!

Cornbread - their version is sweet.  All depends if that is how you like it or not.  Other side dish offerings are coleslaw, baked beans, macaroni salad (& perhaps others that I did not take a mental note of.) I have not had any of them, but they are there.

The pecan pie at the counter is tempting, but so far I have managed to resist (GO ME!)

Bathrooms are clean. Staff are friendly.  What more could you ask for in a place that will get you in & out in no time, if that's what you need?"}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq but it's the sauce's that make it better."}
{"text":"get the pulled pork sandwich with a couple of ribs on the side, and then dip everything into one of the dozens of house-made sauces. delicious!

the only thing that's offputting is that the place is filled with biblical quotes and crap about god. scary. keep your silly creation myths to yourself."}
{"text":"The best bbq, best deep fried turkey, best Mac, best brisket... Just best everything. And Steve is so awesome we just love this guy and what this company is about. Sometimes he travels to different spots but it's so worth finding them. Go eat it now!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork and rib meal with coleslaw, and a pineapple drink. Wonderful combination! The meat itself is not seasons, but there r tons of sources to choose from. Really fast, fill up your hunger."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas! 

I recently moved to LV from Kansas City where great BBQ is everywhere. I was struggling to find a good BBQ spot in Las Vegas and was so happy to discover Holy Smoke because it is amazing! 

You can not go wrong with Holy Smoke's ribs and mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a BBQ smoke place then this is it.
Pulled pork of beef brisket sandwiche in a 4 oz or 8 oz. size.
Sides are avaliable and $1 per rib pork ribs.
I found the ribs a bit on the dry side.

Be prepared to smell like smoke for the rest of the day.
A variety of sauces are available to enhance the taste.

Overall it was just OK for me.
A great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"That mesquite flavor is so good. Steven is great to talk to. Everything is so tender it doesn't even need sauce."}
{"text":"This place has character. Filled with hubcaps and only stools for sitting on, it feels like a real dude's place. The employees wear mechanic uniforms as if they were working on a car instead of smoking the heck out of the meat. The Barnyard has every type of smoked meat in it and is loaded. Really worth the money. There's also delicious milkshakes that are nice and thick that you can turn it upside down. I think I might have clogged a few arteries here, but it was worth it while it lasted."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for work I took my customers here by their recommendation.  Awesome! Fast service, great BBQ, good price too.  Sauce selection was incredible. No frills, just awesome food."}
{"text":"Crazy good food that brings a crowd every lunchtime. I love the ribs, cornbread, and the brisket sandwich. The Brunswick stew was also delicious but it's not on the menu anymore. Keep making people happy!"}
{"text":"I've really never had pulled pork sandwich before but I do love Guy Fieri's  Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and every time that I watch that show and he does an episode on Smoked BBQ I can feel my taste buds releasing their own saliva while I pretend I can taste that pulled pork in my mouth.

A buddy of mine had gone to Holy Smoke BBQ before and he highly recommended it so one day during lunch we decided to both head down there for lunch. Now, for the first time around I totally missed this place when I drove by it. When you turn left (or right depending on your direction) make sure to keep an eye out for Holy Smoke BBQ on your right side, it comes up quick and if you're not attentive you'll drive right by it.

I could tell the place was good, there was a line up of eagerly hungry patrons waiting for their turn to give their orders so that they could just as quickly fill their stomachs up with yummy goodness.

I ordered a small Pulled Pork (4 oz. of oinking goodness), 4 ribs and a coke to quench the thirst.  My first experience eating a pulled pork sandwich? Well, just to say it bluntly, absolutely freaking delicious!! I almost wanted another one when I finished my first one but I tended to the ribs instead. 

I'm really happy my friend showed me this place and I do think I have seen Holy Smoke BBQ on 16th Avenue North as well, closer to my home - I'll definitely have to go try that place out too."}
{"text":"Okay here it goes. The place was kinda hard to find, small sign in an area that you wouldn't expect to find an eatery, attached to a storage facility. Never the less, once found, my curiosity had peaked. Once you enter the door you are hit with the smell of meat.... Smoked meat. I was in heaven. Don't let the decor fool you, I won't talk about the decor as I want you to experience it for yourself, I digress. The food is outstanding. I love the plates, a tray covered with a piece of butchers paper, then the food is added. I had the barnyard.  All I can say is that the next time I'm in Calgary I'll defiantly be going back. I'll probably make a special trip to go back. The portion for the price when it comes to the sandwich I felt was good. Then there's the sauces, home made sauces...mmmmmmm gooood. On my fingers running down my hands and all over my face. Ya baby, that's what I'm talkin about! There are about a dozen tantalizing flavones to choose from, pick your favorite, and add it to your sandwich just the way you like it. I like it messy. The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is because of the sides. Not that I need to over eat, I was a little disappointed in the portion size for the price. Once I added the side, coleslaw, and a drink, can of pop it drove the value of the meal down a little so that said I was a little disappointed in the sides. Like I said, I'll be going back and so should you, it's great!"}
{"text":"I pulled up at 12 pm to get my haircut. Saw a guy selling something out of a trailer. I came to realize it was BBQ so I knew I had to try it. Like a hole in the wall sour of the moment thing I got the brisket with beans and Mac and cheese and another plate with jerk chicken green beann and potatoes with Mac and cheese. Got home I killed it. Food was delicious will definitely go back. Steve the owner a really nice guy and cares about the product he puts out there. Better than any restaurant you can go to. Trust me I like BBQ and I will come meet him again. Must try"}
{"text":"I've eaten alot of BBQ in my life and this could be the worst. We ordered through Skip the Dishes so that could account for the fact it was all cold (Pulled Pork Sandwiches with Fries & Slaw) It was little more than a fast food variation on BBQ. Way overpriced and positive the only \"Smoke\" involved in the preparation of the food came from a bottle of the liquid variety. Don't bother peeps, it was aweful."}
{"text":"Been to Manhattan location a few times; a bit overpriced and dumpy but the food is good.

Tried their Food Truck today...and was not the eating experience; meat and drinks were about the same temperature.  They had been set up for at least 30min and even though there are limitations on what you can prep in a truck, you CAN make the meat hot and the drinks cold."}
{"text":"Was so excited to be here. But food was Luke warm ribs were tuff . cornbread is good. Pulled pork sandwich lacked seasoning and pork was dry."}
{"text":"This is absolutely fantastic food, everything about it is perfection! And Steven brings it all together with his personality. 100% recommend trying"}
{"text":"His food is literally amazing. He needs to be at a great restaurant. His chicken is all white meat and it is so tender and juicy. And the rib literally were falling off the bone! He's definitely worth every penny you send and gas to meet up. SEE YOU SOON STEVE!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this location of Holy Smoke after dropping off a piece of luggage next door. I honestly didn't expect to find this place in the middle of an industrial park. 

The meats were moist and the flavours were very nice. They offer a huge assortment of house-made bbq sauces that you can pick and choose from to give your meat the perfect accompaniment. The cornbread side is a must have - so buttery and delicious. 

If it was slightly more convenient to get to I would be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.... where to start?!! I had the pleasure of enjoying some BBQ chicken, beans and potato salad about a week ago. Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork, ribs, smoked chicken, corn bread, slaw & a milk shake. We tried it all and most of it was absolutely fabulous.  

All of the meat was smoky, moist, tender and full of flavour.  And if it isn't flavorful enough you can add any one of their THIRTEEN (!) sauces to amp up the flavour volume. The corn bread was oh so buttery delicious. The pieces of corn bread don't look all that large but the one little piece between the two of us was just perfect. 

We weren't planning on getting a milkshake but we spotted Dr. Pepper on the list  and couldn't resist. In hindsight we should have resisted because the shake was fairly thin and we really didn't get much of the Dr. Pepper flavour. On the other hand,  I was delighted to see unsweetened ice tea in the dispenser. It is pretty uncommon to see in Canada and I can't get enough of the stuff.

Holy smoke is a near religious BBQ experience!  Thanks to Marc D for sending me the smoke signal."}
{"text":"Brisket was not smoked complete bs lol I have had smoked brisket this no taste had to add salt  sauces to me tasted cheap only good is the tea it appears to be tasty but no smoke flavour bland boring try montanas brisket its smoked and u can taste it super disappointed"}
{"text":"I always thought Holy Smoke BBQ was located somewhere off Memorial because I have the tendency to pay half-attention to the things people say. 
But on a Friday afternoon I stumbled onto this place after Googling for BBQ and was quite surprised at how packed it was, even for 2pm.

Unfortunately they didn't have the brisket so I settled for the pork, with a side of beans and iced tea. I felt like getting more food but I had a whole days worth of physical/mental work I just couldn't go through with ordering their chili and cornbread. The pulled pork in the bun was delicious and juicy, but even more amazing coupled with the myriad of sauces Holy Smoke's condiment cart. The ice tea was OK and would've pleased anyone looking for alternative drinks.

I just realized this. I have access to three great BBQ places: Holy Smoke, Cowtown Beef Shack, and Big D's. I hereby decree my area -south MacLeod/Blackfoot/Heritage as Calgary's

 \"BBQ BERMUDA TRIANGLE\""}
{"text":"I love the fact that Steve will make me a veggie plate when I'm not eating meat with a jerk sauce on the side no complaints here he is a Friday regular for Stay Fresh Barbershop get a haircut and a plate while you wait"}
{"text":"Fresh and anything but fancy southern style BBQ. No frills, no gimmicks, just meat and lots of it. Forget quantity only BBQ places because Holy Smoke is smokin' good quality too! 

Order from a mechanic shirt clad employee at the cafeteria style counter and take your pulled pork, pulled brisket, pulled chicken, or amp it up with a Manwich (pulled pork & brisken) or a barnyard - 3 typed of pulled animal in a pile, back to the red and white picnic tables to pig out. Wow, that last sentence was a mouthful, but it was on purpose, because so are their sandwiches - so there.

But wait! We forgot the most important step! You gotta get yourself some BBQ sauce! There are so many to choose from, and they're all delicious so make sure you get more than one. I like to get several of them and pour a bit onto the part of the sandwich I'm about to bite. Classic sauces, sweet sauces and all the way to super spicy sauces ranging from a feeling of tingly formication on the tongue , all the way to the super spicey - like \"Lip Blister\" - meOW that one burns!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Holy Smoke BBQ. It is as good as it gets! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for lunch with a few buddies and their three kids. We didn't realize that this location is basically a take out joint. They have a few stools along the window, but they are wobbly and pretty short. 

The staff was super friendly, which made the experience. The food was average, but quite pricey for what you get. We all had the Manwich, which is pork and beef piled on a crappy white bun. The bun was dry, and the meat needed to be absolutely smothered in sauce, plus dipped in a different sauce to be edible. Its called cornbread, but doesn't taste like it, just stay away from that."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting. I find the meat pretty dry and bland, luckily there are numerous sauces to make up for it. But I'd rather find something tasty that I don't have to douse in sauce."}
{"text":"Solid basic food as an alternative to burgers.  
Ribs are tender and work well with the sauces.  The brisket is very tender and tasty.  
No nonsense way of serving their food is refreshing.  When it is non peak periods, you do wonder if you are inadvertently in the wrong restaurant dive.  But you will be pleasantly surprised once you get your order."}
{"text":"Man, oh \"MANWICH\" -  It's the pulled pork and brisket sandwich equivalent to growing a mean Duck Dynasty style beard, and tearing up Route 66 on a choppered Fat Boy hog. It's one 'bad' sandwich in the best kind of way.

When you're hungry and you need meat and lots of it - Holy Smoke BBQ is the perfect quick cafeteria style lunch stop.  They serve up all the southern BBQ smokehouse classics like pulled pork, brisket, cornbread and sweet tea. Check out the \"Buck-a-Ribs\" they can't be beat! 

The Staff are friendly and the vibe is fun, and by-no-means-fancy with vintage hubcaps on the walls, and classic country on the radio.

Good luck trying to sample every kind of BBQ sauce. You won't be able to get through them all, but it sure is fun to try!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! The address isn't current we called the phone number no answer. Where from out of town so we took uber to that address and there was no truck there on a Thursday . Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint for lunch. We flew in for business around the area and was very pleasantly surprised to find a BBQ place so close to the office. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The food is just out of this world amazing.... the man truly knows his way around the grill."}
{"text":"This is a Great BBQ place with really awesome staff. They have a huge selection of BBQ sauce and lots of yummy southern BBQ.

I had the MANwhich and it was so much I could not finish. Wow I was impressed! This place is so cool too. Who would have thought there would be such great BBQ hidden away in the Foothills/Manchester Industrial Park. 

Check it out for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, honest home cooked BBQ! Scout ( we think that's his name), educated us on the awesomeness of each dish.  The explanations were spot on and the food did not disappoint! The in house made sauces range from sweet and tangy to spicy habanero hot! If I ever return to Calgary, this is my go to place for BBQ ! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I walked in for a quick bite to eat before picking up my son from school (2pm).  The server was young, inexperienced, and nonchalant. After I asked her what the special of the day was, she suggested one of the combo meals (ranging from $6.49 to $12.99) but completely forgot to mention that it was \"Buck a Bone\" Tuesday($1.25 a bone).  It was also my fault for forgetting what day it was. I ordered the Rib Meal for $7.99(this is a late review, so this meal is only available at the Deerfoot mall location. The combo meals also aren't available anymore and now there is an extra charge for sides) which included five ribs, choice of coleslaw, baked beans or macaroni salad. Drinks were not included.  The homemade lemonade was wonderfully refreshing but pricey. 
This is a small place, so the eating area is a south facing narrow table with elevated chairs. When the sun is shining, this area becomes unbearably warm (I felt like I was eating my lunch in front of a furnace!). Even though you could close the blinds by the windows, they didn't seem to help much. 
I found the ribs juicy, tender, and falling off the bone - finger lickin' good! I wished I had more than a heaping tablespoon of coleslaw, though.  Best of all, there were sixteen different barbecue sauces for sampling on the side table.  My favourites are the Jack Daniels and the Carolina sauce.  I find the south location a lot roomier and the staff are friendlier."}
{"text":"The location in the south is the best, and only around lunchtime when everything is prepped and good to go.  I've eaten in texas at amazing places with bbq and this is as close as it comes in calgary, better than jojo's foodtruck.  The deerfoot mall location is horrible, everything kept in bags soaked in water, stay away from deerfootmall location, as the owner/manager isn't there to maintain quality."}
{"text":"OMG....Soo good. Haven't had BBQ like this in a while. I would recommend this place to anyone. Very nice man Steven hooked me up. The BBQ fell off the bone. Great tasting mac and cheese and baked beans. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We were sampling in lees liquor and he brought us a sample of his BBQ. Absolutely amazing!!! You all have to try it."}
{"text":"Its difficult to find fault with a restaurant that serves, hot delicious wood smoked meat.
Its even more difficult when you have seen the smoker in action and had your olfactory senses hijacked by the aroma of the gently cooking meats. Holy smoke is appropriate indeed. Attentive counter staff put the orders of ribs, pulled pork, brisket and sides ( beans, cornbread and slaw) together for instore consumption or to go. Small catering orders are rapidly assembled as well. The portions are generous, the manwich extreme. Just choose from an assortment of sauces and enjoy.
A special note has to be made about the ribs. They are extrordinary. Side ribs,spicy from a hand rub and not saucy, wonderfully smoky and succulently tender with just enough resiliency to stay on the bone and not resemble rendered drop off the bone in the heavy sauce fare. A steal at a buck a bone.
Beer is served ( Pil on sale) with a selection of soft drinks featuring the Pop Shoppe, it still shows up every now and again.
This meatery is in a corner  light industrial condo with tables inside, seating outside when it is nice and is decorated southern redneck with a touch of Kansas NHL. Remember the Scouts?
Absolutely worthwhile. And probably a plus 4."}
{"text":"While hanging out at seven tattoo with my boyfriend getting tattooed, I was introduced to this delicious bbq. The bbq master came in, was the coolest guy,took everyones orders, and cooked it up in the parking lot. It was so good, everyone in the shop was digging in. Super affordable! Try the pulled pork, brisket, and mac &cheese!"}
{"text":"Smells delicious when you walk in!  Located in a nondescript strip mall, no frills window bar seating.

Liked both sandwiches that I tried - pulled beef brisket & the pulled pork.  I thought the pulled pork was slightly tastier.  I do wish they'd toast the buns or warm it up somehow.

The ribs are good! And $1 per rib, nice.

They have a bunch of sauces available too - we were recommended the Jack Daniels BBQ for the beef and an apple bbq sauce for the pork."}
{"text":"I went to Holy Smoke BBQ tonight for a quick bite after work. I've been here a few years ago and remembered it to be pretty good. Tonight I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cornbread and a lemonade. The pork was pretty good, juicy and a good portion. It was warm, but not hot. The bun was soft and fresh. However, that's all it was. No pickle, no coleslaw for crunch... I enjoyed the BBQ sauce I got to choose but I'm afraid without that it would have been a pretty boring meat and bun sandwich! The cornbread was ok, also fresh but a bit undercooked and kind of greasy. The lemonade was not good. Warm (?!?) and had a funny taste... Service was friendly and fast but the lady on the cash register didn't give me any change back. I didn't complain because it was just $0.15. I don't know,  it was ok but I remembered the meal being much more impressive last time and was better bang for my buck. I'm not sure if I'll go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Meat is dry, chicken lacks flavour. I got the beef brisket, smoked chicken and pork ribs. Poor choice of buns, the food could've been greatly elevated. Good sauces though, and corn bread is yummy but seems like more butter than corn. All in all a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Wow, so good. I had the smoked chicken and I would drive across town for this one. The sauces in the table where Hot Mama, Spicy Carolina and the House. The decor is southern BBQ and the music is rocking. Little hidden gem"}
{"text":"Simply delicious, pork spare ribs, spicy hot links, tender brisket, loaded mash potatoes, collard greens, banana pudding and peach cobbler! I'm sleepy, can't make another move!"}
{"text":"Holy Smoke where have you been all my life?

As a huge fan of BBQ, I don't know why no one had recommended me Holy Smoke. Holy Smoke is a very delicious quick and cheap BBQ place with all of the sauces you could dream of. I had the manwich when I was there last and it was a lot of food. I also had the delicious pumpkin cornbread which was so good, I ate it more as a dessert. The people working the counter are nice but there isn't much room to sit down. I would suggest this location for one or two people for a quick lunch or maybe take-away.

Some of the best BBQ in Calgary at a great price."}
{"text":"Incredible flavors, the brisket sandwich was amazing for every single bite. The bun was the perfect soft and sweet compliment and every sauce was worth trying. 

Decor definitely feels like a hole-in-the-wall out of the way. I'd absolutely put this high on the list for places to cater a meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This is a such nice simple place that knows how to serve a good barbecue! The vibe created by decoration and music is a plus! I got the bbq chicken sandwich and my fiance the brisket, we both got amazed by the quality, freshness and flavor!!! The variety of sauces makes  the expirience even better! Surely I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a meat eater--I'm a pescetarian. Despite this, I love the corn bread and baked beans. Both of which are awesome. The ambience leaves something to the imagination, but the food is awesome and a great value."}
{"text":"I tried Holysmoke for the first time for a company catered lunch. Very good pulled pork, the ribs were well seasoned, well smoked, and delicious, awesome pecan tarts for dessert. The boardroom still smells of BBQ and I ain't complaining."}
{"text":"Ever watch the show Diners, Drive inns and Dives?  This show could be featured.  Small, authentic bbq, licence plates on the walls, and trivia cards on the tables.

Food was amazing.  Tried the pulled pork, and the gf had the brisket sandwich.  Also tried the 'buck a bone ribs'.  All great, but the sauces make the meal....at leat 6? different bbq sauces....mmmm.

They also carry pop shoppe pop, and beer.

You do smell like smoke afterwards - as JC mentioned.

Worth going to."}
{"text":"The girls in Wicked @ Sola Salon love Stephen & his delicious BBQ! Never disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Let's get the information straight please.

Why is there a sign for a different barbecue restaurant pictured? 
It's not even located on Decatur Blvd?
The one pictured is on Highland Drive.

The map that YELP provides, has Holy Smoke BBQ, at the intersection of Flamingo and Las Vegas Boulevard. Not the location at 2605 S Decatur Blvd as listed."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the city hands down. The atmosphere is casual but friendly and whether you go in or get it delivered you'll not find better in Calgary"}
{"text":"Quite an unassuming place with yummy food. I just love the ribs. There is something truly awesome about inexpensive perfectly smoked ribs!"}
{"text":"This place was a true disappointment. I was expecting top shelf BBQ and all I got was a dry yet greasy brisket sandwich, a couple of pork ribs that looked like they had been boiled not smoked, mediocre corn bread, yet the pasta salad was quite good. They do have a good selection of sauces however most of them taste the same... if you call a sauce \"hot mama\" make it HOT!!! The real only saving grace was that they have \"pop shoppe\" pops."}
{"text":"My son and I went here for a BBQ treat. We split the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches and tried the ribs. The sandwiches were mighty tasty! My 4star rating is due to a couple of the ribs out of 8 that we got were just a bit to dry. They were still decent compared to the competition that comes out in other establishments here in Calgary's. I was really impressed that Holy Smoke's makes BBQ sauces that includes all the various regional American BBQ sauces, as Memphis, Carolina, Texas and Kansas City, and I must say they are all excellent! Their sides are traditional and are excellent too! It was a real treat to get a decent cornbread, beans and potato salad!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped by and tried out this place after reading the reviews on yelp and a local car forum.  The reviews were really positive and most people mentioned this place should be featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  

The reviews did not disappoint.  I had a pulled pork with coleslaw and my wife had the beef brisket sandwich.  Both were really good!  And the service was awesome!  

Service: 5/5
Food:     5/5
Price:     4/5"}
{"text":"Pulled pork and beef brisket sandwich selections were delicious, as were the ribs ($1 per bone). You can slather on all kinds of sauces, but even without, the meat is juicy, tender, and flavorful."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for 10 years and being in Calgary for the last 5.5 yrs, I've oft longed for really good Texas style BBQ.  I do make my own with my smoker I hauled all the way up here, but that's usually a weekend affair so its always nice to have a BBQ joint where you can just go in and order and eat in five minutes (less than that at this place, actually).  

So I had recently heard about Holy Smoke, and then was right across the street the other day so I drove my F350 crew cab long bed diesel into the parking lot and ambled up to the front door (on the opposite side of the building...weird.) 

First of all, when I walked in, Holy Smoke smelled right. The deep smokiness that good BBQ joints have.  I was intrigued. I ordered the chopped beef brisket and went with the house BBQ I believe (there were about a dozen varieties and I was so intent on eating I don't remember everything.  I get like that around food.) I was given my Coke and a few minutes later my chopped beef brisket on a bun arrived on a tray lined with plain paper. Simple and to the point.  The beef was overflowing the bun, and once I squirted some sauce on it, it became a dripping, sloppy bbq on a bun. Perfect.  

I squinted as the afternoon sun was shining in my eyes at the bar height table I was seated at by the door.  I opened my mouth wide, lifted my glistening chopped beef sandwich to my lips, and inserted. Chomp. The beef was  tender, and my teeth sank through and through without dragging half the beef out of the bun. Another point for Holy Smoke. 

A few more chomps, and it was gone.  My assessment? The sandwich was pretty good.  I've been spoiled by tasting probably over 100 different BBQ joints across Texas and the southern US, so my bar for great BBQ is pretty high.  But for Calgary, with a VERY limited selection of BBQ (which always surprises me), Holy Smoke does a fair job.  The ambiance of the place is good. Simple, strange stuff hanging around, totally unpretentious.  

The brisket wasn't so much chopped as shredded, but that's not a big deal. I was hoping for a bit more smokey flavor. I'm not sure how much smoke penetration was into the meat as I didn't see any whole pieces of brisket so couldn't see how deep a smoke ring there was. I'm not sure how they actually do the smoking. e.g. electic smoker, real wood smoker, whole wood, chips, pellets, pucks, etc.?  I should have asked, but I was making my first visit low key and didnt' want to bug anyone. 

The main thing that I found a bit of a turn off was there was a substantial amount of a clear liquid dripping from the sandwich. Not sure exactly whether it was juice or oil, but it felt more oily/slick than water based. It didn't affect the taste, but I've never really seen that in a freshly made BBQ sandwhich. I don't know if the meat was freshly chopped/shredded from the brisket, but if not that could explain the liquid if the shredded meat was in a container. I do think one of the challenges of BBQ places here is that the volume of customers may not be so high on a steady basis that it may be difficult to always cut directly from the brisket and keep it fresh or not dried out. Also may be a time saver to cut in advance. 

The sauce I had was okay, but was a little thin for my liking. However in the world of BBQ sauces, there are about 5 million variations so it takes time to find one you like when a place has several to choose from. 

Overall, I'll definately go back and try some other meats. I didn't have any of the side dishes as I didn't want to contaminate my mouth with non-meat items for my initial taste. If nothing else, I'll just go back to sit and savor the smell and hope as much of it as possible gets in my clothes so I can smell it for a few more hours afterwards.  Did I mention I love BBQ?"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. I had brisket and broccoli. It's was amazing. Great customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their pulled pork sandwiches! And their sauces are incredibly addictive. I have a number of their sauces in my pantry for just that reason. :D 

We first discovered Holy Smoke when their South location opened near where my hubby worked. And now we stop in at Holy Smoke (either location) every time we're in the neighborhood. I think it's quaint to stop & eat in unless it's lunch time and then it's best to grab & go.

It really is about as good as it gets in regards to BBQ in Calgary. I highly recommend the Pulled Pork sandwich & corn bread. However be warned the ice tea is unsweetened and may not be suited to everyone's tastes."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq I've had in Vegas . Steve is super cool and professional and always show up on time"}
{"text":"PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I'm at a loss for where to start. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket sandwich and both were extremely (EXTREMELY) dry!!! The cashier instructed us to use their signatures sauces which was helpful because the meats were sooooo dry!!! (Don't get me started on the bbq sauces though as each tasted the same and all had too much vinegar!!!) We should not be getting meat that is not seasoned and not glazed coming from a bbq spot!!! And why is the beef brisket pulled? A true beef brisket sandwich should be sliced not pulled which leads me to wonder if brisket was used at all due to its costs!? The buns were stale and old! And I mean come on how is that possible! With the price we're paying we should be getting a fresh bun!!! The sides on the plus side were really good(the baked beans and chilli) but for a bbq place your meat shouldn't need a side accompaniment that overshadows it just to make it palatable!!! 
Completely disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!  I've had the ribs, the brisket and the jerk chicken, everything is so delicious!  I look forward to Stevens weekly visits, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Walk past those standard, tired food court places and have a decent meal you'll appreciate. This was worth a stop at the Deerfoot Mall on the way to the airport. Rib meal (ribs & 1 side) had plentiful fall-off-the-bone ribs, and a wide array of sauces with which to douse them. Had decent baked beans on the side, then added cole slaw because it looked so good on someone else's tray. The cole slaw is better than most - fresh tasting and not dripping in goopy, creamy dressing. I would go here again. It would distinguish itself in most food courts, and undoubtedly it will get more busy and popular as the mall is renovated and expanded."}
{"text":"Otis is the man at this Deerfoot Mall location. He was super friendly, helpful and engaging with the kids. This is one of three locations around Calgary and as good as it's 16th Avenue sister which we visited previously. Since the entire Deerfoot Mall area has plans to undergo a massive business redevelopment, we were surprised to see them as new tenants. But we suspect it's all part of the long term master plan and that makes us super happy.

We decided to grab a bunch of take out one night to avoid cooking. Kids got the smoked chicken, I the pulled pork, husband the manwich. Plus at a buck a rib, we grabbed a bunch of ribs. And sides. Wow was it a feast and for a decent price. In fact there was a ton leftover for hubs to bring to work for lunch the next day.

Huge fan of their sauces. You get try and take what you like within reason. I keep forgetting what my favourites are but usually one sweet and one or more spicy.

Happy to have these guys close and as another take out option. Thanks Otis for the great service, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Review #14 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

Holy Smoke Good.  After reading Yelp reviews I knew I had to try this place soon.  Located off of 16th and Edmonton Trail you could almost miss it if you are not watching (at least I never noticed it there before)....now I drool every time I drive by.

Hubs and I had an unexpected afternoon off with no kids so we decided we would have lunch and this would be the place we try.  We got there a little early (11:40ish) and it was just starting to get busy.  The place is too small for tables/chairs but they do offer about 6-8 stools at the window counter which suited us just fine as we were able to grab a couple stools. 

We were hungry and both ordered the small pulled pork sammy, 6 ribs to share (you can order them individually) and a side each (coleslaw/potato salad).  The price was amazing for the amount of food we received.  I am glad I got the small sammy since it was overloaded with pork and I could not finish it all.  The ribs were absolutely amazing...the side salads delicious..everything outstanding.  We further loved they serve the seasoned meat un-sauced allowing you to choose your sauce(s) from a dozen or so.  I love this concept cause this says my kids might actually eat the food and not complain about the sauce lol.  We couldn't help ourselves and tried at least 4 of them (hot mama, house, jack daniels and a mesquite I think). They were all so good I could have drunk them.

We ended up in a pork coma after eating lunch here and had to go for a long walk to work it off.  It was so darn good that we couldn't leave a morsel on our plate.

Incredible & flavourful food, very friendly staff, fantastic prices...yup we will be back again, and again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great BBQ. Had the beef brisket. Polite and knowledgeable owners. Get there now for tasty meat."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the smell of greatness hits you hard. I ordered a small beef brisket with a side of coleslaw and cornbread, and my hubby got the pulled pork with baked beans. My bun was so perfect....cornbread so delectable...but my brisket was meh. I was on the look out for mysterious clear fluid drippings that other reviewers had warned about. I didn't have any but wow did my hub's pulled pork drip like crazy! His hands were glistening. He said it tasted greasy and not very flavorful. Every sauce that I tasted was yummy though!
In a perfect world, I would take the meat from Big T's and throw it on Holy Smoke's buns and eat it with their sides too. But when it really comes down to it, I'm here for the meat, so I'll be heading back to Big T's next time (just don't order cornbread there it's bleh!).      
I wish that there was a BBQ place in Calgary that was a hit in every category :("}
{"text":"Was driving back from Shaw GMC when I happend to look over and see half a dozen cops sitting outside at picnic tables.  I thought  to myself \"hmmm...since when did Tim Horton's install an outdoor patio?\"  

Upon closer inspection it turned out to be a Holy Smoke - and holy smokes is it ever delicious!

I arrived back at the office and my co-worker and I set off for Holy Smoke immediately to grab some lunch.  We enjoyed the macaroni salad, some BBQ pork ribs (buck a bone) and the BBQ Beef Brisket on a Bun.  One word: delicious.

They have a selection of BBQ sauces ranging from \"House\" to \"Screamin' Hot,\" the staff are extremely fast and friendly, and the atmosphere resonates of the deep and dirty South (think Texas, not Cranston), with checkered tablecloths and twangy Classic Country playing in the background.

A quick trip to the bathroom after the meal revealed hilarious paraphanelia adorning the walls, thus completing my experience.

Not the healthiest in the world, but you know you're getting REAL food that's worth every penny.

If you head down, try and get there early - the place fills up pretty quickly, and there's limited seating both in and outside."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ Guy in Town for sure! Best MAC and Pulled pork Sandwich.  Now know that his mobile and has different set location for different days! Contact him and his customer service is off the chain. He is serving us again today."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews on this place, we decided to check it out for lunch on Friday as we were in the area anyway. So glad we did!!

Holy Smoke is a quaint restaurant with large tables meant to be shared. Luckily, we arrived right before the lunch rush so our order was made fast and we were able to chow down right away. 

Josh ordered the Manwich (which is huge, FYI), while I went with the Beef Brisket. We decided to try the Potato Salad, Coleslaw, and Corn Bread for our sides. Josh also ordered a couple of ribs, which were not $1/each, but $1.25. I also ordered a Sweet Tea which I was very excited about - not too sweet, it was so delicious. There is a large selection of BBQ sauces to try with your meat - we had the Jack Daniels (MY FAVE!), Hot Mama, Apple, and a spicy mustard (cant remember the name)...each sauce had its own unique taste but every bite was better than the last!!

It was on the pricey side ($29 for both) but we got A LOT of food and it was so delicious. Every day since eating there we've talked about how good it was! I loved the kitschy Southern decor, the authentic taste of the food, and that yummy Sweet Tea. I cant wait to return for more!!"}
{"text":"My tastebuds are in love. My husband and I went here on the recommendation of a friend, and were NOT disappointed. We usually stop by every Sunday for lunch as well. Cheap, fast and oh so delicious. 

The selection of sauces is incredible and everything we've had there has not disappointed. My husband claims that he's done \"trying\" the sauces now and that he'll stick with [insert 5 different types here]. I like the House sauce the best, but perhaps because I'm not so adventurous and haven't actually tried the other ones.

I always get the Chickenwich, but Mr has tried a bunch of things and is never disappointed. Now it's where we take people from out of town... and then where they request to go when they're back in town. Basically we're ensuring the owner can finally put in that pool.

----
Upon re-reading my review, I'd like to summarize by saying \"we were not disappointed\""}
{"text":"I took my dad here for lunch today... well, he paid, so I guess that means he took me here. But without me, we never would've tried it in the first place-where does that leave us? My dad and I came here for lunch today.

We seemed to be at the end of a rather long line, but one that moved very quickly. In no time, it was our turn to order. \"You should get the manwich dad!\" I teased. \"Hmph, maybe 20 years ago!\" 

We both ended up ordering a pulled pork sandwich. Mine a regular, his a large. The difference was that his had about twice as much meat on it. It's like the bumper sticker on the condiments holder said \"We love animals... they're made of meat!\"

Two sandwiches, two sides (potato salad for Dad, cornbread for me) and a couple of pops run us well under $25. And I even got to educate my dad on a few things while we ate-boxes of trivia cards adorn each table.\"We could play for who gets to buy lunch,\" my dad joked. 

There's nothing overly fancy about the decor, although the little plastic pigs hanging from the strings of lights are a quaint touch, as are the horns hanging above the door to the washrooms. Tables are cafeteria style with a couple of different kinds of chairs to choose from. Like I said, nothing fancy here. There isn't much to the menu either, but if you can do something this well, the best thing to do is stick with it."}
{"text":"Holy Smokes catered to an event and I was able to try out some of their food. I had their pulled pork, mac and cheese, and bbq chicken legs and it was all very good. The chicken legs were moist, flavorful, and not soaked in bbq sauce. Had a good smokey flavor to it. The pulled pork was tender and the bbq sauce that came on the side added extra saucy goodness. The dinner roll that came with the meal was just ok though. Was kind of hoping for more of a homemade or buttery dinner roll, but it was plain. No big deal cause the bbq is their seller. I really liked the mac and cheese though. It was very cheesy and creamy. So good with the pulled pork. They also had baked beans for the side as an option. It smelled and looked really good, but I had a full plate going on already. Next time I'll give it a try. Overall, pretty good bbq, great set up at the event, and would give their actual restaurant a visit after trying out their food."}
{"text":"I lived in Houston for a few years, and I tried a lot of BBQ over there. Holy Smoke is definitely good. I liked the ambient, the decoration and the service wasn't bad. The washrooms were nice and exceptionaly clean.
The BBQ sandwich was good, the small one I think is very small. Next time I'll go for the large which has twice the meat for only 3 bucks more. My only complaint at this point is the meat temperature: It wasn't fridge cold, but it also wasn't even warm. I'm not sure if is healthy to keep and serve food at that temperature.
The sauces are very good... you'll be tempted to try them all. Corn bread was nice but probably too sweet (and a tad expensive). In all, it was a nice experience and will go again for sure as long as the \"room temperature\" meat doesn't kill me.
One more thing, you can skip the Pecan Tart. Not even close to a southern Pecan Pie and twice as expensive."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ sold by the owner Steven Houston. He's a super nice guy. We have very high standards for BBQ and Steven well exceeded them. The brisket was tender, juicy and just about perfect. The chicken was fantastic too. And the sauce: so good. Ribs are pretty fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I knew what was coming for my Saturday WOD, it's called Murph and it's a workout in the memory of a navy lieutenant. My gym as well as another Crossfit gym participated in this memorial hero workout and it consisted of: run 1 mile, 100 pull ups, 200 pushups and 300 squats ending with another mile run.  For the mile run, we started off at the other gym so we would end there which was just off Blackfoot on 42 Avenue SE.  

Obviously when we ended the workout, we were all sweaty, thirsty and extremely hungry. One of the girls suggested Holy Smoke because it was semi close by so we all went over.  Holy Smoke is located west off the corner of Blackfoot Trail and Manhattan Road.  It's a small meaty joint with a lot of sauces.  I went with the regular pulled pork sandwich, two pieces of ribs, and a macaroni salad.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day out so we were able to sit on the picnic tables outside!  The service is really fast and after you get your food, you have a big selection of sauces to choose from.  I went with two random sauces and they turned out to be sweet and barbequey which was nice.  I did notice the pecan tarts and I was super tempted but I regrettably didn't get one *sigh*.

The pull pork was topped with a blob of coleslaw, I found the meat to be quite tender and juicy, and I dosed it with the sauces available.  The macaroni salad was good and I was happy to be able to order just a couple ribs for $1.39/piece.  The ribs were fall off the bone delicious!!  Its hard to choose a favorite sauce when there is so many so you'll just have to get a small container of each to dip!
Overall, we all scarfed down our meals and one of the girls even went back for a second sandwich.  The picnic tables are nice for when the sun is shining and the menu is quite simple yet delicious.  I'll grab a pecan tart next time too."}
{"text":"* Good BBQ *

After an incredibly disappointing BBQ plate at Palomino Smokehouse (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-palomino-smokehouse-calgary#hrid:ZQaY2hv7M8T7O0q_lWTHJg) I needed to try and have the Calgary BBQ scene redeem itself.  Enter Holy Smoke.  

I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of ribs for a total price of $8.99.  Hooray for normally priced BBQ.  But I would have been willing to pay more as the quality was very good.  

Here is the tray:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/holy-smoke-bbq-calgary?select=vzG3OIgMs1a9CjJj0CW6Xg#vzG3OIgMs1a9CjJj0CW6Xg

The brisket was properly smoked, and very tender.  I personally prefer sliced brisket over pulled, but that is a regional difference.  The taste was spot on.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/holy-smoke-bbq-calgary?select=b3hYDi74Obz34Ft_5ci2aw#b3hYDi74Obz34Ft_5ci2aw

The ribs were excellent.  Fall off the bone without being mushy or stewed.  Good natural smoke flavour with properly rendered fat.  Excellent job on these.  They charge $1 a bone, but threw in an extra one for free.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/holy-smoke-bbq-calgary?select=17uWahZ5OmMspayUOOOekA#17uWahZ5OmMspayUOOOekA

This little spot has better BBQ than the places I've tried in Vancouver.  Too bad it is in Alberta instead of here.  Perhaps they could expand??!?!?!?  (Hint hint, nudge, nudge)"}
{"text":"We had our boss' birthday catered by Steven/Holy Smoke WOW! Phenomenal!!! Chicken & brisket, baked beans & Potato salad! I'm picky about my potato salad...his was AMAZING! Delicious baked beans & chicken that fell off the bone! Brisket was my fave though! Best part..very affordable! Gotta find this guy he's the BEST BBQ I've found in 14 years of living here!"}
{"text":"The best overall BBQ i have in Calgary. This place is great! good, honest and simple food, served up very authentically (unlike their BBQ baron competitors COUGH COUGH) and for the first time in Calgary I have eaten at a BBQ joint that is ONLY a bbq joint and NO nonsense menu.

So I dont wanna hype up this place too much but as far as Calgary goes I am gonna go out on a limb and say that FINALLY their is a place that does REAL bbq in the right setting and with the right attitude and respect for the tradition. None of this pretentious sheeshi stuff you see at other places, and holy smoke is comfortable for what it is and not ashamed for what it isnt.

The food??? This place is all about the basics, ribs, Chopped brisket pulled pork, and then some sides cornbread (loved the cornbread) coleslaw, beans, macoroni salad ect. So you can design your own meal any time you come here. 

The ribs were great, really good smoke n pork flavor with a not to salty rub charred and smoked into the meat. so the rub has a more mild flavor and normally its a very bad idea to under season pork BUT! at holy smoke you add your own seasoning with the wide variety of sauces that they make in house and (I actually love it done this way! it makes for a more dynamic eating experience) 

The ribs were tender yet retained their meaty texture and chew (just the way I like it) and the smoke flavor was not shy at all, very nice smoke ring in the ribs. 

The brisket sandwich I got was also very good, the brisket was chopped fine and bathed in a little sauce and had a pickle in it. It had the classic bbq taste, the beef flavor came through and it was just plain great! Really great!  

The sides I got were great, cornbread n slaw. The slaw was light but flavorful,( it actually tasted a lot better than It looked and was a nice contrast to the potent flavor of the meat), and the cornbread was soft and sweet! almost cake like! next time I will have to try some more of the sides!

perhaps I am being a little to generous with this review, and sure you could tour texas or north carolina and find a whole bunch of places that  do it way better but you know what? when I go in a place and see that the workers are actually proud of the product they are serving me and also they are happy to working at a place its a VERY good sign! these guys are on to even bigger and better things and will improve with time ( i am sure of it)!. It is so inspiring seeing people like this trying to do something good for food culture it just makes me happy! Go check out this place, its got the goods!!!!
I will be back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"One of the best smoked joint I have tried. Reasonable price and portion is huge. Pull pork sandwich was juicy and smokey and not too heavy. Very nice. Cornbread is moist too where I had cornbread else where is dried and very easy to crumble up. Lastly the bean is just totally awesome."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ spot with fantastic service !"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Meat was boil in bag nothing fresh. If your are looking for BBQ in Calgary you can do better at any chain restaurant in the city. I would keep driving"}
{"text":"I came on a day they weren't expecting much traffic so the menu was a bit condensed. I was still able to order a lot of food however. I got a brisket sandwich, 2 ribs, baked beans and cornbread. I had takeout so I wasn't able to avail myself of the wall of sauces which in my opinion were a required addition to the sandwich. Coming to a barbecue like this though, I expect the meat to be plenty seasoned and not require an external sauce. If there is any sauce, I want it cooked in. The ribs were a bit dry, but tasty and the beans and cornbread were wonderful.

I'm sure to come back though as I have high hopes for this place and although I wasn't blown away, the large meal I had ordered was gone in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I had an outstanding meal for my second visit.  I sampled my spouse's Chopped Beef Brisket which we both didn't think was that great.  However, we enjoyed the chili we shared and I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was amazing.  He thought so too.  For me, the pork is the top choice out of three sandwiches I've tried here.  I was pretty excited about not encountering any fat on the meat.  Fat in my mouth makes me want to gag.

I finally had the corn bread and it's so good that it may as well be dessert.  My spouse ordered a Dr. Pepper milkshake which he really liked.  I thought it was just okay but didn't care because I was loving my order of Brunswick Stew.  It was just as flavorful and marvelous as the first time I tried it.  

I made sure to sample some sauces straight up.  They are pretty powerful and it turns out I'm not a fan of most of them.  I guess I prefer the house sauce.

If you're not in the mood for a formal restaurant but yet want to avoid other greasy fast food joints, Holy Smoke is a winner."}
{"text":"I love this BBQ truck. I always look forward to his weekly deliver. I got the ribs and chicken.It was so fresh, hot and delicious. The Mac and cheese is to die for! The links are also super good. Really the whole menu is great."}
{"text":"My friends and I got it delivered. Ok... just ok. Brisket and ribs were dry. Sauces were meh. Chicken was under seasoned. The potato salad and coleslaw were bland too."}
{"text":"Needed, lunch and stop in for quick MANWICH very tasty and quick service at 11:50, small inside and I'm sure the place gets busy...... Get there early for your MANWICH"}
{"text":"Iv eaten here plenty of times and after living in Texas for many years this is the closest thing to Texan BBQ in Calgary.  Their brisket and pulled pork are really taste and they have the beast cornbread in town!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time I'm in that area, I can't help by try to grab a pulled pork, or some ribs and some Corn bread.

They do the smoked meats justice.  Slow and low, meaty and tender, tasty and daring, and all really reasonably priced... it's a gem for the BBQ lover.

I'm not too much a fan of the beans, but everything else is quite good.  The only tip I might give is that you really shouldn't go here during lunch on weekdays, as the line ups can be long.  Try to go during staggered times if you would like to avoid a 15-20 min wait.  It's THAT popular!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their beef brisket, beans and corn bread.  A great place to go if you're hankering for some quick but tasty BBQ.  The eating area is just a counter so keep that in mind if you wanted a more sit-down experience."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week ! Pulled pork is ok for the diet tho so its all good ... Awesome staff awesome food ... Cool atmosphere !!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!

If there ever was a diamond in the rough this would be the 7 carrot stud stuck in the ground waiting for the next passerby to behold its wonder.....maybe that was too much lol but this place epitomizes southern BBQ in all its glory!  

The menu keeps it simple only serving up signature bbq cuisine emphasizing that its all about quality with a shit load of down home dirty charm!  They have chopped  beef brisket, pulled pork sandwiches and ribs for $1 a bone tempting the ever hungry patron to order a mountain of smoked goodness on their lunch break.   They also whip up essential BBQ sides such as coleslaw, potato/macaroni salad, baked beens and freshly baked corn bread (delicious by the way!) while sporting a large assortment of home made bbq sauces that should cater to all different types of taste buds.

Holy Smokes is all you can ask for in a BBQ dive. Its small, no frills with a friendly staff that seem to take pride in the work which makes for a welcoming atmosphere that is rarely seen these days. Not to mention their BBQ is so perfectly smoked, seasoned and mouthwatering that it should be a down right sin!

PEACE!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Friendly...kinda.

I saw kinda b/c yes you can skip the buns, the cornbread the desserts. BUT you HAVE to sick 99.9% of the BBQ sauces b/c they are all made with regular old wheat filled soya sauce.  There is on that is a scary yellow one that is safe but it is hot enough to remove layers of flesh from inside you mouth and possibly other orifices.

If the could provide some not all sauces GF then it would be a 5.  I was a weekly customer until I was diagnosed a Celiac."}
{"text":"heard about this joint thru i think the calgary ffwd and was excited that they had a location more central on 16th ave and edmonton trail.  this review is for that location (couldn't find a yelp listing for that address).

headed over for lunch and ordered the large beef brisket sandwich, a few rib bones and the coleslaw.   i had a difficult time picking between the brisket and the pulled pork, but having tasted the brisket - i'll def be back to try the pulled pork and chilli con carne.  very reasonably priced, good bbq - nice variety of bbq sauces.  just a note, like most bbq pits that i visited - this was mostly counter eating with stools."}
{"text":"Best BBQ (so far!) in Calgary.

Simple, smokey, straight-forward BBQ joint. 
Open mainly for lunch (10-4), Monday through Saturday.

I had \"The Manwich\" which is 4oz. of Pulled Pork and 4oz. of Brisket on a bun. Very good.

They have a LARGE array of in-house made BBQ sauces ranging from sweet to spicy, but most of them with a fairly strong vinegar base. All very good. The Apple stuck out most to me of all of them, but this may just be a preference thing.

The cornbread is great, as is a Pecan Tart to finish the meal (if you have room).

Probably the best part about Holy Smoke is the ribs. At a buck-a-bone, you can make a meal out of them, or just top off your plate with as many as you're hungry for. Super smokey, nice char, they are (in my opinion) perfect tenderness while not going to the \"dried out, 'crumble' off the bone\" extreme. Still moist and juicy.

The cole slaw was not entirely noteworthy, but may still be useful to balance out the heaviness. Baked beans were okay, but the beans themselves tasted slightly burnt. The sauce surrounding them did seem to have a nice rich molasses flavour though.

Guy working the counter was super nice, welcoming and informative (possibly the owner?).

Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"We must be too demanding.  After landing from San Francisco we pulled out yelp and found the best place we could.  Out comes this place.  Well either Canadians tastes are different than Americans or there is not good  Bbq in Canada.  Medicore at best and service was nonchalant."}
{"text":"I love the various sauces you can add to the pulled pork - my favourite is the Jack Daniel's sauce.

I really enjoyed the food, and the concept (the cool trivia cards on the tables), the only reason it didn't get a higher ranking is the prices are steep, and the location is difficult to find.   I also felt pretty crammed in."}
{"text":"Wow!  again our fellow Yelpers' are spot on in giving Holy Smoke a great review.. it's true.. we had the beef brisket and pulled pork.. beauty eh!  add in the home made sauces and you're rocking authentic pulled sandwiches.. and they've got plenty of napkins at hand.. cause you're gonna need em..  this is an absolute gem.. you won't be disappointed"}
