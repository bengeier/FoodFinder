{"text":"The three stars is because I can't help but feel most of the staff care.  I really want to like Whistlers, I've been coming here since my kids were little and there was a pool table.  Now my girls tower over me and are finished or on their way to finishing high school.  They used to have the best nachos in the city except Sneaky Dee's.  It's not easy to be known for nacho's, there really isn't much too it.  But they would sauté onions, peppers and other veg in just the right amount of oil and add just the right amount of cheese with salsa, guacamole and sour cream on the side.  But at some point, possibly the 2007 recession, which saw a lot of restaurants take short cuts to save profits, (who could blame them?) The nacho's just became a large pile of chips, with a bit of cheese on top and nothing else.  So you would just be eating dry nacho's and salsa it you choose to dip.  
Their club sandwich has never been consistent.  Sometimes the chicken is seasoned beautifully and I think it must be the best club ever. But I order it another day and it's dry, and tasteless.  
After my love of the nacho's, and the club was lost, I would get a burger.  But, like the club, it is hit and miss.  But more miss than hit.  
I then fell in love with the vegetarian pizza.  Why keep coming back though? I live closer to the danforth and have 2 locals, that are closer and have consistently great food.  The Gabby's Danforth burger is awesome! 
But sometimes I need a change, want to get away from the Danforth and Whistlers is large, air conditioned and comfortable.  
So, back to the veg pizza.  I'm allergic to tomatoes and always look for a pasta or pizza dish that doesn't feature the highly popular fruit.  The vegetarian pizza I had ordered for years, average dough, olive oil, asparagus, bell peppers, sautéed red onions and goat cheese, served with Parmesan and red pepper flakes.  Awesome!  Crave worthy'. Then one day I went in, ordered the pizza and it came with tomato sauce and mozzarella with goat cheese and the veg.  I spoke to someone about it and specifically asked, if the specs for the pizza have changed, please let me know.  I won't order it, if the specs have changed.  I was assured the specs were the same but someone new was in the kitchen and they'll get me a new one.  The second one came, still with mozzarella.  I was told that they always put mozz on it but so little you can barely see.  Ok fine, it's not on the menu and I can see an unappealing amount of mozz right now.  But I don't want to be a pain.  One bite tells me it's burnt to a crisp at the bottom.  Forget it, I don't want to eat anymore.  Staff were friendly, my meal and drinks were complementary. And I didn't return for months.  But I really wanted that tasty pizza.  The one I used to get all the time before that one incident.  So I go back and order. After all, I was told the specs haven't changed.  The pizza comes with tomato sauce and mozzarella, the goat chef drowning in the mozz.  I send it back, explain that the specs have obviously changed, apologize, state I had tried to figure this out before... Yada yada. I was told, don't worry, we'll fix it, we'll make you anew one
It comes, looks awesome!  But alas, the dough is raw.  So this long tale and other reviews tell me that there is absolutely no quality control in the kitchen.
The service has always been fine, the staff do seem clueless about the menu, (is this a new recipe or not?) But, no one is checking the quality of the food.  Not the kitchen staff, not the manager... The servers, yes they check, most of the time, but if they're unsure what the menu calls for, it's just not helpful. But it seems this restaurant doesn't care if customers like their food or not.  And that bothers me.  It's a pub.  There won't be anything spectacular.  But one should expect something decent.  And it sucks because I like this place.  But I won't be coming back because they just don't care.  They must make enough off the venue upstairs."}
{"text":"Whistlers is so close that we had to go.  We went for a drink before, which is reasonably priced.  But last weekend we went for some dinner.  I ordered a grilled cheese stuffed with guacamole and bacon. It seemed like there was no guacamole in it, but there was, it had just melted into the bread.  I had to order some more on the side to get the taste of the Guac.  I suggest they put it on the side for all of their customers because its just a waste for the guacamole to disappear within the sandwich.  My BF also really enjoyed my grilled cheese, who doesn't love bacon.  

He ordered a panko crusted deep fried portobello mushroom stuffed with brie.  OH MY i loved this veggie burger.  It was actually really really tasty.  I wish I traded meals with him.  Both of our meals were surprisingly tasty and the bill at the end of the night wasn't too bad. 

Our waiter was also very very good, he wasn't intrusive at all, but still got us everything we needed.
One suggestion I would make would to put less salt on the yam fries that came with our meal.  Those fries are already pree salted and putting anymore on them is overload.  We like salt, and they were still too salty!!!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood sports bar with a terrasse in the spring, summer and fall. 

A garlic-y dip with spinach (listed as spinach dip), an A-OK burger, it is more because it is in the neighborhood than anything else that I end up there each time I visit my friends in Toronto.

Positive note, they have Strongbow cider and Stella Artois  on tap."}
{"text":"A good bang for your buck.

if your in the area, its a good place to stop in. Oddly enough on a Monday night is when they are the most busy. Go for the burgers because they cook it how you like it, and they offer sweet potato fries.
overall they have a decent selection of food, along with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great pub food, and atmosphere. I always enjoy coming here to watch hockey games."}
{"text":"Good Neighbourhood Pub with wrap-round patio. Inside cool in Summer and has a nice warm feeling in winter. Extensive normal pub-food menu with daily specials. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"I have been to Whistlers several times and was very impressed. The food was great, service fast, servers were awesome. 

But today at lunch my daughter and granddaughter were in for lunch (my usual crew) and the server was not only inattentive to my table (only interested in flirting with whatever men she could find in the almost empty place) but was outright rude several times. Part of our order was forgotten. She never came back to see if drinks needed replenishing. I had to flag her down for the bill and when she didn't come back to take the payment, we had to go to the bar to pay. We totally could have walked out without paying and no one would have known. 

The food, which has always has been awesome, was less than mediocre today. The grilled bacon, cheese and guac sandwich was soggy and cold. 

My daughter took her daughter to the washrooms to use the \"potty\" and says they were disgusting. 

It's a shame. I loved the place and it's in my neighbourhood. But we will not be back."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here regularly and have never had a less than excellent meal. Firts rate kitchen."}
{"text":"Great patio. Live music, tasty food and good times. 

Try the charcuterie patter. Great for sharing."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good patio after a hard ride in the Don this place is for you. Food is ok, prices are ok, staff are fine. Standard pub grub is on the menu. Don't order anything too complicated or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Even though it has a great indoor atmosphere and a large patio, Whistler's is plagued with slow service, over priced poor quality dishes, and badly placed smoking areas that ruin the patio for non-smokers. The wait staff and bartenders are young and inexperienced mostly, but do their best to care for their customers. The kitchen staff are sloppy with presentation and poor on the timing. They obviously don't care."}
{"text":"Whistlers on a good day can easily boast the best burger in the city. Sadly, the cooks are not consistent and piss away the quality of the meat. The second best item on the menu (grilled calamari served over a bed of greens) was removed from the menu. They do have excellent sweet potato fries, ribs and I must admit I am disappointed with their wings. The patio in the summer is a terrific after work spot to listen to live music, enjoy a Stella and catch the sketchy folks get off the TTC."}
{"text":"Bad service, eh food, would not recommend.

Visited this place for a special group event.

Because of this, we had several tables reserved for us so they had more people than normal.

They were offering us a special of small nachos with any order of a pitcher. We ordered our first pitcher and finished it while the nachos never showed up. Okay, the server may have forgotten so we ordered a second pitcher and confirmed with her that they come with nachos and she said yes and would bring us the first nachos too. Finished the second pitcher and still, never got nachos. We talked to other people and apparently we were not the only ones.

Also, during our first pitcher, a seat cleared up next to the tv so we asked our server to switch us to that table. She said yes and that she would clean the table for us. 2 hours later and there were still stuff left over from the previous guests.

I tried their wings and it was okay but nothing you wouldn't expect from a pub. Very mediocre.

Average food and the very bad service, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am truly surprised right now! After 15 years of living across the street and eating here maybe 5 times because the food sucked so bad.. 

I just had an awesome banquet burger! $14 

The menu is not too vast, the prices are a bit pricey.. But I will say that meal was worth the $14. 

I just told my lovely server and she said the got a new chef. I said keep him. She said the pizzas are really good too. It's been 4 years since I've eaten here! At least I have the burger to look forward to now."}
{"text":"Location is good. Parking in the back. TTC accessible. Bar staff is pleasant and not overly chatty. Wait staff are helpful and enthusiastic. Menu has a nice variety. The specials are over-priced and you can cook most any thing on the menu yourself. It's a consistent place to go with a large family, a work group or a bunch of friends. Nothing special for a nice date though.Their pasta specials can be bought in the Sobeys next door and cooked at home. There are nice large comfortable tables and they are child friendly. There are TVs so there is no dearth of things to look at. Nights are sometimes a bit noisy. The jazz is nice when there is a group. The function room upstairs is better than most but not accessible if you can't do stairs. 
similarly, the washrooms are downstairs. Food stops at about 11p.m. Bar menu is adequate for a large group with different tastes. Meat is processed in the sandwiches. It's typical stuff like Caseys, Kelseys etc, but it is a great place to meet up with a group."}
{"text":"Whistler's is the place to go for a good meal. With both indoor and patio seating, Whistler's makes for a comfortable experience with good service and great food.

They offer a wide variety of appetizer platters that come in generous portions (best to share with a group). The pub platter comes with delicious finger foods to start off your meal and are not heavy and greasy like some appetizer platters. 

The steak there is superb. Made to order, it is very juicy and seasoned to perfection. By far one of the staples on the menu. 

Prices are very reasonable, service is friendly and the food is good. Definitely worth going back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, had driven by many times but never visited.   The food was good but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time!   I was meeting friends there and they arrived quite a bit earlier as I was working.   I was never offered a menu or even acknowledged by the waitress when she brought their food.   I found my own menu and could not  find the waitress again.  My friends did not receive any cutlery or napkins with their food, they managed to flag someone else down to get those and that person luckily took my order.   The food took about 35 minutes to arrive, I had to ask a few times as I assumed they may have forgotten  the order.   After we finished eating  nobody came to clear the plates or to ask the 5 of us if we wanted another drink.   After almost 1 hour I finally got up and took the plates inside myself!   We finally found the waitress and 3 of us ordered that 2nd drink we had been wanting!"}
{"text":"Great patio. But beer is macro swill and food is ok. Jazz is great. If they just brought in some local micro beer and tried a bit harder on the food my rating would jump.  I really want to like this place as it is the closest pub to me. Each time I go in I desperately hope it has improved but am sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Whistler's has a nice atmosphere inside, although the smokers on both sides of the patio make outside unpleasant.  The service is generally good, but the food at Whistler's is terrible.  As many people have noted here on Yelp.  And it's not just that it's badly prepared.  The nachos, for example, were made using stale nacho chips.  Even the best kitchen staff can't save nachos made with stale chips.  How could they serve that?  I kept thinking \"I'm sure the food will be better next time.\"  And it never is.  So I'll go to Whistler's for a beer once in a blue moon, but avoid the food at all costs."}
{"text":"This pub is filled with regulars who sit at the bar. This lets you know that the beer is always fresh and delicious. It looks like any other English pub dark wood everywhere, and a few flat screen TVs. The patio is pretty impressive, much larger than you would expect from a neighborhood pub. There is a second floor that is used for private parties. The bathrooms are WAAAYYY larger than you would think. Easily a 10 staller plus urinals! These were kept in pristine condition although located in the basement.

The service is quick and delivered with a smile although if you're not a regular I highly recommend sitting away from the bar at dinner time as you may feel you don't really belong to this boys' club.

The food surprised me the most. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries, although they weren't astounding I didn't feel as if I was getting ripped off or that the quality was lacking. The sweet potato fries were not too think nor too thin and had an excellent crisp and served with the standard chipotle mayo, these fries stole the show. The grilled chicken sandwich was on grilled peices of sliced bread but had a large piece of chicken breast. The beer was fresh and the selection was decent.

Overall, a good neighborhood pub with a decent price tag. Probably some of the better pub food in the area especially the sweet potato fries. Great place to meet up for a few after work drinks and food."}
{"text":"My local pub, an after work favourite, especially when there's live jazz playing on the patio in the summer... not a huge selection of beers but its got the staples. Serves comfort food, done well... the servers are generally very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I just moved about two blocks away from here, so I was really hoping the negative reviews of my new neighborhood bar were wrong. I went in for a drink with a friend the other night and got extraordinarily slow, lackluster service. They also had far too few beers on tap for a bar. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is definitely not someplace you go because of the food.  You go to Whistler's because of its convenient location and inexpensive Magner's cider on tap.

We were lucky and a had a tremendous waiter twice the same evening (before and after a show).   He can't do anything about the quality of the food -  but he was attentive to us in an unobtrusive way.  This would be a half or one-star review without the good wait staff. 

One of the worst, industrial quality grey burgers I've ever had outside of the public school system.  The sweet potato fries at Burger King are better (and they aren't great either).  

We ordered a cheese platter during our second visit the other night.  At least one of the cheeses was past its sell-by-date. 

Really unfortunate. 

The location means we'd be happy to go there and spend $$$ if the food was at least adequate.   

Don't come here if you're with people who care about food."}
{"text":"The food is nothing to write home about but the beer is always cold and reasonably priced. Service is always friendly and fast. Nice large patio. Overall, great neighbourhood drinking spot. Live blues music outside at least once a week in the summer."}
{"text":"I purchased a deal for Whistler's, to get $25 worth of brunch or lunch for $10, and, after brunch today, have ranked it low on my list of brunch choices in Toronto.

The service was friendly, energetic and attentive. 

I hope it was a rare mistake that the steak and eggs took over 45 minutes to arrive. 

My below average review is a result of average food, below average coffee and inflated promises (\"...one of the best brunches in the city\"). I can think of ten places in Toronto that outrank Whistler's brunch."}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis. I don't think it knows if it's trying to be a sports bar, irish pub, family restaurant, r&b lounge, or it's own beast altogether. You'll know what I mean when you walk inside and notice the large sports screens, clashing decor, and one strange playlist playing over the speakers.

Food wise, it was ok. I came here for brunch and got some ok, somewhat bland eggs and a bunch of caesars. At least the company was good."}
