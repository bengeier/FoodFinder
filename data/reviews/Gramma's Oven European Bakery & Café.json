{"text":"Gramma's oven is the best.  I have lunch there a few times a week.  The service is quick and the food is delicious, and cheap!! I also love their gingerbread cookies.  Who would have thought to have gingerbread men all year round.  Can't wait till they get their easter cookies so I can bring them home to the kids!! If you haven't tried out this place you gotta go! Truly a hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"I read about the little old lady and her delicious pastries and had to check this place out.

I was disappointed. First of all, if you want a nice place to sit down for a coffee -- this is actually a fantastic spot. Most of the space is dedicated to some very nice chairs/tables for you to sit and enjoy your coffee etc.

However, the selection of pastries is quite limited. And I did not meet a little old lady that was sweet...but some younger lady who, even after explaining that it was my first time there, didn't engage with me or suggest anything. I really didn't feel very welcome. 

Had a danish and it was okay but they are pretty expensive and if I wasn't going to come in and sit down with someone for a coffee I probably would never go here again. 

It's clean and all...and maybe I just got unlucky so I'll leave it at 3 stars for now. Also, it has a niche...just not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"The lady that helped me there was so sweet and nice. I really appreciated all of her help.  The ambiance of this place was very relaxing and comfortable. I almost felt like I was in my own grandmother's home. I got some gingerbread cookies and they were a hit. I also tried some French bread. I personally love eating it by itself, but we also made some garlic bread with it. My son is a very picky eater most of the time, but he had no problem eating this bread or the cookies (obviously). He asks me for the bread from Gramma's all the time!"}
{"text":"Gramma's Oven now takes debit card, although they charge $0.25 to use it. I'm not sure if it's even legal to do that, so I'll keep my rating at 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great little place for a sit down with a friend.  I really like the dainty cookies they make."}
{"text":"Nice little bakery/cafe in Oak Ridges.  I only found it because I was at the Taftan Kebab in the same plaza.
I bought the Ukranian Potato Bread and Polish Sourdough.  Both are soft, white breads as opposed to crusty, chewy bread types. (My kid likes soft bread so we'll be back).
Really enjoyed the Blueberry Crumble Cake.  Very fresh, moist bundt cake with a blueberry jam-like topping and only $7.50.  Will definitely buy again.

Weekends draw a large cycling contingent so seating can be limited around lunch time.

Debit or cash accepted."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The sandwiches are delicious! The bread is fresh! And the cookies and rum balls are mouth watering! Always a repeat customer, Eva will gladly fill your coffee up once or twice with a smile, such a comfy cozy caf√©! Slow paced and the way European bakeries are known to be! I'll always be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had!  Bagels were toasty warm with a generous amount of cream cheese. The lady didn't look like a gramma but she was fast and very nice!  I will be back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The gingerbread man we walked out with was forgotten in the car overnight.  Two days later, it was still light, airy, delicious gingery goodness.

Gramma's Oven is a pretty busy happening place with a regular stream of clients.  All the tables were busy on a Sunday morning.  I arrived with my two kids and hubby.  We had an assortment of pastries, bagels & cream cheese, and a custom sandwich for my fussiest eater.  The staff were wonderful.  Friendly.  Coffee flowing.

What struck me as someone who loves traveling but has not been at liberty to go back to Europe any time soon - I was reminded of your standard bakery in Iceland, Copenhagen,  Poland, or Germany.  But, this is Oak Ridges.  Home sweet home."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Grandma's.  Since it's right around the corner from my school, I go there often.  I always buy the bread for home and, though I don't indulge as often as before, the pastries are outstanding.  I can be found there often in the morning, picking up a latte on my way in.  Their espresso is quite good, not to mention a decent selection of teas.  Their soups and sandwiches are great for lunch.

Often, Grandma's can be quite busy, which means a bit of a wait.  While the staff is very friendly, from time to time, they seem a bit slower.  If you are in a tremendous rush, this may not be the place to go.  However, the food is worth a bit of a wait.

I would truly recommend Grandma's.  Always remember, though, they only accept cash.  Important to remember."}
{"text":"Love the delicious almond crescent cookies! Ladies who work there are lovely and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Just dropped by here for the first time a couple minutes ago.  The lady (granny) that helped me was super sweet.  In fact, she was so nice that I came out with a huge apple strudel even though I just went in to take a look around.  Brought it home and wow was it delicious.

I live just around the corner (new to the neighbourhood).

Will definitely be going back.

Gosh - that Granny was nice!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little European style bakery. They sell artisanal baked goods and pastries. They also have a small menu for homey sandwiches and daily soups. I love that you can get a decent espresso here for $1.75. I like to sit here and have a sweet bun with my coffee then take home some artisanal bread. You should really try the Ukrainian potato, the Babka, and the Polish sourdough. The rye and pumpernickel will be foolproof.

{"text":"Stick with Gramma's Oven baked goods, you won't be disappointed!

Though not baked on site, all the baked goods are from the other store just around 15 minute North in Oakridges.

Buy a cappuccino/latte ($2.75) and you can also get a choice of danish for free.. that's why I ended up trying one of their Raisin Danish... (I would have pick apple or something else) which is quite good!

I don't know why gramma put milk into my Americano ($2.25), maybe is my fault I should have told her that I like my black when I ordered?

Cookies, Bread and Sweet all look delicious... I will stick with my Gramma's baking instead of her coffee beverages!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Never again. The lady gave off an isolated rude vibe like I was in the wrong place. Granny was not there."}
