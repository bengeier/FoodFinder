{"text":"Great gelato, I have been a couple of times because its a store where you can keep going back and experimenting with a wide range of flavours (as well as the fact that gelato is healthier than ice cream). I defiantly recommend the hazelnut, the dark chocolate is very rich so I would recommend getting it with another light flavour like coconut."}
{"text":"I joined yelp just to take advantage of their yelp upgrade! I couldn't make up my mind between pistachio and mango flavour and asked to try them twice... To my amazement the server at the counter did not seem annoyed with the request and gladly entertained my desire. Mind you, being a fatty in a gelato shop like this was like hell, with all the different flavours I could not make up my mind :( the server probably noticed my indecisiveness and told me that if I had yelp and checked in I could get a free upgrade! I was very happy that I was able to get both flavours :)  Andddddd to top it all off, the owner asked if I would like to try their new waffle that they were testing a new recipe for.... FREE! How could I possibly refuse free sweets? Although it was a little soft, the plate was very beautiful and tasted pretty good especially free and with another scoop of gelato on it. I let the owner know that the waffle dish would have tasted better if he let the waffle cook a little longer to make it more crispy and the owner thanked me for my opinion AND GUESS WHAT? HE OFFERED ME FREE COFFEE., what an awesome experience :)"}
{"text":"I was in Richmond Hill visiting family when they took me here for dessert. I don't normally go for gelato during the winter, but I'm glad that I did. They had a large selection of flavours to choose from, but thankfully the staff was kind enough to let me sample a few before I settling on a scoop of their pistachio. I made sure to steal a bite from my family, though. I ended up buying a 1 litre tub to share with my co-workers before I left.  I'll definitely make sure to visit again."}
{"text":"I tried the blood orange sorbetto and salted caramel gelato here today and both were utterly delicious! They have so many amazing looking flavours and the server was so nice and piled my cup so high that I could forgive the heinous interior decor and forget that I was in the seediest looking plaza in Richmond Hill. Highly recommend since there is no other place like it in the area. Next time, I'd like to try their affogato and maybe one of their paninis."}
{"text":"We just moved to Richmond Hill and found this gelato place on yelp, and it looks like a place that's easy to miss from the outside, but once we have tasted their gelato, we can never forget its flavours.  my boyfriend asked for mango cheesecake and rum raisin, and I asked for one pistacchio and bacio. I noticed the colour of pistachio looks more vivid than other gelato places, so I asked the lady why. The lady went to get me a real pistacchio nut. Shecompared the colour of the pistacchio nut with the colour of their pistacchio gelato, she said that they put real pistacchio into the gelato and thats why the colour of their pistacchio gelato looks different than other places. I believed her because when I tasted the gelato, I could really taste the nuttiness of the pistacchio instead of some artificial flavouring.   The lady was really nice and let us tried some other flavours, we ended up getting 1 litre of rum ball and dark chocolate home. we really enjoy this little place and will for sure revisit again and again. This place deserves a 5 star from me."}
{"text":"I la-la-loveee the the pistachio and they even had a special Bailey's flavor that was delicious. Great place to sit and chitchat while eating gelato :) They also gave a generous amount when scooping!!  They also have some flavors with no milk in it for those who are lactose intolerant :) Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place has to be the diversity of their gelato flavours! They have a great selection and by 2 pm some of their popular ones were running quite low, so get there early.  Got the banana and forest berry mix for 6 bucks (I put in $0.40 in their tip jar to round off my coins). The lady behind the counter allowed me to have three samples  and I was very appreciative (came in wanting one scoop... Got two hehe). She put in a huge serving of the banana gelato and a respectable amount of the forest berry which I did not mind one bit.  The gelato was creamy and very rich which made me remember my first time having gelato in Rome and was a definite bonus! I am going to bring my girlfriend here as soon as I can and probably spoil us with their large size cup!  They get a 5, great product and great service what more can one ask for."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars. The gelato is great - probably the best in the area. However, since the new management took over this year the service needs some serious improvement. There was a new guy working behind the counter last night who was really friendly and smiled to serve us - he was great! But there was a woman managing him who was SO RUDE and unprofessional. She loudly criticized the new guy in front of clients, saying that he was not ready to run the shop because \"he was a huge mess\" and couldn't handle the cash or clients properly. This was totally unprofessional and made it very awkward for us to sit in the store enjoying our gelato. The new guy listened and quietly took all of her berating comments and returned to work - he was actually doing a fantastic job from a client perspective. Meanwhile, this woman continued to shout at him and then went on a smoke break. The poor guy was handling the store perfectly. If anything in this store needs to be improved it's this woman's attitude - I can't see this business lasting long if she doesn't start to respect employees and clients. This woman needs a lesson about professionalism and friendliness from her new and courteous staff."}
{"text":"This place gives great servings and the people who work there are nice. The blueberry flavour is really refreshing and fruity and the pistachio one is nice and creamy. All in all, this is a wonderful place to get some gelato."}
{"text":"Ummm the gelato is a bit \"sugary\" than other places.  the opening hour has change from 12noon to 2 pm"}
{"text":"I'm a fitness model so I try to eat as healthy as possible but every once in a while I'll treat myself to a gelato. After coming here I'm rethinking my occupation because I can't stop thinking about it! Me and my partner got a loveboat which comes with 4 flavors. I wasnt a fan of the vanilla but the lychee and the baileys are amazing."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time after the York Region Pride Parade.  They had a decent selection of flavours at a decent price with very generous servings, but for those who know REAL gelato, this place leaves you with something to be desired.  The gelato is kept at too high a temperature, resulting in icing and over-freezing.  The result? The servers have to use the paddles (kudos on the attempt to use a gelato paddle, LOL) to chip, chisel and pry the gelato out of the container.  It made me cringe!  Yup, I probably sound like a gelato snob, but... well, yeah!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  All the gelato is made with fresh ingredients on site.  They have so many flavours to choose from.  I tend to watch what I eat so I normally get their sorbettos because they are fat free.  But their cookies and cream is bomb!   I tried their panini's ...damn good too :)"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner on a Sunday night and half the flavours were gone :(. Ended up ordering the lemon sorbet and pistachio gelato.  Check-in yelpers cuz you get a free upgrade from small to medium! The pistachio was creamy and delicious, but the lemon was too sour for me."}
{"text":"This is a decent enough place for gelato in downtown Richmond Hill. The setup is interesting, it is part of a small plaza and the space is shared with the kabob restaurant next door. They must own both places. Service was very friendly  When we arrived through to when we left, not a single customer came in. Was very quiet. The gelato as a result suffers as they don't have the traffic to constantly make new batches. I suspect this batch was there for a week or so. Had a bacio and tiramisu mix. Flavours were decent but again due to the \"staleness\", the gelato was harder than I would like.   3 stars. Maybe it's busier in the middle of summer and they have fresher stock?"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have some gelato. My husband and I came in today.. no one even cared to greet us. The owner had her underage daughter working there... she was barely interested in helping us. Everything we asked she called her mom .. was so weird. Anyways, complemented the owner on the ice cream she didn't even respond.  So we get the ice cream (same size) mine barely filled, my husbands over flowing . The daughter put the ice cream so messy and sticky, so I asked for her to double the cup so it doesn't get all over me- she called her mom to ask for permission. The ice cream was dripping all over my phone and car keys and just everywhere. The owner noticed we were upset and didn't even bother saying a word she just stared at us.  And as for the ice cream, had no texture and for the fererro flavor they take off all of the actual Ferraro and keep it on the side and just give you the ice cream. It upsets me seeing a business ran like this. People go out and pay $7 for a small cup of ice cream to enjoy themselves, so if you're not gonna be pleasant to customers don't open a business."}
{"text":"Like I said in many of my past reviews, I only give 5 stars if customer service was beyond exceptional and the staff here were. They were extremely patient as they waited for me to decided, and let me tell you it was a long ass wait. When I asked for the gelato (blueberry and forest berry.. I'll get to those later), they were genuinely there to serve me. Awesome stuff!  The gelato was awesome in itself.. I've had gelato at other places, but this place struck home. The gelato was smooth and had a burst of flavour I couldn't describe. I ordered the blueberry and forest berry.. Blueberry was DA BOMB and forest berry was great, but a little too sweet. I had no problem with that, but some customers might. As we were eating, the guy at the counter (I forget his name) asked if we'd like to try their \"in-the-works\" gelato crepe.. ON DA HAUS! What better way to end the night than to get gelato + free gelato crepe? We instantly said, 'YES!'  The crepe was also pretty darn good, but not something I haven't tasted. It was still delicious none the less..  PS: I checked in and got the free upgrade offer.. :)  Fantabulous place to go out with your significant other during the night."}
{"text":"Right across from the Richmond Hill Centre for Performing Arts is a small lot with 10+ parking spots and 5 or so shops, one of which is Ti Amo Gelato.  As you walk in there is what seems to be in condominium terms, a SUN room with patio chairs and patio coffee tables to the left as well as to the right facing the parking lot and the Centre.  Walk past that to the inside where standard restaurant tables/chairs await and plenty of space to chill and have a Gelato, Bubble Tea, Coffee and such.  It's open from noon to 11 pm most nights except for Friday & Saturdays when it's MIDNIGHT.  Tahitian Vanilla & Dark Chocolate($4.50/medium cup) was exactly what I needed for this afternoon as I sat on the Comfy patio seat.  Dark Chocolate could almost substitute for Chocolate Ganache while the Tahitian Vanilla was lightly sweeten perfect to offset the rich Chocolate.  BTW, it notes you can sample 2 flavours per customer."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and made a trip up to Richmond Hill just based on the great reviews. And guess what? It was totally worth it! We got there around 10:30 pm on a random Wednesday night. As we pulled up into the parking lot, we saw the chairs up and someone sweeping. We were quickly greeted by a cheery man, inviting us in!  Although all the gelato had already been put away, Henry and his wife Alice started pulling out an array of flavors for us to taste. We settled on Affagatos (fresh espresso poured over ice cream) with Tiramisu and Dolce Latte gelato. The gelato was AMAZING and the espresso was FRESH! Together they created a wonderful harmony of flavors - definitely one of the best Affagatos I have ever had.  5 stars all the way! Home made gelato. Coffee beans roasted on site. The most wonderful and charming people. Perfecto!"}
{"text":"It's been two years since I last visited Ti AMO.  Gelato is still wonderful!  Lemon and red orange are my favourite. This is one of the best choices in the GTA."}
{"text":"A great place to get gelato. I particularly like the lemon gelato and the mango one. All the gelato is made from fresh fruits (I witnessed a delivery), and is made to exacting standards.  For those of you who are calorie conscious these gelatos are around 60 to 70 calories/portion.   I have been there 3 times so far and when you combine good service with excellent products this cannot fail to produce a winner."}
{"text":"They have a lot of flavors and the lady at the counter was extremely generous when giving samples! Some flavors are traditional and some were pretty funky, I tried the cherry cheesecake and pistachio! The cherry one was too sour in my opinion, but the pistachio one was amazing! I think their best bets are the nutty or cocoa based flavors, will return to try more, even though their prices are defs higher than other establishments."}
{"text":"price was reasonable and their flavours were ok.. they tasted artificial and slightly sweet.  The pistachio gelato is what I use as a benchmark and sadly, this one tasted artificial.  Their chocolate wasn't bad and their blueberry was good but the pistachio was a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"So many delicious flavours to choose from! A huge tub (22$) fed a family of 7 nooooo problem. Totally worth the trip to a shady part of R. Hill"}
{"text":"Super bare store with the the ladies chatting about. Not what I expected.    I came here with my daughter and 2 nieces on a hot day for some cool-me-down gelato.  The space is very very uncomfortable and definitely not somewhere I would leisurely hang out with a friend.    There were good amount of choices for flavours but it would have been nice for them to offer kid sizes as small is still way too big for a 3 year old.    The girls seemed to enjoy their gelatos but I would rather drive a little extra and find somewhere a little more comfortable next time."}
{"text":"Don't get the pistachio.  It tastes fake.  To have a staple flavour like pistachio taste like theirs is a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Helpful staff. Decent gelato. Decor needs an update but we didn't care. Good place to take the kids thats not a chain restaurant for \"ice cream\" after Wonderland."}
{"text":"I love this place! Gelato is delicious! I drive a long distance just for their Gelato! Shop is a little bit outdated and could use work. Wish they had another location closer to Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"After being closed for the entire winter, Ti Amo seems to finally be out of hibernation, this time under new management?  They still offer a wide array of flavours but the pistachio I had this time around did not seem as creamy and flavorful as I remembered it to be.  The price has skyrocketed (which is not on par with any other premium gelato place...) $4.25+tax for a small.. it used to be $3.50? The 1/2 litre tub is now $11...up from the previous $8! They no longer participate in the Vincity rewards points program or offer a upsize with Yelp check in.   For the price and environment, I don't think I'd be coming back here often.. there are many other options available!"}
{"text":"Light and tasty all-natural italian gelato. Plenty of non-dairy options.   I'm not super-big on ice cream (yup, that's my story and I'm sticking to it LOL). However, my wife and I love to come here, get some gelato, and sit their for a bit, chillaxing.  Our favourite options so far: - bacio (lots of chocalate -- this one does have dairy in it) - pink grapefruit - pomegranate - lychee  The place is never busy. It's not like a Starbucks where people have to site on each each others lap because all the seats are taken.   BTW the coffee here is not top shelf but it's okay, and pairs well with gelato. If you want better coffee, the owners don't seem to mind if you bring a cup from Covernotes across the street.  Parking is very scarce here. Again, across the street it's ample, just outside and behind the Centre for the Performing Arts.  All in all, great place to indulge yourself in something sweet yet reasonably healthy."}
{"text":"Sketchy little gem across from the Richmond hill performing arts centre.  The place itself is nothing to look at but the gelato is great. Used to get the panini's there but the quality seems to have gone down and the prices have gone up. Slow service sometimes also."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party, and the decor was horrible. It looked like it was from the 90's, and the service was very slow. I've experienced better gelato places, and you are better off getting ice cream from Baskin Robins or Ben & Jerry's. Save your money people."}
{"text":"When I think gelateria, I expect Italian artisanship and sophistication not a dingy place in a plaza next to a convenience store. Looks may be deceiving; not in this case though.   The gelato did not taste like gelato and it sure as heck didn't look like gelato. It was missing the creamy velvety texture of good gelato. It looked a lot more like good old Chapman's ice cream. The great thing about real gelato is the freshness of the ingredients that comes through. You can tell just by the look of their gelato how artificial the flavours are. For example, pistachio, the most popular gelato flavour and my personal favourite, was electric green here! They had a few other flavours with crazy neon colours. The dark chocolate tasted like fudgesicle.  I am not holding this place to the same standards as a Florentine gelateria, I think, even in Toronto, much better gelato can be had.   I rather have Yogurty's...sigh."}
{"text":"I have to say Ti Amo is a hidden gem in Richmond Hill for Gelato or a place to meet and hang out with friends.   The selections of Gelato is great! They have one side of the display case with all fruity favours (18 of them!!) and the other side the creamy creamy favour (18 of them!) I was counting wish that the lady can let me try every single one of them.. but no luck since it said 2 per person.. maybe I have to come back again and again to try them all!  The fresh fruits selections are great! It has kiwi, mixed berries, raspberrries, lychee...and more.. the colour all so pretty! However I did not get to eat any of those because my friend ordered the large 3 favours cup ($5.50) and after ordering that she found out it is too big for her to eat them all! So I added up stuck with her choice of favours.. which are mostly on the creamy creamy side....hmmm  Npw for sure I have excuse of coming back again!"}
{"text":"We went there for the GELATO and I was exited like a little girl for a scoopful.  Putting my nose over the cold chest I was delighted by the colorful array of creamy soft swirls and rich delectable colors of ice cream, well ok, gelato, right.   What is a gelato and what is an ice cream anyway?  Well, gelato is Italian ice cream - yeah, like you know that already, I know!   While ice cream contains cream or milk and butterfat, sugar, flavoring and sometimes eggs,  gelato is made with eggs and contains lower percentage of butterfat. Gelato is also denser than ice cream, meaning it contains less air inside so you kinda get more stuff from what you pay.  If you ask me, this is a healthier treat, too, because it uses the freshest ingredients.  But you can always google it to learn more.  I got Bacio and Pistachio flavors, Pomegranate for my little boy, and Peanut Dulce for our friend.  Light and super flavorful I must say.  Runs along your tongue like silk leaving a trail of distinctively fresh flavor and aroma of the sweet nuts or the juicy poms. MmmMMMmmmm.  I also got myself a nice cup of cafe latte.  Their coffee was so good it tasted premium.  And that gelato-coffee combination was divine.  It filled my craving for something good that day to lift my senses from all the cloud and rain over our heads.    Looking at their menu, they've got gelatos in various nuts and fruits flavors, a number of coffee and tea flavors, shakes and slushies, some pastries, and oh really (!?) bubble milk teas.  The staff were very friendly akin to a small town generosity of small talk and sincere smiles.    I wasn't too disappointed and will visit frequently.  Got lots of other flavors to try and enjoy.  It's a nice quiet place, too, to hang out with friends and family with great desserts and treats to unwind and think of happy thoughts and probably share the same childhood delight with my little ones.

{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved it. There are many flavors to choose from and today I went for 2 flavors for 4.95. I got Cherry Cheesecake and Bacio. It was soooo good. A little weird for a winter day but definitely a good treat! Don't hesitate to ask the staff for samples if you are unsure about a certain flavor.  There is ample space to just sit back and enjoy your dessert!  Can't wait to be back in the summer!"}
{"text":"Tried the pistachio gelato and loved it! Would definitely go back again! They have numerous flavors I have yet to rey out and the staff there are very friendly."}
