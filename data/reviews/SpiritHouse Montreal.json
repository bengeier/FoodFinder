{"text":"Nice decor (old style light bulbs galore) with lots of wood and a clever way to arrange open shelves of great spirits in front of arched windows. Lots of variety, both food and drinks. Feels a bit commercial, i.e. it is a small chain, the wait staff is not that knowledgeable or professional, but they are friendly and courteous. Same with the cocktails: the menu has a few interesting items (e.g. Creekside Sour), but it is not as innovative or seasonal as Le Lab (the true cocktail lovers place with highly knowledgeable staff, which I rate five stars). If you work or live in the area, definitely a going back place that's comfortable and predictable!"}
{"text":"Too bad this place closed down. It seemed like a great spot for drinks. Plus they had one of the best whisky sours in the city."}
{"text":"A great after work bar with a nice vintage-y feel. The cocktails are expertly crafted and the selection is astounding. Great service,too! The food is tapas-style bar food, and the duck confit poutine is wonderful and decadent. Go check it out next time you're in the area. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here after failing to make reservations on a Friday night and not having much luck at other restaurants.  Let's just say we couldn't have been happier that happened!  The cocktail and liquor selection is humungous and the drinks are well made.  The food was awesome--you must try the putine sampler, cheesesteak sliders, and nachos.  The service was also top-notch; our bartender was super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice cocktails and tasty food and super friendly service, though they told my friend they could make her the cocktail she wanted without egg whites and then brought it to her with a puffy cloud of egg whites... sort of dismissing her serious dietary issues with the stuff. And it feels a little cookie cutter: the edison bulbs and leather chairs modern/industrial etc. I wish there was more character in the look of the bar, it's kind of (exactly) like Rosewood and Joverse... I'm glad there are new places to go in Old Montreal, I just wish there was more individuality and soul there."}
{"text":"SpiritHouse, please turn down the really, really, overwhelmingly loud music! I basically yelled my way through 1 cocktail and left because we couldn't hear each other and my throat was sore from yelling. Just turn it down a notch! If I knew I could comfortably talk to people while enjoying a cocktail at SpiritHouse I would go there at least several times a week for client meetings / 5@7 / etc. The cocktails are actually quite delicious - expertly mixed - perfectly balanced. The food is just ok. The tacos are passable (but I wouldn't order them again), the nachos are pretty boring / standard, the sliders are alright (really nothing special), the fried chicken just doesn't work - either revamp the recipe or take it off the menu. The hard crust comes off in one sheet combined with sweet and spicy weird sauce just don't work. I see what you're going for, but trust me when I say it's not being pulled off. There's no one that wants the fried chicken on your menu to work more than I do. I recommend going for cocktails until you can't take the noise anymore but go somewhere else for food. The cocktails are worth it."}
