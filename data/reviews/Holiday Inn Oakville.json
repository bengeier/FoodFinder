{"text":"I have since returned to the Holiday Inn Oakville Centre - everything that Gino Z said is true.  The internet experience was flawless.  My wi-fi connection was fast and reliable.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I spent the weekend in Oakville celebrating a wedding and we chose to stay at this location because they had good rates and in decent proximity to the location of the wedding venue.  The rooms themselves were clean and offered the simple amenities any hotel should. The house keeps were lovely and very friendly each morning.  The main area of the hotel was a bit to be desired. I wanted to go swimming and was looking forward to their pool. They said it was under renos but would be finished by the end of August - The concrete was still being worked on. Not to mention, the pool is in the lobby beside the breakfast buffet. Alot of the rooms overlooked the main area rather than getting a window to the outside world.   The staff at the front desk were accommodating if you pushed for what you wanted.   For a Holiday Inn that is supposed to be newly renovated... it still has alot of fixing up to do."}
{"text":"What a great hotel to come to with family! All of the staff are hugely accommodating and friendly, ams the restaurant even catered to my super picky son!! Fabulous location and central to everything!!! BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"I loved it! Modern look, spacious room, with coffee and a fridge (we came from a hotel with no fridge and realized how necessary it is), good free wifi and a self serviced laundry room! The food downstairs is good as well. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I had to be in Oakville yesterday and today.  Because there was a storm watch for overnight, I decided to stay over last night just in case the drive this morning was bad.  I stayed at the Holiday Inn.  They had warm cookies waiting at reception when I checked in.  Yum!  I had a corner room and it was an odd shape.  There was a small wall sticking out that was odd ... I got up to use the washroom during the night and was afraid I'd walk into it or the corner of the dresser in the dark.  It made for a narrow gap.  The room came with complimentary WIFI (it was speedy) and parking.  A hot and cold breakfast was included (I didn't check it out) as was a free dessert at supper (if I'd spent $25 or more).  There was a mini fridge and coffee maker in the room."}
{"text":"I stay here often, at least 3 or 4 times a year, over the past 6 years.  During this time the hotel has undergone MAJOR renovations.  The work is done and they have done a very nice job.  I travel extensively and the staff treat me well.  I feel very comfortable here.  I also notice that, over the years, I do see some of the same staff over and over, including those in charge of guest services.  The rooms have always been very nice - that said, I am always up on the executive floor so, can't speak for the rooms on the lower floors.  Buffet breakfast is good to high quality food, a nice selection and variety.  I've only eaten dinner here a couple of times but, was pleased.  If you're here on Wednesday, make sure to hit the guest appreciation cocktail/mixing social.  It's a nice time to mingle with other guests and hotel staff - very laid back and friendly.  The staff have always been very accommodating.  We've had a corporate account here for over 10 years now and lodged many employees and clients here.  They've been consistently happy with it, too.  There were some issues during the renovations but, those were to be expected and have long been resolved.  My only complaint is, like many hotels, they got rid of their hot tub."}
{"text":"This is a decent hotel option near the GO station in Oakville. I have used this hotel a couple of times when hotel prices in central Toronto have spiked, as they occasionally do during peak times. This hotel is much more moderate in cost and the proximity to the GO Train allows easy access to downtown. Also, as an IHG Spire member, I am predisposed to seek out properties in this hotel family.  Arriving at Pearson, I took a taxi from there to the hotel. The cost was $58 CAD flat rate plus tip. On my last stay, I had a room on the 6th floor. This worked well for me and afforded a nice view of the area. My room was clean and spacious with a pleasant decor. The bathroom was functional with an adequate amount of space. The TV offered a decent array of programming. The work area was good size and the WiFi functioned without any major issues. The bed was comfortable and the environs were quiet allowing me to get good sleep.  There was a restaurant in the hotel offering an option for breakfast. I took advantage of this one morning and it was so-so. However, there were also two or three places within walking distance of the hotel. We went to Whole Foods one morning and Sunset Grill on another.  The room rates were not bad for the quality of the stay and the location. The average daily rate was about $146 CAD. My total bill was just over $501 CAD for three nights with all taxes included. This was a pretty good deal. As such, I would not hesitate to recommend this place if you need a hotel in Oakville for business in Oakville or Mississauga or if you need an alternative to a downtown hotel."}
{"text":"This was, without a doubt, the quietest, most peaceful hotel room I've ever stayed in.  Big-screen TV, a refrigerator, and a fat free wireless connection make it a good place to spend time and get work done.   Given this hotel's proximity to the QEW and Trafalgar Road, I have to attribute the room's quietness to the fact that it was an \"inside\" room, whose sliding door faced the atrium/pool, instead of the outside.     The facilities and fixtures were clean and modern, and the location is great for ease of access to highways and trains, but not a scenic location itself.     NOTE:  One thing I could definitely do without is the high pressure sales tactics upon check-in, in an attempt to get me to buy into the breakfast program.  If I had wanted that, I would have bought it in the reservation process, but when I'm standing in front of the desk after a long day's travel I just want to get to my f-ing room.  \"No means no\"."}
{"text":"Decent hotel for the business traveller.  Positives:  Location near the GO and VIA rail stops.  Walkable distance to Whole Foods and other eateries,   Longer walk to the Oakville lakefront, but a very pretty route.  The staff is very friendly.  Negatives:  The Internet service was unstable, and the hot breakfast food was pretty bad.  A-Ok sums it up."}
{"text":"I've stayed at this hotel twice in my life. The first time was about 6 years ago for a soccer tournament.  The second time was when I spent a weekend with most of my events in downtown Toronto.  There really is nothing special about the hotel itself.  The last time I was there in July of 2010 the pool was under construction and there some other renovations going on.  The rooms were pretty clean and I didn't have many problems with the service there.  However, I did not spend much time in the hotel either stay.    The MAIN reason I chose this hotel both times is due to its LOCATION!  It is less then 2 blocks from the train and bus station.  This hotel is far enough outside the Toronto downtown area that you are not paying the expensive prices, and the short train ride to downtown is pretty cheap and reliable.  If you do not want to pay massive amounts of money and want to hang out in Toronto I strongly suggest staying here, saving some money, take the train into town and I'll have a great experience."}
