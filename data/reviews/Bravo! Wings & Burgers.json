{"text":"Bravo wings!!  Formerly known as superstar wings but they changed it... Duno why. This is a wings/bar kinda place like \"all star wings\" except nowhere as good lol. Many different wings to choose from, fries, burgers, and ribs. Everything is just average.. Nothing stands out too much.  The reason why I come here is to watch UFC events not rly the food. Note: Theres an $18 minimum sitting fee for ufc events. Overall, VERY average, nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Bravo is a great sports bar kind of place. There are TVs all around the room, comfortable seating.  The food is good  - lots of burgers and wings that they offer 100 flavors.   Overall, a solid place to relax with friends, with good beer and great food. Awesome place to watch games and i definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"*** WARNING: THIS PLACE IS NOW CLOSED! *** This has been reported to Yelp but they haven't taken down Bravo's listing yet.  I've been to this place probably 6-7 times since they opened as \"Superstar Wings\". A previous review compared the place to All Star Wings, which is probably inevitable since All Star is well known for wings in the area. Before comparing directly to All Star, here are positives and negatives of Bravo:  Positives: + Usually not busy. This is definitely a plus because you probably won't have to wait for a table. + Wings taste good, are decently sized, and they have a wide selection of flavors. (Rather, combinations of a few basic flavors.) Never tried their ribs but a friend did and said they were decent. + Shows UFC events. Of course it will probably be busier during these events. Also there is a minimum fee for UFC events. + Relatively cheap. Certainly cheaper than Wild Wing. (UPDATE: This is no longer true, according to the website the prices have gone up!) + Clean, generally well-kept restaurant. Decorated like a sports bar. There are HD TVs all over the place. + Servers are generally attentive and helpful. + Restrooms are decently well kept.  Negatives: - Non-wings food is hit and miss. Fries are mediocre, so was bruschetta. And if the \"pizza bun\" is still the same sorry-looking thing that it used to be, do NOT order it! Never tried their burgers. - It's decorated like a sports bar but they play loud clubbing-type music. Not that I really mind it, but it's seems a bit out of place. - There's no explanations about what the various flavors are on the menu. The waitresses don't always know what the flavors are either. - The parking lots in this area get crazy busy during lunch/dinner hours. Protip: Parking is usually available on the opposite side of the street behind Villa Malaysia.  Now, compared to All Star ... I've been to All Star many times over the years. When I first went there (I'm referring to the Woodbine & 16th location) it was great, but super busy. Now, since the renovation, the look of the place has substantially improved, but the quality seems to have gone down. The second-to-last time we ordered from them some of the wings were downright tiny. The last time, when we got take-out 200 wings for a group event, they didn't include any celery or carrots. It's not really a big deal but, come on, those are considered standard when ordering wings.  The main advantage to Bravo vs All Star is that All Star is usually packed and Bravo isn't. You don't need to stand around waiting for a table at Bravo. And many of the flavors at Bravo are suspiciously similar to All Star, so if you have a favorite at All Star you can always ask at Bravo and they may have one that's similar on their menu. Don't get me wrong, All Star is very good too, but I'd rather go to Bravo and get seated and order right away.  Overall I recommend it, and will return.  *** WARNING: THIS PLACE IS NOW CLOSED! ***"}
{"text":"Another wings place in the area.  Bravo wings used to be call Superstar Wings.  For some reason this place is hardly ever packed.  It has nice decoration and many tvs for sporting events.  The wings itself is decent and cheaper than All Star, they have good selection of flavors.  They also have a patio area but I never seen anyone use it, guess they don't usually fill up.  Been to Bravo 3 times after the name change and its been average all the time.  So if you want good seating to tvs and do not want to wait to be seated this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If you are ever looking for a place to watch a game and everywhere you go is packed, then heres plan C. This place is never ever ever everrrrrr packed. This place is our last option when we cant find seating at other bars and pubs. I dont know why people never come here because they have at least 8 tvs and there service is not bad.   On wednesdays they have the any burger special for $7.99 excluding the super burger. Burgers are pretty darn good. They have a lot of variety such as ribs, wings, calarmi, chicken, salads and stuff. Domestic pitcher is $15.99"}
{"text":"Been going here when it use to be called Superstar.  Dunno it seems after the name change and menu additions the service has been okay.  Waitress staff use to be more personal and sometimes sit down at my table to chit chat.  Price is still reasonable compared to other wing places.  Wings are decent size and the burger combos are actually pretty good.  Sucks you gotta pay for extra condiments though (mayo).    Never been here during a UFC match, but damn a $18 minimum sitting fee?  Overall I will continue to go here since like others mentioned always has a table ready and the atmosphere is chill."}
{"text":"For a smaller Wings restaurant, I received good service. The Wings never been bad, it's consistently delicious. Experiences has been great overall."}
