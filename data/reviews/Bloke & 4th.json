{"text":"Amazing food !

I came to bloke with a friend and we had wayyyyy too much food.
I read some past reviews that their portion sizes weren't big enough so my friend and I got 4 courses and let me tell you that by the time the dessert came I was stuffed.  For those of you that thought the sizes weren't big enough must eat for a small city or something because the food portions were perfect if not more. 

I loved the Bangkok Slaw and will order it again for sure. 
 
We tried the Fish Tacos as well as the Tuna and Wild Salmon Tar Tar 

The chef was awesome in making sure that I didn't get any diary on my meals as I had requested. 

Our server was very nice and willing to help answer any questions we had.

For dessert we had Peanut Butter bombs which to not sound cheesy were \"the bomb\"
 
We definitely enjoyed our time and ended up staying for the nightclub portion.

I would recommend Bloke & 4th to everyone new and old to the city, it is a great spot and they do not disappoint. 

Great Job!"}
{"text":"Food:
Good food, not amazing for the price you're paying.

Atmosphere:
Great for a girls night out or just any night out! It's lively (busy) and packed.

Service:
Not the best. I've been there loads of times for dinner and drinks and the staff are so snooty - too snooty for their own good! It's an experience.

Overall: good if you're looking for dinner and then clubbing."}
{"text":"I was excited to celebrate my birthday here to try the food created by the people of Food Dudes catering. With a party of 15 people I was forced to choose a set menu option and decided to go with the $35 per person appetizer menu that included 6 appetizers to share. I was told that everyone would have exactly one portion of each app and was given the flexibility to add more apps for an additional $5 per person per app. I decided to hold off on any additions to give my guests the option to order from the regular menu if they wanted more food. Thankfully I held out because it was such a rip off! One portion meant one tiny piece of shrimp and one measly drumstick, and so on and so forth. The food was absolutely delicious, but I couldn't get over how ridiculously scant the portions were. I was starving even after all 6 apps were delivered and I ended up ordering another app and an entree to satisfy my hunger. From the regular menu, $35 worth of shared apps would get you way more than 6 pieces of food. I was completely disappointed and a bit ticked off! If you're a large group I absolutely would not recommend coming here to eat as you will be forced to choose an overpriced set menu option. To get more value for your money come here as a smaller group.

On the upside, the venue is really nice and the service was excellent, but that's as far as my compliments go.

With the restaurant turning into a club at 11pm I was hoping that I could dance my disappointment away, but the clubbing/lounge experience fell short too. The music wasn't that great and with the denial of getting guest list for those friends who could not make it for dinner I was expecting to be engulfed by a crowd of people. In fact there was a whole area where you could have comfortably fit another 40 people. My friends and I were not at all having a great time and we gladly left.

I absolutely won't be returning here to dine as part of a large group or to party the night away and I don't recommend that you do either."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now for birthdays, and each time has been awful.  The customer service has consistently been slow and the staff never apologetic  Pricing for drinks is steep, and they don't even have the quality of liquor you'd expect given the prices.

It has  a pretty nice ambience, but it's not enough to outweigh all the problems..."}
{"text":"This review is for the club section only. 

Let's put all the cards on the table because this club seems to get a lot of BAD reviews, I am a 29 yr old female who planned an evening with 4 other friends between the ages 23 and 35. We are all mature professionals, doctors to business owners. We chose B & 4th because it claims to be \"high end\" and a \"sophisticated\" venue only accepting a certain style of person, and when I say this I mean, very well dressed and put together professionals. 

From the beginning. I added us to guest list just to ensure no issues at the door (as you read on other reviews). The bouncer and guest list girl were very nice. They took my name and confirmed our reservation, we waited outside for only 5-7 min before letting us in, following with an explanation of why we had to wait, perfect!

The venue itself was very nice and the staff looked great. The drinks were within ratio and not watered down....that's a plus. The drinks were slightly over priced but again, were made well. 

The people!.......despite what others say in their reviews, there were all types of races and colours....lol. I don't understand why people would write that this place was racist... complete opposite. On that note, most of the ladies there were young, busting out of their dresses and drunk.....like sloppy drunk, which is ok, it's a club however, throws you off from its advertising of it' s \"sophisticated atmosphere\". The men were half and half.... super drunk or just enjoying the night. As a matter of fact through speaking with one of the men, they bluntly mentioned that no girls in this club were worth more than just a screw. 

The down fall of the night was the DJ, he sucked! I like all kinds of music but he played hard core rap music that I don't even think was main stream and no one was dancing to it either, strange. Only a little of house and even then, the mixing of the songs were short and not flowing. 

Overall the evening went well and we stayed until 2am. I hope my review is helpful. It is hard to distinguish some of these venues and how they advertise them. If you are looking to get totally hammered and party hard then I guess this place fits the bill, but anywhere would, if you were in that state.If you are looking for more of a mature crowed social club, this is not the place. 

Thank you Bloke and 4th for the experience! Get a new DJ...   :),"}
{"text":"In the Asian culture, the number 'four' is not lucky but I took my chances to eat at Bloke and 4th and it was well worth the risk.  This resto lounge opened recently in the King and Spadina space that was formerly mBurger and is more of a club during the nights but with the guys from the Food Dudes catering services in the kitchen, the food was fresh, innovative and delicious.

Here the number 4 is the name of the game.  Most of the 'sharing appetizers' are portioned in fours and even the drink cocktail has the drink du jour which is lucky number 4.

The menu is all about their social appetizers which are their sharing plates and mains.  Our selections included their charcuterie board which included the house-cured duck prosciutto and maple bacon and balsamic gelee (which is packs a really intense flavour wow!) and a round of dirty martinis that have jalepeno stuffed olives which i am now addicted to. They are so great - salty and spicy!  I needed to order more olives just to munch on. 

Then came the smoked squash soup which we ordered on the recommendation of house manager.  They came in small shot glasses with house made pakoras on top.  They were so comforting for our winter weather!  Well executed and would recommend this dish to anybody!

We also ordered the set of chicken drumettes which came with a tub of liquid nitrogen that gets poured over the blue cheese causing them to freeze into blue cheese sprinkles.  It was a bold hit of flavour!

We try the main yellow fin tuna dish that came with fried calamari rings over a Bangkok slaw of fresh slivers of veggies tossed in a citrus sesame slaw.  This was a huge hit with the table and we are thankful that we were able to try this.  The mixes of flavours and textures were so delicious. 

At this point - we decided to order the 'Number 4' specialty drink.  This drink was light with gin and  cucumber ice cubes,  creamy from frothed eggs whites with a hint of a flash frozen serrano pepper which gave the drink some heat!

We then tried our final 'sharing plate' - the  tuna tartar served as ice cream scoops in seaweed sugar cones as which was my favourite dish of the evening.  It was light and delicate with a sweetness from the sugar cones. 

We are so stuffed at this point but are convinced (no arm twisting involved) to try their ice cream cone of the day which is chocolate chip lavender served with strawberries.  This was such an impressive flavour because it is so subtle similar to the way green tea ice cream starts but has a really delicate and fragrant after taste.  Yum! 

By the time dinner was done, the club scene was starting to form.  What a kicking night it was!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. Service is a little slow, but the staff were a sight for sore eyes! i would go back !!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my girls for their Winterlicious 14 menu and it was better than expected! The service wasn't amazing, but they were eager and friendly. Presentation of the food was nice and quality was great. Portions were a little on the small side tho. Very flavorful. We all had the chocolate and caramel pie for dessert and it was delish! However, the dessert portion was giant and we could barely finish it.   I did manage to finish it, but definitely felt guilty afterwards!! :)
I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bloke was no joke on Thursday night!  The DJ was on point and the crowd was packed.  the Main dancefloor was small but you can move around them.  The back bar has more dancing room if need be.  The women are plentiful.  I will be back when in Toronto again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here tonight for Summerlicious and were very disappointed. While the service was attentive, we weren't too impressed with the food or ambiance (didn't realize it was also a night club!). For starters we ordered the mushroom arancini and pulled pork brioche - taste was good, but both were luke warm. For the entrees we had the steak and vegan board. My boyfriend said the steak was okay, but the portion was rather small. The vegan board was basically a random assortment of dips/toppings and some pita bread. Most of the dips were cold, tasteless, and mushy. For dessert I had the vegan brownie, which would have been better had it been warm. My boyfriend had the deep fried cheesecake. We were looking forward to trying this particular dish, but were very disappointed when it was brought to our table and turned out to be no larger than a Timbit. Needless to say, we won't be going back again :("}
{"text":"I was here for the bar on November 9, 2013

Wow! I can't believe how terrible this place is. I would give Bloke 0 stars, but the system wont allow for it. Do NOT GO HERE for late night/ for the bar. 

I cannot say enough about how poorly mannered the staff at this terribly run establishment is. When I finally got into the bar I went to check my winter coat. because I was wearing a ballero type scarf, emphasis on scarf (which I was small enough to put in my coat sleeve), the woman at coat check demanded that I pay for two items for a total of $7.00. I couldn't believe it!! I told her \"Are you going to give me two ticket stubs and put each item on a separate hanger?\". She said \"No of course not\". And I said no I am not paying that. That is ridiculous. I only had FIVE dollars on me at the time because cover charge was TWENTY DOLLARS at the door. Are you guys serious? She took the five dollars and said \"whatever, that's fine\". WHY DID YOU HIRE THIS GIRL!? 

I then go to the ATM and the machine is broken. So I was sitting in this bar, all night, couldn't even by a drink. The bouncer said, the bartender will take debit at the bar. When i went there, she said she would take the card but I had to pay $50 to the bar first for the drink minimum; or I could go across the street. WHAT?! and have to deal with the coat girl! Are you kidding me? (I really can't believe the audacity of the charging-per-item-rule. WOW!). I stayed 30 minutes and insisted to all 20 of my girlfriends that we leave and go to another bar. Which we did, and had a much better night there.

By the way, if there is anyone from LAW ENFORCEMENT reading this. There were UNDERAGE drinkers at the bar. I don't know if it was the braces with the combination of high school football jackets that spelled it out? or the fact that they were 5' 5\" and looked 13 that gave it way? But they were there. Ridiculous in ever sense, I cannot believe this place.

DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME and $."}
{"text":"Came to bloke and 4th with a bunch of my girlfriends. We had the price fixe menu which was $45 for a 7-course appetizer meal for everyone at the whole table. Good food. Highlights were the chicken drumettes and the veal on pizza dough. 

Cons. If you're a foodie and you're ok with paying ridiculous amounts for very small portions of food, this is your heaven. Otherwise i probably wouldn't recommend it. The servers don't come by that often and are slow to refill water which is my biggest peeve with restaurants. Also, the bus lady came by to collect our salad plate and dropped the tongs on my head, and then it bounced off my shoulder. She apologized obviously but that really shouldn't have happened, unless she was drunk or something. All in all this venue is VERY overhyped and i probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Bloke & 4th. Very cool space with AMAZING food and awesome drinks. Can't ask for much more than that!

I'm a vegetarian and they had great options for me.  I think the guys behind this place (the Food Dudes) are amazing and I've been lucky to experience their food at a private party.  Can't wait for a chance to use them for a party."}
{"text":"Good was tasty. Service was good. Portions could be a tad bigger. But every dish we were served was Delish"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Sophisticated and classy. A nice and fun environment."}
{"text":"What the fuck! Where did this place spring from?

Always surprised at how much I have yet to discover in my own area let alone the whole of Toronto.

Do not remember much about this club apart from the barmaids all being gifted in the chest department. 

The first time I went I did not really enjoy it, being it was a Saturday night it consisted of hiphop wanna bes and Princess wanna bes.

However went there on a Thursday night for the FCUK fashion show after party and the crowd was much nicer. Music was also good, some house which slowly made its way to the commercial RnB.

What got me was the politeness of the staff and the front door security and management but I suppose if a big retailer is throwing an after party and bottle service that a bit of ass kissing is a must. For that one extra star for what should be normal service to normal patrons."}
{"text":"food was ok and the decor is a little douche bag central- it is a \"supper club\" so... 
Staff were all indifferent airheads- i really didn't like any of the staff I encountered there. 
Food is pretty good and they're trying to push this thing called the social app- basically they are over priced appetizers. 
we (2 of us) ordered a bunch of these social apps at the server's encouragement and paid like $200 AND left hungry. 
buh bye"}
{"text":"I have never been here for dinner, but have been here several times for the club. I would never come back. The place is pretentious, and for no good reason. I went here on opening night, and they wouldn't let anyone in after a certain point, when the place wasn't full at all. I made the unfortunate decision of getting a booth for my birthday here, and even though I spent a couple of grand, I couldn't have been treated worse. They made me give them multiple guest lists (why couldn't they all be under my name?), and so if person X didn't show up under which I had other people, they didn't want to let those people in. They told me I would get a certain number of comps, which I didn't, so even though I spent so much money, most of my friends (not even that many) had to pay to get in. I was told that tip would not be automatically be added, but of course, I paid tax and 18% tip. On top of all that, the DJ was incompetent and didn't take requests because he obviously had a prerecorded mix. He was also rude."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:
Bloke & 4th is swanky and sophisticated. If you want a chic night out over cocktails this is a good choice. The atmosphere is warm and beautifully decorated.

FOOD:
There is no dinner menu per se, but they offer \"social apps\" for sharing before they move the tables out of the way and transform the lounge into a club. The food is quite good - from the seasonal soup (smoked butternut squash at the time) to braised veal meatball on thin pizza slices, and apple wood smoked salmon satays. The beef sliders and calamari were the only items I was not wow'd by. 

PRICE: 
The prix fix menu is $45/pp for 7 appetizers to share with your group.  The portions are not large enough to fill you up for a meal (but this is typical for a chic resto-lounge) so set your expectations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Joined friend and her co workers here for a dinner she planned. Tapas(small sharing plates). I have to say the food here was absolutely amazing. Veal meatballs, polenta (polenta wasn't amazing but it was average) mini sliders. I cannot start to speak on the quality, effort, detail, and delicious taste of the food. The server also seemed to know exactly what he was serving.

The initial woman serving us drinks, meh, she had no idea what was going on. On top of that, the drinks were 75% ice. 

I am weary of places that turn into night clubs. Not a proper supper club. - it turns into douche bag central at about 11. We were all coming from work, and wore work attire, but many a female was close to naked, many a male was doused in grease. Some arrived at 6,7. Who comes from work looking like that  - ever? Which leads me to believe they were just house wives, single cougars, and yuppies trying to fit into the crazy mold.

Skip the nightshift here, go early leave early and enjoy the absolutely flavourful food."}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious. The steak tartare was really good and the braised short ribs was really tasty too. Would definitely go back again. However the service was really bad :( waited very long before we can put our order in."}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying that the number one thing this place needs to fix is the Attitude of its serving staff.  The comments, facial expressions, and total lack of enthusiasm to help their customers is what will truly be their downfall. Everyone from the hosts, servers, bar staff, and Managers really need help on just being nice to the people that come to your establishment to give them their hard earned money.

From the outside, the location is hard to find because the sign is written in black letters on a black wall.  I really do not know what they are trying to pull off there, but it does not work.

The ambience is nice.  It is your typical supper club.  They serve dinner until approximately 10pm and then it turns into a nightclub after.  

The food was decent but not worth the price. I did not get my dessert and when I told the server this.... the first words that came out of his mouth were \"well I put them down on the table somewhere.\" Immediately I gave him a nasty look and promptly replied that I just wanted to let you know that I did not get my dessert.  Thats all.  Another example of attitude is when my friend ordered a drink that never came, the server gave him a smart ass answer and asked my friend \"do you want this to be a good night or a bad night?\" 

There were many other examples throughout the night of our less than subpar service as well but I will talk about some of the good things here.

The music and DJ was on point and he was playing some great mixes! The bottle service selection was good and our host was actually nice to us.

Bloke & 4th needs to change a lot of things in order to keep customers coming back.  I would not recommend you go here for supper but feel free to go have a good time at their night club."}
{"text":"Summerlicious is always in and around my birthday and so naturally I end up at a lot of them for birthday dinners.

I don't know about everyone else but I had a lot of difficulty trying to secure reservations this year without eating like a senior (e.g. 5PM) or having to eat two dinners (because I don't think I would've been able to hold out until 9:30PM).

I almost couldn't get a reservation to Bloke & 4th, but through the power of Twitter managed to nab a reservation for our table of 10.

I don't usually go to restaurant-lounges (the kind that turns into a bar/club after 10PM) because the food is usually mediocre and you're usually paying for the ambiance and convenience of not having to go elsewhere to party afterwards.  But after having learned that The Food Dudes were part owner at this trendy King West joint, all my doubts subsided.

The $35 dinner menu consisted of an amuse-bouche + 3 courses.  While the amuse (a Strawberry gazpacho) was a refreshing way to start off our meal, it was their Focaccia bread that had us all cooing.  It had a nice crust, but was pillow-soft on the inside and I suspect there was some cheese involved.  While I almost always pass on the bread, there wasn't one slice left in this basket!

To start I opted for the Steak Tartare with paper-thin, house-cut chips, mustard aioli and fried capers for added crunch.  The tartare was not too wet, not too pickled, and not too sweet - as Goldilocks would say - it was just right.

For my main, in true Flinstone size, a Braised Short Rib served over a bed of smoky cauliflower purée, grilled asparagus, King mushrooms and topped with carrot chips.  This colossal rib had me howling Ya-Ba-Da-Ba-Doo as tender and juicy shreds of meat came off the fork.  The King mushrooms were full of flavour and I loved the creamy cauliflower purée (bonus that it's way less calories than your usual mashed potato).

I had high hopes for the Key Lime Pie - essentially a white chocolate and Key Lime crème brûlée with ginger crumble on top.  But it resembled a Key Lime Pie as much as I resemble Angelina Jolie - not even a hint of lime flavour.

Luckily, the real dessert came when my best friend Andie surprised me with my very own birthday cake.  A Chocolate-Kahlua cake with Frangelico cream and a cherry minion on top!  I loved it. Bloke & 4th was kind enough to divide up the cake for us; service throughout the night was attentive and our server was a lot of fun!

We ordered pitchers of Sangria ($36) to drink.  As one of my friends put it \"Enjoy your Sunny D!\"  But we did later discover that all the alcohol content went straight into the booze-soaked fruit.

All in all, I had a fabulous time at Bloke & 4th.   Even my pickiest friends gave their stamp of approval for this Summerlicious pick!  The ambiance is chic and there is plenty of street parking nearby (we parked right out front).  But beware the parking enforcement Nazis who left me a huge birthday present (a parking ticket) for being 10 minutes late to renew my parking.

Summerlicious runs until this Friday, July 19th.  Take advantage of special prix fixe menus and choose wisely - not all restaurants are created equal ;)

{"text":"I'm American and I've never encountered racism the way I did at this club. I didn't have a huge problem with the staff that worked there. My main problem was the clientele, who were rude, pushed and elbowed the people I was with, and made racial comments. The other people I was with did have a very hard time with the bartenders. We paid way too much in bottle service to have such a poor experience. :( but the DJ was fantastic.  That's why they get 2 stars. Music is amazing."}
{"text":"I attended Bloke & 4th for a company holiday party, and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect before arrival. I'm a regular at BarHop just beside Bloke, and from what I could recall, it was a place full of club-goers, whom I could see constantly smoking if they weren't waiting for bouncers to let them inside. 

So, I wore my best \"holiday work party appropriate\" outfit and jumped in.

And was pleasantly surprised!

The food was delicious (since it was by the Food Dudes, I should've figured), definitely a Canadian/Americana style of tapas to be sure. 

The hors d'oeuvres that were passed around were tantilizing, two of my favourites were a steak tartare on house-made potato chips (which were divine!) and a cold shrimp with chutney stacked a-top it (hard to eat though).

For beverages, we could purchase whatever from the rail, but only house beer (which was, honestly, a surprisingly mediocre selection), house wine, and this weird blue mixed drink were free. The blue thing looked like it was blue curacao with a shot of sprite and vodka... no thanks, and the beer was sad, so I stuck with the wine which was better than I expected with the other drinks around. I expect the sad alcohol selection is due to their being a club at night, those places always have the least impressive drinks.

But then, bring on the dinner! We were wowed with several \"salads\" which were really impressive plates with vegetables on it AS WELL as actual salads, and the meal progressed to these amazing butter chicken meatballs with house-made naan and, the piece de resistance, mouthwatering short-ribs.

So why is this only three stars?

The ambiance, unfortunately, sucked. I felt like I was in a really shitty club the entire time, the staff cleared our tables and chairs the second we stood up to make room for people coming later for clubbing, and I knew it was time to go elsewhere. LOVE THE FOOD, I'd really like to see this place be more of a supper club than an office-bro dance night, but the actual venue was a turn-off."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not a club type person - so please take this review with a grain of salt. 

Our company had a holiday/cocktail party here.  If I were to assess the entire event, it would have been 1.5 stars, however I don't know how much of it was the planning committee's fault and how much of it was the venue's fault.  

What I liked:  The space was very nice.  It has some comfy couches and is very clean and hip. The music was pretty good as well.

What I disliked: I'm sure our company would have told them we were planning to be there from 6:30-11:30 and we wanted a cocktail party.  If it's a cocktail party, there definitely should be music, but it was blaring all night.  This would be great if it were a bunch of university students clubbing, but the DJ should have thought it through that it is a COMPANY party and people want to mingle for the first few hours.  At least give us 2 hours until 8:30 to hear ourselves talk and then you can blast the music up at 8:30-9 so people can start dancing.  Another dislike was the infrequency of the food.  I probably had about four bites all night at the venue and I was there from 6:30 to 10.  Another coworker and I got so frustrated, we left at 7:30 to grab some real food.  I don't know if this was our company being cheap, but my coworker said he attended a b-day party here and ran into the same situation.  

My last and final dislike was the food.  While I thought the meat was pretty good, why did everything have to be served on a chip, cracker or just be fries?  You could have at least served it on bread.  

Verdict: Seems like a good clubbing place, but doesn't seem like a great dinner place or to hold \"professional\" parties."}
{"text":"4.5!
So good...you know you're satisfied when you can't breathe and sit there in a coma.

Service was above and beyond.

Food tasted amazing and portions were perfect.  Food Dudes doing their thing watch out now!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible front door service. We came for the club and had bottle service and guest list. The front door guest list girl was extremely rude and condescending to us. She told us we weren't on her list and we were never getting in and made a stink about how we were being rude to her when all we did was ask her to check with her manager to see our names as she wasn't finding it. 

Music was amazing and our promoter was fabulous which are the only reasons this place didn't get a 1 star. Bottle service was attentive and the crowd here is upscale. Too bad the front door staff ruined this otherwise good venue. 

Be prepared to pay for a lot of bottles here if you want bottle service on a Saturday. It was rammed."}
{"text":"Pretentious are the words that describe the crowd that enjoys this place.

I won't comment on the food, which is fine and overpriced like most of King West, but quite a few of the male staff at this place are truly misogynistic.  I can tell you from experience, that if you're not a pretty woman, you will be treated differently in a more noticeable way than at most venues.  If you are, then if you're unlucky expect to be on the receiving end of vulgar sexual comments when your male friends are not around.  I'm talking those doing security, and at the bar."}
{"text":"I can't speak to what Bloke and 4th is like after hours, when it turns into a club, but restaurant-wise, Bloke & 4th is easily one of my favourite places I've been for Winter or Summerlicious.

The décor is modern, dark, and loungey. Lots of small nooks and areas to be seated and eat in small groups, as well as larger tables and booth/table hybrids if you are bringing a larger group.

Everyone that works here is gorgeous looking eye-candy! Males, females, hostesses, bar tenders, wait staff! Each of them attentive and quite friendly, too.

We opted for two pitchers of Sangria (which I recall were between $35-39 each) and split amongst everyone. We were all able to have two glasses of the Sangria each from the pitcher, so if you are sharing in a large group it's quite a good deal. The Sangria came with chopped up fruit, and it was quite yummy, though a little light on the alcohol.

The amuse bouche was a fruit gazpacho shot with cucumber. It was an interesting sweet and savoury mix, and cool way to start off the meal.

For my app I had the fire-roasted shrimp that came in a sweet and spicy sauce, served with crispy chips and on a bed of warm, delicious guac. These were fantastic. The sweet spice sauce on the shrimp was to die for!

For my main I had the shortrib that came with an INCREDIBLE cauliflower puree. Seriously, I wanted to lick the plate clean from that puree. The shortrib was quite good, a large portion, and packed a lot of flavor.

For the dessert I had the chocolate pot au crème. Simple, but delicious.

All 7 of us that came to check out Bloke & 4th did not have any complains about the food - it was rave reviews all around. I will definitely be back to check out some of the tasting menus they have!"}
{"text":"We made reservations to come here for Winterlicious, but was informed there was an unfortunate incident of their water pipes bursting. Instead they offered us (group of 4) a complimentary dinner. As we all know, nothing in life is FREE. So we figured they'll cap us at the Winterlicious price, which was $45/person and of course alcohol would be extra.

We ordered almost everything (11 dishes incl. 2 desserts) on the menu as it is tapas style. We were really impressed with the food since the supper clubs that I've been to at least have been mediocre. Our fave dishes were the salmon & tuna tartare, braised brisket sliders & pork belly.

Our server, Sam S. was excellent. He was friendly, explained every dish and didn't treat us any less just because our meals were comp'd.

Now I'm not saying all of the above because our experience was complimentary (food, alcohol, right down to coat check - it's true!). The food and service was truly good. However it is on the pricier side. We weren't stupidly full, but was satisfied enough. So expect to pay at least $50/person. I'd only come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is a belated Winterlicious review.

We checked out Bloke & 4th for a ladies dinner on a snowy Thursday evening.  With a 7:30pm reservation, we were seated right away and I was starving so we also ordered quickly as well.  

Appetizers - I chose the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  Main - Port Braised Beef Short Ribs and dessert was the Bourbon Chocolate and Caramel Pie.  We rounded out our dinner orders with two bottles of the Apothic Red wine.

The shrimp appetizer was good, but contained only 3 shrimps (Can there ever be too much shrimp?).  The star of dinner was the beef short rib - very tender and flavourful.  Dessert pie was massive and turned out to be a generous portion which I had to doggie bag as I was stuffed.

Service was friendly and efficient.  I have lowered expectations whenever I do a meal during the 'Licious events.  They were even able to accommodate two people in our party who were almost an hour late and had everyone caught up by dessert.

A good meal in a swanky place that I initially thought would be kind of douchey.  Glad the food and service proved me wrong."}

Attended my sister's birthday at this supper club.  Never heard of it and the experience made sense why.

Service:  Absolutely unacceptable.  We arrive and the hostess was sweet and courteous and sat us down.  We were three of twelve guests that had arrived.  We sat and a fellow filled our glasses with water and  one cup already had water?!? The fellow replace the glass and left us.  Didn't tell us when or who our server was going to be.  We waited for about 15 minutes and no one had offered us a drink menu or again let us know who our server was.  Finally, as the hostess walked by we grabbed her and ask for a server as our first celebratory drink was not even on ice yet. The hostess took our order.  Another five minutes passed and no drinks until our uncomfortable facial expressions drew the bartender to our table with our first order of drinks.  We ask Jonathan, the bartender, who was our server , he then tried to get our server.  The server came over and guess what he told us, \"I am busy with that table over there and will come to you guys when they are done.\"  Reaction:  Appalled.  Its Saturday, get it together and multitask.  Fine, you are busy, shouldn't you offer a drink menu and at least capitalize on the fact there was a birthday dinner going on.  After a free shot and a drink I was a little relaxed.  We should have had at least another three shots for the 30 minute gap between each course.  Dinner was a boring drag.  After the dinner, the changing over to a club started.  They did not make an easy one.  The men whom were moving the tables were rude and rough.  Use words, \"pardon me?\" \"Excuse me?!\"  The service was very poor.  Everyone but the hostess need to check their attitude at the door and walk around with upscale attitude and make the supper some money.  I have only given a one star because the music was fantastic.  

Food:  Starter - mushroom and some cheese.  It was good, but I would had preferred my food hot not my plate.  Main - steak.  Nothing extraordinary, it was the chinese bbq with some burnt jasmine rice.  Dessert - great and such a tease, it was the size of a pea ball.  We were on summerlicious menu and nothing about it would ever make me pay full price.

Ambiance:  the dinner setting was cool, sexy and classy.  The club night was just dark.  There was a girl on a table 'naked' with fruit on her.  Not that original especially when she had black granny panties on.  Don't try it, if you can't execute it.

Price:  not worth the quality of food served.  

Overall Feedback:  our group if twelve really tried to give the place a chance and it was disappointing and sad."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Music is great, food is amazing. The entire staff (owners, bartenders, bottle service girls and security) go out of there way to accommodate you. I will defiantly go back"}
