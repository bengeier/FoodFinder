{"text":"This place is the spot if you looking for a low key good time. The house DJ is always playing the best tunes. Kaitlin the bartender always puts you in a great mood and is snappy with the drinks. The cocktail waitress Coli has a lot of energy and always has a smile on her face. She will bring you back if your feeling down."}
{"text":"When they're good they're great. Service was awesome. Mac n cheese was amazing, my husband liked the brisket, wedge salad was pretty good. They give a free half order of onion rings to first timers. They also had no issue brining samples of the sauces so my husband could decide which he liked. Their North Carolina BBQ was pretty awful though. And we weren't terribly impressed by the spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Dillon's is a small restaurant just off of the west side 101 loop at Thunderbird road.  It is a small place with a bar.  The food is excellent and the service is very friendly and prompt.  Two dishes you need to try are their \"burnt ends\" (don't be confused by the name) and their Southwestern Stew.  The stew is quite inexpensive and very tasty.  Not a huge meal but is sufficient as a meal itself."}
{"text":"I've dined at this Dillon's a dozen times or more, it's a favorite in my family.  I especially like fresh-fried mushrooms; these guys deliver, and add fresh onion rings and fried pickles to boot.  I'm not crazy about the pickles; I prefer hamburger dill slices in the southern style, but these guys deliver on the house made batter.  It's light, crispy, and their ancho dipping sauce is on point.  This is real barbecue, slow-smoked, and pulled by hand; with sauces as garnish.  Choose from sausage, pulled pork, brisket, St. Louis or baby back ribs, or chicken.  Full bar and good margaritas, and not very expensive at all.  Service:  These are among the cutest, most attentive, younger women in the valley.  Allow for a little youth, and be wowed by their dedication.  Love this place."}
{"text":"As far as Sun City goes, this place fits in. Not a whole lot of good places to eat. It's \"not bad\" but it definitely isn't somewhere I would eat by choice. Thought I would go simple on my first visit and get the Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was dry. Like really dry. Like I could make it better and I barely know how to cook. In addition, the restaurant smells. They have carpet and you can just smell all the food and beverages that have been spilled and soaked into the floor. I would recommend driving up to Bell Road and finding something there."}
{"text":"Food was great. Host staff was great. Server was too anxious to go home. Texting and side work was more important than serving our table. Overall was good though."}
{"text":"Brisket and ribs are tasty. Slow to get meals out. Prices are bit high for quality. Didn't like the pulled pork. Too dry. Sides were good."}
{"text":"I took my husband,a day early for Father's Day and my husband is big man and loves his ribs so went check this place out.He got Brontosaurus ribs meal and I got country fried steak ,kids got cheeseburger meal are very huge portions and really good. We added spicy BBQ sauce ribs were excellent! Love the atmosphere, great service and friendly staff Victor our waiter very helpful and made us feel welcome. Kids love the window by back they have little area of rabbits the kids were entertained. By far the best bbq I ever had! Service was amazing, food was amazing, coming back tomorrow to try something else on the menu! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"2 lunches here so far and very happy both times! Great service and very good food!  I have had the Brisket Sandwich both times, but with different sauce. Sweet Heat and Cajun BBQ! The only thing I can criticize a bit is the bun. I feel like they could use something a bit thicker to withstand the moist meat covered in BBQ sauce.  The Cole-Slaw is great too! A place I will go to more, and look forward to trying more of their menu. Very curious about their Fish and Burgers."}
{"text":"Very confused as to why the reviews seem to be all over the board here. We have been here many times and the BBQ food is the best in the valley and at least at this location it is very consisent.   Great spareribs, good baby backs, decent brisket although it has an overall tendency sometimes to be a bit dry/overcooked. Sauces are great!  BBQ beans side is very good, rich and has a fair amount of beef in it too. Cole slaw is good, although sometimes I have noticed it needed to be marinated a tad bit more. Even their sandwiches tend to be very good, big portions, great flavors, although a bit pricy.   Service at this location is very good also. Servers are pleasant, attentive, and seem happy to work here.   If someone thinks overall there is a better BBQ restaurant company in the valley, then I would like to know where it is, because Dillon's is very, very, good."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order for my first try here.  The are reasonably priced take out by the pound, but actually ended up getting my order wrong (even though it was correct on my receipt).  Because of this I only got to try the brisket, which I have to give 2 stars.  At a solid BBQ place, the brisket should be easy to eat and smokey good.  The issue here is that it was neither.  You have to cover the brisket in sauce to give it a good taste and on top of that it was hard and chewy.  Seems like in Sun City it would at least be critical to have meat that isn't hard, my grandmother really couldn't eat it as it was too hard to chew up.  I ended up cutting it up into small pieces to freeze and save for a stew or something at a later date."}
{"text":"I was so genuinely happy with my last visit to this location !! I had the turkey sandwich on toast and it is always so delicious (especially with a side of the hot sauce ) and a side of Mac n cheese , which is always my favorite side. With the good food came great service from Alissa. She was so sweet and patient and seemed on top of it all! Will be back to this spot many more times !!"}
{"text":"The burger was good. Not spectacular but good. The onion rings and French fries and no taste to them and made me gag. The decor of the dining area looks like a Goodwill came in 15 years ago, decorated and then never old anyone that they needed to dust or update w/the changing times.   Decent, but you could do better"}
{"text":"This used to be a great little barbeque place but those days are gone.  The food is bland and not worth the wait or price.  Servers do the minimum and won't wait around to hear you if you would like to add a side.  Even their onion ring promotions are not as great as they have been, portions are small.  Won't go back after the last time when our server thought she was doing us a favor by showing up.  The menus never left the table and forget about changing an order.  Was there a quota for number of tables filled that day?  Don't know, no longer care."}
{"text":"I hate writing such a poor review but after spending a day (bathroom time) recovering,  I think it's I need to send a warning.  If you're looking for slow service, bad food and a good cleanse, head to Dillons on 87th and Thunderbird.  I had undercooked rubbery fish, my friend had a bland pulled chicken sandwich and deep fried mushrooms that came from a can, (not like the picture).  The temp manager confirmed this!  We waited almost an hour for our lunch, which was crazy considering there where like 8 tables full. This place was once the bomb but, over the years it  has turned from a 5 star to a no star. I'm typically not one to complain but the final insult was the $40.00 bill at the end. Considering both my friend I ended up in the bathroom, I would consider this experience a waist of money, literally!  One last thing, if you want to substitute a side for a salad, it's $1.50 extra. We ordered fish and pulled chicken sandwich, can fried mushrooms, two side salads, a ice tea and lemonade, $40.00. The manager said he wouldn't suggest the chicken and thought the fish didn't look right when it left the kitchen. MMMM?"}
{"text":"Visited Dillon ' s two weeks ago. Hadn't been there in many years. The decor and ambiance improved, but the  food was a disappointment. My husband ordered the full rack of beef ribs. They were tough and seemed undercooked. He had great difficulty in getting them off the bone. $25 for the ribs...a rip-off. The baby back pork ribs were good, and fell off the bone. I would go elsewhere for ribs."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, but my favorites to order are the onion rings & the catfish nuggets. The bar area is the best place to be. Great bartenders & great service."}
{"text":"Went on July 4th. They weren't very busy. The bartender was very busy with something, not us, that was for sure. Had a real need for pork ribs, they were out. Had the combo plate with beef ribs and sausage. The sausage was not even luke warm. The beef ribs were tough, fatty and not very tasty. Another table had a whole rack of the beef ribs. As they were walking out I asked them what they thought of the ribs. They said they complained about them and were not charged. The mac and cheese was very good as was the coleslaw. My experience with Dillon's in the past is their sides are always good and their meats are not so good. They seem to have  a problem with service. The table behind us said he had been there 15 minutes before anyone came to the table. Our sever said that this was her third day. For three days on the job she did good. I was surprised that any restaurant had to add servers in the summer. All of the servers we saw were college age."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Waited a while for food but it was well worth it! Fantastic brisket platter, wedge  salad, BLT, and desserts. Sweet hot BBQ sauce was amazing. Beans were the best i ever had! Everyone enjoyed. Service was friendly and all plates came out as ordered."}
{"text":"They were friendly the food was awesome no complaints.... The onion rings was the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Good place for eating before a Cardinals game.  Ribs are somewhat over cooked and a little dry. Cajun sauce is good. order it on the side. Brisket is great and moist."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork sandwich is the best I have ever had! So bomb! And the spicy BBQ sauce is delish! I would recommend this place. The appearance of the restaurant could use some work but it wouldn't stop me from going!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is great and Eileen makes the environment super fun!  We go here for happy hours, family dinner and nights out!  Highly recommended for all sorts of entertainment."}
{"text":"There are few instances embedded in my memory where the food was so terrible that it was worth mentioning.  This place should take the BBQ part of their sign down.  They are not worthy!    I got the pick three with:   Burnt ends(dry and barely fit for dog food),   Turkey(tasted like a horrible thanksgiving bird or just thick sliced lunch meat.  Who serves BBQ with gravy for God's sake?)  Brisket(This is probably the same meat they serve on the roast beef subs at subway, only thicker sliced.  No smokey flavor whatsoever.)  The three sauces offered were either bitter, sweet, or bittersweet.  On a great positive, the sides that myself and my lovely companion enjoyed are most likely available at any Walmart deli, or the aisle with Bush's baked beans.  No, seriously,  the onion rings were amazing.  Good for one appetizer, happy hour drinks and get the hell out!  The server was awesome, and the manager tried to take care of me earlier in the meal.  I'm just not the type to make a scene in public over food.  When I did mention that the brisket and turkey were like lunch meat with no smokey flavor, I was told that they cater to an older clientele and can't add much smoke flavor."}
{"text":"George loved your BBQ sauces & onion rings  Holly in San Diego Synergy World"}
{"text":"Like anyone else I appreciate locally owned and operated places, and I wish Dillons all the success in the world (I found their service both friendly and fast), but seriously, this BBQ sucks.   I had pork spare ribs and brisket because these are the two most difficult cuts to get right. Texturally, the brisket was fine, if a bit dry. The ribs were underdone (the bones did not come clean as they should when properly prepared, and they were tough because of this). The ribs and the brisket both had only the slightest hint of smoke flavor... they were seriously undersmoked.   To top it off, their sauces (mild and \"cajun\" - which is not hot at all, though I suspect they cater to the Sun City palate) were both savory sauces dominated by the flavor of mustard and vinegar. How anybody can judge either of these sauces delicious is a mystery to me. I found them both horrible.   One bite of each meat was all I could manage.   Sides were a mixed bag. The mac and cheese was delicious (thank you, thank you!) - but the baked beans were chili beans and were... gross. I suspect they were made using the sauce, so it's not terribly surprising I didn't like them. I had their chicken wings as an appetizer, they were pretty good. They are prepared like fried chicken and come with the sauce on the side. It was agreeably hot and delicious... but then again, it wasn't BBQ."}
{"text":"People who like this place have got to be kidding me! The brisket and ribs were dry and tasteless. They try and hide this fact by covering it up with sauce (the sauce is pretty good) but you can't rely on sauce to cover up the fact that your meat is terrible! I should have known I was in trouble when I walked in and smelled bleach, not barbecue. The service was not very good either. I told the waitress about the tasteless food and she just offered me more tasteless food. Had she at least offered to take it off my bill I would have felt slightly better about the experience. Seriously, try the food without the sauce, you will be unpleasantly shocked!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Dillion's through my parents who said it was really good. Then, randomly, three days later, Groupon had a great deal for Dillion's, so I purchased it and used the coupon at this Tbird location.   I got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and it was pretty good. The mac and cheese isn't good at all and overall, the I just wasn't impressed with the place.  I just went back last night and I got the hamburger and fries, and it was again unimpressive.  I have given this place 2 opportunities to make me a customer, but they have failed twice.  Just on a side note: The service isn't bad, the food just doesn't do it for me.  I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Cold beer. Friendly staff and locals. Definitely try the onion rings! I always go in the bar area instead of the restaurant. The bartenders will take great care of you! They usually have live music in the bar on Friday nights. They also have specials during NFL games. I love the smoked turkey platter. If you're unsure of what to try, you can get the sliders and pick three meats and BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I'm from Kansas City, so I know barbeque.  The bbq isn't really very good.  The sandwiches are pretty good, though.  The restaurant also seems rather loud and small."}
{"text":"It's sad to have to give this place a bad review because for a few years we enjoyed it very much. This was me and my fiancé favorite little place to go. Right by our home, beer was always cold and food was great. Until one day we popped into the establishment during the weekend to meet some friends for lunch. We were first to arrive so we grabbed a table in the bar and the waitress came up very sweet and we ordered two beers she asked for our IDs sure no problem! So we hand them to her and she said thank you and ill being those right out! Ya... 15 min later no drinks and mind you it was not busy. Then a lady with dark brown curly hair walks up to our table and literally says \" I need to see your IDs please\" not a hey I'm the manager anything. So a bit taken back we handed our IDs over again! She then proceeded to walk away yes! She walked away with OUR IDs in her hand. We sat that for 20 more minutes still no beer not even a glass of water! Then she comes back to tell my fiancé that his ID was fake.... He is 25 years old. Nothing about his ID looked fake I worked myself in a bar and am certified for selling alcohol and I know what they teach you to ID fake cards. She then proceeded to tell us to leave. Not saying we can give you food but we can give you the beer. By this time me and my fiancé were in shock and angry a place we have been visiting for so long and have been very loyal customers to. So my fiancé told her 1) we are leaving this establishment but we attend to contact management 2) she should of never walked away with our IDs and left us sitting there for a Half hour 3) she needed to watch her attitude with especially for being a manager. She gave attitude to my fiancé before he ever became upset. We left this establishment that day and went to another Mexican food restaurant and order a beer again, we proceeded to ask our waiter there if he thinks my fiancées ID was fake. He threw his head back and laughed and said \" who would think this is fake? \". YUP! So end the story we did call management spoke to a GM did the whole deal. We went back in again with a new ID I had my fiancé get and this manager was still there. Then came to my table and proceeded to tell us \" Glad you got a new ID However you had a very bad attitude \" and she expected us to apologize to her and told us her hostess said that my fiancé was in her class in High school and that's why she didn't serve us. So needless to say GM and owner I believe said it would be taken care of obviously it wasn't. I even tried writing them again and was ignored. I understand being a manager of a restaurant/ bar her behavior was completely out of line. So food is great however staff not so much."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with friends and family. Sat on the patio because this is az in the winter and the weather is the best in the country.  Patio was smaller with no tv's or true upgrades.   Had to go inside to get my own menus. Friend had to go inside to get kids menus and crayons. After about 10 minutes we got to order a drink. Could be happier with the service.   Ordered a pulled pork sandwich with Cajun BBQ sauce and steak fries. Sandwich was actually pretty good and the sauce was also good. Some of my fries were cold which was odd and left me unsatisfied again.   There was nothing about this visit or this location that could justify a higher rating. I have been to other locations and had better experiences.   Maybe it's just this one?"}
{"text":"I promised my carnivorous 10 year old son some BBQ Ribs, and he wasn't letting me off the hook until he got some.  So we ventured over to Dillion' s on Saturday afternoon, since one of my favorite meals is Pulled Pork, and Dillon's was right down the street.    We only had to wait a few minutes and got a table right away.  The atmosphere is understated... not really a place to bring your first date as there is no romantic ambiance here, just rolls of paper towels on each table for those truly dedicated to making a mess.  If you come here, it's for the food.  And it's worth coming here for the food.  I love BBQ, and this is one of the best I have found in Phoenix so far.  My son commented that they had some of the best ribs he had ever eaten (and he's tried a lot). I also noticed that you could buy the pulled pork, chicken, or brisket by the pound to go... already thinking about it for the first week of football.  If you are on the west side and hankering for some BBQ, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Try the new deep fried green beans...YUM! And for the best ever service-with-a-smile, enjoy them with a cold beer at the bar. Kaitlin took excellent care of us!!! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service, and Servers could not be any better.Kaitlin is such a pleasure, and her personality lights up the room. Always attentive, and goes above and beyond.."}
{"text":"My experience is limited to dining in the bar area, usually around 7-830 pm on Friday or Saturday. The food is great and you will leave satisfied. The pulls pork sandwich is my favorite, juicy and flavorful. You can pick your sauce to top it off with. The homemade style Mac and cheese is good. I felt as if I was at my grandmothers eating a hearty meal  The beer selection is poor, consisting of your typical bud light draft with a San tan beer or four peaks thrown in. Nothing out of the ordinary. What the bar does offer is live music on Fridays with no cover."}
{"text":"Our family has been eating at Dillons for generations and enjoying their excellent BBQ and wings. Jeffrey is our server and he always makes  sure we are well taken care of.  If you get seated near the back window you can see the bunnies and the desert tortoise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and a break from driving. Good food, cold beer, good prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I can't say I had the best experience. The service at dinner was excellent but it took 10 min to get a table (and there wasn't a wait). Beer selection is poor. Food was good but not great. Atmosphere (in the dining area) was so-so. Dated."}
{"text":"This was by far the most disappointing restaurant experience, my wife and I had in a very long time. Her pulled chicken sandwich was just passable. However, my brisket sandwich was absolutely the worse, I ever had. The meat was cold, dry and old. That was switched out for a pulled pork sandwich. That proved even worse. NEVER AGAIN, will we go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good if you stick to the BBQ and remember that chili here has chunks of beef. Coming from New York it's different. Their ribs are really tasty as are the beans. Not a fan of their catfish as it has too much breading/batter, however the batter on the onion rings are quite tasty."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time and got the beef brisket platter with Mac and cheese and baked beans and it was AMAZING!! our waiter was also amazing!he had several tables but was still Very attentive and quick! The food was delicious and the customer service was great! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is definitely a comfort food kind of place. Not dressy - and people watching is a must. Mostly families and older. I get the feeling that most were regulars in the neighborhood.  A live band was playing on Saturday night when we went  (oldies).  To start, we had the onion rings, which were awesome. I had baby back ribs, with spicy hot bbq - really great. Plenty of sides, green beans and mashed potatoes. Not something I'd regularly eat - but it was really good! My hubby had a brisket sandwich with steak fries and beans. He loved it.  Our waiter was awesome, I think his name was Austin. There's a also a cute Bunny hutch out back that you can see while you are eating. I love animals, so I thought it was a cute touch. Relieved that they didn't have rabbit on the menu tho!"}
{"text":"We went there the other night for the second time. I don't remember our first time so we figured we'd give them another try. I was craving BBQ ribs. But again, I was disappointed. I asked for ribs that fall off the bones and our very sweet server said to do the baby back ribs. And I did. And it felt like I needed a chainsaw to cut the meat off the bones.  I know there has to be a place that has ribs that just falls off the bone by looking at it. My husband got the prime rib dinner. He said for the price that it was (even for the small one) it wasn't worth it. PS Don't let the pictures fool you. Looks better than it is lol. Not sure what to get at this place, but definitely not ribs."}
{"text":"It has been at a few years sense I last ate there.  I loved their catfish and prim rib.  They have focused in on BBQ.  I am not a fan of St. Louis ribs, it would be unfair for me to write a review on them.    Their wait staff was 4.5 star, the onion rigs were crispy and not at all greasy, but they fell short of the best I have had at a Florida neighborhood Fish Camp (not a camp at all, a fish restaurant).   The beef brisket had good flavor and dry.  The sauce, I had on the side was quite good.   In St. Louis style the sauce please a big part, in Texas it is all about the smoke, then the dry rub playing as a supporting roll.  The BBQ sauce is more of an after thought.  Lastly the asparagus was perfect for me.  Sadly by the time I got to them they were cold, my fault. Forget about the apple pie, I hope they didn't make it.the ice cream was just ice cream.     I would have given then  2 stars but the atmosphere and wait strafe I had to give them a higher rating.   I wish I could give them higher for past meals, we are here today, that is what I am reviewing.   I will eat there agai"}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner at Dillon's and two were happy with their meals. I probably should not have ordered a burger at a BBQ place but the special of the day \"Casey burger\" sounded good.  Ordered it \"medium\" in but it was hard and dry, just like the bun and burnt bacon. Onion rings were included and quite underwhelming. They were probably frozen, not homemade.  It was 4pm and quiet but the server never reappeared nor asked how we liked our meal.  Improvement needed in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have dinned at Dillon's many times already.  Overall, it's not bad, but definitely not the best in town.  The service is great but the quality of the food can be a bit inconsistent.  Towards the end, I prefer to order in pints and make it to-go, I think you get more meat per dollar that way.  Otherwise, service is great and I wouldn't mind eating at the restaurant.  I live around the area so if I am craving for some decent BBQ but not willing to drive more than 10 minutes, then here is what I would get from Dillon's:  Pork rib - This is probably one of their best BBQ meat, in my opinion of course.  Sausage - It's okay...it's really just okay.  Even Angry Crab has better sausage than this place but I wouldn't mind order it if I am already at Dillon's.   VEGGIE OF THE DAY - Let me put it this way, if they happen to serve stir-fried green beans with bacon and onion EVERYDAY, then I am more than happy to raise 1 more star on this review and go there twice as often.   On the flip side- the things I would consider avoid -   Beef rib - I have a picture here.  I know it looks tasty but I would stay away from it.  It's always kind of dried.  Pull Pork - This one is a hit and miss so I finally decide to avoid it.  Once a while it gets very wastery so it ruins the taste.  But when it's done right, then it's fine.  Just avoid it."}
{"text":"I am not a bbq fan by any stretch of the means but I LOVE the burnt tips here!  The service is ALWAYS on point and the portions are perfect!  We don't get to eat here as often as we would like because it is a little pricey but it allows us to look forward to it.  My wife is more adventurous and has tried several other dishes but I stick to the tips."}
{"text":"Cafeteria food at restaurant prices?  Gimme a break!  The food was never great here but it's only gotten worse.  If I were to write everything that's wrong with this place I'd be typing all night.  Save your stomach the pain and don't stop here.  It's been awhile since I left a place actually pissed off, but I am tonight.  Food tasted exactly like the carpet looks, dated and gross.  Shut the doors and stop ripping people off of their hard earned money."}
{"text":"Ordered the baby backs, we're over cooked on the edges inedible asked for extra bbq sauce came out with little cup of sauce like it was the most expensive sauce ever and didn't want to give it away waitress Katie never came back to ask if everything was ok or I would have showed her the over cooked parts but she was overwhelmed running the bar the side items were huge though that's the only reason I would give this place 2 stars for the money I would rather go to famous Dave's they give you all the sauce you want plus some bbq chips at the bar while you wait for your meal"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch.  we arrived at 11am we were seated right away.  Then     two employees came  to the pen outside and to our surprise started cleaning the poop out of the pen.  To some people this might be ok but to me and my friend it was so discusting.  We told our waiter and he said he would tell manager.  Manager never came by our table to address issue Now our waiter was awsome but the food is going down hill.   Last visit and this visit the food has been awful.  We both had the chicken fried chicken and both had soggy crust.  I sent mine back and when brought new one it was nice and crisp.  The coleslaw had no flavor, even when I added pepper and hot sauce.  My friend had mashed potatoes and they were cold.  We woukd have left after the poop incident but I had to use groupon before expiration.    I will not be back and the other groupon I will turn in for credit.   Too many other restaurants choices to visit."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday after church and it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was nice she told us the specials. We got the sweet and spicy wings which are to die for. I got the bbq brisket sandwich with sweet hot cause on the side. I like that the brisket has no sauce on it because I like to dip and I just loved the sandwich. For dessert we got the Apple cinnamon dumpling and there was not one thing we left behind. I love the food at Dillons and I will always come back no matter what people say. Its amazing here"}
{"text":"Husband's choice: Brontasaurus Beef Ribs Platter - A full rack of beef ribs with bbq beans and steak fries. Delicious and enough two (or 3 with an extra side) to easily share.  My friend's choice: Bbq Brisket platter with mac and cheese and bbq beans. The brisket was velvety and tender and melted in your mouth.   My choice: BBQ Pulled Pork with a baked porato covered in bbq sauce and the veggie of the day (green beans). I also added a house salad.I chose to have all 3 bbq sauces on the side and loved them all. The bread would have been better if it was warmed and the green beans were a little too cooked for  me, but it was still overall a great dish.   The salad came out quickly and comes with croutons, egg and bacon. I wish there was a Fat Free salad dressing option, but at least they gad low cal Italian. The salad was huge and very good.  After a normal wait, our meals arrived and were promptly devoured (except for the monstrous ribs).  I could barely walk I was so stuffed!"}
{"text":"The place was decent and so was the food.  I especially liked the potato salad as a side dish."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving a few stars is because the food was good. Joseph H was our server and not to be rude but it was the worst service I've experienced in a long time. Not only did someone else come refill our drinks, we all got our food except our 4 year old. 10 minutes after she still didn't have food, we asked him to check on it for us and a few minutes later he nonchalantly comes back and says \"we're out of the shark bites\". No sorry, didn't ask if he could get her something else, nothing. So as we're almost all done with our food, our daughter finally gets some chicken fingers. Again no apologies or anything. While the food was decent, probably wouldn't return just because of how slow and bad the service was."}
{"text":"tonite had first bad meal here. was with 90 yr old motherinlaw so did not say anything cuz she gets so flustered and thinks anything untoward is her fault somehow. been here plenty and usually very good food across the board. beware the chicken fried steak if the breading could not save it there is a problem, and there was an overabundance of breading on a stringy unchewable hunk of steak. just pushed it around and hid it under gravy so mom didn't notice. little blip hopefully just one bad day and not a sign of things to come, cuz dillon's is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Really good KC barbecue and prime rib love the $3.00 onion rings I had the 12 oz cut my daughter  the 3 item platter with sauce on the side service was fair used entertainment book coupon."}
{"text":"My first and last visit to Dillon's Thunderbird -- since we are not big meat-eaters, we both ordered tilapia.  I ordered the grilled tilapia w/potato salad and broccoli.  My husband ordered the blackened  w/baked potato and broccoli.    Oddly enough, the grilled tilapia was much more highly seasoned than the blackened and very salty.  I left half on my plate.    The potato salad was a disappointing blob of dressing/sour cream with another heavy dose of salt.  Neither one of us could eat it. The fish WAS cooked nicely in terms of done-ness - just couldn't handle the salty and peppery overdose.    Guess what was good? The broccoli!  Great job on the broccoli - but I didn't pay for a few spears of veggies!   Maybe I will try a different Dillon's."}
{"text":"What happened to the chicken fried steak??? It is off the menu and that's why we go to Dillions.  So I guess bye bye"}
{"text":"After reading all the bad reviews. And having most of them validated by a employee... Thanks for saving me the waste of time and money. I am not 90 and don't want my food cooked like that either. But the cater to the area residents. so what can u say..."}
{"text":"Brisket and tortoise? Well you can only eat the brisket, but the tortoise was getting his own meal on in the backyard with the female. That was the post meal show, along with rabbits and birds hanging out in the skinny backyard. Our seats were not window seats, but those would be the best place to sit to eat and watch the show.     Nothing to complain about at my debut here in this BBQ mecca. The brisket is incredibly lean and presented in a pretty circular fashion on the bun. There is no real smoke ring or bark on the brisket, but it is still great tasting and only needs a smattering of sauce. The other meat we tried was the turkey and those were lean and thicker sliced and also tender and tasty. Most sandwiches were about $10.50, but some other prices are a bit high with combo platters at almost 20 bucks and 1/2 rack at the same price. Ouch. Side dish that stood out was the mac and cheese and both sauces we tried were great with the Cajun nipping out the regular as my favorite."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the fish tacos! Our guest had Salmon and my husband had chicken fried steak. All was great, staff attentive and helpful! Overall one of our favorite places to go and eat especially with guests."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times.  In the past it has been fairly decent, but when I went yesterday it was awful.  I went with my dad and one of his work associates who was visiting from out of town.  I was really embarrassed.  The plastic table cloth was completely stained and disgusting.  I didn't want to touch it.  I took a quick glance at the other tables and they all looked the same way.  Eww.  They had a special on onion rings and those were pretty tasty.  I'd score the food a 3 (I had the pulled pork sandwich and they must have put the meat in a bowl and then dumped it on the bun because it stayed in the shape of the bowl and looked like a giant serving of cat food.  That could easily be fixed.  And no one felt like they got enough BBQ sauce, and c'mon!  it is a BBQ restaurant! Someone in our party got a salad and it was garnished with canned peaches.  Looked gross.)  The place had an aura of an assisted living cafeteria.  No thanks.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this Dillions on a few occasions.  The service is always average and so is the food.  Last time I ordered wings and the Devil sandwich.  The wings are money.  Nice and crisp with a bowl of red hot sauce to dip them in.  The Devil sandwich was whack.  Some pulled pork with the SAME red hot sauce that came with the wings.  A guy can only eat so much Franks red hot sauce at one meal.  I must have misunderstood.  I thought it was some type of homemade hot bbq sauce.  I must have been thinking of Devil's spit from Famous Daves...speaking of famous daves I think next time I want bbq I will go there.  Dillons is just ok for me.  My wife had the catfish and liked it.  She also loved her potato salad.  My bbq beans were pretty tasty I must say.  I would say thumbs up to the wings and sides and just a meh to the rest.    The inside was extremely loud from the drunks in the karaoke bar next to us.  Not sure how they can be that drunk already seems how it wasn't even 7 pm yet.  Between the loud horrible singing and the fly that wouldn't leave our table the experience wasn't enjoyable.  Had I known it was that kind of a bbq I probably wouldn't have taken my one year old.  Guess you have to make money where you can and the bar was packed.  We just ate quickly and got out of there before the country songs came on."}
{"text":"Well the thing that made me not want to come back the most was our terrible waitress. It took 5 minutes to get greeted and asked for our drinks. By that time I had figured out what I wanted to eat. So we order our drinks and say that we will be ready to order in a few minutes to give her time to get our drinks. It took another 5 minutes to get our drinks. She drops them off and then leaves right away to take another tables order. Then 5 minutes later she comes and takes our order. The food comes very fast and it tasted good. So she brings us out a little tiny cup of catsup,  my fiance asks the waitress for more catsup. I wait 5 minutes and walk to the kitchen area and ask for the manager and catsup. The manager comes and says she is sorry and what the problem was I said crappy service. So she gave us 3 five dollar coupons for next time. I dont think there ever will be a next time. Our bill came out to 30.00 for a brisket sand which, and a burger and one tea. Definitely not worth the price that we paid."}
{"text":"Me and my family walked in and was greeted with a warm welcome. We went on a Thursday evening. It was not that busy and our wait was twenty minutes. I would say the decor was out of date. They seriously need a restaurant makeover. We finally got seated.  Our server, Miss Corona was great. She seemed tired, but still served us with genuine effort. Out party was of seven, and she got all of our orders right. She was not rude at all and did not pout when we asked for several things.  I ordered the beef brisket platter with a loaded potato and wedge salad for my side. My brisket was kind of dry. My loaded potato was delicious. The wedge salad was tasty. Overall, decent food.   After a good hour, our meal came to an end. She dropped off the check with no rush. We left the place, still being treated with good customer service all the way out the door.   Overall, Dillons BBQ was a cozy family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty disapointed.  Had high hopes.  Was looking forward to getting the burnt ends.  We started off with order of onion rings and spinach and artichoke dip.  Both unimpressive.  Burnt ends were just chopped brisket plopped on plate with sauce dumped on top.  Where's the love.   Make an effort.  Ordered the sausage which was more like a hot dog in bbq sauce.  Yuck.  The brisket was the best thing at our table.  Mac n cheese creamy and comforting but tasteless.  Steak fries were good.  Cinnamon butter interesting but the roll was not.  Service/waitress was pretty good.  Coolest part was the large turtle or tortoise right outside our window.  Hope it was just a bad night in the kitchen, just sorry I paid for it with my family.  Oh well still searching for good bbq in west valley."}
{"text":"I've been here twice both times were Fridays. We love listening to live music and they have it here on the weekends which is a plus for us. The bartenders are very friendly and attentive. I've only had the burnt ends and wings there and both were spot on and real tasty. And of course nice cold beers.  Another plus is you get yelp money here too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start. With the loud obnoxious drunk at the end of the bar at 330 in the afternoon?  (Who as it turns out, works there. Well. At least that's what he told everyone at the bar and the restaurant.). Seriously. At one point, he was literally barking. Like a dog. And I'm not kidding. The guy stepped out for a smoke and almost nosedived right by my table. And when he left all I could think was \"I hope he's not driving...\"). Or should I start with the food. Ok in a second. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention what a dive this place is. And I don't mind dives, but this place was \"restaurant rescue\" needing kind of dive.   Ok. Lifted kilt. Not bad  Food:  I got the combo with \"smoked\" turkey and \"burnt ends\", cole slaw and a baked potato (they don't have chives?). The \"burnt ends\". Ugh. More like flavorless cubed up pot roast. They obviously don't know what burnt ends really are. The \"smoked\" turkey. A little better but not smoked as far as I could tell. (No smoke rings). The \"sweet & hot\" bbq sauce is the only saving grace. The cole slaw. Super bland. Basically, cabbage and maybe mayo?  The baked potato with butter and sour cream. How do you mess that up?  You microwave it, that's how. I got a dinner roll. It didn't taste house made. Maybe store bought.    The service:  when the server paid attention to me, she was super nice. In fact I feel a little bad about writing such a negative review, but this has very little to do with her. Sorry, \"C\".   It looks like this is really just a beer joint that happens to serve food. There were probably 20-25 people in there and I only counted 6 ladies. So...    I tried to connect to the wifi but I couldn't get it to work.   That plate plus the one beer and a nice tip for the server set me back 30 bucks.   Maybe the overall experience would have been better on the restaurant side rather than in the bar area. But I'll end by saying I'm still looking for a good bbq place on the west side."}
{"text":"Best onion rings ever!  Steak was very good too - but try the onion rings you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Just went to Dillon's again yesterday. It's not somewhere you go for ambience . . . Or amazing service, not that our servers have been horrible ever, just busy. Dillon's doesn't even have best menu nor is everything spectacular. Why go then? They're Pulled Pork Sandwich is ridiculous delicious!  I've tried many other things on their menu: the Smoked Salmon, the Southwest Mac n Cheese, the smoked Chicken, the Pulled Chicken Sandwich, the list goes on. None were ever bad. Most seem to lack something whether it was a little more flavor or more moisture in the meat. But their BBQ sauce and their Pulled Pork is off the hook!  If you haven't been there, try that first.  This particular location is a little cooky.They need a remodel. The carpet is something you'd find in a JB's (Are they even around anymore?) or a Coco's. the tables have those wipeable tablecloths which I guess is a little more barbecue-esque. Some tables have these ads all over them which I guess is not really a big deal since it draws your attention away from the mismatched lighting, carpet, and tablecloths. The back windows show a tiny yard for birds which is fenced in so you don't have to look at the parking lot of the body shop next door. They do put the paper towels on the table for cleaning up all the BBQ sauce on your fingers which adds to its authenticity.  Service there is usually so-so. Servers are friendly, hospitable, but often busy. Sometimes it's hard to get a timely refill or an extra side of BBQ sauce. Other than that, adequate.  I'll be back and you know what for."}
{"text":"We went to Dillon's last night for a late lunch. Although my meal wasn't bad, my wife ordered the chicken fried chicken. When it came, it was fish and not chicken. The first waitperson came back and said it was really chicken, and another person said that it was in the cooker next to the fish and that is why it smelled like that. Our waitress did not try to deny that what she got was fish and not chicken. They offered to replace the dish, but we find it disturbing that two members of the waitstaff were unwilling to take our word for it when my wife said it was fish. The rest of my wife's meal had almost no flavor to it. The potato salad was good, but the french fries weren't fresh the first time and the second time they weren't cooked."}
{"text":"Great place, great service.    Been here a few times and I have a few groupons for Dillons.  This visit we ordered a full rack and a full rack of brontosaurus ribs!  See the pic i posted.    Food was great, not the best pork ribs, but the best beef ribs I have had.  couple that with great line up from the bar, live music and 99 cent great O rings...  I am a fan of Dillons.   Other dishes that I love, burnt ends, SW Stew."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a terrific brisket sandwich and some Cole Slaw today for lunch at this restaurant. The price was fair, the food was good and the service was friendly. They have a decent menu and the atmosphere is clean and casual. I would recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Not sure who is writing these reviews.  I've been here before, it was crap then and I was hoping for a change in quality since they have been opening multiple new locations.  I was terribly wrong.  I tried so hard to find something good by trying multiple items on the menu.  At their price point, this stuff should knock your socks off, not gag you.  Smoked chicken...not even brined, terrible. Smoked turkey...same thing, blah. Smoked sausage....ballpark hot dog equivalent, seriously disappointing. Smoked brisket.....IT WAS GRAY and DEAD. Baby back ribs...decent but and tender, smoke flavor seemed odd.   Mashed potatoes...cover in gravy, edible.  The national BBQ association should rally and petition to close this place down.  I think they get away with it because most of their patrons are over 70 with a bland flavor palette.  Then again you can try to cover up the disappointment with their sauce.  Service was so so.  Brought out the meal in rounds, so not everyone got food at the same time.  Decor is dated to the 90s.  Feels like you are eating in a retirement home or one of those old Luby's Cafeterias.  Stick to Naked BBQ or equivalent."}
{"text":"Epic failure on my part when it comes to grilling ribs. After two failed attempts at fixing ribs this month and disappointing the kids, I ordered take-out from Dillon's on Thunderbird. I called on the phone. It was ready in 15 minutes.   The hosts were fantastic gals. They even checked my meal with me to make sure that I got the right order. However, I did have to come back to pick up my drinks, but they caught that I left my credit card so that makes us even.  2 kids meals for $17 and change. The meals came with 4 ribs, choice of barbecue sauce (mild, Cajun or spicy), Smiley Face fries and a small drink. When I got home, the kids were happy, and mom felt like a winner. Thanks, Dillon's BBQ!  p/s I was impressed that they had plenty of handicapped parking. They also had a nice curbside parking area. Cute decor, but it cannot beat the Wildlife Dillon's where you can dine with the sharks."}
{"text":"I think I just had the best pulled pork sandwich ever. Reasonably priced, flavor so good I had to write a review. Wow"}
{"text":"Had 2 people say this was a great place.  Went with high expectations and left with mediocre satisfaction.  The Pumpkin beer was great and the service even better.  I ordered the pulled pork with baked potato & baked beans.  Could not eat the beans because of the spicy off taste.  How can you mess up baked beans?  The potato was alright, but the pulled pork was dry and not so tasty.  In my book, the pork and the bbq sauce needed to be together, not separate.  If friends  want to come here, I will, but it won't be my choice.  As for price $20 for a beer and pulled pork is OK, if the quality & quantity are there.  In fairness, others will have a different opinion."}
{"text":"I love this place, the bartender Stephanie is awesome! never had a bad meal or service here. also great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Came here recently and couldn't have been happier with my experience! I had the pulled pork plate with Mac and cheese and French fries - all so good! But the best part of dinner was our awesome server, Alyssa. My mom is super picky and asks a million questions but Alyssa was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and answered every question she asked. Being a server for the past five years, I can definitely recognize great service when I see it! Looking forward to coming back when the live band is there!"}
{"text":"After seven years or more, we were in the area and decided to take my brother to check out AZ barbecue.   There is a problem with long delays between meals. It is still a decent place to eat but we remember it as better. My wife's 50/50 ribs were good but the ribs were low on meat.  I had a two meat combo: sausage and beef brisket.  The barbecue sauce was good. The beans, ok, and the cole slaw average.  The beer selection is much better.  We enjoyed Deschutes Fresh Hop IPA.   I wouldn't avoid this place but won't go out of my way.  I did hear back from someone in management after a couple of weeks. I appreciate the response. The suggestion regarding rib quality was that we  contact the manager but we aren't the customers that make an issue of everything.  Before my father-in-law passed away in 2009, we were here several times each year.  We liked the place.  There seems to be an issue but when we return (and we will) we hope it will be better."}
{"text":"Tip: pay the extra $1.00 to get the side of onions rings instead of the appetizer portion...the individual side portion is generous and at a dollar how can you go wrong?  I tried the spinach enchiladas with chips and salsa.  I was hoping to be wowed and unfortunately wasn't.  I mean what was I thinking, a vegetarian in a BBQ establishment?  I found solace in that fact that even though Dillion's is known for their BBQ there were a variety of options for vegetarians.  Next time I will try the Prickly Peach Salad oh and the fried pickles.  With that said the rest of my party raved about the pork pulled sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Always have good service when I come here. Decided to take my kids to sit down instead of do take out. Love that they have Rabbits outside that you can view from your table. My son absolutely loved that. The service started out slow on my visit Monday 12/18 so another server Jeff came over since he recognized that I was sitting there waiting. ( I also used to work at the dillons in sun city grand with Jeff before it closed). We have had him serve us plenty of times and he is one of the best. Anyways, he quickly took the kids food order so that they could eat something since my baby was getting fussy. Our originally server came back to our table a couple of minutes later. She kept apologizing and explained she had a emergency with the babysitter so being a mom of 2 i completely understood.  She was on top of her game the entire time and made up for the delay in getting our food in. My son loved talking to her too. Jeff still came by a couple times to make sure everything was good. Love how attentive everyone was and the food was delicious like always."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Came in on this Sunday for simple apps and drinks, apparently the waitress didn't hear our order, maybe should listen instead of socializing with people at the bar, onion rings cooked on the fly, horrible, undercooked. We ate them....that's what we came for. Now, we were not charged for the rings, thank goodness. Service was defensive and not good."}
{"text":"Great fried pickles. Typical BBQ. Service is sketchy @ times. I feel like this place needs a remodel. It's strangely set up & no real server ever took care of us. We had 3 different waiting staff come to our table. Just a lot going on here...."}
{"text":"I am still not a Dillon's fan, the food was average, but a bit overpriced for what you get. Tried to split the bill and it got screwed up so bad we had to make several phone calls to get it back, they charged both cards the full amount. Service was good, but overall just an average place to eat. But the best thing about it is the onion rings, cant go wrong with them."}
{"text":"We visited in the mid afternoon for dinner on yesterday (Thursday).  They were already out of \"Burnt Ends\" but that sometimes happens and is not a negative, just an observation.  We both had brisket. It was very lean the way it should be but, the meat was barely warm. Fortunately the BBQ sauce was heated so the sauce warmed up the meat.  The baked potato was cool in the middle and the dinner roll was tasteless. No other bread options exist.  The service was great!  I wish I had better things to say. I love BBQ and I left hungry. When we got home, I snacked from the fridge."}
{"text":"Since we moved here I've heard so many people talk about Dillon's & their onion rings. We finally bit the bullet & headed over there. I was surprised with how large it was inside. We were seated right away & started with their onion rings which are only $2. They were AMAZING! The breading was light & crispy without being overly greasy. I ordered the brisket plate with mac & cheese & mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  My mom ordered the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes & cole slaw. My brisket was very flavorful but pretty dry, the BBQ sauce was definitely needed. Mac & cheese was decent & the mashed was really good, I would just go for cream gravy instead of brown next time. The real superstar was the chicken fried chicken.  This is usually my go-to meal anytime a place has it, I literally search out chicken fried chicken when I go places. This was probably one of the best I have had. The batter was so crispy, just like the onion rings, the chicken was incredibly juicy & their gravy was definitely homemade, no powdered mixes here. Can't wait to come back again very soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here on 7/12/2017 using a Groupon.  We saved about $15 total on our meal and were very pleased with the service, the food and the overall experience. As a matter of fact, the staff went above and beyond for us when we had trouble accessing their Wi-Fi.  A manager rebooted the system as we were having problems connecting.    I absolutely love their pulled pork sandwiches, so I had one.  It was delicious!  The pulled pork was Bar-B-Qed perfectly and was not fatty or greasy -- this is an issue I have other local Bar-B-Q restaurants.    The dining experience was excellent this visit.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never tried the food. After sitting in the bar for 15 minutes while the bartender completely ignored our party of four, we walked out. Must have been one heck of a story she was telling. No wonder there were no cars there. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Great food   Always a great expirience.    Bed barbecue in the valley.    Will definitely come back and reccomend to others"}
{"text":"I love the food .. n service ....n the new re/ model  looks nice .. to bad the cover the outside windows n it looks very dark inside is kind u feel in/ closed n trap in .. will b nice if the removed the paper or painted window lot look outside ..."}
{"text":"The food warrants a five star but the service was terrible! No drink refills we had to ask, no check we had to ask and no personality! Great burnt ends though!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT, love it!!!  So good. I always try to find a reason to come here to eat. The BBQ is the best. We always use the Dillons Standard to see if other restaurants measure up when we try other places. So far, not to many."}
{"text":"We've been to Dillon's many times but this was our first time at this location, given how close it is to Sun City it explains why we were the youngest couple in there (we're in our 30's). My boyfriend keeps buying the Groupons and we keep coming back. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the Groupons we wouldn't come here, but for the price we pay it's a great deal.   This particular visit we started with the breaded mushrooms, they were good, we were able to choose between regular ranch and a chipotle ranch, we went with both.   James ordered the pulled pork with sweet heat like always and I decided to try something new. I ordered the taco salad with chicken and wow was it tasty! That chicken was amazing, it's different than the chicken used in the chicken sandwich. The only thing that could have made it better was guacamole.   We had a table in the back by the window so we got to watch the bunnies. I am, however, deeply concerned about the one that looks like it has a huge tumor on its neck. Has anyone gotten that checked out??"}
{"text":"Service is slow in the bar area. Not many people here either.  Bartender more interested in her phone. 40 min wait for two salads."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ...came for lunch and left full with a huge smile. Had the brisket sandwich with spicy sweet bbq sauce. And my friend had the burnt ends plater. I recommend either. Soft moist meat, great smoke built into the meat and a dynamite sauce. I'll be back to try more, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"A lot of people like/love Dillion's. I'm not one of them. A truly good BBQ is an art form and Dillion's BBQ is not even close, certainly not \"the best in the valley.\" What you get in portion size (huge) does not make up for the lack of great BBQ flavor and tender meat.  The only reason we went back after our first lackluster meal a couple of years ago, was because of a group event.  It's kind of a dingy place, disjointed in the layout, and not even cute folksy décor - like it was decorated by a committee. Service was lacking - waitress didn't know the menu. I asked if the peaches on the peach salad were fresh and she said yes. She then came back and told me they were canned peaches - really? And this in peach season?? Get a clue, Dillon's! Then on top of it, she got an order wrong - and we kept having to ask for water.  I agree with other Yelper's - there are much better BBQ places around."}
{"text":"I like the bbq sandwich and soup. This place gets busy. Expensive so I do not visit often."}
{"text":"Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper."}
{"text":"We always get really good service here. It's an easy place to go if you have kids. The bunnies are a nice extra. The food isn't extraordinary, but it at least has some flavor and is decent priced. The service has always been wonderful which honestly is what keeps us going back. We've been to a few of their locations and this one taste wise is our favorite. Our favorite item is the mushrooms. :) easy place to go out with kids for an easy quick dinner."}
{"text":"UPDATE; I was given a call by management and they took the time to make things right. Thank you  very muck Kelly for being so nice."}
{"text":"Great food and terrific waitresses. We love eating here. Their onion rings are the best!"}
{"text":"This is a meat place close to Sun City so dinner at 5 last night was quite appropriate.   Dillon's is decent fresh food in a casual environment. Good for groups, efficient wait staff and big portions. The man was on a brisket kick and since this was a BBQ joint, figured he would try it. It is Kansas style and it was nice and tender BBQ-though not quite \"smoked\" and definitely sliced on a meat slicer.  The daughter had a pulled pork sandwich that was tender and delicious. The Grandmother had a brisket sandwich, there are other offerings as well-fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish, etc. Salads are good as are the onion rings they ordered for appetizers. This is no BBQ joint. This is a family restaurant with decent food and decent service.  I am giving 4 stars again mostly due to the great service we have. For some reason, AZ is still ass backwards when it comes to recognizing waitstaff. They are not paid minimum wage (though I am not sure how this is legal). They make about $3.25 per hour from the establishment (this is up from $2.12 two years ago) and the rest is supposed to come out of tips. Any young person willing to work in the Sun City area and depend on tips and actually works really hard to get them deserves a whole star to themselves (oh and an extra tip behind the chintzy tippers in my family here).  Reservations are only taken for a party of 8 or more."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for a tournament and found Dillon ' s in yelp.  Was greeted pleasantly by hostess,  waitress Kimberly was friendly and knowledgeful of menu. She was attentive checking if we needed anything else.  I tried the chicken,  sausage links, and pulled pork. Food was really good, hot bbq sauce was good.  Overall was a good experience with good food. Thanks"}
{"text":"I am used to the another Dillon s location and expected a similar experience in service. Was I wrong. I stopped by to order something to go and the hostess up front was less than friendly. I was then directed to the bar to place an order. I went in there and was not greeted for several minutes (even though the bartender made eye contact with me) so I left. Won t be back to that location for sure, and will likely go to a different BBQ place next time."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! They have the best onion ring appetizer, and they're only $2. I always seem to be seated in the same area and have the same waitresses, Bri and Jess. They are both very aware of what their tables need and very nice! Plus my drink is never empty"}
{"text":"I can only give an average rating.. The service was awful, it took forever to get our food and the place wasn't busy. The food was ok but not great so I just can't recommend this place over 3 stars"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, service was great and she was very helpful with any questions we had about the menu. Food came out super fast and was delicious, no complaints about the food at all. The beer was super cold!! Prices were very reasonable. If anyone needed a place for great BBQ I would send them here!"}
{"text":"St. Louis style barbecue that is sure to leave a smile on your face!   Delightful house turned into a restaurant complete with a bar and a bird watching back patio area. One of the last placed in the Phoenix area to get a healthy portion of beef ribs - with or without tangy bbq sauces! There is sure to be something on the menu that will satisfy any family member."}
{"text":"Updating my rating because after I posted my original review, someone from Dillon's reached out to me for feedback. I responded to her, essentially saying the same thing I said in my review but received NO response. Why even reach out to me when you aren't going to try to assuage me? Lost a point for poor customer service. Don't try to reach out to me again, Dillon's. I'm definitely never eating here again."}
{"text":"Of course the BURNT ENDS were excellent!!! We were there on a Friday night and there was a live band. But it was way to loud. We sat in the restaurant area and could hardly hear each talk or the waiter. Never knew they had bunnies there. We got to sit by the windows along the bunny backside where the bunnies are. SO CUTE!"}
{"text":"With so many corporate options near by I was elated when mother decided that Dillon's is where she wanted to go for her birthday. Not because the food is awesome or anything like that but because they are still independent and successful.   For years and years we've been coming to Dillon's and I have to say that they are consistently okay. Back in the day when the menu was smaller and their meat platters came with garlic bread twists this was one of my favorites. Does anyone remember the bread twists? Oh those were awesome!   The BBQ here is alright.. not bad, not great.. just stuck somewhere in the middle. Mother BTW, loved her Chicken Club sandwich and IMHO one of the only things to order on the menu.. fried chicken breast, bacon, ham and cheddar cheese on a bun.. it shines in its pork fayyt goodness!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but a little overpriced. Kids meals at 5.99, 6.99, and 7.99 say drink included, but apparently milk or Shirley temple is not. So you pay an extra $2.89 for that and your kids meal is $10. That's just ridiculous in my opinion. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"My second visit to this location and I have to say we are completely disappointed. We ordered the pickle fries to start and they were amazing. I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot to put the order in because we didn't get them for 20 minutes. Our dinner order was out quick, but our Mac & Cheese was less than warm. The waitress quickly offered to replace it with fresh hot Mac n Cheese. While that was being done, my wife realized that she received asparagus and not the mixed veggies that the waitress recommended. Oh, and how about some silverware??? My wife then asked where my second side was... At this point, we were ready to go. I declined on my second side. The waitress said \"oh sorry\" when asked about the asparagus. Another waiter then said \"that was yesterday's vegetable of the day\". We passed on one of our family favorites to dine here on Mothers Day and were 100% dissatisfied!!! And to top it off, I was a bit offended that the cashier did a AAA discount of $8.00 to make up for ALL of this. I apologized a million times to my wife and mother of our 5 children for the horrible service she received on her special day!   Kind Regards,   Nick & Megan   FYI I added a pic of checking in from FB but didn't want to share this horrible experience with everyone. My first visit was 100% better than this last."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want lunch...Other times you desire MEAT and BBQ sauce! Dillons BBQ is my go to spot when I want to walk away happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've come to Dillon's several times since I moved to Phoenix in 2000. The food is good and wait staff is friendly. I'very attended several work luncheons here and there is space to hold parties. My favorite is the BBQ Burnt Ends. Worth trying Dillon's at least once."}
{"text":"The best BBQ porks sandwhich ever. Juicy, flarvorful, meaty, smokey. Perfect."}
{"text":"I work next door to Dillons so I eat here almost dailey. The service is always outstanding and the food is always fantastic. I advise all my customers to grab a bite while they wait for their car to be repaired."}
{"text":"I've come here in the past and food was ok, but the service during the latest visit was horrendous. We had a reservation and arrived on time. They not so politely told us it was 45 mins wait even though we made A RESERVATION!?! After we got the food, it was as average as usual. I don't get it..terribly managed place."}
{"text":"Ok, so we have driven past this place a hundred times always wondering what it was.  Finally figured out it was BBQ and after some random shopping adventures, the bff and I were ready for some BBQ.    We walked in and the place was pretty full!  The decor is...interesting...very \"grandma's living room\" but makes you feel at home.  I couldn't decide between the brisket sandwich or the pulled pork so I asked our server.  He immediately said the brisket was his top choice.  So I went for it.    I do not regret it.  I asked for 2 different sauces on the side.  Yes! Finally a place that just gives you the brisket sliced thinly and sauce on the side! Just like my dad does it!   Their cajun BBQ sauce is perfection! Not too spicy, but more than flavorful!  The brisket is very tender and flavorful...also VERY LEAN! The bun is soft and not at all too bready...sorry, but a bready bun just ruins the sandwich! I'm there for the meat, not for the bread ;-)  I really enjoyed dinner and will definitely be going back!  If you can, ask to sit by the window facing their little \"garden\"!  You might have a few of 3 of the cutest bunnies you've ever seen...might I add that they are HUGE bunnies!  So cute just hopping around! Was definitely a bonus! hehehe"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 3, but I cant.  Service, slow.  Food, eh.  Husb had 3 meat platter, which prob was a 3 star.  Potato salad, eh. I had dillon dip which was the 2 star along w mac n cheese. Single  Onion ring order for $1 diring HH & it was ok...better the onion rings that took a while were actually hot.  Bunnies & wildlife outside kept my 4 yo son busy.0 I will not b returning to this location.  I remember Wildlife W  Zoo Dillons to b better food, service & atmosphere for sure"}
{"text":"Not a lot to choose from but what we did order we all enjoyed. Our server Ryan was prompt and very nice. The best thing about our experience was sitting next to the window where we saw bunnies and tortoises while eating! What an awesome unexpected pleasure!!! Will return!"}
{"text":"Meh. Just ok. Came from out of town and wanted to try some good bbq. The big draw was the burnt ends. Do yourself a favor and pass!!! Just chopped up brisket, nothing special at all! Cannot come minutely close to KC bbq. Service was pretty good. Best part of the meal was the bbq sauce.."}
{"text":"Great ribs, had the 50/50 platter! Delicious! Great food, people and experience!    Before I forget the \"mules\" are delicious, we had the Moscow and the one with tequila, dirty the named eludes me at this point for the latter \"mule\"... Lol"}
{"text":"We live right by this restaurant and every time we go I'm shocked at how over priced they are. The food is good and service is friendly But we don't frequent it for food only their bar."}
{"text":"Alrighty, get your butt down here and eat some fried food. Dillion's has the best fried food ever because the batter is so good and the fried mushrooms, zucchini, pickles, and onions are fresh. The sauces they give are really tasty. They give you hot sauce and ranch that we ran out of real quick. Ordering the wings dry and dipping it in the hot sauce is really good and their chili nachos are so good , their gone in a couple seconds. The chili nachos come in a large platter and somehow my whole family gobbles it all down and wants more. To make it even better, they have great, friendly service that just makes you happy to be there. You get nice cold, beers that are perfectly bubbly. (That's what my dad thinks.)"}
{"text":"My son brought me and my others boys here  for a after Mother's day dinner. We ordered the spare ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken club sandwich so we could try the different meats. My God it was delicious! I've been wanting to come here for forever and finally got the chance to do so. The service was good the place was clean just disappointed I never came sooner. Definitely will be back with my entire family."}
{"text":"This place has been on my to try list since before I knew what Yelp is.  I made it my choice when I won a football bet last fall.  Yes, I know football season has been over for a while but diets, cash flow and life in general, on both sides, made this dinner wait.  Suffice it to say the company was worth the wait.  When we got there about 6:30 on Saturday the parking lot was packed and we were worried we would be stuck in the bar with our growling stomachs.  It turned out we were seated immediately although there were only a few tables open.  We started with a half order of onion rings.  These are hand made in house and served with a really good dipping sauce.  Both the rings and the sauce reminded me of Lenny's (which got rid of their sauce and started buying frozen onion rings) only one notch higher.  We were both thinking ribs in a BBQ joint and she got the baby backs and I got the St Louis style spare ribs.  She got the fall off the bone she wanted and I got the slightly chewy I wanted.  Of the sauces I preferred the cajun which was only mildly hot, however the ribs were good enough they really didn't need much sauce.  We both ordered different sides so we could try many of them.  We liked them all but my favorites were the cole slaw and the macaroni and cheese.  The only soso item was the dinner roll but even there they are smart enough to serve soft butter.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive the entire time.  Our waitress had the answers to all of our questions without having to go ask.  Sort of an anomaly in the North West valley, you can arrive here between 7:30 and 8:30 and the place will be sort of quiet between the Sun City folks and the later night crowd and be seated right away."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try Dillons and it was amazing. I ordered the Brontosaurus beef ribs and was very impressed. They were tender and very tasty. And they aren't lying when they say they are huge. I could of fed my whole family with an order. Dillons might become my new favorite spot I want to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"This place was extremely good, we had the onion rings and a combo plate.   I loved the beef ribs, who I was with didn't like them, but it was her first time having beef ribs. The only thing is the Mac & Cheese could have used a bit more salt and pepper, but otherwise they were amazing.   The service was good, and it felt very homey which is what we were looking for on this trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hubby had just had surgery and was in recovery so we needed a place to have lunch and this wasn't too far from the hospital. Plus I knew there was a Groupon so I purchased the Groupon and took his family here. I ordered the Chicken Club Salad and it was great. It was a good-sized salad with plenty of meat and the chicken breast was fried perfectly. I ordered blue cheese dressing on the side but also some of their barbecue sauce because their sauce is wonderful. It came with a roll on the side along with their cinnamon butter that I love. The people I was with both ordered burgers with fries and they looked good as well. Service was very fast and we were out of there in no time at all. Our waitress was very nice and even asked us if we wanted iced teas to go. Great service, great food, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Food was not that good plus I had to actually go looking for my server twice!.  Pretty bad since I was with a table of 10.  Prices weren't that bad but it is tough getting past the poor service!"}
{"text":"It was delicious!! Service was amazing. We had onion rings for an appetizer. I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad, my wife had short ends, mac and cheese, potato salad."}
{"text":"I have probably eaten at Dillons  fifty times it's always been pretty good but ate there last Thursday in the bar which is where I usually eat. I had the stew and salad which is one of my favorites salad was great but stew was soup with lots of broth and not the usual.  My wife had brisket sandwich normally very moist and tender ---- not this time. The worst part of the meal was the service, the waitress took our order and never came back to check on is my wife had to go up to the bar to get water I had to go to the bar together check and pay.   We all have bad days so I will probably go back, but not for a while."}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I ate at Dillon's. We found them in our Entertainment Book. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our waitress Stephanie was great. All of the food was so good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good BBQ meats, but that may be the only saving grace for a return to this location unfortunately.    We arrived around 7 p.m. so a touch after the normal dinner crowd and were seated pretty quickly after we arrived.  Once seated we waited about 20 minutes to get our order taken and  about 25 minutes after that to receive our food.    I had the pulled pork sandwich and he had the pick any 2 meats plate (with sausage and pulled chicken).  For a side my plate had the steak fries and his had the mac and cheese and BBQ beans.  The pulled pork was delish, as was the sausage and the pulled chicken.  The sides were a different matter.  The mac and cheese wan't bad, but it was pretty flavorless.  If you've ever made steak fries in the oven at home, you may be familiar with the struggle to cook them evenly and to have them not turn out soggy in the middle but cooked on the edges.  Dillon's has this same problem.  The middles were definitely soggy and undercooked. while the edges were perfect.  The BBQ beans were the best of the three sides we had.    Server didn't check up on us and never refilled our drinks and forgot to put our Groupon deal on the check when it was brought out.  In his defense he was emptying a few tables when we were wrapping up and coupons are forgotten all the time.  It was just more the accumulation of all the other waiting that compiled this factor onto the negative experience.  Overall: B- / C+ The meats were really tasty.  The sides were lacking, but they have tons to choose from, so perhaps different selections next time?  The wait was pretty hefty, but it's based on a one time  only visit - so grain of salt.  If we have the time and desire for some BBQ we may visit again, but there are lots of other places to try...."}
{"text":"Oh Dillon's.  I once, mistakenly took this guy that I was seeing to Dillon's.  See, we hadn't really talked much about our eating habits as it was our second or third date (and we'd just met for drinks before this date) but he had marked \"meat and potatoes\" in his on-line profile.  I'm not a meat and potatoes girl as I am Pakistani and these things are inherent to American culture but I was keen on satisfying his supposed love for meat and potatoes.  In order to truly grasp this situation, you have to know that this guy was from the East Valley and kind of a snob because of it- I know that the West Valley has a long way to go (but I live and work here and have to be positive so shut up!) and am not denying that.  We had only hung out in the East Valley, and it was my turn to try and let the West Valley shine.  Anyway, I was freaking out because I don't know Phoenix that well and don't eat meat and potatoes.  So, I called a good friend who is a Phoenix native and she instantly thought \"DILLONS!\" when I said meat and potatoes.  She was, of course right on, if one is really into meat and potatoes.  It turns out that the guy I was seeing wasn't really into meat and potatoes and hadn't thought much about his profile when he had filled it out.  I felt like a total freak, as he told me he enjoyed Thai and all kinds of stuff that I actually enjoy.  This led to a bit of an awkward albeit fun time at Dillon's.    We opted to sit outside as it was a nice evening.  Unfortunately, the patio area gives you clear view of some abandoned trailer and a large overgrown field.  Not exactly romantic or cool.   We ordered a bottle of red wine when we sat down and the waitress was clearly miffed by this.  I'm pretty positive she had been working there for years and no one had actually ordered a bottle of wine.  It also took a very long time for the wine to be delivered to us, so we were sure that someone had to run out to the local Circle K to get us our bottle of wine.    I ended up ordering the spinach enchiladas (I know, lame) and he ordered a salmon salad.  Although the food was decent, I'd probably only suggest this restaurant to a big meat eater.  Which apparently wasn't either of us.  I totally let the West side down by showcasing Dillon's to an East Valley snob.  Argh."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why everyone \"raves\" about this place.... second time I've been here while on vacation from California. The service is just okay, took forever to get water refills. I ordered the fish tacos with a side of mac & cheese & loaded potatoes. The fish tacos looked amazing but tasted so plain. There was no flavor, not even with the salsa..... the mac & cheese was the exact same. It looked so yummy from all of the pictures I saw but was very plain. The loaded mashed potatoes were very loaded that I even ate an entire piece of butter because they put so dam much on them and for some reason it didn't melt after I stirred it twice. I even tried some off of my family's plates & even the BBQ was bland. They do give you huge serving sizes but it's Not worth it. Take your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Very accommodating, great and pleasant service and good food.  I arranged a yearly reunion and they gave us their small private room....just perfect, complete with table cloths.  They allowed me to bring in a cake.  The young lady who helped me with these arrangements was Melissa and our server was Ann....both delightful young ladies."}
{"text":"excellent bbq i love there ribs and pulled pork sandwich as well as the fries and beans"}
{"text":"If you are looking for quality BBQ this is the place to go.  The service is friendly and the portions are huge.  The building and dining area could use some improvements, the table cloths are a bit old and the color is unappealing.  The brisket is what I usually order, sometimes it is awesome, other times it is just ok.    They are friendly towards are kids and the noise they make, they often have loud music so you don't notice the sounds kids make.  The portions are huge, way more than it is comfortable to eat, and the prices are fair for the amount.  It would almost be better to get 20% less for a 20% lower price."}
{"text":"Latisha is the best ! Great service, attitude, and atmosphere!!!! I love this place and Latisha is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and always great  service.  My significant other and I have been there quite a few times since 2011, and have always had a positive experience.  If you sit in the bar, bring earplugs for the live music!   If you want a sit down restaurant meal, make sure you get a window by the bunnies!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Dillon's after reading the yelp reviews but was dissatisfied with the food and service. I ordered the Brontosaurus beef ribs and was very disappointed that the ribs were dry, tough, over cooked.  I asked for plain butter and the server said that they didn't have any. A restaurant that servers comfort food has no butter?  I ordered a beer with a glass, the beer wasn't very cold and the glass was warm as though it had just been washed (it should have been frosted or chilled).  The food at Dillons isn't the problem, it's the simple details that ruined my visit."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about how good this place is.  I've been there dozens of times and every time I eat there, I am very satisfied.  Pulled pork is awesome.  Mashed potatoes are delish.  They recently started serving a macaroni and cheese, which was awesome.  It has corn and bread crumbs in it and just tastes fantastic.  Ribs are incredible.  Chicken club sandwich is sooo good.  It is a big fried chicken breast, with ham, bacon and cheese.  Holy crap it's good.....You must go to Dillon's right now.  You wont be sorry...."}
{"text":"Good service. Brisket good. Sweet and hot sauce was good. Priced about 2 bucks high on all entrees."}
{"text":"I took 3 meat platter with Smoked Turkey, Brisket and St. Louis Style Ribs..... OMG..... with all 3 meats even sides were awesome.. BBQ beans and coleslaw..... Brisket and Turkey were so moist and tender... they were just melting my mouth.... I never had anything like that, they were out of the world..... My favorite the Ribs, were cooked to the perfection and they were perfect combination of meat flavour and sauce... It was insanely awesome.... I will visit this place again......... and again....... and again...... :)"}
{"text":"I am surprised there are not more reviews for Dillon's seeing how popular it is on the west-side.  It is a good BBQ restaurant, with a wide menu, friendly staff, and quick service (for the most part). Despite being overrun with white hairs, there is a good mix of families and often it gets really loud in their. The BBQ sauce is tasty and the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs are some of the best you will find over here. It is the type of place you can go to and know you will always have a quality meal- no surprises here. It has become a staple with my family and often a place we take out of town company. With locations in Surprise and 67th and the 101, it is convenient to most of the west-side."}
{"text":"These guys have good BBQ, the only problem is they cook to their demographic so everything is over cooked, and they go light on their sauce on some and extremly heavy on many other items. Many bland items, but good happy hour specials and appitizers, and some good spicy bbq items.  Kind of pricy for what you get compared to others. Also the ditsy watresses would rather flit with guys in the back than ask you if you need a refill or something.(famous daves is way better) If I lived in sun city I would probably rate this establishment  with 4 or more stars but this young buck looks elsewhere for bbq delight. Texaz bbq or famous daves are much better choices."}
{"text":"I came here with a groupon a while back because I heard great things about this place. To put it simply, I was under impressed with their food. For me, I compare all bbq with Bobby Q's bbq, so the bar is set really high. I would put Dillon's in the \"It's OK, but nothing special\" category. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Wow service here is horrendous. Been dining for 45 minutes and we have trash blowing off the table next to us that's been dirty since we sat down. When the food was dropped off I asked for a water and was returned a water about 80 degrees with zero ice. Thanks for the Luke warm water food runner! Apparently there's no bussers and every server here has a rotten attitude like they hate their job. All in all I feel truly saddened by my visit here, I love the food and bbq. This time though the service was a complete let down, didn't bother talking to management I can only assume this is stemming from the top down. Bad vibes, terrible ambiance. Not sure when I'll be back here, will probably opt for Rudys and Famous daves. Total let down Dillion's Kc BBq"}
{"text":"Getting some takeaway for dinner, but probably not again. I ordered two pounds of pulled pork, some potato salad, and was going to get some sauces to go with two pounds of meat. I was told that a half pint is provided with the first pound, and after that I was on my own regarding sauces. Hmm. When I asked if I would receive just the one half-pint of sauce if I bought five pounds of pulled pork, I was told yes, just one half pint is provided as part of an order, no matter how large. This is not a customer-friendly policy, and I doubt that I'll think of Dillon's again as a place to stop for family dinner takeaway."}
{"text":"So loud we could not hear or talk without almost  yelling . Could not stay and enjoy our time it actually gave me a headache.  Food was good service was fairly good ."}
{"text":"Roll up the sleeves cause it is BBQ time! I never seem to get to this place enough. If you want beef that will melt in your mouth go for the Burnt Tips! You will thank yourself while you eat. Dillon's does get pretty packed on Friday and Saturday so try to go a little earlier or later. I go that route and find it easier to get in. Nothing special about the decor, but what do you want? Top notch BBQ or fancy shamcy art? Put this place on your list of must try! They have a decent bar too, so enjoy an icy one with those tips!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Sit at the bar.  Their bar menu is ridiculously cheap and it's huge portions. We keep returning for the potato skins, which are covered in cheese! I enjoy their nachos as well, just hoped the salsa was spicy.  Friday and Saturday they have live music outside beginning at 6. The outside patio gets packed.  It's full of locals, definitely a friendly bar.  They do have several televisions, so you can watch your sports.   The only down fall is they close at 10.  They are right off the 101 on Thunderbird, so it's easy to get there.  They also do take out, so if you heading to the park nearby you can order some food."}
{"text":"Great food. Feels like walkin into Grandma's house. Ordered Fried Pickles for Appetizer. Good breading, though they use cut pickle wedges pieces, which is a larger bite for fried pickles. Dill Slices would be better, but great taste all the same. Pork BBQ there is awesome. Some of the best I have had in Arizona. Service was pretty good too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Pull pork sandwich was very dry! Pretty much sucks.  Was replace with turkey platter! The manager only took 4.65 off my platter.  I came for the barbecue. I would not recommend this place for pull pork."}
{"text":"First off let me just say I normally really like this place! Last night not so much. We sat in the bar due to a wait for regular seating. I had no idea the bar servers are lacking in serving! After we finally get our drinks we ordered some onion rings extra ranch! The rings come no extra ranch and no small plates to eat! When she decides to come back and offer small plates we were already done! We ordered the pulled chicken bad mistake! She never did ask what sauce we wanted so when the plate comes I mention that and her reply is oh well I didn't offer and you didn't ask! We get our sweet heat sauce and the pulled chicken there has no comparison to the pulled pork! They should just take that off the menu! Didn't even finish it it's so gross! Not sure we will ever be back! If we ever go there again I will be sure that Latisha is not our server!"}
{"text":"Ok, we love the food here....but seriously... our waiter didn't introduce himself and just walked up asking if we were ready to order. The entire wait staff acted as if they could care less.  Every other location has awesome service. Not sure what happened today.  Had it been our first ever visit, we wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with the wife and the place was really dissapointing. The staff was nice but the food was not good. My brisket was so dry, my coleslaw tasted like it was made of raw cabbage it was so hard. Her food was not so great, nothing to point out but nothing special. Not worth it, I'd stay away."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I've been here.  It used to be amazing!  It was super slow and the server was a young kid that couldn't talk about the menu.  He had no clue about several oh the items.  Lol.  I had more knowledge of his menu.   The brisket was tough and had no visible smoke ring or smoke flavor.   The smoked sausage was amazing as were the Mac n cheese and coleslaw.  Excellent BBQ sauce.   The food came out cold though.  Say for 10 minutes waiting for my change and he didn't bring it all back.   I recommend famous Daves or better yet Honey Bears for great BBQ"}
{"text":"It's a BBQ place and the fish tacos aren't bad.  Next time, I am bringing my own hot sauce but, no complaints because the fish was good and it's a BBQ place after all.  Table of folks got other stuff they raved about but, will let them add own reviews.  For first time here, I liked it.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Food is as good as any bbq in the city! The day we went they were short staffed BUT still got us seated,  and the staff people did a great job checking on us...did not feel neglected at all... if they do that good of job when they are short...i wonder how they would be fully staffed?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a drink and lunch. Staff was great. Stephanie in particular was amazing! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Honestly this just to be my boyfriends favorite barbecue place but last time we were there the meat wasn't great it was a little bit dry."}
{"text":"The food is good. I love there chicken and beef brisket. But beware - they are expensive.  I bought cup of soup and it cost me almost $7 without tip.  It took me about 5-6 bites and it was gone."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever!!  The service was super slow.  We had to ask 3 different times and 2 different servers for an item.  I have eaten at the location on 59th ave & the 101 and the service was excellent.  But it was completely different at this location.  Very slow and unapologetic!  I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about 10 years,  but it was just as good today as it was back then.  Their Sunday Bloody Mary special is well worth it.  They were out of burnt ends which was a bummer, but everything we ordered was delish. Alyssa U was the best server ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service!!! The food was warm & right on time after appetizers! Our waitress Ann W. Was wonderful! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"They can make an old fashioned.  This can be hard to come by.  The bar was filled to the brim when we went in, We opted for the patio and sat a few minutes, wondering 'do they come to us, do we go to them?'  We go to them.  It was a Saturday, around 4:00, and they were setting up for a band, if we hadn't been on the way to a wedding we may have stuck around. Overall, not bad at all, It didn't knock my socks off, but not bad."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy for my husband and Spinach Enchiladas for me. Good service & good food. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Dillon's for many years and my recent visit today was quite disappointing....  The Waitress came by with our beverages, but completely disappeared as we waited and...and waited...and waited to give her our order....(by this time, we could had driven over to FAMOUS DAVE'S in the amount of time it took for her to reappear!) There were only 3 other customers in the whole place, so it wasn't crazy busy (and there was ANOTHER Food Server on duty too).  Anyhow....  I usually order their Pulled Pork, which is never disappointing. However, after seeing Adam Richman (Man Vs Food) eating some BBQ brisket on a recent episode, I suddenly wanted brisket too!  The brisket was nicely rolled on a bun (like a spiral lollipop) and looked quite pretty, but was NOT as moist as the Pulled Pork.  It was dry. The homemade potato salad is ALWAYS a winner! The overall portions seemed skimpy for the price ($8 or $9 bucks) for a sandwich and 1 side. (For less money, I could had gone to a Buffet to pig-out and not have to wait for a SLOW Food Server...)   Took awhile to get the check too...ugh! Not everyone who eats there has HOURS to sit there waiting and waiting.   If you want good portions for a good value...this is NOT the place to visit.  Slow service and dry brisket will remind me to chose someplace else for lunch next time. .."}
{"text":"Best potato salad I've ever had. We order some for every holiday BBQ and/or dinner and our guests are always drooling in satisfaction. :)"}
{"text":"It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it."}
{"text":"First time going here I wasn't to impressed. Maybe second times a charm. If you like pickles then the fried pickles appetizer is not to bad. The red sauce that comes with it however is not even close to a good combination in my opinion with this dish. The food was ok. No flavor in anything that I could really taste. Mostly just spicy. The Mac n cheese tasted like velveeta cheese and shells with corn mixed in. He chicken quesadilla had hardly any flavor. Although this was my first time here doesn't mean I'm going to write it off completely. Maybe next time will be better."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night - the only reason for the 3 stars is that the bartender was great. We ordered a couple of combos to share so that we could try everything. When our food came out, it was cold! Not just \"it sat in the window a little too long\" but actually cold in temperature like it was cooked yesterday and put right in the plate! Mashed potatoes cold - burnt ends cold - brisket cold, baked potato cold!!! We sent back one plate and asked for another potato on the side. Clearly it was just put in the microwave because when the potato came out it was so hot it scalded my mouth!  Anyways - flavor was just ok  But the drinks were good and Eileen did her best to make things right."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. BBQ pork Carolina style sandwich and fries.   Sandwich was extremely dry and difficult to chew. Couldn't taste the pork at all, over sauced. Toasted bun is the only thing that saved the sandwich from falling completely apart. Cole slaw was as others described, just cabbage and mayo like. This was served with a decent portion of steak cut fries, not salted or flavored at all. Potatoes. Deep fried. Bar tender was nice but never asked how my meal was, I would have let her know. Ordered an Arnold Palmer. Seemed like it was pink lemonade, was gross but after eating that choke sandwich I needed a refill.   Overall 2 stars. I don't recommend at all. The only positive is that their portion sizes are reasonable for the price point."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found a groupon of Dillion's for $17 you got like $30 worth of food so my first thought was wow, this must be a sorta cheap eats place. l was certainly wrong it's rather pricey, the portions weren't, but the food was okay. However after it went left my boyfriend got sick from the food just a bit later in the evening. lt was certainly a unique experience, they won't get our money again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Prickly Peach Salad.  Canned peaches that tasted like smoke and onions, walnuts were not candied as described, there were no carrots, and the bed of mixed greens was iceberg lettuce...this is after they brought me the wrong salad the first time around. $12...Won't be back..."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon to use, and it requires dine-in. We'd previously picked up take-out from this location and although I had called it in and arrived on time to pick it up, they still took about 20 minutes to get our order (it was just pulled pork, what's so difficult?).  We hoped dine-in would be different, and even made reservations. We arrived right on time at 6 pm on a Saturday and were made to wait a while. Then they apparently gave our table to someone else, so quick had to come up with another table. Our server was very nice, but apparently overworked because we rarely saw her. It took a long time to get our drinks, long enough we started wishing we'd ordered our food with our drinks.   The food took a very long time to arrive. It was over an hour from our arrival before we were served even the mac and cheese for my 2 year old, who was getting impatient. Finally got our food and it was just not that good. I've had much better BBQ pulled pork at Thee Pitts Again and never had to wait that long to eat.   All the disorganization and chaos, topped off with so-so BBQ means we won't be back, unless it 's to try the bar without the kiddo. It just takes too much time to get food that ain't that great in the restaurant."}
{"text":"10 years ago I lived just down the street from this great BBQ where it was always crowded with airmen from Luke AFB.  Last week we were driving home from Las Vegas and it was time for a lunch stop, so we returned to Dillon's and found it has not changed much.  Still great BBQ pork sandwiches with tasty side dishes of cole slaw and beans.  Nice to return to a familiar place and find it is still the best BBQ on the west side of PHX."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with my wife, drunk guy behind me spits beer all over me and my food.  I asked him to pay for my food that he just spit beer on and he tells me it's 5 on 1 mother fucker no one saw shit.   I went and got a manager and told her what happened, she comes over and talks to him,  and he says to me, what are you gonna do about it little girl.  The manager told him to shut up and took him outside to talk to him.  3 minutes later he comes back in and sits down, so apparently  they know this guy and didn't kick him out.  I decide to leave to alleviate the 5 on 1 situation and she runs my card.  I told her to put my tab on the drunk guy who spit all over it, and she asks me if I want a to go box...seriously..."}
{"text":"Well... This is one of those places you will either crave or come back In the same week. Tried burnt ends, Mac and cheese , beef ribs , pulled pork and a few other things and everything was on point .. Even the Bloody Mary was tasty. Service was great and didn't have to wait forever like most BBQ places to get your order Plenty of seating and short wait. Great environment all around. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Situated right off of thunderbird and the 101 towards sun city this place is pretty convenient to get too from off the freeway.  The food here is terrific.  they are known for their BBQ but I tend to order other items as they are just as good.    The smoked turkey is fantastic juicy and lean.  They also have deep fried pickles which are sooo soo good.  Addicting.  Their homemade ranch dressing is the bomb.  One other thing this place is known for is the Onion Rings! Get a half order they are humongous!  The prime rib is one of my favorites it has a slightly bacony taste to it.  Overall give dillions a shot.  Its good to take the wife and grandma too!   I  Love this place never had a bad meal.  The Dillons dip is the best french dip sandwich around.  I also love the Beef Ribs and the Chilli is OMG Awesome they put brisket in it! Good for kids too!"}
{"text":"Came today and did not have reservations for a party of 18, wow they were able to take us right in at noon with out any problems! The food was great and the service was spot on, some in the group had eaten here before but this was my first time I will be returning. Wife had there burger and I did the Dillon dip, both were delicious!"}
{"text":"It was so good last time (a week ago...see my recent previous review) that we went back again today!! Our server Timothy was excellent!   Listen people, I have been smoking my own meats for years!! I love to smoke my own meat and I'm honestly really darn good at it, but I don't always have time. That is why THIS LOCATION of Dillons hits the spot for us when I have a craving for GOOD barbeque and I don't have 12 hours to babysit the grill and my meat!! The other locations of Dillions might be newer and fancier, but they do NOT put the same love into their food as this particular location!! If you have been to the other locations of Dillons and have been disappointed, don't judge this location by that experience!!! There IS a difference!!  Our kid loves the smiley face french fries and we like the huge portion of shrimp because he eats like a man!! Our kid also likes the giant turtles and bunnies right outside that he can watch through the big windows while he enjoys his meal!!   Good food, great value, free entertainment for the kid = happy kid, happy parents!! See you soon!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Dillon's location several times over the past 3 or 4 years and I have never been disappointed.  The food is great, the servers are nice and the price is reasonable.  Another factor is the beer is very affordable.  The selection at the Arrowhead location is a little better for those who enjoy craft beers, but if you are ok with the normal light beers and Amber Bock then this location will do.    I usually get the ribs or burnt ends.  The burnt ends are very tender, never dried out and big.  The BBQ sauces are great, you get a choice of three.  The ribs sometimes don't have enough smoke, but the meat falls of the bone and still has great flavor.  My wife goes for the half chicken and she has never complained.    The layout of the restaurant is awkward, they have added on and it doesn't flow the best and the decor is outdated, but it is definitely family friendly dining.  Our 8 month old fits right in and if he gets noisy, you cannot hear him as the place gets fairly loud when busy.    Check it out for the BBQ items, I haven't ventured to the sandwiches."}
{"text":"This used to be the go to place for BBQ on the west side but it seems as if the high standards they used to have for both food and service have completely deteriorated.   The pulled pork tasted as if it was kept on steam table with the lid on allowing the condensation to water it down, the pork ribs were terribly greasy, and the beef ribs were incredibly tough.  Oftentimes I can still be won over by a restaurant if the service is good but the quality of the service was just as bad.  My wife and I have visited a few times in the last year or so with the hope that our recent experiences were just an anomaly but I think we have made our last visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming here basically since the place opened and have yet to have a bad experience. Occasionally service may be a bit slower than usual, but unless I'm being completely ignored, I'm not too put off by it.  I first went here off of the recommendation of someone who told me I HAD to try the chicken fried steak. However, sitting down and looking at the menu, I realized that ordering a chicken fried steak in a BBQ joint would be akin to ordering a hamburger in a Mexican food restaurant. Not even going there!  Items I can say without a doubt are great: Pulled pork (moist and slightly smoky), turkey (thinly sliced but a great smoked flavor), smoked sausage (although it doesn't stand out above other smoked sausages elsewhere, it's still good), and ribs (I'm not a huge rib person, but they are tasty and flavorful).  My absolute favorite, must get is the burnt ends. I am a fan of huge smoke flavor and these tasty brisket ends don't disappoint! Strangely enough, the brisket itself is probably the one item on the menu I'm not a huge fan of.  The BBQ Sauce, you ask? I'm a fan of the cajun style (slightly kicky and not too sweet), which is Dillon's original sauce. The sweet and mild sauce was created for the Sun City crowd who requested a milder sauce, and the name describes it about perfectly.  The sides I've had are all pretty good, although I usually stick with a potato product and beans - why mess with something that works for you?  As others have mentioned, this is very near Sun City, expect early crowds.   And one other thing? I have yet to try the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday before concert and sat in the bar area.  The server was very friendly and going.  Location right off freeway. Beer is ice cold.  The macaroni and cheese was so good."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get the love of this place it was good BBQ but far from great.    Tip: If your pulled pork or chicken sandwich comes smothered in sauce it's because they are hiding something.    A true bbq place would put sauce on the side so you can taste the smokiness of the meat before drenching it in sauce.    Now the sauce was good and chicken was tender on my sandwich and the bbq beans were great but I just would like to try the smokey meat before to taste how good it is and how juicy it is prior to sauce.    Will I go back maybe but for sure I won't go out of my way there are too many other places in town that offer above average bbq."}
{"text":"I've heard so many people speak so highly of the food and fun they had here so we tried it the other day and I have to say I wasn't impressed. We were sat in the back room next to the window with the view of the turtles and bunnies that run around. Even tho it was different I was disgusted looking at the poop while trying to enjoy a meal (most of the poop was from the pigeons). The food was decent but nothing to rave about. The  service was good but I prefer other bbq places over this one. We prob won't be back."}
{"text":"Carolina pulled pork and brisket sandwiches were both very good although they came out a little too hot ( heat lamp?).  Baked beans were only okay. Onion rings were delicious and could be the best deal in town ($2)."}
{"text":"I have heard really good thing about Dillon's and I have been to one of their other locations. I guess on this visit they were short staffed in the kitchen. Our server was very polite and attentive. I will have to give them another try on another visit to Phoenix to see if my opinion changes. I order a medium hamburger and it was more like well done. It was nothing exciting but the Mac and cheese was really good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and wouldn't miss the onion rings! BBQ has all been good and service is friendly. Pretty close to Sun City so it's got an early crowd... Plan your time accordingly!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food! ...sliders, onion rings, potatoes peels !! Great prices on drinks...come early for music !!! Love their b b q!!!  Just great food"}
{"text":"Best nachos in town! The service was great as well. My waitress was Latisha, super friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"In town to see the parents, and they said meet us at Dillon's.  I immediately Yelped it to see where it was, what the menu looked like and of course, the reviews.  My husband and I were a little concerned that it was going to be a bad experience because of the latest posts...it was NOT!!  Though it is by far not \"elegant\", it is however, super country cute.  We were greeted and sat.  And immediately waited on by (I believe) Alyssa--she was charming and sweet.  I can understand some of the reviews saying that they cater to a \"certain crowd\".  Fine.  Alyssa did an AWESOME job taking care of my 65 year old parents, asking exact questions and making sure their orders were correct and catered to their needs!!  This really makes me happy.   And I can understand it takes a lot of patience, but she did it with ease!!    They have a FULL menu, but it's the BBQ that was our agenda.  Super succulent shredded pork, juicy pork ribs, ridiculously HUGE beef ribs, and the sides (I think between the 4 of us, we had them all) were very rich and tasty (mac-n-cheese and potato salad were off the hook!!). Their iced tea was FRESH and my mom's soda was perfectly bubbly!!  We were given take-out containers with bags and were allowed to sit a little while so we could catch up! We had such an excellent lunch and visit with one another.  Thanks Dillon's Thunderbird Crew!!  And THANK YOU ALYSSA!!!  Post Script: *Parking goes fast. *The prices were completely affordable. *The bar looks like a HUGE PLUS!! *They are wheel-chair friendly. *They have adorable \"bibs\" for the \"ribs.\"  *And the unheard of: the other customers were friendly and generous--the kind woman next to us picked up MY napkin and gave it to me!!!  Who does that???!!!  GOOD PEOPLE DO!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy fresh onion rings...great bbq and great service.  Good value for the price.  Eat here iften.  Always good!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. We ordered to go and they gave us the wrong order so double check your bag before you leave. Turned out OK though, the brisket was really good and the BBQ sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Everything was so good!!!! Except the corn bread. I would do 4.5 if I could. Worth the visit. I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"Arizona is not good BBQ territory (that would be Texas), but this place does a great job for the area. I've eaten a few times and it is a consistent solid performer."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Nothing special. Had the brisket sandwich. Sliced a little thick for my tastes, and not very tender. The biggest negative is that service is very slow. This was my third and probably last visit here because of the service."}
{"text":"Food is always good here.  Smoked turkey platter for me and pulled pork platter for my Babe!  Service is always great here as well.  This time it was our good fortune to have Leticia take care of us and she was outstanding!  Back at Dillon's and another great meal with Leticia taking care of us again.  Such a delightful young lady!  Look forward to our next meal with you.  And another great dining experience with Kayla taking good care of us tonight. Thank you, Kala! Your service was much appreciated."}
{"text":"My cross country trip this year has turned me into somewhat of a BBQ snob. So while this rating may seem a little harsh, 3 is still average right?   Anyhow Like a true fattie, I ordered a 3 meat plate baby back ribs, brisket and burnt ends. We got unsold on appetizers and opted for 2 orders of $1 onion rings and some fried shrooms.   Appetizers were decent. For $1 you can't complain about anything. The shrooms were a bit greasy for my taste but I got my daily dose of veggies...   Onto the main dishes: The baby back ribs had a nice bark on them however were a bit on the dry side. Like any rib shack I go to I take a pic of the smoke ring and cross section for reference. Dot believe me take a gander a my pics. I attribute the dryness due to the fact that they were probably smoked early in the afternoon. You could taste the smoke in the meat but because they were dry I needed to sauce them up to help them out. The sweet and hot sauce was ok but not noteworthy enough to buy a bottle and take home.   The burnt ends we're a little on rare side to be called burnt ends. They looked like rib bits versus burnt ends. There wasn't really much or anything burnt about them.   The brisket was the best of the 3 on the platter. It was thin sliced, had a nice smoke ring and was still nice and moist. Not sure what type of sauce was it was served with but it did help keep the brisket from drying out.   All and all, it was ok but it didn't wow me or woo me in any way however, I'd still take Dillon's over Famous Dave's any day."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Dillon's for a couple of weeks since moving back to the west valley. I used to live near dillons arrowhead so I'm familiar with it.   This was my first time at the Thunderbird location and it went very well. I will be back.    The hostess was very nice and welcoming upon entering and gave me some good suggestions. I ordered the brisket sandwich with Mac n cheese and it was delicious. The brisket was a little dry but the Cajun BBQ sauce was on point. The bartender, Eileen, hooked me up with a free coca cola while I was waiting and while it may not seem like much, that coupled with the atmosphere and warm reception is something that will make people want to go back.  Next time I'll definitely check out the onion rings I have been deprived of for so long   I've had some fantastic BBQ in Kansas City and thjs isn't quite up to the same level when it comes to the food but the smell and atmosphere are right on par"}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I have been at this location, but it had been several years. From the outside it does not look to be very large, but when you get inside the place has many rooms to sit. On this occasion we were fortunate to have a window that looked out to the rabbit pen. Made the wait easy. We enjoyed watching the rabbits hopping around.  The restaurant was clean and everyone treated us like they wanted us to enjoy ourself and the meal. I got the rib tips and they were good. My two sides was A salad and a salad. Our food was delivered in a good amount of time. Only down side was I like Balsamic vinegar on my salad and they did not have."}
{"text":"Yum! Big portions of savory smoked meats and rich sides. Love the onion rings as a starter."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good , service from waitress was decent. I had a groupon and the mgr wouldn't honor it though, which ticked me off."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at this location!   The service has always been spot on, they run each other's food out and have busser's roaming around to make sure you get your food quickly and tables are cleared.   The pulled pork is tasty, and not greasy or fatty. Hubby loves the burnt ends - so does my Frenchie.   Sides are large, rolls are delish, especially with the garlic butter they give you.  They refill your drinks without you having to hunt them down and beg.   I could eat their fried mushrooms every day.   We have been here many times and the food is consistent and plentiful.     I even just noticed how clean the carpeting was - no easy feat considering all the BBQ sauce that must get spilled on a daily basis."}
{"text":"My wife and son took me here for a Father's Day lunch. I enjoyed one of the best chicken club sandwiches I have ever had! The wife had what looked to be an awesome salad with fried chicken breast on top. Even our picky kid ate all of his chicken strips! We definitely recommend this place if you are on the west side."}
