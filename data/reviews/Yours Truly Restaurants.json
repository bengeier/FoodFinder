{"text":"Reopened on 04/2/17 - And the food is great as always. :) The Restaurant kept the same floor plan, but updated everything."}
{"text":"Reliably better than average food at a fair price. However, the old fashioned decor (which is simply OLD and out of fashion) is a total turnoff, as are the remarkably tight booths, which are for midgets only. And while the tasty burgers, wraps and other dishes can be a treat, we also have a years-long running joke about Yours Truly's almost patented \"brown lettuce salad\" since it is about 100% likely you'll get some in any salad ordered, as we have over the years."}
{"text":"I've certainly eaten my share of meals at YT. And generally it's been good. Although the quality has been slipping over the years.. both the food, prep, and service. The Beachwood location is \"tight\"--like cramped.. But it's always been that way so no biggie. Also, some of the waitresses need to be put out to pasture. I mean seriously. Give me a break.
Also I'd like to see options for \"healthier\" alternatives.. like organic eggs, real butter, etc."}
{"text":"I've been to this location so often over the years they should name a seat after me. The food used to be good, now is just \"okay\". Same with the waitress staff.. at least as of 6 months ago. I got tired of the \"old-bag\" routine from a couple of them and haven't been back. (they sure showed me) I think there should be an age, or at least attitude limit.. seriously. Like the Beachwood location, they need to cut the old grumpy wood.
Also, it'd be nice to see \"healthier\" breakfast alternatives. And no I don't mean Tofu and bean curd. Like organic eggs, real butter, decent fruit, avocado, etc.
Place used to be \"fun\". Friendly (and kinda HOT) waitresses, decent (and HOT) food, nice location. Anymore it's just \"blah\". They need to go back to basics.
And open the freaking blinds already! Egads let some light in that place. It's like they're vampires in there. Heck, maybe they ARE!"}
{"text":"Very small place with great service! Friendly staff always checking in to see if I needed something else. Had a burger that was prepared well(good work in the kitchen-hot food and short wait) ..liked the Cole slaw too."}
{"text":"I am torn, nay heartbroken with this place. I absolutely love their food however I absolutely hate the \"everything is a la carte ordering,\" every server stares at you like a deer in the headlights if you stray from the menu in any way, and special orders definitely upset them. I hate it when the server refills my glass, touching the glass I drank from to the pop machine where other glasses that others drank from have touched. disgusting. They never come back to the table to check until you are almost done eating, and do not understand the \"salads and appetizers come before the meal in america\" concept. 
Their staff is not knowledgeable about their food or what drinks are available, our server was so confused about the beer selections, we skipped the beers, she lost herself some money there. she did not suggestively sell anything, if i was her boss she would be re trained or let go. She was offended by us and proceeded to talk s**t to one of her other tables about us and how \"difficult\" we were, because we asked questions? really? The table whom she engaged in conversation, were two servers from one of our other favorite restaurants, where we spend a lot of money on a weekly basis both dining in and taking out. Because they engaged her in this conversation and were so vocal about what awful human beings we are, and because they proudly announced \"we work at Petie's\" we won't be eating there anymore either. 
Service is consistently bad, always has been, every six months or so we give them another chance, every time we are disappointed, we will not be back. I have been in the restaurant business myself for 22 years and I work too hard for my tips and my customers to waste my money here. 
We did leave an almost  30% tip. she has to make a living somehow and we aren't douchebags despite what she said."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the smallest restaurant you'll ever set foot in. 

We're regulars at Yours Truly (both this one and the one in Mayfield Village), and what keeps us returning is the wide variety of choices on the menu (including their all-day breakfast), the quality food, and the friendly service. 

Due to the restaurant's size, it often gets quite cramped, especially at peak hours. So cramped, in fact, that the servers often need to reach over other tables to hand you your food. This isn't exactly ideal, but it's worth it because the food's just that good. 

The service is usually pretty friendly. No complaints there. 

The parking lot, like the amount of seating in the restaurant, is limited. It can occasionally be difficult to find a place to park. 

Overall, Yours Truly is a solid choice for a meal, whether it's seven in the morning or nine at night. There's really not many restaurants like it in this part of town."}
{"text":"Notso fries, fun atmosphere, delicious breakfasts, sandwiches and again, the notso fries!"}
{"text":"If you stick to the burgers and the breakfast items, you'll be fine. Most people will recommend the Notso fries, but (and this is where my Cleveland cred gets revoked) I think they're too soggy. Why douse a perfectly good cottage fry with dairy goop?"}
{"text":"Kind of your typical American eatery it had a lot of more traditional/homestyle stuff that are great for dinner. Pretty good to go to for lunch if you are in the area. Definitely try the notso fries, they are worth your trip."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant. Good for kids also. They have a Thomas the Train set in the back and also a tv. Good food. Nothing outstanding, just good."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast...my wife, son and I were treated to a delicious meal. 

We had a great time in a wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a place where the food is always good, there's always a crowd, and even my seven-year-old daughter loves it!  Sure, the booths could be bigger and there could be a better waiting area, but the intimate feel is all part of the charm of Yours Truly.  I'm new to the area, but YT has become a family favorite already."}
{"text":"Fun place, decent food...But don't let them seat you in the back room, or what I would call the \"Black hole\".  If you're seated there, leave and come back another day...Or simply bring a snack to ride you over until the wait staff decides to make eye contact with you."}
{"text":"I've ate at this establishment many times with a good experience 9 times out of 10. But the thing that tainted this visit was the waitress. Her service was reprehensible, obscenely delayed and unorganized. People who were seated after us were served before us. And not only was the waitress clueless but so was the manager. In one phrase: ONE BIG MISTAKE"}
{"text":"I have only been to Yours Truly a couple times.  I ordered the French toast last weekend.  It wasn't amazing, but it is good.  Previously, I ordered some sort of Mac'n'cheese that was delicious!  Rich and creamy!  

Service is decent, our waiter kept the water refills coming, which was much appreciated since we were sitting outside. 

All in all, a cute little restaurant to visit, with yummy food."}
{"text":"A local chain with consistently good food, served well. Great milkshakes. Excellent service. Prices might be a wee bit higher than similar food would command elsewhere. Yuppie alert. Family friendly and attractive, lots of wood and brass and victorian-esque wall-coverings. Good parking. Can be quite busy at lunch and dinner. Some locations (e.g. Shaker Square) do not quite match up to the others, but this and Valley View are great places for a family meal or an informal business lunch."}
{"text":"We visited Yours Truly for the first time on a business trip and couldn't believe how small this little place was!  Despite the small quarters and the wait time we decided to wait it out given the solid referral we received from our hotel.  So glad we did!  Angela and Leah made us feel right at home giving us coffee while we waited.  The tight quarters gave opportunity to lots of funny exchanges and we had so much fun with these hard working ladies.  We sampled lots of delicious comfort foods and genuinely felt like this would be a favorite spot if we were locals.  Go in and say hi to Angela and Lea from Susan and Mohammad."}
{"text":"I have only come to this place for breakfast -- several times over the last few years, when I am visiting my Mother in Hudson. And I get the same thing -- two huge blueberry pancakes which drink all the maple syrup they can serve. The result is good, satisfying, filling, and likely raising my cholesterol count to absurd levels. Coffee, on the other hand, needs some work.

I like this place -- it is as close as you are going to get in self-consciously upscale Hudson to a diner. The ambiance is a 1990s vision of what 1890s decor should look like. It is a \"ye olde\" look that, in and of itself, reflects an era now passed. One suspects the redecoration will be coming soon -- though I hope they just keep tings as they are. There is nothing wrong with a time capsule as long as the food is good."}
{"text":"The location in Shaker Square is only slightly better than its sister on Chagrin Boulevard. I've been to the former on four occasions, and the servers were very courteous and attentive. The milkshakes are rich without being sickening and the gyros are seasoned just right, but other items fall short. I ordered the quarter-pound burger twice - once rare and once medium - and it was always overcooked. The bun was also sopping with grease and the burger itself began to fall apart about halfway through. 

The biggest disappointment are the sweet potato fries. This is one of my favorite snacks when it comes to American classics, and while the texture/cut of the fries was sufficient, the lack of sea salt or spice rendered the whole dish lackluster. I felt it was a waste, especially since the size of the portion was relatively substantial.

Not an impressive establishment, but I'm sure there are standouts I have yet to try."}
{"text":"What happened to this place poor service, bad coffee, cold food 30 min ticket time.. Never again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service. However it is extremely tiny and hard to get a table. Still worth it though."}
{"text":"Adorable quaint establishment.  I had salmon caesers salad and artichoke appetizer.  Oh,  and root beer float!  Good was great!"}
{"text":"We are on a road trip and enjoy trying new places. This is a great little dinner/restaurant!  Not super expensive, the staff is fun,  food was a nice twist from the traditional. Our server was feisty and seemed to enjoy her job and her clientele. She was great with suggestions for our meal when we asked. I had the \"envelope \" with humus and grilled chicken. Cooked to perfection, it was delicious, messy goodness. My husband had the chicken Reuben. He is a traditionalist when it comes to his favorites but he thoroughly enjoyed the detour!"}
{"text":"So we just ordered food to-go. I specifically asked for hearty mac and cheese WITH CHICKEN. I live 20 min. Away in Wickliffe and get home and there's no chicken. I call to let them know the mistake they made and the girl Brittany who answered the phone said and I quote \"well you didn't get charged for the chicken\" as if somehow that makes their mistake better. I didn't even get a manager I was so mad. Yeah, I didn't get charged for the chicken YOU FORGOT, BUT INSTEAD PAYED $6.80 FOR A LUNCH IM NOT GOING TO EAT NOW. Tell me how that seems okay in customer service. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"This place is best for breakfast!  Outdoor seating, a bar you can sit at. A family place."}
{"text":"Once again Yours Truly Hudson takes the \"prize\" for being my LEAST favorite location for this popular northeast Ohio restaurant chain. Though we live closer to the Hudson Yours Truly, we generally ignore it and choose to drive to either the Valley View or Shaker Heights locations.

Unfortunately, today I stopped in at the Hudson YT. Let me say that I and my family eat at Yours Truly fairly often. The Hudson location is THE ONLY LOCATION where I've experienced an \"attitude.\" 

I won't go into all the \"gory\" details of my visit today, however, this is not the first time I have experienced an \"attitude\" that was less than welcoming at Yours Truly in Hudson. In addition, my husband also felt snubbed on an occasion when he and my daughter ate here without me. 

Apparently only SOME customers are worthy of being treated with courtesy at this location. I will definitely think twice about spending my money at a restaurant where I am not welcomed. Also, I would not recommend it to others. 

For me, how you are treated influences how you enjoy your meal. My daughter and her friend ate today, but I didn't even bother to order due to my experience. Your experience may be different, but I won't be back to this location for a while."}
{"text":"Really enjoy going with the family. My kids always love going in and getting shakes.  Food and service are wonderful.  They have the best Notso fries!"}
{"text":"It started off a bit frustrating but because of the food, I concluded that my visit to this charming restaurant was one I do not regret. As soon as I walked in, I quickly observed the various amounts of friends and families enjoying themselves as well as the delightful smell of food. It made me feel happy and ready to eat! My visit only became frustrating when the waitress asked if we needed a minute to look over the menu. Since there were so many delicious options, we had to comply. That minute turned into about fifteen minutes of us sitting there anxious and hungry. We were very bothered but when we finally ordered, things took a definite turn for the better. The food came out so fast it was hard to believe. It was dinner time and I had a wonderful breakfast meal while my friend had lunch which tells you how appeasing the restaurant is. Our meals were so outstanding that our frustration quickly disappeared. Because of the lovely environment, the various options on the menu, and of course the scrumptious food, I highly recommend taking a trip down to Yours Truly Restaurant."}
{"text":"I was rather unimpressed with this restaurant.  it was entirely a \"diner\" kind of place - friendly but rushed staff, uninspired food, everythin greasy and safe.

I'd suggest grabbing the notso fries if you're interested in something a little fun and covered in bacon.  The sliders I had were certainly acceptable, but nothing worth recommending.

The only thing that was truly bad about the restaurant was the speed of service. Even though I was there later in the evening, when not many other diners were around, the waitress was slow (but friendly) and always seemed like she was in a rush."}
{"text":"The service at Yours Truly has always been fast when I've dined there, despite the number of customers.  I went in for a quick bite with my mom and brother, and they delivered speedily.

I ordered the Turkey Reuben, which was pretty average and a little greasy.  It came with two slices of fresh melon, which was a nice touch.  My brother's General Tso's Chicken was piled high with rice and drenched in sauce, and consisted of relatively few pieces of chicken compared to the volume of rice and a portion one might receive at a Chinese restaurant.  My mom liked her hamburger.

The staff was attentive and refilled our coffee frequently.

Overall, their menu selection just isn't my taste, and I find it challenging to locate many healthy options.  For their versatility, I would think that they might have more selection.  It's also priced a little high for the quality I received."}
{"text":"I have been to three of their locations. The first time years ago i was so impressed. After the last two visits i probably would not return here. The evening started well. The hostess greeted us and couldn't wait to seat us. We wanted to wait to see where our group of 6 to decide where to sit. 3 ppl came to try to seat us while waiting. wow such service this should be a good nite. it was 600pm there three tables in the restaurant on Friday night.

WE were seated outside at our choice and then proceed to wait 25 minutes for a server to arrive. She finally did and gave a long story about why no one was out to serve us yet. she took our drink order and returned a couple minutes later. didnt remember who ordered what and only brought one of two beers ordered.
i had a pepsi the cost 1.95$ it did not taste good and was in  tiny glass filled with ice to the brim.

our app finally arrived and we barely got in our mouth when oh here is your food too.
the artichoke appetizer was bland. and a bit cold. i had the greek salad which despite all the spices in the dressing was so bland. there was no flavor to the dressing at all.

they also forgot two side dishes and finally brought them 20 minutes after the dinner was served. the fries were also bland and cold. the rice was awful. it claimed to be saffron rice but had no flavor what so ever. plain white rice is more flavorful then this.
the others seemed to like their fish fry.

This place seems to have alienated the locals and managed to extract any flavor from their dishes. i am no impressed at all."}
{"text":"The service was confused. We talked to 3 different service people.  The 3rd person was our actual waiter.  It didn't seem like they were super busy, just moderately busy, but the service was on the slower end. We never got waters. We finally asked for waters after the meal was over.  (My girl friend was thirsty after eating.)  The service was subpar. But everything was friendly, casual, and a nice vibe overall.  (I still tipped the waiter over 20% because that's what you should do unless you get absolutely horrible service.)

The food was decent but nothing spectacular. It took a while to get our food and when we did,  my fries and coleslaw were not ready and I had almost finished my sandwich by the time my fries were brought to the table.   I got the chicken cordon bleu sandwich-- I ordered it with onions but of course they forgot the onions.  It was generally tasty except the chicken was a little tough.

Lastly, I just wanted to mention the decor. Looking back on it,  it's kind of weird.  On the walls are pictures of bright shiny faces of people working at a Yours Truly restaurant.  Isn't that kind of weird?  It's like the walls of the restaurant are an advertisement for the restaurant itself. Plus there's some writing on the walls mentioning dishes you can get at Yours Truly.  All I can think is why not beautify the walls with something picturesque?  I'm already in your restaurant, so why put what appears to be quasi-adervtising on the walls?

I would eat here again but that's only because it's hard to find good basic diner food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  really small but worth it if you have to wait. We sat at the counter and I had a great ciabatta and eggs over hard with spinach and tomatoes!  Delicious!  and I don't recall this offering at the other locations. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible from service to food. The portions are extremely small and the prices are extremely high. The kill it skillet kills your wallet more than your hunger. I have never written a review but due to the terrible experience I was impelled to write. The manager was sent only to be rude and disrespectful. You don't have to guess I WILL NEVER COME BACK AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU."}
{"text":"great food, with reasonable prices for the quantities you get. the staff was friendly and their suggestions were spot on."}
{"text":"We have been YT fans for years and have tried almost all the locations in Cleveland. The Shake Square location is terrific and has the best breakfast in town. Monster hash is a must if you want to splurge on some calories and the oatmeal is a home run if you want to be healthy. We love the flavored coffees, too.

If you are going for lunch or dinner, I highly recommend the always-yummy tostado!"}
{"text":"Food still excellent. . . Service was adequate.  Not a busy night and sat at bar with my sister for the artichoke heart appetizer with a glass of pinot grigio and a twisted lemonade.  Drinks ran out and had to hail a server, she never checked back for a refill.   We did add the hummus platter to our order and it was very good although the pita bread was a bit stale. Massive amounts of hummus helped remedy the dry pita."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here many times and it has always been good with good service.  This time I had dinner.  The menu offers a good choice of entries.  I ordered cod with grilled onions and spinach, rice and coleslaw.  I was amazed when it arrived to the table.  There was \"truly\" enough rice and coleslaw for more than two people!  My sister's helping of fish was very large too.  Neither of us could near finish the meal!  My biggest complaint of this meal was that the rice was under cooked and cold.  The fish was very good.  This is a nice family place to eat.  Nothing fancy and it is quite noisy just from people talking.  There's a little bar there with TVs on too.  I would recommend it for a great breakfast or brunch though."}
{"text":"Like a Denny's but more expensive.  I gave this restaurant \"chain\" a second chance, but our visit to Medina and Hudson locations made me ask the same question, \"why do people like this place?.\"  Totally bland mediocre food and the menu might as well be a la carte.  One might assume that their $8 or $9 dollar sandwich would include fries, NOT SO FAST MY FRIEND...  Fries are extra, of course because who would include fries with a sandwich?  Oh wait that right, pretty much any restaurant would include a side.  But then again these restaurants tend to be in areas where most people drive cars that cost more than the average house in Akron so maybe they don't care about being ripped off.  This place reminds of the type of restaurant that grandparents love and drag the rest of their unwilling family to; but they would deal with it because Nanna is paying.  When in Hudson I would rather go to Aladdins or heck, even Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was excellent.   I had the pleasure of sitting next to the owner's wife - she was such a sweetheart! greeted everyone as they came in and made sure I had everything I needed.  Absolutely made my experience.  Will definitely be coming back.

Would highly recommend the Monster Hash....and the Baily's and Coffee :)"}
{"text":"We were just there for lunch, loved our waitress Donna but..... I got a chopped salad  and bit into an olive pit. Okay, not happy but understand how it can happen. However when I bit into a plastic bread tag, that was it! Could not take another bite. Donna did take the salad off the bill. I filled out a comment card and asked her to give to the manager which she did. The manager took forever to come to address my issue even though she was just sitting at the counter. She just blew off my concerns saying this stuff happens?????!!!!. Yes they took off the salad but they should have taken off half the bill at the least. LAST VISIT there."}
{"text":"I like this place. Nice atmosphere and good food. Can get pretty busy but they seem to deal with it ok."}
{"text":"This place is great. They accommodated my extra large family in town for my brothers wedding.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Yours Truly for breakfast. The food was awful! The coffee was really strong with no flavor and the cream was not real. My husband ordered Eggs Benedict and I the Corned Beef Hash. The minute the plates were set down I was disappointed. The hash was clearly from a can, dumped on the griddle and the Benedict was Luke warm with flavorless hollandaise that resembled gelatin. I didn't eat mine and was surprised that the waitress didn't ask why. I didn't want to pay for it, but my husband stopped me from asking for a manager. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times for breakfast, but only because it's close. The food is so so, not anything special. Just the usual menu you'll see at any other restaurant. So if you want the usual, here is, no surprises. They have their signature eggs, but that's only because they don't poached eggs. When I did asked for poach, the waitress said \"we don't do poached eggs\". The service is consistantly, extremely slow. One thing is for sure, breakfast, lunch or dinner, the service is consistant. Slow. I have sat through 2 cups  of coffee (15mins) before any wait staff takes my order and other 4 cups (20mins) before I get my meal. If you're hungry and can't stand to watch others eat, this not the place for you. I don't come here anymore. My mornings are too valuable."}
{"text":"Excellent service with a smile and just a bit of attitude. Good old fashioned comfort food, prepared well. Good portion sizes.  Spotless cleanliness even in the restroom. What's not to like?
If you're not giving them five stars, what are you missing? 
Montana was our server. She should train every server (everywhere) about the importance of being nice, and showing up to talk to the guests once in a while. 
When in the area I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just small town good.

I don't think I can write a fair review of this place.  It has a romantic sentimentally for my wife and I.  This place is more than just this place it is an extension of the entire town.  Nothing is wonderful about Yours Truly it is just perfectly good.  You always wait for a table and the wait is always friendly. 

Order the \"Notso Fries\""}
{"text":"Yours Truly has the best family atmosphere and is and great place to have fun with friends and family! Great food as well!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a free entrée so we decided to try this place for dinner.  What mistake the dinner menu selection is very limited mostly sandwiches, The few meals on the menu did not have one thing that I liked.   So I decided to get a Reuben and my wife got a hamburger while to my surprise it was not a corn beef it was chicken I asked the waitress if it was corn beef she said yes. I never in my life heard of a chicken Ruben. So I had her take that sandwich back and I ordered a Montecristo instead that was one of the worst sandwiches I ever had, everything was soggy bread the cottage fries. It was very very bland in taste. My wife hamburger nothing special she said the burgers at steak and shake are much better cheaper. This place may be good for breakfast but forget the dinners. Of course I should've realized before we even walked in it was not that good they were only about six people in the place and this was the dinner hour needless to say we will not be back here."}
{"text":"Slow service, the food wasn't very good.  I think it's a place that's good for breakfast, but lunch or dinner...not so much.  Wicked fast wifi though!"}
{"text":"Yum! Food is awesome and fast. The wait staff is great-they know the menu, and are friendly! Great all the way around!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite breakfast spots in Lake County!  This cute little place definitely gives to that old diner feel, especially with the really awesome wrap around dine-at counter and AMAZING hand dipped milk shakes (I highly suggest your order one or you'll be sorry).  

I will say that anything on the breakfast menu will be delicious - I have not once had a disappointing meal and neither should you.  I'm a big fan of the eggs benedict and the veggie omelet and I've also had bites of the pancakes (sorry, you eat with me and order something that looks super yummy I'm going fork first into your plate!!  well, if that's ok...).  I've also ordered takeout for lunch and the food is also quite good, but definitely nowhere near the mouth watering-ness of the breakfast delights.  One more thing, you HAVE to (I really mean HAVE to) try the flash fried artichoke hearts - with ranch, obvi!  What was it - pringles that said \"once you pop you can't stop\"??  Well, apply this philosophy to these awesome little appetizers!

My only gripe is how crowded this place gets.  Try and get there early on the weekends for breakfast because you and everyone else in Mentor are all thinking the same thing - yours truly!!  If you end up waiting, don't get frustrated - the payoff is worth it."}
{"text":"We frequent Yours Truly fairly often and we have noticed the prices going up and the portions getting smaller. Last night I had their Friday Nigh fish fry and was serve 2 small pieces about half of what you used to get. 

I committed to the server about the small portion and she offer to get me another piece of fish which was nice and I accepted her offer. 

Other than this everything else was very good and enjoyable."}
{"text":"You can't get better family food than this local chain. Most now have limited wine beer breakfast anytime. The chagrin road is tiny and often has a wait. But it's worth it
Great burgers too don't hesitate to go to any of their spots. The valley view has outside dining by the canal"}
{"text":"Food is nothing to get excited about. Not very creative and not prepared very well.

It's usually quite busy for breakfast which means your food is prepared in a rush. I ordered a spinach and mozz omelette. It was siting in a pool of liquid and the raw spinach had just been shoved in by the handful. I had to remove the spinach to cut it up before I attempted to eat the portions that were edible. 

The pancakes and French toast ordered at my table looked decent. As did the hashbrowns. They also serve booze, which is nice for a brunch outing. 

They have really gone down hill over the years and it's disappointing.  I wish they would put some time and effort into the menu and the preparation of the food."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a tiny grilled cheese (no fries) that cost $7 after tax and tip. Don't bother coming here. This was a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Perfect small place for breakfast. We received prompt excellent service. Food was great too."}
{"text":"I like this place because they are near. But that doesnt meam it is my fav. I like the food better at the beachwood location but like the fact i can take the dog  to shaker sq. I get the hashbrowns with green peppers and onions and veggie envelope with house dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Cramped and noisy filled with screaming kids and terrible service. The food has gone downhill severely. I gave this place three chances before writing this review and all three times I went and sat down at the counter and was ignored for over 10 minutes. I live within walking distance and I will never ever go there again"}
{"text":"One of the reasons why I like this place so much is the fact that the service at Yours Truly is some of the best you can find anywhere in the area (Mentor, OH). The whole menu is fairly priced and the portions are just right. I usually get the omelettes and they have always been consistently delicious. The key lime tart is also very good, you can't go wrong with one of their yummy pies."}
{"text":"The food here isn't amazing, but it's a nice place for students to go after school or to work at."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I had the French toast, which was great. There is good, fast service. It is a smaller place and there were a good amount of people there, so it was pretty cramped. There was about a 15 minute wait but it was worth it. One thing that I noticed was that there were two pairs that were not there together but we're sitting extremely close to one another. Some people may not mind that but personally, I wouldn't enjoy that."}
{"text":"i've eaten @ yours truly hundreds of times & it's always good

today i had a veggie omelet & of course, cottage fries

as always, everything was fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"We waited for 45 minutes to be seated as the hostess was seating parties of two at tables big enough for four people and a single diner was also sat in a four person booth. They really need more training for their staff and the place was not as clean as i remember and it could stand a thorough cleaning.  The food was good,  the prices are a little high for lunch and the service was ok.  The waitresses can electronically take your order at your table but don't ask any questions or expect eye contact while this is going on or you'll ruin her concentration.  I wish i could rate this restaurant with more stars but they really don't deserve it. The experience with the hostess ruined or while experience.  Not a place you can pop into for a quick lunch and if you have to get back to work within an hour you might want to think about going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch before a wedding with a few friends. We were all from out of town and had never heard of Yours Truly before and decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed!! Delicious, large portions, the most friendly and warm staff, and a really welcoming atmosphere. All for a very, very reasonable price. I sometimes come to the area for work, and now I excited to come back and eat at Yours Truly again!"}
{"text":"After we were seated it took right about 15 min to get 2 coffees. By 32 minutes we had our breakfast of Eggs Benedict and Eggs Bruschetta. The ham on the Benedict was extremely fatty and the spinach on the Bruschetta was not picked. See the posted picture of what remained from me doing the kitchen's prep. The waiter returned to ask how everything was and I was still in the middle of picking their spinach for them. His response was that's how it arrives. So apparently they must not do \"prep\". The previous comment about how the food tasted right of the Sysco truck was ringing all too true.

The positive, it's a nice location in downtown Hudson and the decor inside was nice. Service was terrible and food was not acceptable. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Expected more! The service was slow and not at all welcoming or friendly. My daughter who is always the first to jump to waitresses defense was even speechless. They were out of redskin potatoes , then pink lemonade and then out of the daily fish fry. Not looking to return anytime soon after spending $70 on 5 people no drinks and was only supposed to be a quick stop."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Also, I got a lemon for my water and it was unnecessarily fresh. I got my hand drenched from squeezing it."}
{"text":"Not the most amazing of restaurants, surely, but if you're in the mood for breakfast fare it doesn't get much better.

The food is standard, but done well enough. When I requested my poached eggs to be cooked to death, they even listened to me. That rarely happens.

Approach the place as a diner, and you'll walk out satisfied. Try to chalk it up to anything more, and I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"My family and I have been YT fans for over 30 years and we were extremely excited about the re-opening of the Beachwood location. Yay! Natso Fries! For years, this has been our favorite spot!  

Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with our most recent experience. With the new renovations, the customers have more of a view of the kitchen. It really didn't seem very clean and considering there were so many people in the kitchen (very chaotic and not in that charming diner kinda vibe), there were several items forgotten from our order. 

The floors were dirty. The counters were smudged. Our glasses, plates and flatware were extremely cloudy and old, as if the dishwasher didn't do a thorough job. This is strange considering this restaurant JUST opened. Additionally, it was quite disgusting to see unwrapped straws on the counter subject to any cough or sneeze from other patrons. 

All and all, the food was still the same and our server, albeit a bit disoriented, was very sweet and professional. 

I hope this isn't the new YT standard."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great value. Breakfast was delicious. We had the Suntoast and the AM Breakfast wrap. The salsa that came with the wrap seemed store-bought but the wrap was great. The rest of their menu also looked really good, wide variety. They have some outdoor seating on their patio and our dog was able to join us there. All the staff were very friendly and prompt. They even brought out water and a piece of bacon for our dog! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a solid diner that serves breakfast all day.    The service has always been prompt and acceptable.

The Notso fries with the melted cheese, bacon and sour cream is definitely the stand-out item on the menu.  The cottage fries used provide a perfect flat surface for scooping up all the topping and they provide plenty of toppings.  

They have a variety of midwestern classics that they execute well."}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family to eat.  My favorite is notso omlette.  It's awesome.

The ranch dressing is also delish!  I"}
{"text":"YT is a great, intimate, and casual eatery.  It is family owned which manifests itself in the service of the friendly staff and the wide range of menu items appropriate for \"any reason\" dining.  

I often have business meetings in the AM, to go lunches - it gets crowded quick at lunch time, with limited seating, and eat with family too where everyone can find something to eat.  The team at Audimute Soundproofing eats regularly this place and has done so for many years.  We have yet to have a bad meal or poor service experience, even with our  orders to go.

Reasonable prices and a pleasant community of regulars abound in  an elegantly designed, throwback diner atmosphere.  It's probably the closest you will get to Cheers without the expansive bar, even though they do serve beer and wine.

Many folks love their breakfasts, as the omelettes are large and delicious.  YT does breakfast anytime!  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and not to be missed.  They offer plenty of healthy breakfast choices and everything is made to order.  Freshness and friendliness is clearly a priority making YT one of my favorite places to eat casually.

The only improvement that could make the experience better would be more seating.  I have recently learned that an expansion is planned which could only be a good thing."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard good things about Yours Truly, so we stopped in recently for a between-appointments breakfast.  We were very happy with the food and the service!

Jenn A waited on us and did a wonderful job!  She was quick to get drinks and take our order, and was very attentive to us.  For instance, my wife was holding her phone overhead for some silly reason, but Jenn came over and asked if we needed anything?  She thought Mary was trying to identify a song playing in the background and offered to go look at the stereo in the office to see what was playing!  THAT exemplifies \"above and beyond!\"

We both had tea and Jenn made sure we had plenty of hot water, then offered us \"to go\" cups with more hot water.  

The food was delicious and arrived relatively quickly, even though the restaurant seemed fairly busy.  The portions were also very generous.  I noted that the management apparently believes in having plenty of wait staff available, so none of the servers seemed rushed or overworked.

We had about 70 minutes between appointments in the area.  We were able to order and eat without rushing and still made it to our next appointment without any problem at all.

The restaurant was clean and well-maintained.  There were no sticky spots on the table and no slick spots on the floor.

The management apparently is involved with the community, as well.  There were a couple \"announcement\"-type flyers up and there was even a bicycle and sign on display for the local police fundraiser raffle.  +++ points for community involvement!

The prices are just a *bit* on the high side, but certainly not outrageous.  However...a clean, happy place to eat with great food and friendly wait staff is worth another two or three dollars!  

We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my cousins, they always bring me here. They're regulars and get greeted by name. The servers all know them and I think that's why my cousins think it's the best place ever.

My opinion: meh. I've been in for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Nothing has ever been spectacular.... I'd say it's better than Bob Evans, but not impressive in any real way. (Now that I'm thinking back on it, the iced tea IS above average. But that's probably the best thing I have to say about it.)

YT makes this huge deal out of their potatoes.... I think they call them cottage potatoes.... Whatever the name, they're flat french fries. They arrive in huge bags, frozen. Then they're dumped in the deep fryer. WHY DO PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT THEM?!?!?

I'll get dragged in next time I'm in town. It won't be kicking and screaming, but I will definitely not suggest it on my own."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a good traditional American meal, especially for breakfast. Starting my day with the sunrise breakfast and a fresh squeeze orange juice is the best thing ever! Tiny but cuty place, it is the first restaurant and then a couple of other opened in Ohio. I like this place!"}
{"text":"This is the second time i have gotten home and the take out order was wrong.  Disappointing and just not worthh driving back into town to have the order fixed.  I just think it should be right the first time.  I feel as though the quality has decreased over the years."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a very quaint diner.  There's a really relaxing and friendly atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I stopped by for brunch on a Saturday morning and waited for about 10 minutes.  The place is seriously tiny.  There's seating for about 20 people at the tables and about 8 people at the bar.

We both ordered off the breakfast menu.  The meal was fantastic, portions plentiful and tasty.  I only finished about half of my plate, but my bf finished his.  The tangy limeade was a fresh squeezed, which I was very pleasantly surprised by and enjoyed very much.  The wait staff were friendly.  

All in all, we would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Good food, manager is very rude and disrespectful and she's like that to everyone, sending her waitresses to speak with the guest when asking for her
#yoursTruly"}
{"text":"Stopped in early in the morning before work to have breakfast with friends since it was close to where I live. The place was quiet and the staff was very friendly. We all enjoyed the food that we got, thogh the pancakes could've been a bit fluffier. Otherwise I would come back as my friends enjoyed themselves and the convenience of its location."}
{"text":"The tiny restaurant shocked me - I was not expecting to see how SMALL this restaurant really is! There were 5-6 tables with 2 sets of 2-person tables, 2 booths, and bar seating. This restaurant is NOT for the claustrophobic, and NOT for the anti-social. 

When we were seated, we sat next to complete strangers. The menu had a great variety, and I ordered the spiciest omelet they had. It wasn't anything special, it was just like the omelets I make at home, which meant that it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were fantastic, especially with the Tango sauce, which is mustard based. 

The ambiance in this restaurant is very interesting, and definitely not for shy people."}
{"text":"I like this place...my dad and I try to go here biweekly on Sundays. It's got a laid-back feel. Our waiter/waitress is always friendly and knowledgeable. The food is good, but some of the items are overpriced for their size/quality. I gave this place 4 stars because I'm big on customer service and everyone besides the waiters always look like they want to shoot themselves...and if you ask them anything they always have an attitude, say nothing, and find someone else to answer your simple question.

But they get points for being dog friendly, I've seen some people take their dogs with them and sit outside, with them tied close-by outside of the fenced area. I took my dog there once."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very reasonable price! My mother and I had the veggie burger and cottage fries which were both excellent!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here with my daughter.   Service was very slow.  Do they really need nearly 15 minutes to prepare and serve a couple omelets?   The waitress vanished for long periods.  When the food finally came, my omelet was dry and both our omelets were prepared in a careless way:  the fillings were under the eggs with eggs just laying over them like a blanket.  Nothing was mixed up."}
{"text":"Very very slow service..... And a disappointing meal, especially for the wait we had on a not so busy night. The fish was mushy and honestly just gross.
I am definitely not in any hurry to go back, in fact I would not go back. On the upside, all the staff were extremely friendly. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the friendly staff!! Definitely not the quality or taste of the food."}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancee for brunch. As usual, this place was crowded. But our wait was only 10 minutes long  our server came right away to get our drink orders. She was friendly and nice. I ordered a Monte Cristo with a half order of sweet potato fries. My fiancee ordered a reuban burger with cottage fries. As usual we shared our meals with each other. The Monte Cristo was piled high with turkey and ham and was served with honey mustard. The reuban burger was cooked medium perfectly. Both were delicious. The only criticism I have is the seating. We were put at a table where the were people walking back and forth on each side of us , it kind of felt like we were on display. And the seats are not upolstered, just hard wood. Maybe that is how they turn tables so quickly."}
{"text":"I usually stop here at least once every time I come to town for business.  Seems to be popular place with the locals - always a good sign.  The menu has a lot of offering and breakfast is available anytime.  I usually go with the turkey Ruben.  I also recommend the the onion rings over the fries.  

They seemed to be a little under staffed on the floor.  Our waitress was working the counter and tables so service wasn't top notch today."}
{"text":"I don't understand how people like this place.  I ordered a chili cheese hotdog, and it was literally a store bought bun with a hotdog in it, chili from a can, and some of that fake yellow shredded cheese."}
{"text":"I am a fan of ALL Yours Truly in CLE. The food is always wonderful. This location is much larger than the Beachwood & Chagrin Falls locations and the wait is shorter here."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch.  The place was quite busy but the service was fast and efficient.  There were five of us.  We had the loaded potatoes, they were  good but quite heavy.  We had a variety of sandwiches and all were well prepared.  Nice atmosphere, good food and OK but not great service."}
{"text":"I feel like our waitress was embarrassed to bring us the food because it was so sad looking.  If I wanted a Boca burger and frozen fries (which were made late and brought at the same time as our check) I would have stayed home. I don't get it. They did comp  the fries because they were so late but that didn't improve the flavor."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week and had the Napa Spinach Salad with grilled chicken (baby spinach with grapes, strawberries, walnuts, dried cranberries and crumbled gorgonzola cheese, served with low fat strawberry vinaigrette.  This salad was surprisingly large and very tasty! If you're feeling healthy definitely try this salad, you won't be disappointed. 

My boyfriend had a chicken wrap and fries. He really enjoyed his meal said the sauce that came with it is what made it even better. The fries were shaped like gold coins, which I found a bit amusing. They tasted okay, nothing great. Again he loved them, but he grew up eating here so I think there is a bit of nostalgia mixed in.

Service was a bit slow (and it was later in the afternoon, after lunch rush hour) which made it a difficult place to to go while on lunch break from work. Took about an hour from sitting down to paying and leaving.

They have the kind of menu where you can find something for everyone which makes this is a great place to go when you have several people in your group and everyone wants something different.

I will definitely come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot for traditional fare. Eggs, toast, coffee; you get the picture. Every time I've been the service was a bit slow, and my over easy eggs came to me poached once. Other than that the dining experience was fine."}
{"text":"Had \"the Envelope\", was pretty bland in my opinion. Ordered the hummus on the side and it was alright, definitely doesn't place high on the list for me though.  

But the service was great and everything was nice and clean. 

I do look forward to trying other items in the future. All-in-all it was a decent experience and I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"I've been to three Yours Truly locations (Hudson, Mayfield Village, and Mentor) and all three are excellent. The Mayfield and Hudson locations tend to get crowded during peak hours. The food and service are consistently great. The menu is extensive and fairly priced. They have all-day breakfast, which I really like."}
{"text":"We stop in here occasionally for a good home-style breakfast. The food is always good and the service is always good. I do think it's a little pricey for breakfast food though."}
{"text":"There were a bunch of other local options during a recent jaunt in Chagrin Falls, but we needed diner food and quick. The A/C and fan were both on - freezing inside but felt great in the summer. I had a tuna melt and it was, as I told my mom, \"insanely good.\" It was made with cheddar as opposed to the usual American, and it was on an English muffin which was a great departure as well. My mom had the chicken salad on a pita which she also liked.

The service was really friendly. I have no complaints! Good for a quick (or more leisurely) bite."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day and made right. I had 2 eggs and hash browns that were cooked to perfection with a side of grits. Everyone was extremely friendly and very welcoming, the people here make you want to come back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday (Sunday) for breakfast for the first time with my wife. It was a very nice surprise and the food quality was excellent! Liked I could get turkey links instead of pork for a change. The food was hot and the coffee is included in the price which is not always the case when dining out. The service was also very friendly and fast even though it was busy. This will not be our last trip to this location! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were starving after church and stopped here for brunch. Got a seat right away at the counter. Ordered right away and were served drinks. Then we waited. And we waited. And we waited. I'm willing to bet the farm that my sandwich sat under the lights for nearly a half hour while hubby's pancakes were made, put up, sent back to reheat, put up, sent back. You get the idea. A half hour!  We left. Won't be back. Managers: you need to hire AND train more people to handle the Sunday after church rush. Simple as that."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get breakfast, lunch or dinner. The service here is always pretty good. The chicken sandwiches are good. The milkshakes are really good. They have some interesting dishes with loaded fries called Notso or something. Interesting Italian/Greek wrap and good burgers. Sweet Potato fries and the sauce are always good. 

If you get breakfast with eggs, make sure your eggs are cooked fully. Just a warning. We had some runny ones before. 

Overall interesting place with a nice cozy vibe with the woodwork etc. Could use some updating eventually and other music than 60's music. Please baby boomers!!...the 60's are gone!! Trippy music while I eat is not my favorite. Even if it is at a low volume."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Very small restaurant with  long lines during peak times. Cant stand the noise level since the remodel and won't go back."}
{"text":"This was a very nice brunch. The waiter was very quick and efficient. The atmosphere was very inviting and the food was delicious and filling. The 1star short of awesome was the silverware had some food stuck on it and that was a concern for me."}
{"text":"Love YT! I swear by the cottage fries and tango sauce. Its an establishment in Chagrin Falls - great breakfast, great milkshakes, and decent food all around. Head downtown, see the Falls, shop around, get some YT and finish with ice cream from the popcorn shop! I have to say, I tend toward the unhealthy stuff when I visit, but I have had and enjoyed both their spinach salad and asian veggies. I also adore their chicken noodle soup - certainly doesn't resemble anything out a can!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! That was my first time visiting. My boyfriend and I both had the Killit Skillit and Belgian waffles. I didn't think I could finish all that food, but I did. The service was excellent as well. I'll definitely be back to visit."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything but breakfast here, but they're pretty darn good at it! The corned beef hash is delicious and the Ranchero Omelette was fantastic! The eggs were SO FLUFFY and the spicy guacamole was on par with Mexican restaurants' offerings. 
The reason for three instead of four stars (the food earned the four, but service gets three): we were slightly forgotten when we sat outside on the patio.  Our server forgot a couple of other tables outside as well (she even said, \"Oh I forgot you were waiting out here.\" a couple of times). I understand that patio season just started, but the adjustment can't be that difficult..."}
{"text":"not-so fries are the bomb. When I come back I'm hitting this place up. Good milkshakes adnd they have a fish fry on fridays."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update and re-review. We went at lunch time and ordered breakfast. My husband's omelet was nice and hot, while mine had obviously sat so that the eggs could get that gross congealed look about them. On the bright side, it was not quite as greasy as when we had been there the last time. 

Management:  Get the wait staff some trays to carry out the dishes of food. We are not impessed that you make them line up plates on their arms, against their shirts, against other plates. Gross."}
{"text":"Maybe it depends on what you order here.  In fairness, everyone that mentions this place raves about the breakfast.  We went for dinner and choose any type of breakfast food so maybe that is where we went wrong.  I ordered a cup of chili with the works and a side of macaroni and cheese.  Both were okay.  The sweet potatoes fries are crispy and good."}
{"text":"So small and so good. I do not know how they make their omelets that fluffy. It's amazing. Try the sedona. Pretty much a Denver/Western omelet.  These guys never mess up a meal."}
{"text":"The salad I got was great, but the service was just ok. I sat at the bar, so the waitress was right in front of me, but I had difficulty getting my check. It is a very small place and it difficult to maneuver through and the bathroom was not exactly clean. If I eat there again, I will order takeout."}
{"text":"The Mayfield location I would say is comparable to all of the yours trulys. Same menu and the service is par. The food is pretty good and reasonably priced and they always have a featured menu with seasonal items etc. their breakfast is available all day which is a big plus. The lunch and dinner menu has everything from burgers, salads, some entrées and appetizers. They also have a selection of soups. It always seems that when I get takeout from here they miss something, Forget to put something in the bag that was paid for and or forget condiments. But overall it's a good place to get lunch or breakfast"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal or service here.  Great comfort food and amazing omelets.  I have no idea how it's humanly possible to get the eggs that fluffy.  However, these guys are geniuses and they do it the same at all of their locations.  The sliders were fantastic last time I went.  

Don't order healthy.  You'll be as unhappy as the reviewer Nancy B. was with granola, fruit and yogurt.  However, you can get an egg-white only omelet and it's still amazing."}
{"text":"First, best Greek omelette ever.  Eggs were soft and fluffy and the fillings were all fresh and flavorful.  Olives and cheese stood out.  

Service was top notch and the restaurant itself was clean and well organized.  I like all of the Yours Truly's around, but this one is my favorite.

Even though it is in Hutton, the prices are still normal people prices.

They run a special on Tuesday where you can get a choice of two; soup, salad or half sandwich for $5.00.  Given the sizes of their portions, probably a great deal."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a popular estbalishment  that if your from the area you most likely to run into your friends, co-workers or pastors or church staff. The food is awesome the staff is friendly and out of this world their nothing that you can complane about. One thing that i have to mention that if you want some where to watch recap of the game or say your going out to dinner with your family you can see the cleveland browns or indians play. 

  The bathroom is well cleaned and maintained."}
{"text":"I understand everybody is different, but the mark of a good kitchen, to me, is one that tells the guest- \"I can do whatever you want.\" I've given poor reviews to \"Chefs\" who do not offer substitutions, or specific orders.

I never deviate from the menu. I like to experience what a place offers, but my fiancee has specific tastes which no menu seems to please. So, she likes to deviate from the game plan. When we sat down at Yours Truly for a Breakfast Meeting with a California guest passing through, our waitress showed us the extensive menu, during a busy breakfast time, and stated: 

\"But, y'all can get whatever you want. Just let me know what you like, our cooks can do it for you.\"

Miraculously, we did not veer from the menu, and the food was good. The service was great. Normally, it would be 4 stars, but because the waitress challenged us to challenge the kitchen- 5 stars. I might take her up on the offer one day..."}
{"text":"I love Yours Truly but...not this location. Whenever I've come here I've had the worse customer service. The waiters and waitresses have been impersonal but I've always come here in grim agreement to meet with someone.

I little bit ago my husband and I decided to take my nephew out to dinner for his birthday. We left the choice of restaurant up to him and to our dismay he chose Yours Truly. It was kinda crowded so we were asked our name to be put on the list. We were told it was estimated around 20 minutes but 45 went by...then we noticed groups larger then us were being seated...then found out that he girl who asked for our name NEVER wrote it down!! She apologized repeatedly and hey, mistakes happen right? We kept our cool then as usual we were given a waiter that didn't give us the time of day. He took our drink order and I was starting to ask a question but he quickly turned around & walked away. I even yelled after him but he ignored me. W hen we thought nothing else would go wrong...the waiter came back and broke a glass over our table! He picked up a few pieces, never apologized and came back 20 minutes later with our food!! In the meantime my poor 11 year old nephew had a huge chunk of glass in his lap and we had tiny specks of glass on the table which we had to wipe off ourselves. I can't even imagine if a piece of glass flew in his eye and having to convey this to his mother! We never heard an apology when we were handed the bill nor did we have a penny taken off. My husband and I didn't want to make a huge stink over this while we were there since we were already late for our following plans but we did leave a customer comment card with our number on it. Of course we never heard a response. My assessment of this location is they're too busy for appropriate customer service. We're just a number of many in this crowded town. One thing we do know for sure..we will never step foot back here."}
{"text":"Love it here... Grew up coming to yours truly and then left town 25 years ago. Every trip back since, we make it an effort to always get lunch here. My son loves coming here and it is his favorite. Thank you so much for continuing to serve and deliver amazing food"}
{"text":"First time back for breakfast since the re-opening on 4/26/17. They kept the original building footprint but widened the interior space so that it feels more comfortable in the seating arrangements. The seats and booths are burgundy with white trim and the kitchen area is more visible. We've been coming here for years and they've kept the same great Yours Truly menus. Good to have them open since closing in February 2016."}
{"text":"I am truly very fond of Yours Truly. It has a lovely diner-esque atmosphere that is on the classier side of that realm without being pretentious. I never come here with just my family, but it's a really nice place to meet up with friends for brunch and a mimosa. The servers are ALWAYS friendly and welcoming, even joining in on a conversation you might be having while waiting. They greet you with a smile and are always ready with a coffee refill (the coffee isn't bad either!). Mentor has my favorite Yours Truly staff compared to the others as well. 

Because the wait times can be insane during breakfast/lunch/church rush (trust me - you do not want to be anywhere near that building at 9-11am on Sundays), I usually only come during off times. We didn't have any wait at 8am on Saturday (I would rather have been sleeping too.. but the notso fries..) or at 2pm on weekends. If you come at any other time, prepare for a 50 min wait. The kid-watching can be pretty cute while you're waiting, though, if you are a kid-person. 

I AM IN ¡LOVE! With YT's Notso Fries. I could eat them for every meal and have broken many a diet for them. I have even ordered both the notso omelet and notso fries for the same meal because I am insane and obsessed. I also really love their eggs bruschetta as a light changeup from my normal Sunrise. 

Yours Truly adds such character to Mentor's community, and I will continue to go when I have time to wait for an hour to get seated!"}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant in Chagrin Falls.  The menu is typical American fare with burgers and sandwiches, salads, and entrees. Nothing spectacular, but good food. Like many places in the Falls, its in an old building, so there is nice ambiance and character in the restaurant.

I'd recommend Yours Truly for lunch or a casual dinner - good for kids."}
{"text":"Yeh, been going there for years.  Tonight, two problems....

No Heat.  Seriously, just a clue turn off the ceiling fans!  I'd rather eat outside!

COLD food.  We saw it sit under the warming bin.  Not only our food under there for 20 minutes, but nice heating the cole slaw!

It's always been good and fast.  Tonight something was wrong!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to YT for 20 yrs and this is probably one of my favorites. They just finished a major remodel so it looks all shiney and new but the kept it the same tiny size so it's still as charming as ever. We had breakfast this morning and it was excellent as always. I had their signature Notso Omlet andy wife had the corned beef hash, my daughter lived the mouse pancakes."}
{"text":"Still very slow service.  And my omelet had a few stray mushrooms in it.  If you have 90 minutes to kill over a meal then eat here."}
{"text":"The service was ok.  Our waitress took forever to bring out our drinks, but the food was good (we were there for breakfast).  We sat on the patio and it was really nice but there were a lot of bees."}
{"text":"I had the kill it skillet, bad for me, but filling and pretty good.  The service was fine.  Go here when you want an old style breakfast any time of the day."}
{"text":"My mother said this is one of her favorite breakfast spots so when I came to visit she wanted me to give it a try. It's a nice little breakfast nook. Somewhat quaint. About the size of the average Waffle House but better quality food. I enjoyed my breakfast and the service."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, waitress offered suggestions for dinner, quick to refill my glass when it got low, etc. She just really did a great job of taking care of us. Notso omelet was delicious, my husband had the Mac 'n cheese with chicken and kept talking about the great taste. Will definitely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. I got a Cobb salad which was a great size and great. My experience was good except was irritated that the waitress gave me attitude when I asked for bleu cheese instead of gorgonzola. She responded in a sassy way \" they are the same thing but that's cool\" the comment was unnecessary and kind of ruined my mood. First of, gorgonzola is a type of bleu cheese with a stronger flavor. If it was the same it would be called bleu cheese...."}
{"text":"We went here because visiting Chagrin Falls is fun and great reviews means good breakfast. First the food was really good and I would have loved to rate it 4 stars, BUT...there was a hair in the food... and the bathrooms were pretty dirty...clean it up and I'll rate higher."}
{"text":"So this place gets 5-stars for location and 3-stars for food. I love the location in Chagrin because of the great people watching and dog watching. I would recommend sitting outside if possible to enjoy the view. The food here is basic diner food. I've been here twice and once had a burger, which was pretty good (not as good as Flip Side which is right down the street) and once had the buffalo chicken wrap which was yummy. Also had a milkshake here (Strawberry) which was good, but probably not made with fresh strawberries since there were no fruit chunks in it. Overall, this place is decent but not super impressive."}
{"text":"The best deal going at Yours Truely is their \"Happy Hour\" menu. Any of their burgers are $5.00. The flash fried artichokes are excellent. If I had to suggest one improvement, it would be their coffee. It's not that bad, but not that great either. 

The atmosphere is great at this particular restaurant. It's well lit and has a very clean appearance. We have dined at the Cuyahoga Falls YT also. More cozy/smaller, but same great service."}
{"text":"The Yours Truly chain of restaurants is a part of growing up in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland.  I've been going to every location since I was in diapers and I'll keep going back as long as I have a reason to go to Cleveland.

I started out on the kids menu, worked my way up through cheesburgers and cottage fries, past the Friday fish fry (yum!) and up to my current favorite: the special delivery.  This is one of my favorite burgers anywhere and always feels like home to me.  Sour cream, onions and mushrooms on a toasted bun with a side of cottage fries...this is heaven.  Pair that with one of their old-fashioned milkshakes and I don't even have words to describe the artery-clogging bliss!

The whole menu is good, though.  Although ordering anything and expecting it to be perfect isn't always a \"sure thing\", it's reasonable to expect that you'll go away happy.

The Chagrin Falls location is my \"home branch\" and I've been there for the ups and downs, including when the kitchen burned down and left the place closed for months while they fixed it up and renovated the whole place.  Now there's a great old-time feel that perfectly complements the restaurant's small-town location.  I always see a handful of people I know in here (except for the tourists), so it's a comfortable atmosphere that just feels right.

This restaurant is one of the best things that Northeast Ohio can truly call its own and I'm glad about that.  I hope they keep going strong for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yours Truly since I moved to the Chagrin Falls area in eight grade.  It is a great diner and quality is uniform across its numerous locations.  As many have stated, the notso fries are a must-have guilty pleasure and the chicken sandwiches are very good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is perfect for a relaxed lunch or dinner with friends or family.  I never have to wait too long.  The longest has been about 20 minutes on a Friday evening.  The prices are definitely reasonable and the food is always delicious.  I usually order more than one entrée and then share with whomever I'm there with.  There are enough vegetarian options to keep me happy.

A MUST TRY are the flash fried artichoke hearts! AMAZING!

Try and check out the outdoor seating area during the summer.  Very nice and the size is good.  You don't feel like you are on top of everyone else enjoying the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a Friday evening with my family. They weren't too busy and they sat us immediately. Our waitress was nice enough. She quickly took our drink orders, and brought them out. I had coffee which did the job. When it came time for food orders, I opted for the sunrise which included eggs, choice of meat, hash browns, toast and choice of drink. When our food came, the first thing I noticed was it was steaming hot. I usually consider that a good sign. Right away, I dove into the hash browns, which were hot, but bland... strike one. Next I went for the eggs. I was expecting some fluffy, steaming hot and well seasoned eggs. what I got was quite the opposite. The eggs were tasteless, dry and ice cold. How hard is it to make some eggs you ask? I wonder the same thing myself. After double disappointment, I decided to lift my spirits, and hopefully my taste buds, with bacon. Ya, they messed up the eggs, but it's nearly impossible to butcher some bacon (no pun intended). I almost had to give them credit... the bacon did in fact have flavor. However, I can't say it was good flavor. The bacon had a weird taste about it, and was also soggy. Strike three for this place. I've been told they have a good burger, and that may be true. Alas, I didn't come to yours truly in search of a burger, I came for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Tazza salad was delicious! The warm chicken on the bed of cold lettuce, spinach and veggies was wonderful. The honey mustard dressing made it perfect. The waitress was attentive, enjoyed the experience. $10 lunch."}
{"text":"Yours Truly has some good food.  Period.  Whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner- you will find something you like on the menu.  The location in Chagrin Falls is prime for a quick breakfast meeting, a luncheon or a family dinner.  If you get there during the rush, plan on being crammed in either next to the front door or the back door as the wait staff elbow their way through you.  It's just part of the appeal. 

For breakfast, try the YT Medley.  It's a pita with eggs, cheese and bacon in the middle.  It's great.  Everyone who visits us and we take to this restaurant tries the Killit-Skillet which is a skillet full of eggs, hash browns, breakfast meats and toast.  It's pretty big, but really good.  

For lunch, their burgers are killer and my favorite is the Envelope with the house dressing.  It's simple: provolone, spinach and tomato in a pita with a cucumber ranch dressing.  Delicious nonetheless.  If it is cold out, be sure to get the chicken soup- it's just about the best non-homemade chicken soup in town.  

At any meal you should at least try the Notso fries.  They are cottage fries with cheese, bacon and sour cream piled high.  Unless you have a hollow third leg, order the junior size.  It's plenty.

This is a fun place to eat, particularly if you have kids."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! This is definitely one of the Shaker Square favorites as the prices are very reasonable and the food is great. For breakfast, my favorite is the Killet Skillet that is a huge breakfast with mixed hashbrowns, onions, green peppers, topped with eggs served with crusty bread, sausages patties, and bacon. They also brew good coffee and have freshly squeezed orange juice. Can be extremely busy during brunch time on weekends though, but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast...love M @ M Omlets! And corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Italian omelet was overdone, but still tasted good with lots of sausage and melted mozarella. A little marinara would have made a world of difference. Sitting at the counter in this tiny restaurant is always fun, especially if you want to meet new people."}
{"text":"A busy local chain (northeast Ohio only) that delivers on their modest goal of serving quality diner food quickly.

One of the only issues we encountered was the parking lot which is very small and tucked into an oddly shaped piece of land to accommodate the quaint little town. I had to circle a couple times after dropping my wife off up front and wait for someone to leave in order to find a spot.

My wife and I visited this location in Hudson on a Sunday morning knowing full well it will likely be busy, which it was. We were quoted 10-15 minutes for a table and were seated in that time.

The server was not rude but seemed quite busy which didn't bother us because we don't need a lot of attention and prefer to be left alone for the most part. 

We ordered coffee and grapefruit juice to start. She loved her grapefruit juice but the coffee was just \"meh.\" I wasn't expecting gourmet but it sufficed.

The food was delivered in about 5 minutes from the time of order which was great since we were both famished. I ordered the Notso omelet and my wife a breakfast combo with eggs, ham and pancakes.

We were both very happy with our food. The omelet was nice and fluffy and was packed with bacon, cheese and hash browns. Highly recommended! My wife particularly enjoyed the pancakes, which I tried and loved and come similarly recommended.

In the end it was an inexpensive and quick diner breakfast that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yours Truly offers a typical diner experience and menu. The Shaker Square location has plenty of booth seating next to the windows running the length of the restaurant, so it's a comfortable place to dine in (I'm not a fan of the large-screen TVs though). The notso fries are a great concept, but execution could be improved - at least when I got them, they were lukewarm and limp, and the cheese topping had set. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant, casual.  Menu was interesting.  I really like the flat potatos that are a cross between potato chips and french fries.  Might be a good place for breakfast.  My husband loved it....he loves everything!"}
{"text":"breakfast place with great service.  Even a good place to consider having a coffee at the bar and get work done (over starbucks)"}
{"text":"The food - 3 stars
The manager - 5 stars
The server - 1 star...so we'll just kind of average them and give 3 stars.

There was a lengthy wait for a Sunday morning and it's a TIGHT space so waiting can be a pain.  We were seated and ordered.  The kid we had with us just wanted 2 pancakes with chocolate chips and a small bowl of fruit.  Upon reviewing the bill we were charged $6.50 despite pancakes being $2/each.  Even with an upcharge I don't think a handful of chocolate chips should be $2.50 more!  The server argued with us saying \"I just entered it.\" Uh, I'm not saying you entered it wrong. I'm saying make it right.  There is also no listing of an upcharge for chocolate chips. On another dish it lists 60 cents more for blueberries so that's our best comparison...but again, not $2.50.  I ask to speak to the manager because clearly she was appearing to be incompetent and she rolled her eyes and shook her head at me at my request.  He came over and was wonderful. He actually shared that she was recently demoted from manager and I now know why.  Good move, Yours Truly!  Now just get rid of her all together and you'll be better off.  The manager did what she should have done -- apologized, recognized our problem and made the situation right.  I was happy paying $4.60 (2 pancakes plus the upcharge they do for blueberries) but not $6.50.  He ended up removing the charge all together which he totally didn't have to do.  Her service up to this point was okay but holy crap, some people need to learn how to respond to negative customer service situations."}
{"text":"Usually very busy, the staff is always efficient. Two words - NOTSO FRIES!  Our favorite! 
Breakfast is also good."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every couple months or so.  This time was just awful in terms of service.  While our food was decent, the server came over once to get our beverage order, again to take our food order and lastly to bring us our bill.  The manager delivered our food and refilled my drink but other than that, our server was missing.  We would have both appreciated more refills of our beverages and to have our plates removed from the table in a timely manner.  I saw the manager go over to the server at one point while staring at our table and then he gestured over to us.  She then came and removed our plates and brought us our bill.  Yes, it was busy, but the server handling tables next to us seemed to have larger groups and was far more on top of her game.  I'm sure we'll return but hopefully the service will be back to what it usually is."}
{"text":"Great service.  Had the Greek omlet. Hash browns a little bland but still good. Great tasting. Great people. Must try."}
{"text":"Yours truly restaurants are always a favorite around town. They're extremely affordable and you get a quality of family friendly food that everyone is always satisfied with. Their menu is extremely long, but certain options are miles better than others. Diner classics tend to be consistently better than their more exotic options. Their sweet potato fries and milkshakes are some of their best options, in my opinion.  Lots of people love the salads, for their large portion sizes and hearty options, and their omelettes are also fan favorite. The Greek omelette is definitely worth a try. Has more of a small town diner feel, but with the efficiency of a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Most of my immediate family and I really enjoy dining at this location. The chicken walnut salad and tuna salad is incredible. They offer many choices of bread from pitas to ciabatta. This is not very common at most restaurants. You can eat here and not spoil your diet either. The kid's chicken fingers are made perfectly. One of the best things about them is their Fish Dinner on Fridays. Although, my husband and I noticed it seemed to be downsized a bit in the past year or so. The fish is great, the cole slaw can be dry and not so great. Definitely a go-to for us for lunch and dinner. I went 2 days in a row last week!"}
{"text":"I would just like to say I have been to several yours truly locations in Cleveland and this one takes the cake. I went with my husband, 8 month old and best friend around noon today. We decided to come to this one after being spoken to rudely by the hostess at the Beachwood location and being told to wait near the cold window where there was barely any room to stand with my baby in her car seat carrier. At the Chagrin falls location we were seated within 5 minutes. The food was incredible, we got the monster hash, side of fruit, ole burger, eggs Benedict, and a Belgium waffle. We had a server named Bill who went above and beyond to provide the best, most memorable service I have had in a very long time. He juggled and entertained my daughter. He suggested bringing out slices of lemon and lime which I had been wanting to try! (She loved both). This location was more spacious than the other with much friendlier staff and good food. We will be back to this one and hope to have Bill as the waiter again!!!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to a few of these restaurants in my area, but this Yours Truly is one of the best locations I've ever been to. 

Yours Truly, in my mind, is a name that speaks of comfort food, and comforting it was. One thing that these folks have are cottage fries that are a huge mountain of \"tasty\" that is a real pleasure to tuck into. 

The other food (my wife had a steak and I had a Monte Christo,) was all great, nicely done and hit the spot. The staff were attentive and helpful and our waitress never let our glasses get empty and was always there with a helpful suggestion.  The location was warm, clean and inviting and really nice. 

So, if you're truly looking for a place for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack, check out Yours Truly in Hudson!"}
{"text":"It's 10:52PM and I am craving Yours Truly. 

I stopped here for a quick lunch with a friend who had been the first time the night before. It's obliviously that good she needed to come back. 

This place is TINY. I mean, trailer size small. However, amazingly, we walked right in and got a booth. This place seems to be a place like cheers which is always a plus in any dining experience.

Now, the food. Oh my goodness, the food. I ordered a grilled ham and cheese and the monster hash. I am drooling already. The GHAC was amazing and huge! I could barely finish it but since it was so good I had to. The monster hash is hashbrowns with onions and peppers and LOTS of cheese. IN fact, a little too much cheese but nonetheless, amazing. 

The service was good as well, esp. for such a small little place where there is barely any room to move. In fact, remember if you sit in a booth you'll hear some interesting convo from the coks..or a good song!

can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Talked to the manager about the less than stellar food, as the state of the restrooms on my way out made silence no longer an option. She said they just changed their veggie burger distributor, thanked me for my feedback, apologized about the rest, and gave us a $10 gift certificate to come back. So, we will, and hopefully more stars can be added then."}
{"text":"Yours Truly: a seriously great family restaurant. I've probably eaten at YT at least once a month for my whole life, but have yet to get sick of it. All of the locations I've been to have a great atmosphere. While you may literally be sitting on top of the person next to you (especially on Chagrin), the great service and homey feeling make up for it. Now about the food. Although they may not have the most inventive menu, everything made here is quite good. One thing you have to experience at Yours Truly are their cottage fries, which are among the best fries in Cleveland. Try them Notso style, with gobs of sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits. I also recommend the Greek Omelet or the Quesadillas. If you're in Cleveland and looking for a fairly inexpensive quality restaurant, make sure you go to YT!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to YT multiple times and each time it seems it loses a little bit of quality from the previous time. We came in on a Friday night and it was quite busy but we were seated promptly. We have a 1yr old so it takes time to get settled but our server didn't show for close to 10 minutes after we were seated. She finally arrived, took our drink orders and reappeared 5 minutes later and took our food orders. The place was starting to clear out as it was getting later but the food still took forever and we had to wait for refills. While waiting I look over and see our sever sitting and chatting in the customer waiting area near the front door. Meanwhile I watched our food sit at the pass for a solid 10 minutes and when it arrived it was barely warm. The food wasn't steaming hot but I was steaming mad after that. As for the quality of the food it was OK, not the best we've had at YT and not the worst. We like it here so we will be back but another experience like this and it will be a while before we return."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and home made soups and chili. Staff was very attentive and friendly. A+ service with a very large group of hockey players.
Definitely will visit again when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I really had a good breakfast there! I'll be back to dine there the next time I'm in n Cleveland, Ohio"}
{"text":"We went there 12:30 on a Sunday morning. We expected it to be busy and, of course, there was a wait. But two seats were open at the counter, so we sat right down. The server gave us menus and got our drink order right away, and within 5 mins. had our order, a chicken salad sandwich and an order of pancakes. 
As crazy as it was there, the kitchen was working hard (visible from our stools) and had both dishes up on the pass-through within a few minutes. 
Unfortunately, the server was covering the entire counter, a six top, and tables outside in the patio, besides making coffee and other tasks behind the counter. 
I watched the butter melt away in my hot cakes for 10 mins, and by the time the server got to them, she simply called for a cook, and I watched them get thrown back on the griddle. 
By the time the server got back to them again - same results. 10 more minutes elapsed, second blob of butter gone, cold cakes. She sent them back again and scurried off. Meanwhile, a chicken salad sandwich is still doing what chick salad and bread do after being together for a half hour. 
When my pancakes went through the process a third time, we got up and left.
No, I didn't pay for my cup of coffee. I'll pay for it next time we go back, which is never."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and wonderful customer service, they truly make you feel like family. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yours Truly treated me very well. While traveling Medina, OH on business for three months, I ate at Yours Truly about 20 times. It's a comfortable neighborhood diner that serves cheap, hot food. Be smart, order diner food and you'll be happy. 

My usual order was half a tuna sandwich on an english muffin and a cup of chili. I could eat this meal every day, it's simple and tasty. Often times they'd give me the whole sandwich rather than half. The chili is very standard, have it plain or loaded with cheese and onions.

For the most bang for you buck, get an entree, as it comes with two sides. The side salad is pretty large, lots of dressing choices. Onion rings here are perfection, although you only get a few of them. If you like onion rings you should go out of your way to try them. The sweet potato fries are tasty, they come with a tangy/spicy dipping sauce.

Don't be adventurous, I tried the Asian dish once and it wasn't good. Should be obvious, but I was curious.

Yours Truly is always full of friendly people around dinner time. The staff seems to be mostly local high school kids, usually very polite. It was really nice to have an easy, home-style spot to eat and relax while I was out-of-town."}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant that is always hopping! Decor is brass bound old world pub feel and the patio seems popular. Carry out is ready fast and packed to stay hot and not spill! I adore the Buffalo Broil sandwich and the Notso fries. Get some fresh squeezed limeade and thank me later."}
{"text":"Diners usually seem all the same to me; each has the same greasy food menu and a dated decor. But this one gets a bump up star from average because it has a toy train table that entertained my kids while we waited for the food to arrive.  The kids meals also come with an ice cream sundae dessert."}
{"text":"Yours food is Truly tasty. Had sunrise breakfast for dinner, it was lot of food for a good price.  Scrambled eggs, hash browns, 3 turkey links, 2 toasts, and includes drink.  Huge menu, good music, nice servers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yours Truly's other locations are not too bad, but if you're smart you'll avoid the Shaker Sq. location.  Service is terrible 95% of the time and I mean terrible!  You'll be lucky if your waitress actually brings you your check.  Usually you'll have to get up and find another waitress if you plan on paying before leaving.  Complaining to any of the completely inept, complacent and incompetent managers makes no difference, and as you might have guessed, this is the root of the problem.  Don't ever order takeout either or your order will be wrong and probably won't be ready when you arrive.  By far the worst establishment in Shaker Square - a mismanaged, lazy staff, and overpriced, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Cute tiny place, however the customer service is not stellar. Order the chicken walnut salad sandwich which was sent back. They chicken tasted spoiled (got a second opinion from friend who ordered the Cobb Salad who agreed). Sent the sandwich back and ordered the Belgium waffle with whip cream and strawberries. The strawberries had a black bug (which was not a fruit fly) in the dish and then management assaulted my intelligence and said the bug was a coffee ground (which it was not).  The hot chocolate was not hot but cool. Not what you would expect with \"HOT\" chocolate. If this is the only place and your super hungry than maybe (just be careful what you order) but if not please go somewhere else. Customer service is not great and neither is the food."}
{"text":"Very good, food, service and prices. OJ  so fresh, it's like you have a straw in an orange"}
{"text":"This place has a few locations the last time I knew but is a local institution.  It in my mind replaces Dinks (after it changed names/owners) as the reasonably priced restaurant in Chagrin Falls with good food and a nice environment.  There is a reason it is usually crowded on the weekends...

The front is small and there is a back room, but I like to sit in front.  There are some tables that seat two out front on the sidewalk if you want to people watch.  

The menu is pretty vast if you include the breakfast you can get anytime.  I had a club burger and it was excellent!  I don't eat hamburgers much but had one last week that was excellent in a restaurant in Whitehouse Ohio, but this was probably even better, it was close.  The waffle fries are extra, so keep that in mind if watching price but it also came with coleslaw (the waffle fries that is).  But we shared them so calories cut ha ha, its a fair portion.  We also had a chicken sandwich which was pretty good and an omelette.  All was good.

During peak times the place is very busy. People are running around all over the place in a tight restaurant, so don't come then if you want tranquility, but it is actually a little exciting.

The restaurant interior has basically remained the same for a long time and I wouldn't change a thing.  Very quaint.  

Its located in Chagrin Falls and has locals as well as people from all the suburbs and city of Cleveland.  Its a great little town I used to go with one of my girlfriends when I lived there and later parents as well.  If you have not been to Chagrin Falls and you are from Cleveland or visit Cleveland, it is a must.  

Side Note: 
I am from the Cleveland suburbs (but live in Toledo area now) and used to complain about living there.  I lived in LA and Chicago and was fortunate to travel the US and world on vacation and for business and I can tell you, Cleveland is a wonderful city.  It will never be a global tourist destination, thats not what it is, but if you go there the downtown is greatly improved with people living there in modern condos/apt and there are many nice areas like Tremont, University Circle, Chagrin Falls, Peninsula, Ohio City, Coventry, Little Italy, The Flats, etc.  And the park system is huge and amazing.  Feel free to contact me if you need advice on what tot do.  And not I do not work for the Cleveland Dept of tourism ha ha.:). Just passionate about the city.  It is not there yet, but well on its way and ahead of many cities...."}
{"text":"The chicken tender salad was good, nothing to write home about though."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday afternoon for lunch and ordered to go. It took two people to tell us somebody will be with you shortly and 20 minutes later somebody finally took our order, and the place wasn't even busy!

We had to ask twice for our water while we waited, something that you'd expect to get while you waited. As we were sitting there, we noticed so many health code violations, including seeing the workers go in and out to the patio, touching money and plates of food without washing their hands.

We weren't the only ones who were disappointed with the service. Another customer actually came in and had a loud dispute with the manager about the wait time. What did the manager do? She chuckled! Wow! Then she told him to get out and never come back instead of offering to fix the problem. Finally one of the police officers in the restaurant had to break it up and told the couple to leave. 

When we got our food, we immediately checked it to find out the fries were COLD. At this point we were confused because we already waited 20 minutes to place our order and 45 minutes for our food, yet the fries were cold. Once I pointed it out to the server, it took another 3 minutes to make a fresh batch. How does that make sense? Not to mention they did ask us for payment before giving us the food... shady!

Would I go back? Uhhh... I think I'll go with NO. That's why I stole a bottle of water... since the water was as cold as the fries. Never again."}
{"text":"Decor is efficient without frills.  Warm colours, and flat paints bespeak easy charm, without the rush.

My coffee was average.  Hashbrowns were good.  Eggs benedict were served on english muffins, and the sauce was generous and not well balanced.

If you think of this place as a diner, it totally makes sense.  If one thinks of it as a brunch place, it feels a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Very nice upscale diner.  I enjoy the food, and the service is very, very good.  People are friendly there."}
{"text":"Had the \"old Fashion Oatmeal\". Nothing old fashioned about it. Was bad instant. 

Wife had omelette. Was mediocre at best. 

Nice appeal. Nice staff. But if your in the square there are plenty of other choices."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 12 years. Their food is great! They have really good burgers. The breakfast menu is excellent. The only thing is, it's always packed so sometimes I have a hard time getting seated. But it's always worth the wait. Family friendly. There's a play area for the little ones."}
{"text":"I've lived across the street for a year and a half and this past weekend was my first time here. They have breakfast all day so my friend and I went for lunch. We waited 5 min for a table, as they were pretty packed. We were greeted pretty promptly when we sat down and drink orders taken. 

I got the pancakes and egg white special and my friend got an omelet. Everything was spot on and done how we wanted it. Food was delicious. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the syrup was on the side which was appreciated Good food to boot! Service was good, especially for how busy they were Will try and get over here more often for sure"}
{"text":"Food was extremely overpriced with very small portions. 2 small sandwiches totaled over 20$. Mine was a piece of chicken, flat top cooked, with franks red hot splashed on top and a dusting of blu cheese. On top of that my bottom bun was soggy, and the sandwich wasn't even served with fries. For the same price we will go to Rocknes for much bigger portions and better food."}
{"text":"A local chain, Yours Truly makes some great burgers at good prices.  Definitely check these guys out before TGI Fridays and the like.
Catholics should check out Fish-fry Fridays!

I am told that these restaurants all offer free wireless.  If this is so, it is unexpected but very welcome."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not staffed appropriately to handle the customers.  The server was completely apologetic and hardworking but the length of time it took to be properly seated and served was unacceptable.  The food was good but the service was way too slow."}
{"text":"I order the lunch size salad with salmon every time,  which is about 2-3 times per month. Every time I order there's something wrong with my order. Either the lettuce is wilted or the salmon is undercooked. They can't get it right and the only thing they can do or say is\"I'm sorry\". I'M DONE...sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal!  Had the starter sliders, not so fried and chicken strips. SOOOO fresh. Loved my meal and coveted others plates as well. Served by Katie who was very spunky and attentive."}

{"text":"If you head to Cleveland, stop at what I consider one of the best breakfast places in town. I grew up on Yours Truly food in places like Chagrin Blvd's iconic, small location and Chagrin Falls. This morning I had a their very standard scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and rye bread and everything was done to perfection. They just get breakfast right. Good, strong coffee, well done hash browns and crispy bacon. The Shaker Circle location is a place where everyone knows your name or they're trying to recall it. Parking is the only downside because it is mostly metered if you drive there, so have plenty of quarters handy!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of all the Yours Truly locations. I used to come to the Shaker Square location in particular when I was younger and I just remember it being a great experience. I came to this location a few days ago and a rush of nostalgia came back. However I was a little disappointed with the service. Don't get me wrong the food was delish and once we addressed the issue to a server. they quickly resolved it. 

The issue was that I had arrived first, before my party of 4 had arrived, and when I sat they said they'd be right back with water/drink order but didn't return for 15 mins. I had to get up and find someone and ask them to come to my table. I understand that they probably just assumed I was waiting for my party to get there but a cup of water is mandatory in my eyes. 

I'll never write-off Yours Truly though because like I said they still have excellent food and drinks too!"}
{"text":"I must be missing something, or caught them on an off night. 
Having enjoyed breakfast there in the past, I tried dinner. 
The place isn't very clean. The servers were everywhere, yet mine got stuck taking a phone order while 6 others stood around chatting? The chili was just ok....no cheese, no onions, very few beans and very watery. 
Salmon was very over cooked, the mac and cheese was more cheese sauce than macaroni no crust, shells over cooked. the spinach and onions were fair at best. 
My bad, had so many better options to chose from, and will do so next time in town."}
{"text":"Extremely comfortable food, environment & service. I feel like I am right at home. Coffee is fresh ground for every pot.. and they have $1 ice cream Sundays.. you had me hooked right then and there"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were spending the day driving around with nowhere in particular to be, and we ended up stopping at Yours Truly for brunch. I am so glad that we did! I have been to other locations on numerous occasions but never for breakfast.  This particular one is very quaint inside and although it is small, never once did I feel \"crowded\" even though we sat at one of the tables right in the center of the aisle.  I have had notso fries before, and while looking at the breakfast menu I could not pass up the notso omelette.  Oh my goodness was it delicious! How could you go wrong with bacon, cheeses, and POTATOES INSIDE THE OMELETTE?!? It was topped with sour cream and served with cottage fries on the side. Absolute heaven. I am actually salivating thinking about it 2 weeks later (gross I know!). 

The only thing I would complain about would be the service... It seemed very confused to me, and we never saw the same waitress twice.  The drink refills were slow to come out, but each person came by with a smile."}
{"text":"Not a very allergen friendly restaurant. They have a gluten free menu, but if you have a dairy, egg, or soy allergy there is nothing but salad as an option. Talking to the waitress I didn't feel comfortable getting grilled chicken due to cross contamination."}
{"text":"Very poor experience. Upon seating us, the teenage host asked which table we would like and when I said the booth, he told me he was saving it for a bigger party than ours of 3. He then proceeded to seat another party of three there immediately after us. We were seated at a table where one of the chairs had a growing puddle of water on it from the leaky air conditioner above. My one year old enjoyed her kids meal food, the chicken tenders were good. My husband and I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Broil and the Buffalo Chicken wrap. Both were completely saturated with hot sauce, as if half the bottle was emptied on top. It was clearly Frank's Red Hot, not Buffalo, which is what I thought I was getting. The bread on my sandwich was so soggy by the time it got to me, it was melting and falling apart all over my hands. We did not enjoy our food. One of the male waiters was also apparently taking a break right across from us and continuously tried talking to our one year old daughter, and kept coming back to do so. It made me very uncomfortable. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very quaint place. Waitress was nice. Food was decent.

Not memorable in any way besides the hockey dad with the HUGE mullet sitting across from us, so it falls to the 3 star level."}
{"text":"Yours Truly  87 rating. A Cleveland classic that serves good salads, burgers and breakfast. Family owned chain and exceedingly consistent. Favorite item is the Teriyaki Burger and Walnut Chicken Salad (so I named two, sue me)"}
{"text":"Though I love the Chagrin location of Your's Truly, I am sad to say I was disappointed in the Shaker Square location. The food was still up to par however the service left much to be desired. Multiple times throughout the meal, my friends and I genuinely thought our waitress forgot about us... I will still most likely come back because I love the food and the variety they offer but I may either stick with the Chagrin location or opt for takeout."}
{"text":"Yours Truly was a childhood standby when I was growing up in Cleveland. Recently moved back and was surprised that it was not all I remembered.

Most recently, a friend and I ordered carry out. Placed our order before 12pm and were told it would be ready in 15 minutes. We show up at 12:25, the restaurant is half-full and our orders aren't ready yet. By the time our orders are complete, we've waited another 15 minutes. We finally get our order and run out the door (as by this time we're running quite late), only to find that they've mixed the order up. I ordered chicken tenders and received a shabby salad. My friend ordered extra sauce on the side and was provided with no sauce at all. Not only was the food we received the wrong order, but it was also pretty lackluster. 

At the very least, I will never be ordering carry out again. At least if you dine in you have the opportunity to send the food back or get a refund."}
{"text":"Given the prices, the food was only okay. The French toast was flat and had barely any egg batter on it. The egg bruschetta was extra runny. Disappointed generally. Hummus was good, should do more food with their Lebanese background."}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere.  Music is a mix and not too loud. However it's too small for more than 4 people.  I will be back next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ok...I see why local probably flock here.  It's big, convenient and comfortable.  Good local gathering spot.  But the owner seems to know that, and serve mediocre food knowing people will come anyway.  We went last wk for breakfast.  The coffe is dishwater weak, the pancakes are tough, syrup is scant, waffles nothing I can't do at home.  All in all, next time I'll do McDonalds....it's faster, cheaper and pancakes and coffee much better.   Was hoping for more.  Sorry, I know it's a fav among locals, but really ....demand better food.     And the bathroom smells like urine.  You need an exhaust fan."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here.  Everything is great on the menu and the service is always very good despite having a ton of younger servers that in my experience have piss poor customer service skills. Well, NOT HERE!

The only reason they didn't get 5 starts is because of how crowded it is up front.  I feel bad for anyone getting placed in a smaller table by the entrance as everyone stands there waiting for their tables staring down at you eating your food."}
{"text":"Yours truly is an adorable little restaurant. We got there around 6:15 on a Tuesday night and there was a bit of a wait (the place is super tiny), but once we were seated, the service was great and the good came quickly.

They accommodated me as a vegetarian by cooking the veggie burger separately and everyone enjoyed their meals. The food was priced really cheap and so, between that, the great taste, and the service, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for late breakfast today, a Monday at 11:30.  Immediate seating - not very busy.  I ordered an omelet with a side of toast.  The omelet, The Palermo was light and fluffy, done well and an ampel serving. ($8.00)... I had to ask for a coffee table refill, and my finished plate sat on my table for at least 10 minutes before it was bussed away.   The food was very good.  Service - could improve, but in all farness, the lunch crowd began to show up when I was waiting for service.  Overall, I recommend Your's Truly."}
{"text":"The A.M. Breakfast wrap was awesome! It was packed tightly and filled with plenty of ingredients! I added ham and sausage patties to mine. It was great!"}
{"text":"When I visit Cleveland, this is my first stop to get some Notso Fries (no words to describe its greatness) and Chicken Fingers with that awesome honey mustard sauce! And I hate honey mustard sauce! The Special Delivery is great too and you get so much. My sister gets the milkshakes and they are huge and they leave the mixing cup with whatever won't fit in your glass. I love Yours Truly and miss it when I'm away."}
{"text":"So many times the simplest order is incorrect. I had to ask several times for things. The orders are wrong and then when \"try\" to correct, it's deceitfully done and still not correct. The food is good but not worth the stress of having things wrong over and over. My son was in tears because there was cheese on his chicken sandwich. When he asked for no cheese. Well it was scraped off. Seriously??? He's not going to eat it! That's wrong."}
{"text":"Nice variety of food on menu with lots of homemade stuff.   Friendly attentive service.  Everyone loved their food in our group - all good hot, tasty, accurate for our entire group of five.  We had a variety - some breakfast platters some burgers some wraps.    This place is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Good food. However they need to get rid of the tablets they use to take orders. This isn't a large restaurant with 100 tables. I ordered the chili with cheese and onions and a Cobb salad. The chili was ok. No heat to it. Just plain old chili. The Cobb salad had too much blue cheese in it. Over all it wasn't a bad meal, but the tablets need to go."}
{"text":"I've been to Yours Truly many many times, just not recently.   My daughters and I were driving by this location and all of a sudden had a taste for some Notso fries.  We stopped in on a Saturday night at approx 8:00.  The restaurant was pretty full, but there was only a very short wait for a table.  I ordered the patty melt with light onions and requested mushrooms.  My daughter ordered the cheeseburger.   We also ordered a regular order of Notso fries, there are 3 sizes.   Our food arrived in about 15 minutes.  My patty melt arrived a little bit more pink than medium well and there were no mushrooms and lots of onions.    I didn't make a big deal, just scraped off some of the onions and decided that it wasn't worth the additional wait for mushrooms.   I must say that the homemade, thick sliced pickles chips served with the sandwich were very, very good.   My daughter enjoyed her burger and the Notso fries were just as I remembered....unsalted cottage fries topped with cheese bacon with a side of sour cream....yum!   All in all this was a very good meal.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place . fresh squeeze OJ
 people very nice there I ordered 2 eggs and spinach with toast ."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite local spots for breakfast but sadly the service is not what it used to be. Was seated and given coffee by the greeter at 11:23am and literally not one waitstaff stopped at my table until 23 minutes later and it was not busy. I literally had to flag down the greeter who seated me to tell him not one person stopped at my table all awhile they took orders from three other tables around me that came in afterwards, and I see other waitstaff talking, laughing and watching TV. Greeter took my order and I asked for the manager who even took his time coming out. At this point, I told the greeter to just cancel my order and charge me for the coffee. I'm not sticking around. My breakfast was ruined due to the lousy service. 

If there was a way I could place my order directly with the cooks and retrieve my food  and completely eliminate  any interaction with the waitstaff, I would... They absolutely suck. I hope the YT staff reads this message and GYST!"}
{"text":"Went for a pre-rehearsal working dinner at around 5:30PM. The place was empty except for like 2 other tables. I'd like to think that it was because of the time of day and not because the place just doesn't get the traffic it used to. 

I was surprised by the expanded menu, I hadn't been to a Yours Truly since like 9th grade. I used to go to this location all the time as a child and so I think that I was expecting more because I had such fond memories of it as a child.

The service was ok, perfectly nice but not particularly attentive even though there weren't many people in the restaurant. I got a beer and the quarter pound burger with a small side of fries. The fries and the burger were fine, nothing to call home about but good enough for me to feel satisfied with my choice. The price--13 bucks, not including tip--was more that I thought it was worth since it was diner quality and I could get a much better AND BIGGER burger for the same price at more upscale restaurants. I don't think the prices of the food reflect the quality or the type of establishment especially since the prices weren't always so high. 

I'd like to see an increase in quality or a decrease in price, otherwise I probably will choose to go elsewhere. Unless I'm feeling nostalgic."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little slow on the service. They were incredibly busy though.

The chicken mac & cheese was a standout.
But everything on the menu looks good."}
{"text":"Dirty table... dirty menus... over cooked food... stale toast... will not be returning for breakfast... and with all of the new places in the area... not for any other meal... very sad to see this former cornerstone of downtown slip so far!"}
{"text":"Quick and yummy. Service isn't always great, but this is a really good go to spot in Hudson!!"}
{"text":"I finally remembered the name of this place! We had gone to Mentor for my cousin's wedding over the summer last year, and I have been meaning to write a review ever since. My family and I LOVED this place. YT is A-OK with us. SInce we were staying in a hotel down the street, we frequented YT twice every day for breakfast and lunch and were never disappointed with anything. The food was amazing! Onion rings were definitely at the top of my list as well as the mac and cheese, and let's not forget the breakfast omelettes. All the meals were solidly delicious and everything was freshly made. I think the real asset at Yours Truly is the staff though, everyone was just so nice! We really enjoyed each time we went there. Too bad they don't have one around these parts."}
{"text":"I've only ever had breakfast here, but it's always spot on.

Fresh squeezed OJ and limeaide, thick smokey bacon and fluffy pancakes. Definitely a step up from the average chain as far as breakfast goes. 

Servers were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good. Understaffed beyond belief! Servers running around like crazy, food taking forever to come out of the kitchen (can't really be the servers fault because the orders are being sent in from the handheld device at the table). We split our group in two because the wait was so long, and one table got food 25 minutes before the other, both ordered at the same time.

From the sound of it, this is a normal occurrence when they get busy. If they are anywhere close to full, you might want to pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because this is the smallest place ever! For as busy as they are they should look into expanding........I think the smallness of the place is seriously a safety hazard haah!  Ok now for the good stuff. GOOD LORD NOTSO OMLET!!!!! Hello, cheeese, hasbrowns, bacon and sour cream all wrapped up in a delicious egg omlet soo good! I also tried their french bread...I was in heaven.  This is a frequent breakfast stop for me and the guy, just wish it was a bit bigger.  I have been to the one on rockside and honestly, not as good as this one...hhmm."}
{"text":"Returned recently with outstanding service, but food that lacked.  

My son's burger was unimpressive,  my saffron rice was stale and dry.  

Always a pet peeve that they never give you a receipt that line items your order, they only give you a credit card receipt when paying with plastic.

I like that they've switched to ketchup that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup."}
{"text":"best deal in town for fresh squeezed grapefruit juice."}
{"text":"I have to say first that Yours Truly in Medina is one of my favorite spots.  Usually anytime of the day or evening the service and food is excellent.  Tonight was not one of those nights.  Let me clarify though, our waitress Melanie H was terrific.  In fact if not for her kindness and positive attitude we would have had a less than stellar visit and I would not be giving 4 stars.

We shared a chocolate milk shake. Mmmmm very good.  My husbands favorite is the Special Delivery.  I felt like having breakfast for dinner so I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  I have had this dish before with the wonderful hash browns and could not wait.

Our food came and it all looked great.  But that is as far as it went.  My over easy eggs were not over easy but I was going to over look that until I tried my hash browns.  They tasted like they had been sitting in a pan full of oil all day and were just mush.  So disappointed.  I ate the eggs and left the hash browns.  That's where Melanie took it upon herself to notice that I had not touched them and asked if there was something wrong.  I told her and she said she wished I had said something earlier so she could have fixed it for me.  But I didn't want to make the chef feel bad it just wasn't a good night.  She came back to our table and had talked with the manager without us even asking and my dinner was reduced.  Very nice.  Thank you Melanie H for your great service!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed yours truly. Tonight we went for the fish fry.  Very disappointed, waited 45 minutes for our food with a one year old grand kid.  Pepsi was flat, one piece of fish was cool and the second piece was extremely hot.  Overall quite a let down."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow, even though it was mid-afternoon and they were not busy.  Our waitress was friendly, but slow in refilling our drinks. By the time I was through with my meal I started to feel very queasy, and was sick within a half hour. I think it was because my burger was very rare, even though I asked for medium. The other 3 people with me enjoyed their meal, except for the slow service."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot and it looks good with the redone building, though I will miss the original counter stools. I have been coming here my entire life for the simple diner classics, without being greasy and the 4 best words in the English language, \"breakfast served all day\". 

Service is always fast, once you are seated. There is the occasional wait, but they turn over the tables pretty well. 

Some of my favorites are the Sunrise breakfast, with wheat toast, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and bacon for under $8. Also, really like the Greek omelet because of the kalamata olives in it. There really isn't a bad thing on the menu. 

There burgers and chicken broils are very good and juicy at lunchtime and I also really like their buffalo chicken wrap. 

If you are craving sweet they make great homemade milkshakes."}
{"text":"Wow how do they make such good food in such a tiny place.  This is some sort of converted fast food joint that they have created a warm little diner out of.

The food was great and the service excellent.  I ordered off the happy hour menu flash fried artichoke hearts and the notso fries.  Excellent choices and the bill was $6 wow what a deal.  I can't wait to go back the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My wife and I took the kids here on 8/21/13 for dinner on the night before school starts. 2 of our kids each received a certificate for a free kids meal from their school over the past year. We wanted to use them before they expire. The food has always been pretty good, and there was nothing out of the ordinary about the food this time... it was fine. Our sever was friendly enough, but it seemed that she was having an off night -  it took us a while to get served and she had forgotten a couple of requests, though we had no beef with her... everyone has those kids of days. What upset me is being informed of management's decision - while we were paying our bill - that they are now only accepting one of the free kids meal coupons at a time. Really? I don't understand the logic. It's not like my wife and I shared an appetizer and tried to get away really cheap with the kids eating free. We purchased two adult entrees - one for each free kids meal. Most logical restaurants that offer kids eat free days offer a free kids meal for every adult entree purchased. I don't understand why ours wasn't honored.

If Yours Truly management happens to read this and care to explain to me the logic behind this policy, please feel free to reach out to me."}
{"text":"I get by with a little Yelp from my friends! A fellow Yelper suggested this restaurant and man she is smart....shhhh, don't tell her I said that. She might get a big head. I applaud her for the suggestion. 

I have passed this joint dozens of times and always have meant to stop in. But, I have always gone for my tried and true go to's and skipped trying it out. Not anymore folks, I can officially say that I've broken into the Yours Truly universe. I will start out by saying this place has ample parking, a fantastic location in downtown Hudson and beautiful landscaping. A great setting!

Inside is equally as nice. Well kept, nice and clean (a huge deal for me) and a warm and inviting atmosphere. Plenty of comfortable seating as well. A nice big waiting area too. Which you will need because this place always seems to be super busy! Every staff person I ran into was helpful, kind and had huge smiles. Such a great feeling.

We sat on the patio and my Lord, what a nice patio they have. Lots of seating, a beautiful setting and cool lights in the evening time. They were busy and it took a bit for our waitress to greet us, but understandable to a certain extent. Our waitress was pleasant and made sure we had everything at all times. She wasn't as smiley and friendly as the rest of the staff, which was kinda a bummer...but she was effective and far from stand offish, so we will take it!

Ordered two omelettes (Palermo and Notso).  Sweet mother of monkey milk, they are HUGE. So glad we split them as a group! We LOVED both equally. The Palermo had an amazing Italian sausage....god was it good! The Notso literally made us moan. Both huge hits! The hasbrowns? Sweet baby Jesus, they were some of the best I've had. Crispy and perfectly cooked along with an amazing flavor. My kiddo ordered the chicken fingers and fruit....HUGE hit for her. Also, we had a fantastic house salad. It was fresh, crisp and the ranch dressing was to die for!

We look forward to coming back soon! Wtg Yours Truly!

Yours Truly,
Raymond"}
{"text":"Your's Truly is a Cleveland staple. It is so good, everything I've had there has been so good.

It's small, but nice and cozy and like a diner feel.  You have to get the Notso Fries!!

There are a few places to sit at the counter, and some booths and tables.

I'm all the way in Texas, and I'm craving it as we speak... sounds like I need a visit back to OHIO real quick!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the absolute WORST eggs Benedict I have ever tasted.  Seriously the hollandaise sauce was GROSS.  We let them know and the manager said it tasted fine to him.  I'm not expecting much coming to a Yours Truly, but I'm pretty sure you can get gravy from a dog food can and it would be better.  Waffle was solid, hash browns lacked any flavor.  Your local greasy spoon family restaurant is a better choice."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast. It was ok. Waitress was fine. However, the owner was super rude. An old guy who was curt from the beginning. Lacked courtesy. My 2 yr daughter dropped Apple juice on floor. I apologized to the waitress and she said no to worry about it. We were about to leave when the old guy turns up with the mop and without even saying excuse me starts mopping when we are still seated. In this commotion, my small tube of hand lotion fell from the table. He pretends to be oblivious to it and keeps mopping over it. My husband tells him to look for it and the old guy says \"ah it will turn up.\" Once he left we found it under the table. He didn't even do a good job mopping. In 2 minutes we left and my husband almost slipped over the wet floor. When we were leaving the old guy appeared again and asked us near the front door \" did you find your item?\"  Yes no thanks to you, I thought. Not returning to this place ever."}
{"text":"I've been told this place is truly wonderful. I could think of a place two doors down, I'd rather go to more though. Food is good, not great, and service was great from what I experienced. Ambience was nice."}
{"text":"I'm visiting a friend who lives nearby and she suggested we go here for lunch, today. My friend says she comes here all the time and is always pleased. Today was a different day.

Our first server approached us with attitude and a sullen face to ask us what we wanted to drink. We watched for over 10 minutes as she waited at the bar and eventually some man brought us our drinks. At this point, that's two unidentified servers. Next comes Peter who is supposed to be our main server. We ordered our food and asked Peter for straws (which we didn't receive previously) and I asked for a grape soda because their Arnold Palmer tastes offensive. Peter forgot all about my grape soda and I had to ask the runner to bring it. After a long wait, our food is eventually delivered by a nice young man named Zach. We are now up to 4 servers and a runner. My friend ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream; they brought her a waffle. When they were informed of the error she was only brought strawberries. The food was decent, nothing to write home about. I am shocked it wasn't cold, given the sloth-like service. Zach was very nice and attentive but Zach was not our server, Peter was.

After finally being ignored enough we asked to speak with the manager. He walked over seemingly pissed and also didn't introduce himself. I explained our situation and he told us that Peter is our server but shifts were being changed and didn't we want hot food? It was all very condescending. I pointed out to him that the restaurant wasn't even busy and that we saw our initial server was just standing around forever after our drink order. Our conversation culminated in him nearly shouting, \"Well, what would you like for me to do about?\" I said, \"I don't know; you're the manager.\" He asked the question again and my friend told him we just wanted to make him aware and he said okay and that was pretty much that.

I've never been treated this way as a paying customer. My friend said her experiences prior to today were good and that Peter is even usually a good server. This is obviously a management problem and people like the man I dealt with today should not be in hospitality. Obviously, if I'm ever in Ohio again, I won't eat here.

I should also mention that everything is overpriced. Denny's has better food."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was very nice.  I had the grilled chicken quesadilla and it was delicious!  Very large and could not eat it all.  Prices are fantastic!  Waiters and waitress were awesome,  would definitely come here again if in the area"}
{"text":"Shirly, first to review?  How on EARTH did you manage only three stars?  I've parsed your review, swept it through the decoder, translated into, then back out of, seventeen languages (Urdu was a bitch) and STILL can't understand.  Tepid rice?  That's the only thing you could find that wasn't great?

Okay, take a few cleansing breaths.  Mmmm.  Better.  Let's start over.

I have eaten at three Yours Truly spots, Shaker Square, Hudson, and Medina.  The Medina one is SO much better in every respect as to be unrecognizable as associated with this chain.  I'm so in love with this place, this morning was our fifty-sixth breakfast there.  I am not making that up.  We were a group of five, in the middle of the \"last no cooking at home day before Easter\" and it was slammed.  Still, the service was flawless, the food solid, workmanlike, substantial and predictable.  Now I hasten to add that predictable is a GREAT thing at the first blush of dawn.  I don't need, or want, a surprise at that hour:  \"Chef Antoine has decided to substitute your corned beef hash with a slurry of eel and saffron.  Enjoy!\"

Take a good, close look around.  This enterprise is professional, on every level.  Clean.  It is so, SO clean.  The waitresses are there for the long haul; you won't find one leaning against the front bar whining, \"... but I have a photo shoot tonight, then Biff and I were going to the club...\"  Nope.  Gladys.  Mertyl.  Cookie.  These are hand-picked Service Professionals.

I just wish there were a way to take Shirley C's missing stars and add them back in."}
{"text":"They were as busy as any restaurant on Sunday morning...but they forgot to bring out half of my food. Husband ordered pancakes WITH blueberries, but no one told him they were blueberry pancakes. We got mochas that tasted like watered down hot chocolate. I am giving it 2 stars because my bacon was delicious, and his pancakes still turned out well. We were waiting at the register, bill in hand, to check out and 3 employees within arms' reach looked right at us and said nothing and walked away. I've never wanted to just leave a restaurant without paying...but today I had to fight that urge. All of the employees were running around like this was their first day on the job. Just not a pleasant experience. I could have gone to McDonald's for better service."}
{"text":"Seems like the place is starting to go downhill.........

I have no issues with the food.  Overall the food is wonderful.  Consistently good.  My concern (that I have previously shared with the management) is the restrooms.  I cannot speak towards the ladies' room but the mens' room needs attention.  My main concern is that if the restrooms are in such poor cleanliness and repair, what does the kitchen look like?

The tiles near the floor are cracked, and black mold is plentiful.  The one toilet's seat is loose and makes it difficult to put a toddler on a potty that moves....

The one urinal will run constantly.  But it's useable.

The twin sinks back up and the dirty water that I washed my hands with just won't go down.  The door and door handle is very dirty and I just feel like I got dirtier just by going into the restroom.  The place could really use a good cleaning...looks like cleanliness is an afterthought.  

Entryway is filthy.  Hasn't been cleaned in some time.

Service -- great. 

I won't be going back until they decide to do some cleaning."}
{"text":"This yours truly restaurant has surely seen it day come and go. The physical building itself is worn pretty badly and the restaurant could stand too close for a week or so and do a thorough deep cleaning. Varnish peeling of woods, the grout in the floor is filthy and it was actually pretty greasy if you had wet shoes you would slip slide around and it didn't seem very safe.

I don't know what it is about this particular location versus the location and Mentor. The Mentor location seems to be a little bit cleaner well cap. Could do to a holly volume of traffic but a high volume of traffic should also lend itself to a high volume of repair in cleaning. The food itself was neither remarkable nor bad. It was sustenance, plain and simple.  locate rest area he would stop and eat at and then completely forget about it one hour later.

I'm pretty sure it's not a chain, but the location. Clean this place up, we can work into the restaurant and you'll be ok"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for this recommendation.  I came across Yours Truly after searching for restaurants in Chagrin Falls and we decided on Yours Truly based on the solid 4 star rating and single $.  

Despite the advice of so many others I couldn't get myself to order the \"Notso\" fries.  (french fries with bacon, cheese, and sour cream = no thanks).  Instead I ordered a Greek salad with chicken and he ordered the cod with Asian veggies and sweet potato fries.  Everything was very good overall.  The salad was fresh and well prepared.  The chicken was hot off the grill.  The stand out item on the table was the sweet potato fries. They came with a delicious honey mustard dipping sauce.  The Asian veggies were quite good and a little different.   I've never had kale before in Asian veggies and it gave them an earthy smokey flavor.  The cod was well executed although I think they were probably defrosted fillets.  But hey, it's a diner!

We sat outside and I initially thought we would be neglected being outside but our server was fantastic.  Attentive, helpful, cheerful always predicting our next request whether it be a refill, napkins or the check.  

I think a solid 4 stars and a single $ sign is spot on for Yours Truly.  If judging the sweet potato fries alone I'd give 5 stars.  We'll be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. It reminds me of Perkins, with their emphasis on all day breakfast but with other lunch and dinner offerings. Service was friendly and prompt. Prices are reasonable and on par with other restaurants like this. Atmosphere is casual and friendly, like any good diner. I had an omelette with toast and some pancakes. Everything was good, nothing mind-blowing. They charge extra to get pure maple syrup, or you can have sugar-free syrup for free. Don't bother with that stuff, I tried a bite with it and my pancakes were worse with the sugar free syrup than they were plain. I didn't bother with the pure maple stuff, so I can't say whether it's any good or not. I can point out that Cracker Barrel gives you free maple syrup free of charge. Just saying...

Anyways, it's a nice place to grab some breakfast or brunch if you don't feel like making it yourself."}
{"text":"While I was skeptical because of the lack of customers, the meal I ordered exceeded my expectations. The olé burger was basic, well done as requested, and delicious. The server always made sure my party was taken care of; the manager even let us sample the hummus advertised on the door. 

The only reason to dock a star from the rating was the slow food service. There were maybe 3 other tables being served inside and I waited over 20 minutes. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars, good for a quick breakfast. We stopped in on Saturday morning before it got busy. I ordered the \"number 4 standby\" - 2 pancakes (added blueberries) and bacon. I don't like fake syrup so I paid 1.30 extra for real Maple. My husband ordered an English muffin, sausage and hash browns. We both had OJ to drink. 

My pancakes were a bit tough but everything else was good. My husband said the hash browns were perfectly crisp. 

Our server, Crystal, was great. She checked on us just the right amount and was efficient."}
{"text":"I love the chicken noodle soup and the YT Medley.  Also, when in a splurge mood, My friends and I get the Not-so Fries."}
{"text":"The oatmeal was tasty...

It seemed that our waitress was either pre-occupied or annoyed that we brought our 8 month old with us for breakfast.

Everyone working on a Sunday morning seemed to hate their jobs. The manager simply sat in a corner eating her breakfast and then going out for a smoke here and there...Come on....Small place, be nice."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice...both times, it took over an hour and 1/2 to get marginal food, like sandwiches and breakfast food.  Waitresses are near impossible to get refills of coffee and water from.  The food was ok, but not worth the wait and hassle."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pretty happy with the experience. This was my first visit. In fact, I'd never even heard of the place before we stopped. 

The menu is pretty extensive. It's actually kinda difficult to pick something if you've never been there; alotta different items to get lost in. I had to ask what cottage fries were. They end up basically being similar to Bdubs buffalo chips. 

Anyways, it's a bit pricey because if you buy something like a burger, the sides do not come with it. However, their burgers are pretty scrumptious! 

The service was alright. They had one server doing a whole bunch of tables, and she was swamped. She did well though considering we had a table of 10 people to go along with her other 5-6 other tables. 

Also, some miscellaneous information, they have a cool jukebox and a place where kids can sit down and play with a few toys.

It's definitely worth a stop and dine =)"}
{"text":"Terrible service! There's never anywhere to sit no matter what time of the day it is. I gave it a second try and this time we were seated in a back room of the restaurant that was dirty, too loud and our waitress too busy to even refill our drinks or ask of our food was okay. Which it wasn't. There were 4 of us and 2 of our orders were made wrong. Busy location and sloppy service."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the re-opening and my experience was a good one! Came here for brunch after church. I was expecting a large crowd and a long wait time but we were seated quickly.  I ordered french toast, bacon and potatoes. Presentation was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"I was able to enjoy this restaurant on a Sunday after church. A lovely space and generaly enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for good food at reasonable price. My only negative was that they had a Monte Cristo sandwich that was not a Monte Cristo. Not batter fried. No powder sugar, No syrup. So to say i was disappointed would be an understatement. An overall positive experience, and I'll give it another chance. Yoy should too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Yours Truly more stars since we've been going there forever, but sadly the past few times we've gone the experience hasn't been great. I usually get take-out, so perhaps that's where their weakness is. Our order has either been wrong, not ready yet (upwards of 30 minutes past a given pick up time), or I have come in contact with extremely unhelpful/rude hostesses. Though I have to admit the food is perfectly comforting, maybe a little greasy () but incredibly delicious when we do get it. The notso fries alone are worth coming back. As one of the longer standing diners in town, it's pretty popular and can get busy on the weekends, especially for breakfast/brunch so expect a wait. All-in-all even with some previous not so great experiences, I will still continue coming back here for a quick lunch or dinner. It's a great place to get together with friends. But if you can, try to avoid ordering your food to-go."}
{"text":"I go here maybe once a week. Last time I was there, they overcharged me. Some kind of keyboard error. I didn't even remotely notice it and certainly never would have. When I went in there this morning, the waitress remembered me, and made sure to take the overcharge off of today's bill. There was no reason for them to go above like that, but they did. That is how you get repeat business."}
{"text":"The food here is really, really good. The service here is really, really slow. The buffalo wrap is delicious. The sandwiches here are great. The Quarter Pound Burger I thought was the best deal in town until this past week.

I developed a bad case of food poisoning after eating here.

I did notice that the burger I ordered had mushrooms that were not entirely cooked although I didn't say anything because I was hungry.  The virus itself can be caused by bad meat or produce, not washing lettuce and vegetables thoroughly.

I have noticed some bad habits by the servers over the years here as well. Trays stacked with dirty dishes that are left out in the dining room, or the counter that sneezes when shes counting your money and hands it back to you.

Inn on Coventry and big Als are preferable breakfast places. There's also a place called Michael's Diner on the square thats not bad."}
{"text":"I have been going to Your's Truly (This and the other locations) for almost 20 years now, and have never had a bad meal there. The staff is always friendly, and the food is always good. I love the special delivery (burger) and the wraps. Notso fries are amazing. Great milkshakes. The chili with \"the works\" is also a favorite. If you can get one of the booths in front, it is a great place to watch the world go by!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable atmosphere, server's very attentive coffee always full and good. Food good, portions are a little lite for the price. Choice between toast and hash browns both would be much better."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very reasonable prices. We had good arrives. I would highly recommend it! Delicious pancakes and coffee."}
{"text":"When I said \"No\" to toast because of allergy they offered me gluten free bread!  The menu offered some different"}
{"text":"I've only gotten take-out from here while having some greasy diner food cravings, and my two experiences were both okay. 

The first time I got the club burger, which was alright. I really liked the buns they use, which are slightly sweet, and the rest of the burger was somewhere between average and good. The second time, I tried the famous Notso fries, which were super disappointing to me. I like the cottage fries that they use, and they are generous with the bacon, but the cheese on these fries really grossed me out. It seems like they just throw a couple slices of processed Kraft singles on top and broiled it, because the cheese had that plastic-y texture and not great taste. If you like processed American cheese then you might like these I guess, but I definitely wouldn't order them again.

The service I got both times was technically polite but brisk, but since they were both just take-out orders I wasn't really expecting much more. I'd probably come back to try their breakfast items, which might hopefully improve my rating, but if I ever want cheese fries or a burger I'll drive the extra few minutes and pay the extra dollar or two to get awesome versions of them from B Spot."}
{"text":"A short drive from the Medina Hampton Inn.  Spacious interior with a good number of booths.  Casual but nicer than nearby Denny's and Bob Evans.  Wednesday night is kid's night, so if you are blessedly child-free steer clear on Wednesdays.

I chose the Chicken Walnut Salad Platter for $6.50.  A scoop of tasty chicken salad (no extra seasonings required), served with a huge pile of fresh fruit (pineapple, honeydew, strawberries, blueberries and apples).  Yours Truly delicious!

The menu is large, with a wide selection of breakfast served anytime, sandwiches, burgers, salads, booze and desserts."}
{"text":"3 weeks ago I order the salmon on a Ceasar salad. It was AMAZING! So today I decided to order it again. I was so looking forward to my salmon salad today but was so disappointed. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the rest of the salads was less desirable. I could not find any cheese until I picked up my fish and it was completely melted. 4 croutons and romaine lettuce that looked like iceberg. Then I had mushrooms, mystery cheese and some red peppercorns in it. Not to mention I could taste onion which is the worst! I didn't even finish the salad because it tasted like onions"}
{"text":"We ended up here on New Year's Eve after just moving into town.  We arrived 45 minutes before they were closing but they welcomed us in and our server was really nice.  We had a variety of meals but everyone in our group really enjoyed it. I had the boneless chicken wings and fries.  They were both quite good and there was enough blue cheese dip with the wings to also use with the fries.  Yum!  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent value! We were there for breakfast and sat outside with our dog. I had the Eggs Bruschetta and my son had the Sunrise. Both meals were tasty and satisfying and much more than we could eat. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. The manager (maybe the owner) even brought over a bowl of cold water for our dog - she was very happy! A definite repeat for us!"}
{"text":"Service has improved. They are remodeling. Kinda \"cheesy\" that they are selling old lighting and art work by the front door. Still too pricey. Breakfast for two today, a Sunday was $24.68 including tip."}
{"text":"Great little diner spot we visited when traveling from out of town.  The food was great and the waitress was able to accommodate 5 kids under 4 - not an easy task!  They are extremely friendly and fast and you have to try the pepper bacon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going out to breakfast about once a week lately. It's become my new favorite thing to do. I usually go to diners because they're great food for cheap. Yours Truly is a bit fancier than the diner and also a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. I had \"The Sunrise\" which comes with two eggs, meat, hashbrowns, toast and choice of drink (tea, milk, coffee, soft drink). It's a great bang-for-your-buck. I had the turkey sausage links which your average diner doesn't offer. The rye toast was great...they also offer ciabbatta, which is so good toasted! They offer options for just about anything you could be craving for breakfast.  They also have the best fresh squeezed orange juice--beware that it is very pulpy which I love, but not all do."}
{"text":"This is far and away the best all-around restaurant in Hudson.  It has great food, wonderful service, reasonable prices, and a very nice setting.  I love their unique creations, especially the Y-T Medley which is a breakfast dish that they serve all day long.  Great burgers and desserts like pie, cobbler, and ice cream.  You can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  People come from miles around on Fridays to get their fishfry."}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday while we were waiting for my prescriptions to filled. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by a few things. 

One, service was actually very sweet, quick and efficient! Kudos!

Second, I was expecting Applebee's-esque food, but received something much fresher! The side salad was HUGE. I think they could get away with throwing a few extra ingredients in there besides lettuce, cheese and a cucumber slice. But the lettuce wasn't all iceberg (thank god), it was crispy, fresh and delicious! I also ordered the turkey rueben, which was also very tasty! 

I'll go with a three star for now, but I'm definitely coming back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Been to several Yours Truly restaurants throughout the years.  Just had brunch at this location this past weekend after a great yoga class in the park.  I was surprised at how quickly they got us an outdoor table.  Service was prompt and efficient.  I've never been disappointed with their food. I typically get the French Toast, but this last time, I got pancakes and scrambled eggs with cheese.  It was served at the right temperature, with the right amount of syrup, and I ate every single bite of it.  I've also enjoyed their omelettes, and I absolutely love their monster hash.  I took a lot of restraint to not order that as well this past weekend!   I would return to this location without any hesitation and will continue to go to Yours Truly restaurants in the area as I have been for several years."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Yours Truly for a late lunch on a weekday.  Luckily I slid right into one of the cramped booths instead of having to wait for an open spot.  Had the Special Delivery, which is a really comforting burger of Swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, and sour cream.  Paired that with a side of the intentionally unsalted Cottage Fries--kind of a thick cross between a potato chip and a hash brown.  I would probably opt for a different side next time, but the burger definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"This Yours Truly Restaurant location is very small however, I am always very happy with the attentive and friendly staff. I'm always able to be seated within a reasonable time and food is always good. I frequently take out of town guests here for breakfast. All meals are generous in size and the coffee is great."}
{"text":"This place was established the same year I was born (1982) and I have enjoyed it my entire life.  The notso fries, which are notso common are just amazing.  Picture cottage fries covered in cheese, bacon and sour cream...no this thing is no joke it actually does exist and it is heavenly!  Probably not the healthiest place to eat, but it is a landmark in chagrin falls... The breakfast here is out of this world, my suggestion is the YT melody (pita stuffed with fried eggs, bacon and muenster cheese)! If you eat here I can pretty much guarantee happiness..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning.  Place was packed, and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  As I'm sure others have mentioned, there is not a lot of seating at this location, and it is VERY cramped.  Luckily, we got a booth, which gave us a front row seat for the grill action.

Food - my son got a very generous portion of pancakes with a side a sausage.  He enjoyed it very much.  I got the corned beef has & two eggs with toast.  Solid.  Good potions here, and good quality.

Service - pretty quick and friendly.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes once we were seated.  Food came out quickly.

If you can get a table with little to no wait, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Great service- great food. Many healthy choices on the menu, as well as traditional home cooking. This yours truly seems bigger than the ones in mayfield, shaker and chagrin- seating has never been a problem. Lovely patio dining in an historic setting. The kids love to see the trains rumble by."}
{"text":"Tiny, cozy, little location. We were here on a snugglebugy rainy day and just loved the dark intimate atmosphere. Our server was really nice and speedy too. Our breakfast was really good, they had turkey sausage and gluten free bread!  Only downside - seeing the frozen hash browns sitting on the shelf right above our table. Reasonably priced and I would definitely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"The gold standard to which other Yours Truly restaurants will be held against is, of course, Hudson's Yours Truly. What can you expect? You could eat off of the construction equipment strewn about the local roads in Hudson. However, this place, although smaller, has a quality atmosphere and service to it."}
{"text":"YT is still fantastic. They recently updated their menu, and the flash fried artichoke hearts are incredible. 

Dare-I-say, I prefer them to the cottage fries (I guess there not terribly comparable, but I try to limit myself to one fried veggie per meal)."}
{"text":"What a cute little diner! The inside is beautiful and bright. Staff is so welcoming. Upon walking in I smelled fresh brewed delicious coffee and saw that the coffee of the day on the board was English Toffee! Had to order me a cup with 2 refills!! Such good coffee  
The menu is large! Tons of options including breakfast all day! I ordered the monte cristo with no ham it was a double decker of French toast with Swiss and turkey. I ordered the sweet potato fries for a side. Mmm I love my sweet fries with tango sauce! I ate all my fries but 1/4 of the sandwich was enough for me. Left overs are the best! I even asked for a to go coffee and received a fresh and large cup!! Our server was so sweet and kept our refills filled.
The food came out so quick!! Like super quick!! We came early around 5 pm after a movie nearby. Good time to come cuz when we were leaving the place was getting filled.
This a great family diner with great food. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The past 4 times I've been here it has been less than acceptable. 

The server was very nice. Our food took 44 minutes. We waited 10 minutes for a hot chocolate.  We ordered a kid's cheeseburger, kid's grilled cheese, an omelette and a veggie burger. 

The veggie burger came out completely different than what was ordered and none of the sides were fresh. The lettuce was brown, slimy & obviously not fresh. The tomatoes were all end cuts with rotten brown spots.  The onions were rubbery and old.  Not to mention, everyone's cottage fries were cold, chewy, & terrible. After sending the veggie burger and sides back, we waited another 20 minutes for it to be sent out correctly (& with fresh tomato, lettuce and onion).  Unfortunately the second try was just as bad. 

The server offered to bring the manager by, so we agreed. 20 more minutes went by without the manager stopping by. We finally decided to leave without speaking with the manager. 

When we left we stopped to use the restroom. It was extremely unkempt. 

I'm wondering if the Hudson location has a different owner, because I've never had a bad meal there...

This is a shame we won't be going back here, because we live in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Ok food most of the time, just a quick family place. Service has always been good. Food isn't consistent except the notso fries which our children order everytime we eat there. One problem is it never appears clean but that doesn't seem to stop anyone from eating there, hasn't stopped us either."}
{"text":"I have visited multiple Yours Truly locations throughout the area while I travel to our different offices in business to get a quick lunch.  As a place that serves breakfast food at all hours, that's a great add in my book for a working lunch.  The quality of the food and consistency of that quality across all locations ensures that I'll keep coming back.

This location in Beachwood seems to be one of the originals, it's small and cramped, but always has the news on TV and a bar with an open seat to ensure I can get in, get a good meal, and get back to work without worrying what will end up on my plate.  Especially great if I have to skip breakfast on the way in and catch an early lunch instead.

Now, you may be asking why only three stars if the food is so great?  As I always come into this location to grab a bite at the bar, I've noticed the service could use some work.  The staff are usually too busy to greet at the door or clean the bar off after someone leaves.  When you do arrive to sit at the bar, the staff are constantly on the go and you sometimes feel like you are an inconvenience to them.  

I will keep coming back here as my go-to place for breakfast food for lunch at work, but will switch elsewhere if a better diner comes along in the area."}
{"text":"We were sitted right away. I ordered the Special Delivery burger without the sour cream. It was cooked just right but I would have enjoyed it more with tomato. The cottage fries were good but the cole slaw was quite dry. I could not finish it. For dessert apple pie Ala mode with ice cream. The pie was flakey and very good. Our server brought our check without asking us if we wanted dessert, so we had to ask her. 

The food was better in the past. Fine if you just want to catch something to eat but not for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and I'm pretty sure our waitress was miffed that she had to wait in us. Friendly no, tasty yes, stomach issues on the way home YES.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim in the middle of my biweekly trek through Shaker Square's Farmer's Market for brunch on Saturday. The place was quaint, somewhat busy, but had a nice, calm, \"brunchy\" atmosphere. The menu was reasonably priced compared to other diners, so I ordered a bit more than I originally planned.

The eggs benedict was standard fare; good, but nothing special. The sweet potato fries were delicious, but the honey mustard sauce it comes with is not a good match. I also ordered a Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Now, this was probably the highlight and lowlight of my meal at the same time. How? Because I freaking love Belgian waffles, yet it came with a few measly slices of what amounts to barely half of a strawberry... oh, and not a trace of whipped cream. I stopped my waitress asking where the whipped cream was, and I shit you not, she tells me with a bit of a condescending smile, \"it doesn't come with whipped cream.\" Poor girl seemed so sure of herself. The menu pretty clearly states you either get a waffle with breakfast meat or strawberries and whipped cream. I didn't want to make her feel dumb by pointing that out because I didn't want to get boogers or something in my whipped cream, so I just politely nodded when asked if I would like her to bring me some on the side. I still enjoyed the hell out of my waffle and half a strawberry with whipped cream on the side.

I'd probably go to another location before this one, but for what it is (a classier Denny's), YT is A-OK in my book.

tl;dr - Decent meal, decent price, got my waffle with half a strawberry and booger-free whipped cream on the side."}
{"text":"The food was basic breakfast diner type food.  The pancakes were good simple.  The staff was very patient and accomodating.  I didn't find the food memorable and much prefer Fire next door but this diner is good for casual breakfast and is kid friendly.  It doesn't have the food quality or ambiance of its neighbor but if you just want comfort food on a weekend morning and want to stay in sweats this a decent choice."}
{"text":"I like Yours Truly. Sometimes you get a server that isn't the most efficient, but the food is always good. 

The shining star on the menu is without a doubt the Notso Fries. Fries that are topped with melted cheese, sour cream and if you partake...bacon. I don't do the bacon but either way...YUMMS!

Everything is fairly basic, sandwiches don't come with fries or anything but  since it's decent pricing, it's ok. According to A LOT of people I know the milkshakes and malts are superb. I don't dance that route too often but if you're a fan of either I think this should be visited.

I like the vegetarian options, always a plus to have healthy alternatives, rather than just one option. Plus YT has been around for a while and you know when you go there what you are getting. The recipes are always the same and don't falter. Good reliable YT."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a great small town diner feel and their gluten free options are great. They have gluten free bread, which opens up a lot of the menu (burgers and sandwiches), but their salads look delicious too and there are a number of entrees that work. The staff is also pretty knowledgeable when you ask about marinades (the entire section of grilled chicken sandwiches is safe-the marinade is Italian dressing). The food has been good every time I've been here, and the coffee is good (and bottomless). Definitely a Chagrin Falls staple."}
{"text":"I love Yours Truly... no matter what the location the food and service are top notch."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food, mostly as I remember from coming years ago (notso fries). Service was very friendly but it was hard to catch our server's attention while waiting for our food which also took quite a while to come out.  Overall, a good but not fast paced, diner experience."}

Would Suggest To Others? Yes
What I Ordered: Eggs Scrambled

- Good Breakfast/Lunch Selection

- Slow Service

We went to Yours Truly Restaurants with a group of people, all of us looking for brunch. The food at Yours Truly was good, but unfortunately it took a long time to get the food. I understand serving a large group, all with different orders and requests, is not easy but all our orders were simple. Most of us got 2-3 eggs cooked various ways but it took over an hour to get the food after we ordered. Overall, the food and atmosphere were good but the wait turned us off."}
{"text":"I was visiting my grandma in Hudson and my uncle recommended this place. Turned out to be a good recommendation.

The service is quite friendly and attentative.
And the food was pretty good. My grandmother and I had omlettes. I had to get Tabasco to suffice for my taste buds accustomed to all types of spicy food back home in Los Angeles, but the food was pretty good.
My sister had this eggs bruschetta that also looked good.

The vibe of this place was like a nicer, homelier version of IHOP or Denny's. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good place. Not exceptional but you have to keep in mind that this is Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Didn't have silverware. The server took our drink order, I ordered a milkshake. She let it sit on the mixer for 8 minutes. I timed it. Then she tried to hand it to me as it was literal milk. I told her I don't want it because it's so thin. and she still charged me for it. She wasnt taking care of anyone properly. The manager had to come over and take control of the whole bar and take out orders. Our food was delicious. But will definitely avoid the crazy blonde server/bartender."}
{"text":"Two people in our party were served ribeyes that had gone rancid. You would have thought the kitchen would have caught the awful smell permeating from them before serving it to guests. That was obviously not the case. The smell alone encompassed our table. We promptly set them back. One person opted for a different entree, just a plain burger. The other after the experience wanted nothing else. I ordered the general tso chicken and it was pretty decent. The notso fries the table split were not-so impressive! You'd think the manager would come apologize for the bad meat but you'd be wrong again! We had to ask to speak with the manager. He came to the table acting bothered by our asking to talk to him. All he wanted to talk about was how busy he was dealing with some guy digging through their garbage looking for a license! Not the issue at hand at all. Manager was very rude and unapologetic.  Serving bad meat is a big deal and honestly all we wanted was a genuine apology but received nothing of the sort. Really expected a much better experience. ."}
{"text":"After a fast seating, we waited with two kids for twenty minutes for service, any service. Finally a waitress came over and apologized saying our waitress left unannounced and they just realized it. Well order food and drink before she could leave again. Thirty minutes later our food finally arrived. When queried the waitress said one of the cooks just quit. Maybe an unusual night but we will never go back to a place with such employee problems."}
{"text":"Consistent food and friendly service at this upscale diner. There's a counter with stools where you'll always find regulars. A small patio offers outdoor seating. The dining room is lined on both sides with booths. The tables in the center can feel cramped like your sitting right next to the adjacent table. It's not elegant, just a diner with some good dishes, beer, wine, a flavored coffee of the day and cappuccinos. The prices are good and the service is typically quick. Coffee refills are always expeditious. 

The women's bathroom is pleasant and clean. The tables and menus have always been clean and I've never had any issues with stickiness. It seems a popular lunch spot for area business people. When there are families close by with active children, it can get loud. 

The food has always appeared cooked from whole ingredients. I enjoy the omelets and the Napa spinach salad regularly. This is a five star breakfast/lunch diner. I'm not sure I'd say the same about diner."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a meal.  I do mean little, but they make up for in friendliness and quality of food.  

Have never had a bad meal and always fresh cooking.

Newly renovated and updated"}
{"text":"This is a quiet little restaurant. Which I love! Its small and intimate. 

The food was good. I especially like their French fries. Its typical cafe food. We didn't wait long for our order. 

The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  Its definitely a place I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my grandaughter and the family.  She's 6 and so having the play-nook is a definite plus.  The waffles were great, unfortunately I chose the corned beef hash and eggs (so so - waffle next time!)"}
{"text":"Today is a beautiful day here in Chagrin Falls and made better by the tasty meal I had at Yours Truly. If you get a chance, try the Fried Artichokes and the Napa Salad.  Our server Geoff recomended both and like our food, he was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for a breakfast this past weekend.

Very efficiently used space in this micro sized restaurant. Seriously, we were lucky to get a booth and with 2 people per side, you got knees and elbows hanging out over the side. To get back to your table from the washroom, you have to turn sideways to slip past the bussers. I watched several people get frustrated with the family style seating at the tabletops.

My steak and eggs were delicious and the others I was with enjoyed their omelets and hash browns. Service was not great here, we had to keep asking the manager to get us coffee fill ups, nor was it too friendly. They do another kind'a quirky thing too; before you give your card to the server, the manager asked me to \"Flip it over and run it down\". I thought is was a joke or something. Translation for those of you who don't speak Yours Truly: they want you to add your tip to your bill before they run your card. I guess that makes it more efficient. 

Although the food was fine, I don't think I'd be back."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or brunch! The quality of their foods keeps me coming back for more and more!!! The friendly staff makes sure your always satisfied. The Suncakes and Danny Boy are amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here because I wanted Notso fries and they did NOT disappoint!! They may have been better than I remembered! Due to their deliciousness, there isn't a picture. 

My husband ordered the Chagrin Broil, which isn't on the actual menu, but they will still make it. He enjoyed it. 

I ordered the Asian chicken and vegetables with rice and a salad. This was fair. Kinda dull. Over cooked veggies and dry chicken. Salad was yummy and big for a side salad!!

All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Servers everywhere, everyone of them were helpful and always there, I almost forgot which one was our waitress, but great job, well managed. I didn't take pics cause I was with a client! But we had breakfast, it came fast, hot and made just right. Mine was simple, eggs, sausage patties and dry wheat toast! The coffee of the day was toffee, and I'd go back just for that!!! Overall really nice experience!!"}
{"text":"We are not from here, so relied on reviews from Yelp to find a restaurant that has Gluten Free options for our daughter.  VERY NICE mom and pop restaurant with excellent service and menu options.  Burgers were HUGE and homemade patties. We will definitely be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"super cheap, yummy diner food.  not too greasy.  5 fingers with tango sauce, lotso fries.  It's where people go in the area.  if it is holiday season- good luck getting a table at a normal hour (and this is AFTER the expansion)."}
{"text":"I kept this review on the back burner however I don't remember why I never finished it. I do remember we went here for an early Valentines day weekend day trip, and just decided to eat here after looking at reviews for other places. 

When we walked in we were not sure if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated. Even though the place was not full and there were employees that past us several times we stood at the entrance for a good 5 min with employees staring at us wondering why we were in the restaurant. I finally, walked over to an employee and asked, is this seat yourself? She said No, you have to wait to be seated. Ok, I'm waiting.... I didn't want to get snippy but I was annoyed that no one said Hello or Please wait to be seated or we will be with you in a min you can insert any normal saying that one would expect to hear from any type of employee. 

We were finally seated and our server was so awesome. She was old school, and kept our drinks full and everything. I wish I can remember her name because  we talked about how much we loved her. (Sidebar) We sat at a little two top table next to two older ladies that gossiped and complained about everything and anyone, which made me laugh a little because you can hand someone a hundred bucks like that and they would complain the money was dirty or green. 

The food was ok, we had two cheeseburgers that were not great but not memorable either. I mean they were cheeseburgers. I do like a great cheeseburger, so I thought these were lacking.

If it was not for our great server I don't think I would of gave this place three stars."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is the reliable local chain where you know you're never going to get bad food, but you're not likely to get any great food, either.

YT is a regular breakfast stop for me, always with a former colleague.  Their omelets are very good, and their pancakes are very good, as well.  Great coffee, as well.

I'm not a big fan of pulpy orange juice, but I love orange juice, so this represents a small problem for me.  I have to skip it.  

I've been in for lunch and dinner, too, and get the Special Delivery burger.  Mushrooms, onions, and sour cream on a burger... I never thought to put sour cream on a burger.  I should have.  They did.  They win.

All in all, as I said to start, YT is reliable.  But, \"old comfy pair of shoes\" reliable, not \"little black dress\" reliable.  Not that I know anything about the latter.

Nothing special, consistently good, friendly wait staff, and very reasonable prices.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome, but the food was mediocre. I can tell that nothing was fresh, and the cooks shouldn't be cooking because my eggs Benedict wasn't a true eggs benny, it had fried eggs instead of poached. If i wanted fried eggs i would have ordered that. The hollandaise sauce was disgusting."}
{"text":"I can't tell you about the food... I didn't get waited on! I only recommend NOT to go to this one in Shaker Square."}
{"text":"Nice and low key and good food and quaint. It's a good place to go for grub at reasonable prices. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"It truly breaks my heart to write this review but it must be done. This is not the first time that I have had a horrible experience at Yours Truly and most importantly I hope this will be the last. 

        I frequent YT on the regular and most of the time I have a pleasant experience. My waitresses are always friendly, as well as the hostess, service is always professional with no worries and most of all the food is decent. But today I decided to treat my family to breakfast on a Saturday. Keep in mind that I have eaten here plenty of weekends and I have never had any complaints until now. I ordered pancakes and a monster hash which is something that I usually have and my children both ordered mouse pancakes. My pancakes are usually big and fluffy but today they were small and a little on the tough side, my sausages were not well done like I ordered and my monster hash, was just plain old hash browns instead of the cheese and green onions that I always order. My children's order was messed up as well, they ordered the two mouse pancakes but instead they one got the mouse pancakes and the other got extra pancakes. Jamie, our waitress said that she added the extra pancake, I'm assuming that she made a mistake but that's not how it sounded. She informed us that we wouldn't get charged for the extra pancake but I'm not sure how she could make that mistake when she wrote down the order. As for my monster hash for the seconded time I was disappointed. These were the grossest monster hash I have ever seen. They were just slopped on the plate just any old kind of way and it was half the size of the hash browns that they originally gave me, also the coby cheese that I'm use to, was replaced with mozzarella or American cheese that wasn't all the way melted did not look appetizing. I sent them back without replacing them. I mean really? Why is it okay to have shit on the plate? It did not look good so why send it out? I felt like I was just being served whatever they had left over, it was absolutely disappointing. Our waitress asked me if I want to replace them, even though the third time is a charm but at that point my stomach was just turned off. We all ended up eating the rest of our meal but I was not satisfied and ended up finding a flaw in every bite that I chewed and swallowed. I hope that a manager reads this and takes this as a warning. I am a regular here and I hope to enjoy this place for many years to come but I won't be returning anytime soon.

Over all good place to dine, just make sure the waitresses understand the order."}
{"text":"This is a classic Cleveland institution that employees quality people who are make the average Joe feel like they are apart of the family being served by some aunt or uncle of yours who you love to visit for the company and cuisine. It is comparable to a diner like Cameron Mitchells Cap City in Columbus, however I prefer YTR because of the atmosphere, food and prices are very comparable."}
{"text":"Sitting in the strip of downtown Chagrin Falls, Yours Truly is the perfect place for a cozy diner feel.  This place offers all the best of a classic greasy diner (great wraps, patty melts, burgers, etc).  The girl who served me was exceptionally friendly & even served an additonal serving of fresh fries because the ones I got were the last of the batch and weren't as fresh.  The pricing was standard issue ($6-$10) for your entrees & the dessert menu is also worth checking out.  The reason I rated is as a 4 & not 5 is that the backroom was full of loud kids watching Disney shows on the TV in the corner - Stay in the front room if possible."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out here Saturday afternoon because we were in a hurry to get across town.  The bad news is that it took 20 minutes to make a turkey club & a chicken wrap.  The good news is that the food was good.  It's hard to judge the wait-staff because all we did was order & come back to pick it up, but everyone seemed nice enough as we were picking up the food.  I believe the total was about $18 for two:  Not great, but not bad either.  I would recommend this place for a casual lunch, though not somewhere to enjoy a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices.  My wife and I stopped in for lunch during the week on our lunch breaks. We were in and out within 40 minutes which was great.  We both ordered the fish fry.  It had 2 really nice pieces of battered cod which was plenty.  Nice thick filets in a light batter.  The fish was served with cottage fries, and coleslaw.  It was a very filling lunch in a nice \"diner\" atmosphere.  I drive by on my way to work every morning and they seem quite busy at breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday morning for brunch with my family. We had a 20 minute wait and were seated. Very nice waitress. The host/manager obviously all business.... rapidly ran people to be seated and literally tossed the pile of menus on the table. No greeting, how's your day, sorry for the wait, your waitress will be here shortly...just dash toss dash. He has been there for years, maybe an owner. 

I had the monte cristo and shared not so fries. Both were delicious. Husband had eggs Benedict. He is very picky but thought they were pretty good. Daughter had teriyaki chicken salad. It was enormous. She liked but brought most of it home. 

Very clean as always. Reasonably priced.  Good variety of choices. Our two vegetarians had no trouble finding choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Well.........not much to say but it was okay. I'm not interested in going back here any time soon. The food was bland and the bread was horrible. Much change needed...."}
{"text":"Just a regular Truly Yours place. Came here for breakfast, and got one, lol. 
Although, the place have a huge menu, I can't say that it would my first option for breakfast. The place was clean but  the waitress was super busy and didn't pay too much attention to us- what I mean, she was not attentive with the coffee, food was delivered in fast way without smiling or saying something- she was busy or maybe unhappy that day. 
What I liked it was my white eggs omelette- the cook did all well and I really enjoyed my breakfast. 
I don't think that I will be back here just because there are plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"My previous review still applies, but while I resisted giving them the extra star out of pure nostalgia, I'm giving them one for nostalgia plus apple pie with cinnamon ice cream."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, good food with nice monthly features. Always feel welcome by the host or hostess no matter how crowded it is. Breakfast and lunch crowd and a nice place to go to at 9 pm after an event to get a nice dessert. Family and group friendly! Great place to bring the grand kids with the train table!"}
{"text":"Good food in a tight fit. Loved my turkey club and cottage fries.  Came back on my second trip to Cleveland for another club and taking a turkey Reuben for my Dad"}
{"text":"Yours Truly is the Winking Lizard of the diner world. An established NE Ohio chain that serves up reliable food at fair prices (minus the drafts). 

YT has been serving up comfort food since 1981. On a related note, it appears the decor hasn't been updated since it's inception. Not  that this is necessarily a bad thing because there's something comforting about paisley & floral wallpaper, brass fixtures and big oak booths. I'm teleported back to my childhood each time I step into this establishment. So much so, I almost expect to see Marty McFly and Doc to come barreling through the doors each time I'm dining! Great Scott!! 

The menu is typical for what you would find at most diners including Breakfast, Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads, etc., with a few surprises mixed in  such as Hummus, General Tso's Chicken and a creation in what they call \"Notso\". 

The Notso fries (also available in the form of an omelet), consists of a plate of cottage fries, melted cheddar cheese, bacon & a dollop of sour cream. All ingredients work well together and I'd imagine this sinfully gluttonous dish has to be a top fav on the list of stoner munchies. 

All in all, Yours Truly seems to be a popular destination among the locals. It's comforting and the food is consistent. Not knock-your-socks-off great, but not bad either. Just plain consistently acceptable. Not that there's anything wrong with that..."}
{"text":"This is a favorite breakfast spot for our family. Very kid-friendly with a diverse menu. However, sometimes we get a server that makes us wonder how they got (and keep) their job. Breakfast is served all day, but their lunch menu is just as delicious."}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Cleveland for some time now and I keep driving by this chain. Tonight I finally decided to swing by for dinner. 

Their breakfast food options looked unique, but I was really intrigued by the chicken salad and tuna salad. They get their own feature section on the menu. I ordered the chicken salad melt. It's served open faced on an English muffin which is then covered with cheese and baked. 

The chicken salad was good but nothing life changing. They are heavy on the walnuts. I also ordered a side of Cole slaw which is one of my favorite side dishes. This one had a really weird taste. I can't even relate it to anything in particular. It was not pleasant. 

The service was okay. It's a TINY restaurant and I found myself waiting quite a bit despite it only being about half full. 

I'm hoping to have the opportunity to try their breakfast so I can update my review and give it an additional star(s). For now, based on my meal and experience tonight I can't bring myself to give it above a 3."}
{"text":"Umm, this place is fantastic and I will fight whoever says otherwise. I love the Notso fries more than my children and the grilled chicken Cobb is huge and tasty and I want to drink the ranch dressing. My daughter loves the spinach salad. We always get good service, they have good prices, and it's just a cute simple sit down and eat kind of place. Never change. I love you just the way you are. 
Oh, and they always play good music."}
{"text":"Our group of four stopped in at the perfect time for a Memorial Day afternoon. We were immediately seated by a young teenage hostess, who seemed uninterested in us, as she dropped the menus on the table. Fortunately, she was just one of the hostess. 

Another nice teenage waitress came to attend to our table. She ordered our drinks and entrees. We ordered Notso Fries to share as an appetizer. Delish! Unfortunately, they were out of sour cream. The waitress suggested ranch. That worked. We ordered general Tso chicken , boneless buffalo  bites (good), The Club burger-medium (great); Special Delivery burger-medium (underseasoned-okay). Our food came out promptly. When we asked for more silverware, we were told the dishwasher had just broken down, so they were limited w/silverware. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our Neal. We also ordered the Berry Blast and apple pie w/ice cream. 

All in all, a pretty good meal. It was just a lot going on that day."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Even better service. THE place to go in Chagrin Falls for breakfast I had the kill it skillet. It's a meal enough for two but I ate the whole thing"}
{"text":"Very small but great service.  We got lucky and got seated almost immediately.  I had the Barcelona omelet and my friend had the sunrise.  We both recommend them.  The jalapenos were fresh and not out of a can.  I can stil feel the heat.  Great hangover food!!  Not to mention we got out of there for $20.00.  Hope to get back there soon."}
{"text":"Simply the best food for the buck around!

Great selection and superb staff.  I LOVE YT!"}
{"text":"I love a good neighborhood diner, but this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift. Everything is so old and worn, tile floor missing many tiles, etc.
We went about 10:30am and the floor was a mess littered with food, paper, and spills.Employees need to pay more attention to cleanliness instead of turning tables. 
Food was ok. Employees were friendly."}
{"text":"What a great find! Being super foodies, we love finding places like this. Not a franchise, everything is made from scratch, and they're super family friendly. Traveling with kids is always tough, so this was a breath of fresh air to be able to actually EAT my food while the kids were safely distracted and/or stuffing their faces too. LoL. Our waitress, Christian, was amazing and we can't wait to visit the area again to come back. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right? Haha!"}
{"text":"After 30 years of great service and hundreds of visits, Yours Truly is and always will be top of my list as a great place to eat.  The staff is always tops and the food is consistently good.  It also is priced perfectly for an inexpensive value.  One of the best places in Cleveland for a priced right meal that tastes great."}
{"text":"The best old people restaurant around. Gather up ol' memaw and pepaw and get ready to split an order of the famous \"notso\" fries! If that's not more excitement than your doctor recommends before your 4 o'clock dinner, then check out the monthly specials! Yipeee!"}
{"text":"Great classic diner.  The chili (with onions and melted cheese) was phenomenal as were the deep fried artichoke hearts.  My tuna melt (on an english muffin) was so-so, but the other two really made up for that.  I had a sip of a friends vanilla malted milk shake and that was amazing.  Pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Always a great meal!  Super service. Kind and generous!  Clean and neat!  Love the breakfast.  Get the Sunrise.  Best deal in town!"}
{"text":"There are multiple locations so my review is more in reference to the restaurant as a whole, understanding that the food and service varies from place to place. The food and service have been very good at all of the locations we have gone to. Fun fact: the first time I was there I asked my in laws if I could marry my wife. Anyway, I've enjoyed everything that we have gotten. The only complaint is that their dietary accommodation is somewhat limited. My wife is both dairy and gluten free for health reasons which I understand is challenging for the staff but that's my largest issue. Over all, recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little diner type restaurant. Came in for breakfast and had a veggie omelet, hash browns and toast. Even my wheat toast was good."}
{"text":"I'm not from cleveland but feel like I've been to this chain enough to get the gist.  I just don't think it's very good.  It's basically a diner, yet the food takes very long to make it out of the kitchen.  Service is spotty and forgetful.  The menu is big, but not really a lot of variety.  Just the same stuff repackaged as different items.  I legitimately think Bob Evans is a better breakfast"}
{"text":"We researched this place when we knew we were coming to town. Excited to see their gluten free options. I have never eaten GF pancakes out and they were wonderful! We also had eggs, gf toast (Udis) and GF hashbrown.  Great food!  They have a kids train table to play with. Good for little ones, but if you'd like a more quiet breakfast sit away from that area :)"}
{"text":"Good food starts with good ingredients.  Started to go to this restaurant three months ago and I'm hooked.  Find my wife and I there every Sunday morning.  The only issue is they are slow on the coffee refills.  Try the steak and eggs breakfast-you'll be hooked too!"}
{"text":"Went there tonigh love their fish, what a dissapointment when we Sat
 there and waited and waited for someone to acknowledge we were there. Lots of people talking but no one  came near our table not like they were busy, maybe 3 other tables were occupied. Saw people staning around talking. We sat there over 5 minutes.we got up and left."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, service always friendly. There's a reason this local group of restaurants has stayed popular for so long. Prices are very reasonable. Yes, this particular Yours Truly is small and you may have to wait for a seat. But that's also the charm."}
{"text":"It's time in Cleveland , I found this great little restaurant, breakfast was really good ,fast , hot and the service was friendly, all the other customer were also real friendly"}
{"text":"Just the the \"killit skillet\" for breakfast and it was a lot of food and delicious! My wife had the eggs benedict and loved it. Staff is friendly and curteous. This place is definitely better than the three stars it is currently rated especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is good.
Here is the reason for the two star rating. This may sound petty. They have a pizza burger that used to be on their full-time menu. They've moved it to a seasonal menu. Really? Why? The manager said he didn't know why either. They have everything needed to make the burger except the marinara sauce. How hard is that to keep daily?
Now the reason for the two star rating is that he had heard this complaint from \"numerous customers,\" and yet they continue to do nothing about it. Maybe with a reduction in high-star count reviews they may actually do something about the complaints.
Also, do not get seated in the annexed back room (the old gun shop). You seemed to be forgotten/lost back there."}
{"text":"It's helps when they actually cook the bacon that comes on the Bacon Tomato Cheese omelet. FAIL !!!"}
{"text":"This is a Small little diner and as somebody described it, an obstacle course to go anywhere. 
The service is quick and friendly which is always a plus.

Menu with lots of different options for all times of day. Since it was lunch, I went with the Tuscan chicken wrap and added sweet potato fries for extra. 

The wrap was great and the grilled onions were awesome. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries though, were served cold. It was during a busy lunchtime Saturday, but I expected them to keep an eye on things like that. Also, as a Pennsylvania guy who grew up on Heinz, I was a little disappointed that they served Hunt's ketchup. Lol

Overall not a bad spot to go to if you're in a rush, but they could pay a little more attention to the details."}
{"text":"A nice place for a family meal. Very good service and a neat selection on the menu. Nothing too fancy, just the basics, but enough to cause a rookie to read through the menu for a tough choice. 

The hostess - Kayla - was awesome, very friendly and helpful. And now that I've been, it is on my \"go back\" list."}
{"text":"Quaint little diner-esque joint that is very near and dear to the hearts of many in Chagrin Falls. It's pretty basic in general, but they never fail to satisfy. There are some dishes that you just can't get anywhere else (e.g. the Notso Fries)! I highly recommend the Killet Skillet!!!! Best breakfast skillet out there. 

Fun fact, it was the first restaurant I ever ate at with my family when we first moved to Ohio in 1994."}
{"text":"I found this a very welcoming place: good, friendly service and a tasteful interior that appears somewhat classically 1950's Americana diner style. The food was simple and no-nonsense fare. I had hot buffalo chicken wrap with blue cheese dressing. Simple, but good and fresh. I got the idea that this is mainly a breakfast-oriented place. My dining companions were impressed by the Gorgeous Omelette, which had gorgonzola in it among other things. One of them actually dreamed about it the other day. I should also add that the service was very good."}
{"text":"had their Friday Fish Fry for the 1st time & it was EXCELLENT .. had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but I don't mind a wait if it is worth it .. thankfully we got our orders in when we did .. shortly after we heard the cry from the kitchen that they were out of fish .. we had not planned to order that but after sitting & watching it come out of the kitchen over & over & noticing how tasty it looked we could not resist .. also heard quite a few calls being taken for Fish Fry dinners to go as well .. 2 huge pieces of cod perfectly battered & fried .. we both opted for the red skinned potatoes .. also quite tasty .. the portion if slaw is a bit puny but the size of the fish & generous portion of potatoes more than made up for it .. will definitely be back for this meal .. I have had burgers there in the past as well & they do not disappoint .. find them a bit pricey for breakfast meals but what I see coming out of the kitchen looks delicious in terms of breakfast items .. especially the omlettes .."}
{"text":"Went for a late breakfast as it was close by our hotel. The omelettes and hash browns were very good!! Hubby wanted to go back for dinner the next day. The club sandwich was perfect! And their chili was the right mix of flavor and seasoning. The loaded fries were my favorite."}
{"text":"Rude facility. My daughter and her friend were completely ignored by the staff. If you are under 21 don't bother patronizing this establishment. Last night my teenage daughter along with her friend took 2 young children they were babysitting to Yours Truly for a quick bite to eat. For over 20 minutes they were rudely ignored by the service staff. You have lost our business. May I remind you that several established restaurants are closing their doors. This failure normally starts with poor customer service  

Yours RUDELY;

Former customer"}
{"text":"Yours Truly is definitely one of the best breakfast and lunch spots in Mentor. They have traditional breakfast options that are all great and a solid collection of sandwiches for the lunch crowd. The chili is also fantastic. 

The service is always on point and they do a great job of getting the food out quickly and correctly. Along with this, the decor is very nice and clean. 

I would recommend anyone looking for a quick bite in the Mentor area to stop in to Yours Truly. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Excellent Place. Everything here was 'just right'.

I'm in Beachwood/Shaker Heights doing some work so wanted to find a diner on the way to work. Easy to get to, right on the main road (Chagrin) with the diner set onto a lot and the cars going in one side and out the other. Easy to park (diagonal). I guess most people don't even care about this kind of stuff but it shows they thought about it.

6:45am, friendly waitress and easy to sit up at a nice little bar when you get in. Manageress was smiling and bright. Cook in an open kitchen was super fast and efficient.  Place is very clean. I notice stuff like that because of my crazy obsessive neat freak wife. But there's no junk or dirt around. Good!

Food was excellent. Basic breakfast. Plates good size, scrambled eggs good, hash browns excellent (not soggy! Crispy!), ham was a good slice and not overcooked. Toast was done excellently, nicely crispy and they use good whole wheat bread. Oh the coffee was good and plentiful as well, and the waitress poured water without being asked. All little touches.

People in there are nice. Waitress knew the names of people. As someone else said, like a Cheers type thing. Kind of a high bar with comfortable seats around it. A dining area too. Other reviewers say this place is super small which I guess it is but they use the space well.

Guy next to me asked about whether the tips are pooled. Which I don't normally think about, but it's a good question and in a place like this for an old hippy like me it matters. So like him I tipped the cook additional to the waitress, but only thing I would say going forward is that when I eat in a chain place like this, I want to know that the folks working there are getting a decent basic wage, tips, healthcare, all that stuff. I don't want underpaid, unhappy, unhealthy people cooking and serving my food! :-)   That's just a personal preference of course but I would actually pay a liitle extra if I knew the owners were good to their staff. I don't eat at any Dardens for example because they jerk their employees around.

As I say, all was just right. Maybe this is normal for Ohio, I don't know. I'm a) English and b) live in Boston where the breakfast s*cks, so perhaps I'm just easily impressed. I know this is a chain, so maybe they're not all this good - but whoever is running this joint should give themselves a pat on the back. Good work."}
{"text":"There ain't nothing wrong with this place or the fact that every time I am home I kill about 5-7 skillets.  They're called \"killit skillets\" but beware that eating this magnitude of eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage patties, ciabbata toast all smothered in cheese does nothing for the waistline...but sure as hell puts a grin on my face that is EAR to EAR."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that serves breakfast all day.  This location doesn't comfortably seat more than 30 people.  The portions are massive and the pancakes are the size of the plate.  This place is easy on the wallet and filling if you can handle the limited amount of space."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary.  The service was average.  My silverware was dirty so I took more from another table, refer back to the service being average as to why I had to make my own exchange.  I've had better food at the Chagrin Rd location.  I had the BTC Omelette with monster hash browns, and a pancake.  Total bill including hot tea was $13.68.  I really wanted breakfast, but given it was mid afternoon on a Sunday with Cleveland winter conditions, I went with what was open.  Outside of the notso fries/omelette, if you want average this is your place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Had to ask for 2 more menus 3 times!! Asked for our drinks multiple times and the waitress confirmed our orders but yet we were missing a few items! Also one of the cooks was wearing a hair net but his dreads were out of it...whats the point of the hair net???"}
{"text":"Had breakfast for dinner! Servers are sweet and very helpful, recommended some of their favorites. My food cane within 5 min of me ordering. Cheap, fast, delish."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I went for dinner but ordered breakfast. The service is impeccable. The eggs were hot and cooked perfectly. I sat at the bar and the server (Robert) here was very attentive to everyone at the countertop and you could tell he had great rapport with the regulars."}
{"text":"A local institution, especially for breakfast. My usual is the veggie omlet (sub cheddar or feta for the standard American) with an unusually hearty and flavorful wheat toast. To drink a rich cup of coffee, supplied by local roaster Phoenix. Also a nice patio on Shaker Square when the weather's warm. Deserts and milkshakes are tasty, too. Kid-friendly. Free wireless Internet, though you may need to shift around a bit to find the best signal."}
{"text":"The service is a little out in left field although well intentioned.  The food comes out quickly but drinks and water are very slow.   The food is solid no doubt.  Can get a nice portion of pretty good stuff for a reasonable price.  I would for recommend for hearty breakfest, or a variety of lunch offering.  Deluxe is the way to go for all sandwiches."}
{"text":"Two words: Notso Fries. They're delicious. I also really like their chicken salad and their soups. A must-stop whenever I come into Chagrin."}

{"text":"We were out on the East Side doing business when we randomnly (with the help of 'Siri') came upon this diner/family restaurant.  The service and food were very good, as was the coffee.  There is a good variety on the menu, and their prices were very reasonable.  I've always been a huge fan of mom & pop owned diners and restaurants, and 'Yours Truly' is no exception.  They are priced much lower than the national chains, and the service was faster.  My only gripe, and it is a small one, is that the floor looked very dated.  The tiny square tiles and grout reminded me of our master bathroom, circa 1972!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from a turkey reuben there this weekend.  Spent 24 hours sicker than a dog.

While the service was good, and everyone else had decent food, this experience has soured me against Yours Truly."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new. First off they shoved is in the tiniest most cramped booth i've ever been in. undercooked bacon which had scallions or green pepper all over it, eggs were cooked well but  tasteless and again had scallions or peppers in em, they dont have a juice machine just little bottles of veryfine so after 2 of em ur at like $5.50 (ridiculous). Idk what they spread on my english muffins but im guessing it was some sort of margarine it was gross. The price was cheap, food was so-so. Service was ok i guess. Seems more like a place for old people and children (people with no pallets or standards) I wanted to try their lunch but don't believe i will go back."}
{"text":"If you're a Clevelander and don't like Your's Truly you should take your talents to South Beach too.  The notso fries are unreal but probably best enjoyed only so often.  I have a hard time finding anything on the menu I don't like."}
{"text":"Excelente for breakfast!

About 6 months ago a business partner recommended this restaurant for a breakfast meeting and the next time we were in town we decided we had to do breakfast here again, and we had the excuse of meeting for business.

Orange juice is freshly squeezed and one can taste the fresh ingredients in every bite of whatever you order.

I ordered the Eggs Bruscheta and the Monster Hash, which in itself may sound like a semi-healthy option but the cheese on top of the hash brown makes it full of guilt as it is full of flavor. The Eggs Bruscheta are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, specially if you want to have some spinach in the morning.

Regular coffee from here is fine, but nothing to wake you up if you are used to drink espressos.

We are already planning on a business trip so we can have breakfast here again..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a number of times (not always this location), and it's always been all right.  I like small restaurants like this though---they have a cozy feel, and it definitely beats going to a chain restaurant any day.  I always take my sister here for her birthday every year because she LOVES their notso fries: chip fries covered in melted cheese and bacon. Heart attack on a plate, but a good one.  Coming here for lunch or dinner, there really isn't any dish that I particularly care for; however, the breakfast...OMG. The killet skillet is the BEST breakfast ever!! Soooo much food, I pretty much don't have to eat the rest of the day, and actually now that I think of it, the prices (no matter what you get) are extremely reasonable.  Some of the locations, actually most of them, are very, very small inside, so it gets crowded fast, and sometimes people who are waiting are almost standing on top of you (Beachwood location). 

This is my thing...I was at the Chagrin Falls location this past Saturday, 10/11/14.  My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer, then food, and the app was taking a little while but we didn't necessarily mind. But our waitress, doing her job, noticed this and asked the cook about it. He flipped out on her, was completely rude and condescending, and totally didn't care we (and probably other customers) could hear it. She kept trying to calm him down and said \"I know\" to which his response was \"Yeah, you know a lot, don't you?\" The staff must've had a meeting about workflow or something, because she said \"in our meeting yesterday\" with his response being \"I wasn't hear yesterday\" and I guess that meant whatever was decided in their meeting didn't apply to him.  He was so unbelievebaly rude, and later made a comment to another server about the way she did (or maybe didn't do) something...apparently everyone was doing the wrong thing but him.  He must've been too cool with his Cleveland Indians hat his was wearing...you still have to come here for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Any time there's a gluten free pancake on the menu, I can't resist checking it out. Enjoyed the cozy, country vibe here. I thought it was a local restaurant around Cuyahoga Park, but I came to find that it's a chain.

Warning about the pancakes - they're huge! You definitely get your money's worth. My boyfriend and I split the 3 blueberry gluten free pancakes, but we were only able to eat two of them. They're dense and had a slight floury taste, so I needed some extra syrup to sweeten it up. I liked that the blueberries were incorporated into the batter instead of just placed on top.

The other breakfast items were generic but decent. The only thing I didn't enjoy were the hash browns. They were quite mushy and hardly crispy. 

Service was great. The waitress was very friendly and efficient, and the food came out quickly even though the restaurant was busy."}
{"text":"We stopped here yesterday for something different. We typically end up at an Asian restaurant. I've heard of Yours Truly but it never seems to be around when hunger strikes. This time we happened to see the freeway sign saying it was at the next exit. We walked in and the place had a friendly atmosphere. The menu looked good and our server, Anthony, was very attentive and friendly. There was a miscommunication and I got the grilled cod. I thought I had ordered the battered cod. Anthony was quick to change my order and it came out fast. The manager was busy working with his staff and made sure we were happy and taken care of. It's nice to see a manager that steps in to serve food right along side his staff. The food I didn't care for the baked cod, but my husband ate his with passion. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. The battered cod was good especially with their house made tarter sauce. This is definitely a place to go back to!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday to escape from the pizza night we were having at work for dinner (a separate review entirely). It was around 6pm and the place was already packed when we got there - a good sign.

The restaurant itself is pretty small, seating maybe around 50 people max, and feels like a community bar. A few of the people sitting near us seemed to be regulars and knew the staff members which I thought was pretty nice. The staff are definitely friendlier than average and are helpful with the menu. 

I ordered the hot buffalo wrap with the side of fries. It took about 20 minutes to come out, which was longer than i expected given the simplicity of the dish I ordered. The wrap itself was good, but nothing too different than what you can expect to get from places like TGI Fridays and the like. The fries were really good - not too oily and not to salty either.

Overall this place is a good place if you are looking for a casual bite of food with a small group of friends (or alone). Prices are fair and you can expect to be in and out within an hour or so. I would recommend coming here once in a while as an alternative to places like B-Spot, but is not really in the same category as places like Cheesecake factory, if that helps."}
{"text":"I've Always loved Yours Truly as a kid I used to get breakfast from here but now as I have become older I get the not so fries which are delicious I suggest you substitute the American cheese with cheddar mmm way better the service here is great as well always friendly and attend quickly to your needs I also suggest the burgers they have been given best burger award before and I see why. The Chicken Tenders are good as well they go wonderful with their infamous Tango sauce which is an amazing must try. If your in the neighborhood and want a quaint little place with amazing food I suggest you stop here."}
{"text":"We began coming here a couple of years ago and  liked it.  Food quality and service has declined significantly over the past few months.  Today it took 40 minutes to get our meal and it wasn't right or good in a couple of the items.  Server did not listen and manager didn't seem concerned.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. The serving staff are extremely professional and accommodating. It's great when a restaurant and it's people appreciate your patronage. 

It's a busy place, but they absorb the stress and create a wonderful atmosphere to relax and enjoy some great home cooked food!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The food is always consistently good. Great service."}
{"text":"I'm being nice and giving a 3 for cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms. It's also nice that there are toys set up for kids to play with. However, the service and wait times were not great at all. We waited 10 minutes at the door just to be sat at our table (with multiple employees looking at us and not even acknowledging us), then once we were sat our waitress took quite some time to bring us out menus, silverware, and take our drink order. Waiting on our food wasn't too long but was longer than average, and the food wasn't that great. Waitress then decided to break the check down to multiple checks for even the kids separately from the adults.  When we told her it was only 2 checks needed and the kids would be with the adults she replied very rudely with \"well you said separate checks\". She just couldn't understand that kids typically don't pay for their own checks, especially kids that are 8 and 4 years old."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a very well run eatery offering fantastic service and quality food.

Known best for their breakfasts, they have some creative offerings like skillet breakfasts, breakfast burrito and muffleto sandwiches.

Weekend late mornings you might have to wait to get in."}
{"text":"I regret coming here.  The burger wasn't cooked to my requested temperature, it was overcooked.  The side of fries was cold and chewy.  The tasted like they were cooked yesterday.  I had to remind the server for the coleslaw, but when I received it it was terrible."}
{"text":"First off, must try the NOTSO fries!  They were definitely not good for you, but they were great!  Loaded with bacon and cheese!!!

My wife had the Cobb salad with ranch dressing.  It may have been the biggest salad I have seen at a restaurant.  Not only was it big, it was delicious. The chicken had great flavor and the ranch dressing had to have been homemade.  (We used it on the NOTSO fries - it was that good!).  I had The Club Burger cooked medium rare, which was great!  

The location is great right on Main Street in Chagrin Falls.  Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and had great service!  We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Would have be nice if the steak was cooked better. The restaurant menu was very   Busy would have been nice if pictures were available so we could try something more adventurous."}
{"text":"I love YT restaurants in general but after the experience I had last night at this branch, I will not go back until the manager that worked last night is fired. I specifically asked about a certain dish based on the photo in the menu. I needed to know because my gut will have major problems if I have gluten. I was assured by the waiter that it was not battered. What came out was was battered chicken fingers and not the chicken wings I ordered. I was then told that they didn't have chicken wings and walked away without asking me if I wanted anything else. We had already waited 20 or so min for the food to be delivered after ordering and the sandwich I ordered (with gluten free bread) to go with the wings was already only luke warm by that point. I ate the sandwich. The waiter returned when I was halfway done with the sandwich and then asked if I wanted anything instead. By that time i wasn't about to wait another 20 min for another entree. The waiter was very nice and simply made a mistake. I was willing to let this all go but then this happened. The waiter came by with this electronic pad for payment. When I went to select my tip, I noticed the tip amounts were dollars more than what the tip percentages should have been. I pointed it out to the waiter and he was surprised and went to get the manager. The manager came over and said \"what's the problem here?\"  I thought the waiter would have told him about the tip percentages being wrong. I showed him my bill and told him that a 20% tip based on my bill would be x amount. And then showed him the device and the tip amount it shows for 20%. Much more. He grumbled words I didn't understand and took the device and started punching stuff in it. I asked him if it was basing the tip amounts on the original figure from before they took off the chicken wings. He looked at me and said we don't sell them here. I told him that I had specifically asked about them and was assured that you did and that nothing was battered because of the gluten intolerance. He wouldn't even look at me and he kept doing stuff with the device. Then he put the device in front of me and said type in what you want to give for a tip. I typed in $3. He said to me, \"is that all?\" I said that's more than 20% but he puts my new receipt down with the tip added into the original amount and no pen to sign, turned around and walked away as fast as possible. Next thing I know, I get an alert on my phone as I always do when I'm at a restaurant or store and purchase something. The amount is $4+ more than the total with the tip. Normally it goes through initially for the amount without the tip and the tip shows up during final processing. I couldn't believe his treatment of me to start with but this was too much. I brought my receipts and phone up to him at the register and asked him why he charged me over $4 more than my total with tip. He said he charged me correctly. I said that my bank charge says otherwise and try to show him. He refuses to look at it and said that he put it in correctly and nothing went through yet. I said it obviously did go through because it's already been charged to my account. He said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am when the bulk processing happens. I asked him how the wrong amount showed up on my account if he put in the correct amount. He just said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am. At this point, there was no point in discussing the matter with him any further. I told him it had better be correct and that this has been the worst experience. He never looked at me or apologized.  Mind you, this morning the amount on my bank is still incorrect. This manager has committed fraud and is one of the worst restaurant managers ever. I tend to tip 20-30% based on service. Despite the error the waiter made he was still a good waiter in every other way. His tip was more than 25% based on the total. However, charging me an additional $4+ for what, I don't know, was fraud and that I will not tolerate on any level."}
{"text":"The food is fine. It is filling typical diner food. I gave  3 stars because everything is a la cart so the bill can really add up.  Many better options in Hudson."}
{"text":"If filled with my family and friends, this would be my idea of Heaven.  It's a small, cozy diner with outstanding food - including breakfast all day - and wonderfully friendly staff.  The atmosphere is like visiting a grandmother's kitchen.  (Well, IF the grandmother had a full commercial kitchen and great stools at a lunch counter, among other restaurant-y things . . . but this is still what it feels like to me.)  For years I have made this a pilgrimage site - this particular location, because the others, while still good, don't have the same warmth to me - every visit I've made to Cleveland; I've visited daily or every other day on each visit and I intend to continue looking forward to these opportunities."}
{"text":"Going to Yours Truly makes me realize that Mentor really needs a good diner. Nothing terrible here but it's definitely average. I had a taste for a club sandwich and YT makes a decent one. I would only eat breakfast here if I wanted a bloody mary. The service was alright, she tried to give us the wrong check, but that was an honest mistake. I should have asked for my fries well done too. They were under cooked and cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner yesterday. The food was great! I had a chicken sandwich, cottage fries and slaw. I am in love with the cottage fries!!! The food is reasonably priced and I like that I can get a cheap beer in this diner setting. The waitress was a bit slow and didn't really check in on us much, but that's ok bc once I got the cottage fries nothing else much mattered!!!"}
{"text":"The service was nice and amicable. The food is a different matter. Of the two items that were ordered, one was foamy and runny for a breakfast burritos. The other had hair in the eggs and one the ham."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Cleveland area all my life and it's taken me 29 years to finally try this local gem. Simply put, I see the reason YT is so successful, with 8 restaurants and 32 years in the biz. My first time was actually at the Chagrin Falls location at it was a hit. My second was here in Mentor (also a hit). You just can't beat the quality to price ratio here. It's has a diner feel but it's so much better. Give it a try, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Slow and disorganized. We should have driven to Beachwood, where service is friendly and quick. At one point, we noticed that while full, no one was eating in the whole dining room. Go there if you have plenty of time to wait. The food is good and the waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing; great food,  wonderful employees and the prices were cheap. Our waitress,  Reagan, was also amazing.  I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good: it's great for breakfast. Try the scrambled eggs with cheese and raisin toast. Excellent coffee. The Sunfest includes fresh fruit, which is truly wonderful.
Fair: Lunch is usually very busy. I have had to wait or have been seated in a corner, which I abhor.
Dinner: 
Have had very challenging experiences here in the evening due to a very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"What is with the hype over this place?! 2 stars for the only saving grace... the vanilla milkshake. The restaurant is too small, too greasy, too hot, and with a line cook standing over my meal, too unappealing. The cottage fries are mediocre at best. I think I've had my Yours Truly fill for 2017."}
{"text":"Four stars during the day in the evening one star completely confused no team work female manager not on floor unlike day manager Carl who is awesome"}
{"text":"Over the years we've patronized several of this mini-chain's stores, usually for luncheon, as none are exactly around the corner.
On an earlier stop here for lunch one day, the lady found them lacking so we hadn't returned until the other couple we met for a ride suggested breakfasting here pre-ride.
So we did.
The other gentleman's lady and I both got the Kiilit Skilliet which is every breakfast food know to man tossed together and finished in a skillet, as has become the breakfast fashion during the past decade or so.
We both enjoyed it immensely.
Her comment, with which I partially agree was that getting it cheeseless might be a consideration as it greased it up a bit.
My lady got a yogurt parfait maybe a muffin as well, I dunno.
To me sweet and breakfast, outside of the occasional smear of jam are mutually exclusive, so I find my ears go adrift once the yogurt word escapes the lady's lips.
She however enjoyed it immensely so for all you other sweeties out there, there you go!
The other gentleman got a waffle, eggs, sausage and wheat toast and his knife and fork flew with the precision and furor of a ninja in battle!  So methinks he liked it! He commented his waffle was perfectly done with a crisp exterior and flaky fluffy interior.
He also commented, as did his lady, on the breads that were served with the meals and I would agree they were good, and if not premises- made, at least made to order for the premise.
This mini-chain has always struck me as a breakfast place that also adequately does lunch and dinner to make ends meet, kinda Cracker Barrel/BobEvansy in ilk, so for those who have expressed disgruntlement at \"happy hour\" and dinner poriton issues, it might just be a case of the old \"silk-purse from a sow's ear\" deal when one dines here for other than breakfast . 
Two of our party got hot tea and the table was presented with a nice tea chest with a variety of selections.
He, however left the table for a moment before it's arrival and hence not having an opportunity of making a selection and two waitresses separately came a grabbin' it back before he was able to make a selection, the latter commenting that someone else was waiting for it.
What?
A dining room accomodatiing at least 65 and one tea chest?
Mr. Truly, pul a couple of twenties out of your pocket and spring for another box, knowahadImean?"}
{"text":"YT is a staple chain in Cleveland. You can always count on finding friends sharing coffee or a meal anytime throughout the day. It's a very community focused organization, something that makes many people feel at home and comfortable when dining here.

I'm all about their breakfast items all the time. They have a ton of different options for omelettes- some healthy and some \"Notso\" as the menu will tell you. They also offer a variety of traditional breakfast items, so that everyone can find something they are looking for.

The servers here are always super friendly and easy going. I enjoy speaking with them. If something didn't come out right, ifs not a big deal and they fix it as quickly as possible. 

The place is also very clean, which I think is important.

Check it out if you are looking for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good menu. You will find anything from breakfast to dinner. Some of the breakfast items are served all day - which I love. Decent price regarding Chagrin Falls area. I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"We stopped by Yours Truly after a recent volleyball tournament to refuel. They're known for breakfast, so that's what I ordered. The rest of the fam opted for the usual dinner for dinner. I ordered a veggie omelet with a side of sweet potato fries. My omelet also came with french fries. My daughter ordered a steak, and the wife ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. My son ordered his usual chicken tenders. 

I gave my son my regular fries while I chowed down on some sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious and they were served with a spicy dipping sauce, which complemented them well. My omelet was delicious. It had fresh veggies and I had a side of salsa, which made it even better. Topped with hot sauce, it was a great omelet. My daughter's steak was decent. It wasn't worth $15 though. My wife said her buffalo chicken sandwich was good. 

We'll visit again."}
{"text":"Very clean and the staff is friendly!! The specialty coffee is good when available (runs out fast on Sunday mornings).
Today's choice for coffee is \"Butter Rum\".
Yogurt Parfait is always good and a great morning starter.
Lots of choices for omlettes, I would suggest the Palermo.
Can get busy and crowded sunday mornings by 9 am so get here early if you can."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was great! Polite staff, great vibe, and delicious food. Highly recommended, in a cute town that's fun to explore."}
{"text":"Really small inside but well worth the wait to eat. Plenty to choose from on the menu and super friendly wait staff. I had the Special Delivery burger with sweet potato fries and would definitely go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Love this place! Used to take my wife there for breakfast when we were dating. Sadly we have moved away, but we still come back and visit this place from time to time. Great food and always great service."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yours Truly ever since I can remember and it's always been good to me.  The chocolate malt and Notso Fries are the two best items on the menu, and you can never go wrong with a burger here.  Plus, it's right in the heart of downtown Chagrin Falls, meaning you can take advantage of the best faux charm the Cleveland area has to offer."}
{"text":"Geico Presents: Tiny House - The Restaurant!

Yes, this place is absurdly small, but the food is still great. It used to be my go-to Yours Truly, but now I fear I'm just too big to enjoy it on a regular basis.

As with the other locations, you can't go wrong with Notso Fries, burgers, chili, breakfast, or the Fryday Fish Fry special.

I would recommend going during off-peak hours to attempt to avoid the crowds. This restaurant feels cramped when empty, but it's a sardine can when it's full.

Did I mention this place is small?"}
{"text":"Usually the food and service is quite good. On Sat. June 11 YT failed miserably. Restaurant was busy due to Art Festival traffic. We  weren't offered water, waiter totality ignored us for a good 15 minutes.  I ordered a cup of chowder,  got an bowl and the chowder was ice cold.  

I saw our food on the counter for a good 10 minutes before it was served.  My quesadilla was burnt on the outside, yet barely warm on the inside. It looked like it was cooked with a blow torch. 

My husband ordered dinner  portion of sliders, he was served the appetizer portion. The waiter later brought him the full dinner portion. They weren't individual sliders, just one big burger cut into 4 pieces, served rare not medium as ordered.

The waiter was very apologetic and comped our order. But it will be a while before I venture back to this venue."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment, after dining this place, i was surprised to see other reviews about this place. The servers there were awesome and the food is so good, i had the killa skillet with cup of chili, very tasty and chili was even homemade, its very rare to find good homemade chili. Good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've passed this place so many times in the past and not once did it occur to me to stop and check this place out. I'm glad I finally did! The restaurant is rather spacious and beautifully decorated. I and my guests can't help but admire the wood paneling and the chandelier every time we go. The menu has a lot to offer, including health-conscious options that I don't see often in many other restaurants I've visited. The food itself is very flavorful and fulfilling. My usual go-to is the chicken tenders and cottage fries meal with tango sauce. The tenders have the right amount of crispiness to them and the tango sauce only accentuates their flavor. The cottage fries are wonderful on their own and I recommend that everyone tries them! The prices are about average, but can be a bit high at times. The only real complaint I have is that there's not a whole lot of room between the table and chairs so the table tends to get a bit too close to my stomach, and that the chairs could use some padding. Other than that, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped for brunch with my fiancee. This place is always packed and we usually just go find some place else to eat. Since we hadn't been here for quiet some time we decided to go anyway. I ordered the Reuben burger, My fiancee the Monte Cristo sandwich. They were both very good  in fact, the food is always good here as is the service. The seats are uncomfortable and we were put right in the middle of the restaurant where people walked by on both sides of us. It felt like we were on display."}
{"text":"I second Liz's review. I dream about Yours Truly, specifically when I wake up with a hangover. Their notso fries are amazing!!! I love their milkshakes... let's just say I love everything about it. After every high school dance we would wake up and head over to YT for some goodness. If you are in the Cleveland vicinity- head there immediately."}
{"text":"Charming. Wide menu selection. Temperature of the food was inconsistent. Some hot. Most of it was cold. Love the artichokes.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Since having children (now 2 & 4 years old) my wife and I have been in search for a decent quality restaurant that is casual, comfortable, and lower on the price scale to frequent often.  We have always enjoyed YT's breakfasts, but every attempt at dinner or lunch as been a complete disappointment.

Our primary disappointment is with the quality of the lunch and dinner foods.  Over the past 5+ years, my wife and I have really begun explore restaurants focused on high quality local/organic foods (e.g. Nosh), food trucks, and other establishments with foods that sing with proper seasoning/flavor/creativity and don't make you feel sick afterwards because the quality of ingredients are so high.  In short, our exposure to high quality foods has raised our standards.  

What we have found at YT, is that the food is flavorless and often lacking proper preparation (if you order something that is more sophisticated than deep frying).  In addition, the food quality tastes as though it was directly loaded off of the Sysco truck from the factory of premade everything.  Think bagged soup reheated, premade dressings and sauces, bagged, frozen and deep fried.  The lunch and dinner menu quality is terrible.

I think the primary people going there anymore (other than for breakfast) are those whose tasting palette has not advanced beyond wings, beer, and deep fried everything or the elderly who has only known poor food quality their entire life.

If you consider yourself anything remotely close to a \"foodie\" than skip it for lunch and dinner.  Breakfast is OK there - it appears that the simplicity of breakfast foods is in line with the skill set of the cooks working there."}
{"text":"First off, I love Chagrin Falls.  It's such a pleasant little burg.  I've been there several times but only recently discovered Yours Truly, as a friend invited me to meet there for breakfast.

Yours Truly seems like the kind of place that is probably doing a bang-up business on the weekend.  They have delicious breakfast, and it looks like lunch and dinner are good, too, based on my perusal of the menu.  They have a bar as well, which means you could come in for a late breakfast/brunch on Saturday and easily transition to early afternoon drinks, then dinner, etc etc...

They have outdoor seating, too - limited but a very nice feature.

When I was here, our waitress was very patient (we talked for probably 15-20 minutes before ordering food).  She was also attentive, and I never saw the bottom of my water glass or coffee cup.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Good food with generous servings. Gave it 3 stars due to service being a bit slow. Took 10-15 minutes to get have waitress acknowledge us. Food was hot and fresh when it arrived. Lots of Cleveland police officers eating there so we felt very safe ."}
{"text":"Love this little breakfast joint. They have a great tea selection, decent coffee and a strong American breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I would have gave five stars but there was a tall male employee sitting at the counter spitting tobacco in a cup. This was not very appetizing while my family and I where trying to enjoy our meal. Really gross never seen ever in any food establishments in my life."}
{"text":"I like Yours Truly, they have a great breakfast selection - my favorite is the Sedona omelette with hash browns. For lunch or dinner, I usually get their turkey reuben or monte cristo with sweet potato fries - love the honey mustard that goes with the monte cristo. Service is always friendly and quick. The restaurant itself is very cute and cozy, love the diner vibe."}
{"text":"The best thing I had was GIANT ONION RINGS. Not the beer batter kind, the bread crumb kind. They were wonderful.

I also really liked the Arnold Palmer that had a iced tea with a pink lemonade. Fun and yummy. 

I did NOT like the \"limited edition\" egg salad. Hardly any egg salad and some odd pickles in there. Not good. The mac n cheese was basic and literally had some salad croutons thrown on top. Bleck...Stouffers is better.

If you have small children they have a train table so that was a big hit. Next time I am visiting family in Medina I'll be finding a new spot to eat."}
{"text":"We love this place and come here just about every weekend. I get the same exact thing every time. Here is my issue. I order \"The Sunrise\" which consists of.... 2 eggs, Choice of meat, toast and hash browns. 
I love the corned beef hash so I sub it for the hash browns. The way I see it, they should up charge me the for subbing the hash browns. Unfortunately they make me cancel the hash browns and order a side of corned beef hash (which I pay full price for) 

Why? So now I'm paying for hash browns (which I don't receive) and full charge for hash?"}
{"text":"I showed up minutes  before closing and I had the whole place to myself. I had the most  delicious food  and  conversation with the  most  authentically  friendly  staff. Thanks for a wonderful  gastronomic  experience. Wes, Katie and the  manager (who's name slips my tired brain right now ) thanks for the awesome hospitality and the great sightseeing tips. See you again soon. 
Yours Truly, Naka"}
{"text":"This spot is a go to place for some comfort food! When we are feeling lazy we can pick it up and take it home for dinner. They have a little of everything. It's also a favorite breakfast place and the service is always friendly! The only complaint is that the building is small which makes it quaint, but not for the claustrophobic."}
{"text":"It has been YEARS since I have been here, but I can't say anything bad!  It was so-so when I was younger, but now I can't complain.  They've really stepped up!  in the \"kids\" section, there is a train table so the little ones have something to do other than color!  LOVE THAT!!  My kids loved it too!!!

The kids menu is awesome, offering a variety of things that most other places do not.  They are flexible also, which is wonderful for my oldest son who is Autistic.  SUPER friendly staff, who is also on the ball!

The food we ordered was fabulous!  Hubby and I each ordered an omelette.  THEY WERE HUGE!!  Oh my gosh!  I couldn't even finish mine.  My boys ordered waffles and a mouse pancake.  They were in heaven.  They even added chocolate chips to the mouse pancake and my youngest was so happy!!!  Everything came out within a decent amount of time, and hot!  

The service was fantastic.  I was never left with an empty glass or in need of napkins.  I will come back!  Sooner than years!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Mentor.  I don't live here now but whenever I come back to visit I always come here. The food is always delicious. The service is always great. It's just a good place to go."}
{"text":"We were regulars here for years.  But the place is going down hill fast!!! Last time we were served raw eggs and today there was a Beatle in my omelette!!!! So gross!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very family oriented place to go with decent food. They have a great patio that is in the center of Hudson for those warm summer days! The service is awesome and always has a smile on their face. Prices are resonable!"}
{"text":"This place is small, but not as small as the place on Chagrin Road in Beachwood; this place has a back room. In the nice weather they put metal tables and chairs on the sidewalk out front (a bit crowded). Those are good seats for people watching, especially when the North Union Farmers' Market is in session. I usually get the same thing here (The Sunrise), but today decided to try something new: the AM Wrap Up with sausage. It was really really good and I think it will be my new usual for awhile. It's a wrap with eggs and sausage (optional) and green pepper and onion and cheese with a side of salsa. While this place was packed even before 1000 the servers did not hurry us along, in fact the kitchen took a little long with the order. A nice relaxed breakfast and then afterwards on in this area on a Saturday you have many options!"}
{"text":"A very busy location always even being one of the larger locations in the area. Always fast service. Truly fresh, real fruit, squeezed on order fruit juices. There is bar area to sit at and tables/booths. Often there is a wait. There are outdoor tables but these are just sat on the sidewalk of the strip mall so it's not the ideal place to sit. I like the omelets when I go here. Additionally the restaurant is good at honouring special requests - adding or subtracting ingredients and getting it right. Some of the tables are a bit awkward as you might get sat next to people you don't know - there are a few sets of 3, 2 top tables all in a row and they often sit two different parties on the 2 ends of these."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday Morning breakfast and were very satisfied. Service was good and the food came out tasty as well."}
{"text":"I used to live in Chagrin and this was a staple! It was so good and it was great to see today that nothing has changed!  Except it's a little bigger which is a good thing because even at 2:30 in the afternoon it was PACKED with at least 4 parties waiting.  Grant it, it was a holiday week with people off and in town for the holidays, but this is such a Chagrin Falls staple that it's always busy.  A cozy little diner with good food and great service and cheap prices!  Can't beat that. 

The food was just the same - the NOTSO fries were AWESOME!!  Loaded with cheese bacon and generous heaps of sour cream.   The BLT was solid and the BF's turkey ruben was HUGE and he loved it. 

The kitchen was fast and even with it being so packed we didn't have a long wait to get both great service and yummy food.

I dig it."}
{"text":"OHHHH sooo good!!!
I've been there a few times now, and got some take out too.
Their food is fantastic! They simply manage to make everything taste so so good!
Their service is awesome; it's like being in someone's house. They really make you feel welcome!
The menu and the prices are out of this world! Both times I sat down to eat it was late night, and after 8pm they have happy hour menu which has unbeatable prices! Not to mention it's probably the only place open in the area that time a night.
Absolutely fantastic! I would give them 6 starts if I could!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with breakfast here and I recommend all day breakfast menu if you are outside of breakfast hours. Great place to bring kids and nice to sit outside in the summer. Outside of breakfast, salads are very good and the chili is solid."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why but I find this Yours Truly to have the best, most consistent food quality of all the others I've been to.  I am a huge fan partially cause I love breakfast and partially cause the food is just so damn good.  Their burgers generally are rated amongst the best in Cleveland every year in Cleveland magazine, I've never had one so I couldn't tell you.  This is because I love breakfast. I'm an egg person so whether its an omlette, the \"Kill It Skillet\" (Hashbrowns, Sausage, Eggs, green peppers, cheese served with ciabatta bread toast),  my absolute favorite the YT Medley (Pita sandwich with a fried egg, bacon and muenster cheese.), or even just a regular eggs, toast and breakfast meat breakfast its always good.  And don't forget a milkshake, they are also some of the best around."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . Came here with my cousin and our food is delicious!  I recommend the notso omelette for sure!  Our waitress, named Seven, was really good and very attentive. For a place where majority of its employees are young I was pleasantly surprised by the good service. I plan on coming back and I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!  Recommended by a local and we stopped for an early dinner.  Food was fantastic, service was top notch and best of all the prices were very reasonable.  Eager to head back, menu looked great.

Try the limeade, it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Traditional diner/family restaurant. Good food. Have a few beer/wine selections. Cozy front room. Larger back room. Always  a good choice. One of a chain in the C-land area. All locations are different."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a local chain diner restaurant. I only come here once in a while, usually for breakfast. Definitely get the not-so fries, a gut busting side of loaded fries with bacon, cheese, sour cream. The omelettes are pretty good. Last night I went for a burger, and it was solid good meal, nothing groundbreaking, but this is the type of place when you want American comfort food."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck! Although this location is particularly small, there is truly no place as homey and comforting as Yours Truly. This restaurant knows how to give you delicious food and quick service. They know how to get you in and out without making you feel rushed. They have amazing milkshakes and burgers. Always smiling and cracking jokes, this restaurant knows how to make you feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Today I came here today for lunch with my parents and it was absolutely delicious. The wait staff was very welcoming. Our waitress was being trained and she was amazing. She joked with us and was always around- getting multiple refills and just being really friendly. We started with the lotso notso fries which are cheese fries except with cottage fries instead of regular. They were delicious as usual. For my meal, I got blueberry pancakes and they were the best I have had in a long time. They had lots of blueberries so they were definitely not skimping on that. My overall experience was fantastic and the next time I come I know I will have the same experience."}
{"text":"Geat service and diverse menu. Very professional business. Some good choices for vegetarians and vegans.  I had some saffron rice and sauted spinach and onions.  The vegan wrap is also a good choice. Rhey serve breakfast all day so you have that option to consider. Great owners and quality local chain."}
{"text":"A staple in Hudson, this old style diner is a casual, family friendly restaurant that offers a good diner menu at affordable prices. The fries are excellent, especially in the form of \"natso fries.\" Burgers are always an easy choice!"}
{"text":"The \"Notso fries\" here are delicious. I crave them at least twice a month.  I love the quaint atmosphere. It's a little crowded but the food makes up for it. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I really just wanted some good old fashion pancakes and this place had just what I was looking for. Their hash-browns were also really good, but I think my favorite was the freshly squeezed OJ (YUM)! The staff was really nice and the restaurant just kind of struck me as somewhere all the locals go because of the great service and good food. If you are ever in the area this is a place to stop"}
{"text":"Very small and service is hit or miss but mostly a hit. Everyone is extremely nice either way and the food tastes great. I recommend the fried artichokes and the omlettes. Also the fries aren't bad but sometimes come out a little cold. Def a solid diner and i will continue to be a repeat customer. Thanks for the reliable good meals!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. Excellent fresh OJ you'll want to check out!"}
{"text":"This place is just a tried and true downtown Chagrin Falls diner. The food is reasonably priced, always fresh and tasty and if they screw up they will fix it with a smile. The servers are usually very friendly and if you get a front window table the people watching is fun."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Glass of Dr. Pepper $2.50 and a small glass.  Sausage and eggs very good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab breakfast in Chagrin Falls (or at any Yours Truly location, really). Menu is diverse and expansive, and affordable for a family get-together. The CF location is a bit compact, so don't be surprised if your party of 5 is squeezed into a booth."}
{"text":"They seem to have a lot of wait staff but our server kept forgetting things. My husband and I ordered drinks and he ordered a diet root beer which comes in a bottle. We probably waited 10 minutes after she brought my ginger ale before she finally brought over his drink. Then we ordered the not so fries which is supposed to come with sour cream and we were over half done with our fries before she remembered to bring it."}
