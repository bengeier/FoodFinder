{"text":"So overrated that it's actually ridiculous. Be prepared to see a bunch of twelve graders trying as hard as they can to have \"such a great night\"   Despite the fact that 50% of people in there are underage, they still have a bouncer at the front door pretending he matters while he slowly checks everyone's I.D as if we're about to enter a secret society. If you've ever been anywhere half decent, this place gets lame quick."}
{"text":"I will try to put it down nicely, this place is not my cup of tea.  Service was ok     The Crowd was a group of really old regulars and it felt like it was a private club or something. And yes there was only 1 large group of men, folks leaving and adding to the group, super duper loud!  Thanks"}
{"text":"I went to the cock and pheasant on the weekend to see my friends band play and as I was seated at the bar I placed a food order for the menus basic hamburger n fries meal. It took then 1 hour to cook and properly prepare this simple meal, when I asked the bar tender what was taking so long he told me that the chef was just making sure the meat was cooked properly. After an hour of waiting the hamburger and fries showed up cold and tasteless. The pints of beer are over priced and the food sucks. Don't expect much or anything at all when visiting the cock & Pheasant"}
{"text":"Came here for a \"pub night\" for a social event after work. The waitress was friendly and since people were arriving at different times, she made sure to greet each guest that sat down and get them a drink right away.    We ordered nachos, fries, wings and drinks. Food came out fast and it was okay. Not the best food I've ever had in my life but it was bar food.    We had a good time chatting and eating but you could tell there were regulars that go there all the time."}
{"text":"This pub is on a blacklist of venues that hire bands for a fee then refuse to pay them the agreed amount at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Decent service, live music, decent pricing for a chain pub pretending to be a local joint. Patio is great in the summertime, great for live hockey games on the tube in the winter, plus the neighborhood has decent restaurants nearby if you don't want to eat here."}
