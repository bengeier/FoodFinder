{"text":"Great small place for pizza and in my opinion the best wings in town.  The beer is well priced too.  The kids are always well recieved at the bar...friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The perfect dive.  Cheap drinks, and amazingggggg food.  You have to try the panzerotti here, delicious, enormous and stuffed with tons of pepperoni and whatever other toppings you want.  I find it hard to believe he even makes money on these things.  We also love the burgers here, they are humungous and very tasty."}
{"text":"So I just had the best burger I have ever eaten! Literally the best. And I've tried many on the Toronto Life 25 Best Burger list (which were great) but this one... I couldn't stop smiling while I ate it. This is one of those places that you just happen to stumble upon, (probably would pass right by unless a family member or friend didn't pull you in) and then you tell stories about how good it (the burger) was for years to come. It's one of those places you might forget where it was, but then all other burgers just won't compare, and you'll dream about the burger you once had here.  So what made my mouth water so much... a homemade bacon burger with cheese (called the Banquet Burger).  Bun - slightly toasted, patty - homemade, just the right amount of char on the outside and juicy on the inside, toppings - the works, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, cheese, and..... bacon.... but their bacon is maple bacon and it gives this burger its kick over the top. This juicy 'large' burger is just awesome, and I want to FedEx it over to Toronto Life so it can too reign publicly among the best.  I had no expectations about this place, but its burger had me singing its praises all the way home.  I heard their other food is made from scratch and also pretty good so I'll definitely have to give more a try next time.  A diamond burger in the rough, you almost don't want to tell others about because you never want it to change.  Thank you for completely satisfying my taste buds and making my night... you little unassuming neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"Would not call this a Family Restaurant.  It is a dive.  Full of drunks.  The food is amazing.  Really generous servings.  All home made.  You won't find any frozen burger here.  If you can stand all the loud talking and overlook the total shabbiness you will be rewarded with a overflowing plate of good greasy spoon fare."}
{"text":"Dive bar,  but the food was great.  Small greek salad was huge and very delicious.  Pazerotti was absolutely massive, and very good.   Highly recommend this bar to anyone looking for yummy greasy food"}
