{"text":"Unbelievable, smooth, fast, gorgeous and delicious....and that's just about our waiter Anthony.   We had a great time visiting from out of town.  The night before visiting Pink Pony my girlfriends and I craved a great steak dinner and were all very disappointed at the nameless restaurant, but after doing a bit of research the Pink Pony showed up on our radar and by GOD am I happy we made the decision to give Scottsdale a second steak chance. 
As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a beautiful hostess who guided us to our table and giving us a little history of the Pink Pony, almost immediately my girlfriends and I were in Love.  Promptly water was brought to us and then we met ANTHONY.  Anthony greeted us with a great smile and his clean look, not like ordinary restaurants where the waiter goes into right into the menu, drinks and then rushes you out, Anthony started out asking how we were and where we are from and looking happy to be serving us. After explaining our disappointment in our meal from the previous night he assured me that we would be happy with what we were about to experience. We ordered a bottle of wine that he recommended to us and like a pro opened the bottle on the spot giving us a taste first and then pouring us all a glass.  We ordered the chopped salad and the roasted beet salad to split between the 4 of us, I was a bit skeptical about splitting seeing how most restaurants don't offer that service, but our dear Anthony assured me that it wouldn't be a problem splitting and he delivered as assured, both salads were amazing and a great portion. Anthony then recommended we try the steaks and pork chops to fix our meat craving we didn't satisfy from the night before, my girlfriends and I being foodies, we all ordered something different.  We took Anthony's suggestions and ordered the pork chop, a tenderloin, the salmon and finally the ribs.  I can't tell you how happy we all were with our choices.  All cooked perfectly and tasted like our mothers and grandmothers used to cook.  
The food was AMAZING, our drinks never got low, and Anthony oh sweet young Anthony you are one in a million.  I wish everyplace I eat has its own Anthony.  The Pink Pony is a fine establishment and has made a customer for life because of the amazing food but more importantly the fine people they have working for them.  A hello, smile, thank you, my pleasure and a goodbye will always go along way and we got it here.  I urge you to give the Pink Pony a chance, you will not regret it... make sure you ask for Anthony and watch him light up your mood and make you laugh.  I adore you Anthony!!

PS: Anthony took us on a short tour and we got to look into the kitchen from the kitchen bar and see how the Master Chefs prepare our meals and WOW..what a grade A team they have."}
{"text":"It does not inspire confidence when your bar tendar has to look up on his phone the most basic of drinks, not complicated high ball drinks I'm talking white Russians and Manhattans, service was slow and food was not stand out, I could say these things could be attributed to growing pains but we wont be back to find out."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great decor. Little pricey but you should know to expect that. Surprisingly un-busy on a Friday night during tourist season. Great open air dining. 

Had the bleu bacon burger. It was very good, bacony and sweet and generous portion. Had the cheesecake, it was also pretty good, very creamy. The meatloaf got rave reviews from our table also. 

We had excellent service from our waiter, he was really awesome."}
{"text":"Well, I had no idea this changed so much!  I was going in expecting a dark, all-wood, old-school restaurant.  The only thing the same is the name.   GREAT food though!

The food we had was wonderful though.  The pretzel with the beer cheese...YUM!  We also tried the Nosh board.  Not bad...not bad at all.  Our friends split the meatloaf and said it was one of the best they've ever had.  Some other friends had the green chili pork.  They said it was very good, could be spicier though.  Guess it depends on your tolerance level.  

My hubby and I split the burger, of all things.  It was cooked perfect and tasted amazing!  Overall the food was delish!  I wish they had tried to keep some of the charm from the original place.  Right now it seems very cold and unwelcoming.  That said, the staff was the complete opposite.  The general manager seemed very involved in how all his customers were doing and the wait staff was very attentive and nice.  We most likely will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, however, the food was extremely oily. The onion rings were dripping oil, fries tasted like oil. We couldn't eat our food. The service was also slow even though the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"So good!  Dropped by based on Yelp reviews.  Amazing food and cocktails.  Our server was fun and very attentive!  The bartender created something special for my wife that was very good!  The nosh plate was excellent.  You can't go wrong with this place at all!"}
{"text":"over-priced tourist trap food. parking impossible.

been here several times through the redesign, new head chefs, new staff, new menu. unorganized vision/management and poor use of a HUGE space.

lacks passion, focus and consistency. this defines Business Venture rather than Restaurant."}
{"text":"The blue burger is the best burger I have ever had! Homemade blue cheese, hand made onion rings, and their burgers are made with prime rib. Awesome taste, great service, and large portion. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had never been to the original version of the pink pony but decided to check it out as the new revamped version. I cannot say with any certainty what they are going for now. From what I know of the old place it was Old Arizona.  A concept which I feel is worth hanging on to. I think they are now attempting to attract the young Scottsdale crowd but they didn't seem to capture that space. My husband and I were by far the young ones in there. 

Our service was one of the worst parts. She was nice but not any good. She had no knowledge of the menu. I can't stand that. You work here, know your product. I would get fired from my job if I knew nothing about it. She also disappeared for a very long time so I had to hunt down someone else for ketchup for our fries and another soda. 
The food itself was mediocre. I had the crispy chicken that wasn't crispy and my husband had the burger which was not a stand out. 

Something else that I ALWAYS find to be an important way to know more about a restaurant is by visiting their bathroom. A truly good restaurant leaves no part of itself unattended. This place could have cared less. There was a soaking half used roll of toilet paper sitting on the vanity and crap all over the floor. 

There was no part of my experience here that would ever make me go back."}
{"text":"Shockingly terrible! Don't bother!!

We were excited to get a reservation to this venerable baseball joint while we were in AZ for spring training. It turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences ever. There is no baseball vibe here. It's just going off of an old reputation which it doesn't deserve. Service went from bad to worse. The waitress finally brought glasses of water and a carafe. She left with the carafe??? Our cocktails showed up, but one of the glasses was cracked from top to bottom. We waited and waited for dinner and the waitress offered to bring us bread. We waited forever for bread, which she then said was still in the oven. She brought three more glasses of water without clearing the first four glasses or the salad plates. By now, the table is getting pretty crowded. Six tiny slices of stale tasting bread showed up for four people. We asked for butter which took ten more minutes. Finally the salads showed up. All the while, the waitress is apologizing for things apparently out of her control. When our dinners finally showed up (50 minutes), some of us needed utensils and we didn't receive steak knives. After we finally received the necessary utensils, the steaks were very good, but the vegetables looked and tasted like they had been boiled since the day before. The broccoli was gray. The pork stew looked like a lunch portion and wasn't very good. We finally finished and asked for the bill. We provided a credit card and the waitress returned the folder. To cap it all off, there was no pen provided!!??!? Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip. All this for $212. PS - They were out of one of their house wines and the bathroom had no paper towels. What do you want for an epic dining experience? Go to Don & Charlie's instead. Good food, good vibe, good service, good time."}
{"text":"omg!!!! 3 little pigs .... wow!!!!! im truly almost speechless!!!! and the service, very very impressive! mngmnt even came by to see how everything was, well, just awsome!!!! i will definately frequent the pink pony....koodos to managemnt, bret c, the chef stephen e, and my server anthony.... :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"This is not the pink pony of 20 years ago. If you had gone to the original Pink Pony you would never go to this restaurant again. It is definitely a tourist trap the menu is one page not really much to choose from. We had the tenderloin steak for dinner which was good the mash potatoes and the vegetables and the corn on the cob taste like the wood that they are made on for 3 people it cost us $160 I would definitely say it was not worth it. With all the fine dining in Scottsdale this is not the place I would be going to again"}
{"text":"YIKES!  Sump'n happ'n.... In the kitchen.  Hockey puck beef and meat loaf.  Pretty decor, nutt'n good coming out the kitchen.  Kiss of death in a competitive market."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and nice outdoor patio. Came here as our first choice restaurant was booked up.  We started off by ordering cocktails,however when finally served, they were watered down.  Two in our party ordered steaks but they were over cooked and all grilled items had a weird smokey flavor that know one liked. Service was exceptionally slow."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and friends 3/11..Look forward to seeing the New Pink Pony after years of frequenting the old place..Wish I could think of a word worse than AWFUL!!
My wife , I and 3 friends were ignored..We were never welcomed, and Manager was rude.. Told us 5 people can't eat at table we were at?? Why? You had no one waiting..
I arrived first got room at bar..Had a wine and Beer..Beer I ordered was $6, bartender charged me $9 !!  That should've been a warning right off the bat  .Friends arrive , we sit at table in bar and the fun began..we stopped 3 different waitresses to bring drinks and menus..Never came back..
After 20 minutes, we left..Insulting for sure...
So long..never again..wish you luck but you might want to make people feel welcome,
serve them promptly...Wishful thinking I guess..I did observe that kitchen was backed up too...Might want to plan more before you open..A mess, avoid..you've been warned, Folks..

{"text":"After my review of the Pink Pony, I received a message from Stephen K. Eldridge, the Executive Chef. In his e-mail, Mr. Eldridge apologized profusely for our terrible experience and extended a personal invitation to me and the other members of my party to return to the restaurant as his personal guests. I wrote back and thanked him and informed him that while I was very appreciative of his offer, I would not be returning to Scottsdale until March 2016. Mr. Eldridge contacted me a second time to let me know that his offer was open ended and that I was welcome at the Pink Pony anytime. Several things struck me about this. One, that the management went out of its way to address my original complaint and secondly, that they not only extended a personal invitation to me and my friends as their guests, they assured me that the invitation was open ended. I was very impressed by both the speed of their apology and the ensuing follow up. Rest assured that I will be giving the Pink Pony a second chance."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  Strongly recommend the pretzel fondue.  
We weren't going to eat here cuz we weren't in the mood for the items on the menu.  The manager at the time saw us checking the menus out by the sidewalk and lure dis in.  Still scheptical, we ordered a chicken, avocado, bacon sandwich and s pretzel that was in the app section.  We were impressed to say the least."}
{"text":"A group of us (party  of 8) went to the Pink Pony on a Friday night. Used their valet parking due to the timer evening we were there.  Well worth the $5 for this service.  Simple and easy.  The decor was very modern and well done.  You can still see some of the old charm from the original decor though... The  home plate and other baseball memorabilia along with Pink Pony references  are place throughout the restaurant.

We order a variety of food which was all fantastic,  I had the Fried Chicken and it was awesome.  Crispy and cooked to perfection....another guest ordered the meatloaf and thought it was awesome... Burgers are huge... Enough for two people to share... And the Prime arab was said to be one of the best meals...

Our waitstaff was fantastic.  Sienna made our evening.. We had had a long day and were a bit sarcastic and playful and Sienna handled it with ease.  She really hustled and took care of us without hesitation.  

Definitely a place to go...we will be back."}
{"text":"What a let-down !!! We recently moved within walking distance to the Pony and could not wait to give it try. Once and DONE. Shrimp in the Cocktail were at least 2 days old, not fresh steamed at all, like \"rubber\". Pizza was \"BLACK\" on the entire bottom, burnt and overdone, cheese was like bubblegum, by no means a high quality mozz. The sausage on the pie was bland and nothing special. What a shame, because they did a great job on the renovation. Don't get drawn in by the eye-candy. With all the great places in town this joint needs to up its game big time !!!"}
{"text":"Bret made our dining experience exceptional, highly recommend, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Well if you find yourself in Scottsdale, you must stop by the Pink Pony for the experience alone. When my sister told me we had to stop by for a visit I was sure she was dragging us to a strip club, but no, just your good old fashion steakhouse.

I dug it because in the hoity toityness that is Scottsdale, this place is old skool (with a k) On your way in don't forget to stop and admire the pink pony that stands outside the doors. Why? Well , I am not sure but its cool.

Stepping inside this place will tranform you back to a time when wood paneling was all the rage, and vinyl was the way to go. The food was decent, big portions and not too bad price-wise. The waitress was in classic diner form. She sounded as if she had been smoking since she was a baby, but was super friendly and fast. 

The best part was the dude who sang on the 'stage'. He does take requests, but be careful, he does not appreciate being filmed."}
{"text":"I grew up in Scottsdale, and used to go to the Pink Pony as a child.  The food at that time was always terrible, but you did not have too much of a choice in eateries.  Now you do.  The food today at the Pink Pony is just okay and but expensive.  They need to work on a stronger menu.  I had a starter of pork belly and beans.  It was mostly heinz bake beans and a small strip of pork belly.  I hope this is a learning curve for the new owners, and all will improve.  If the owners can't improve the menu, than they must lower the prices to keep potential regulars.  Too many new restaurants try to cover the cost of decoration by charging a lot on food.  It does not work in the long run."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable. We sat outside. All 4 of us had a cheeseburger of sorts.
They were cooked perfectly and served by a GREAT server. 
Vince was there with refills on time. He was the perfect host!
We will be back..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in to this place because it had an excellent decor and the menu looked promising.  The service and food was a different story.  We didn't get a server for at least ten min and the we waited quite awhile for our food.  I had the meatloaf which was ok and they were a little stingy on the gravy, my girlfriend got the fried chicken which was a little dry and the smokey flavor was not something that should go with fried chicken.  Wish we had a better experience and hope they get their kitchen situation figured out.  Probably will not be returning to the pink pony."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it by the name, but it's a nice place! Just so everybody knows, it's not a strip club.  Despite the complete lack of shiny poles, the food is good!  I had the Mac and Cheese appetizer plus the beet salad.  It was really good!  The drinks aren't epic, but there's good service and a nice open atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been twice in the past month but won't go back. The food is average and the service below average. Three of us ordered cheese burgers and were brought blue burgers. The waiter never stopped by to ask if our meals were ok. I had to go find the hostess to ask for our waiter. I did get the cheese burger but it was tasteless and we never got ketchup for the fries. Our water was empty and not once refilled. There are too many good restaurants in south Scottsdale to bother going back."}
{"text":"Place is nice and trendy. Casual atmosphere. Nice patio area. But thats the only nice thing. Waiter seemed annoyed all night. We also made reservations to sit on the patio and there were a bunch of drunk guys sitting in front of us on the ledge of the restaurant on the other side. Blocked our entire view of the street. Staff noticed and didn't say anything. Food is good. Steak salad was a Caesar salad with steak on the side. Nothing special.  But mac n cheese was amazing. Although I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"We had some friends in from back East and decided to try the pink pony, best decision we made. The food was outstanding as well as the service we went by the Waiters recommendations Very knowledgeable About the menu. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"What an amazing dinning experience. The food is excellent the service was top notch and how can you beat the location. The Pink Pony right in the heart of old town Scottsdale must be on the list of great places to eat. I would recommend this anyone visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"My family hosted a family reunion dinner (35 people!) last Saturday night here, and everyone loved the food, the decor and service. The entire management team, including Chef Stephen, were very engaged in the planning, even creating a special appetizer for the occasion: fried green tomatoes, which were Dads specialty. Our guests had their choice of entree, and steaks were cooked to order, perfectly.  I will be back to try the pork chop!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, drinks, atmosphere and service!  Price may be a little high sometimes but their happy hour deals are amazing AND I sometimes make exceptions about the price for a place this good.  

I absolutely love the Cuban sandwich served at lunch time, and that's saying a lot from someone who normally doesn't like mustard and never eats pickles.  I am so happy I tried it the way the chef designed it because now I wouldn't have that sandwich any other way.  The fries are wonderfully seasoned and obviously fresh.  Another thing I love about the food is that almost everything is made in house, and that's why their pickles are amazing!

The pretzels and beer cheddar fondue are amazing, the pretzels are soft on the inside and the right amount of crustiness on the outside.  The cheese warm, white, and I love the ever so slight chunks in it. 

The duck breast at dinner time over the parsnip puree is an incredible dish that I never thought I'd try/like.  Oh and you can't forget their fabulous Pony Burger!  I love the pork belly it comes with, as well as the garlic aioli spread on the bun.  

I have no complaints, it's a beautiful restaurant that I unfortunately didn't get to visit when it was the old pink pony but all that matters is how fantastic this one is.  You can also tell they pay attention to detail well, as the servers do everything \"the right way\" in my eyes, are very knowledged, friendly and prompt.  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after shopping in downtown Scottsdale, the newly remodeled Pink Pony is beautiful! The menu was full of good choices, and the service was awesome. I tried the fried bologna sandwich, it was very good!  Great place to stop in for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the \"New\" Pink Pony was Feb 6th for drinks and dinner with another couple. Old Town Scottsdale is far off of the beaten path for our little group, thus we were all newbies to the place. Free parking in the garage 2 blocks East was a bonus.

The bar is a combo of modern and traditional, and the service was top notch. 
The Wall of Wine next to the bar is quite impressive!
Very professional bartenders. We especially enjoyed the unique rounded ends of the bar itself, as it allowed for easy conversation.

Seated at a comfy high backed booth, we all enjoyed choosing between standard fare and the many unusual appetizers and dinners.
Its a great place for grazing, if that's your style. Service was friendly and attentive. 

The Bleau-Burger was fantastic! A bit messy, but worth it.  Something called \"Grilled Tacos\" was way better than it sounded - a flavor-packed treat.  Calamari very good, and piping hot. 

All in all - we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  And will be back for HH this Friday."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. As you walk in, you step across a baseball home plate and there is a story behind it. I ordered their meatloaf, which was a speciality dish. It was good tasting, but my other half cooks a tastier meatloaf. The prices were sorta high for the quality of food, but the service was excellent. I might go back sometime."}
{"text":"I'll never go back.  Sub par cocktails.  I am wondering  if they put inferior vodka into superior vodka bottles.  If a restaurant offers a cocktail menu that includes \" craft cocktails\" then one should expect craft and not crappie.  Anyone can throw spirits together and call it a cocktail.  Bar tender nice but not trained.
Manager/part owner? Very disrespectful to staff; cursing loud enough for me to hear...all in all not a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is a classic.  Good food for a decent price.  Staff is awesome.  You can't go wrong with this place.  The charcoal broiled shimp are amazing.  If you go, ask for Linda for your server.  She rocks."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken wings and they were served with feathers still attached. Pointed it out to the bartender who took the offending wing and feather back to the kitchen. No one was too concerned. Never even received an apology. The chicken cool said, \"well, it is chicken.\"  He's correct. Just didn't expect it to come pre-plucked."}
{"text":"I took my Dad here to experience nostalgic Spring Training and to celebrate his birthday.  Definetly not the vibe we were expecting.  I had a rezzie a week in advance for the patio. Showed up on time but they still gave our table away and sat us 40 minutes later in a dark corner by the bar. Hostess and host were AWFUL and weren't even subtle about it.   Anyways- After all that you would expect the food to be amazing. It it was overpriced and underwhelming. Only reason why I am giving 2 stars is because hubby liked his pork belly burger and our waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"We have made it a point to come to this restaurant when we are in town. This was our first visit since the new mgmt has taken over.the service was adequate, drinks expensive and the food prices priced out of the market. This was the most expensive steak my husband has ever eaten. We and the friends who live here locally, will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went to Pink Pony last night for my birthday dinner, made a reservation for 8pm and told them we were celebrating a birthday. I loved the food at Pink Pony, by far the best fillet I have ever had, it was a juicy thick slab of meat that cut like butter and melted in your mouth. The fillet was perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bartender Ashley. We were sat in her section of the bar in a booth. When she came over I asked about wines and asked to try a few before making my decision since they were out of my usual choice, and she seemed quite annoyed with having to serve a drink as bartenders do. Then halfway through the appetizer she was too busy drying wine glasses that my date had to go up to the bar and order another drink. She forgot part of my meal because she admittedly \"grabbed it to fast before making sure it was done\". So, throughout all of dinner she only came to the table a total of 3 times start to finish. 

Then there was a group in the back of the restaurant singing along to the radio  loudly and out of tune. You would think adults would be better behaved in a nice expensive restaurant. They along with Ashley put a damper on my birthday dinner. 

In my opinion if I am spending over $100 on dinner for two, I better get $100 dollar service. Luckily we had a coupon for 25% off orherwise it wouldn't have been worth the bad service, to say the least the food was Pink Ponys saving grace. I would recommend trying this place but do not sit in Ashley's section. 

Also don't go for a birthday celebration expecting a song or a free dessert. They wouldn't dare charge $50/person and give away a $6 piece of cake."}
{"text":"When Pink Pony re-opened after its complete renovation, I loved it.  My roommate and I routinely had lunch, dinner, and happy hour at the place.  The chef was incredible and the ingredients were top notch.  The price point was very reasonable for the quality, particularly for lunch and happy hour.

I had been traveling for work a lot, so a few months went by without going to the Pink Pony. Unfortunately, I went back last week, and they have a new chef with a new \"take\" on the menu.  It's awful - the new burger, which they call their take on the \"Big Mac,\" is horrible...  I would've preferred to eat at McDonalds.  Somehow the french fries were inedible, which is nearly impossible to do with french fries.

I'm guessing the owner wanted to cut costs so he fired a great chef and replaced him with a mediocre chef buying garbage ingredients at huge margins.  Very depressing -- it was a great spot."}
{"text":"Great homemade fresh food.  Great atmosphere and terrific service.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I normally like the Pink Pony and what they have to offer... But, I have to say that the meatloaf was one of the worst dinners I've had... Overcooked, like leather....not juicy... At... All... Won't ever try that again"}
{"text":"I am mostly a Yelp taker, so this review is penance for all the times I've looked here for what to order and what to avoid at a new restaurant and found helpful answers.
1. The Pony Burger is the best I have ever had. No, you do not have to get it with a fried egg. If you like burgers, order up one, medium, and see what I mean. You will not even need a condiment.
2. We tried the beet salad. It needed more zip. But maybe this is not the place for salads.
3. The pizzas will surprise you. They come out looking crusty and big, but they are not crusty, they are just perfect, and the Debris knocked out even the eaters who don't care for meat.
4. The macaroni and cheese. We scraped the skillet clean.
5. The scallops: Huge and awesome! 
6. Our one steak eater adored the ribeye. (It didn't hurt that the kitchen screwed up his order and he had to wait for a new one, so management comped him.)
7. That grilled cheese slider appetizer is yummy and fun to share.
8. Dessert? Yes -- the caramel apple upside down cake. Worth all calories, very sharable. Note that the last dessert, house made ice cream and shakes, does not exist, darn it, and probably will be removed from the menu.
DO have a cocktail, they are huge and fairly priced, and the wine list is full of interesting choices in a wide range of prices.
The booths for four are comfy, though they should have been pink, but the booths for two seem a little tight. Cozy, some might say. High praise for the acoustics -- this place was buzzing on Friday night yet conversation was easy.
One nostalgia note: I visited here twice this week and was remembered the second time. That is what the old Pink Pony was about, not the tired decor and huge steaks. If management can find and keep great servers (and clearly from the early reviews this will take time), they will be successful at merging the best of the old into the new."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick snack and cocktail after a spring training game and it was the perfect spot for a few small plates. It's a little fancier than what we should have done with our jerseys and baseball hats, but the staff was great and checked back in with us regularly."}
{"text":"You would think a steakhouse would know how to cook a steak to the proper temperature. They were 0 for 2 at our table. Nothing worse than ordering medium rare and getting one bite of medium and the rest medium well.  To make it worse our server was horrible, despite only having one table. Hey dude it's not our fault your boss makes you stay until close when there are no customers."}
{"text":"OMG.... The \"Achiote Chicken Sandwich\" is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in my life! The price for this is great too! Will continue to come back here!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for Spring Training 2016 and wanted to stop at the icon known as Pink Pony. A little disappointed to hear it had closed in 2009, it was brought back in 2011 but went under again. It was brought to its current state in 2014, after an extensive remodel, and is open yet again. The outside looks as though it has not changed much, if any. It's on the listing of historical buildings so it's nice the bones of the exterior will always remain as is. Apparently the open front patio area that blends seamlessly to the dining area is a new addition. 

Having no reference to the initial layout I went right in at face value. It was very nice inside and had a reasonably large dining area, plenty of memorabilia, a really nice bar, cool wine cellar and all in all a clean sleek steakhouse look with a hint of southwest flair and baseball nostalgia. This is no longer the dim and rustic place of years gone by.

We came in for lunch and crossed home plate, no really we crossed home plate. The original home plate from nearby Scottsdale Stadium, spring training home of the SF Giants, is under glass at the entry.  

Seating was prompt, we opted to eat on a hi-top in the area that bridged the dining booths to the outside patio. Nice fresh air, good people watching and 2 spring training games on the big screen televisions. 

We ordered up a couple beers from the fairly impressive list of craft beers and landed on the Pony Pretzel as an appetizer. The green Flash West Coast Double IPA was amazing and the Pony Pretzel was really tasty. The beer cheese dip was so good. They could have tweaked this just a tad to a beer cheese soup and I would have ordered the largest bowl possible. For entrees we went with a Pony Chopped (Mixed Greens, Tomato Jam, Bacon, Smoked Blue Cheese, Pickled Egg, Crispy Garbanzo Beans, Scallions, Cucumber, Croutons, with Blue Cheese Dressing), The Basic Burger (8 ounce patty, choice of cheese, LTO and garlic herb aioli on a brioche bun) and the BLT-A (Applewood Smoked Bacon, Romaine, Tomato, Avocado). Both sandwiches came with fries that were prepared just right, nice and crisp. The Pony Chopped was a perfect blend of unique twists on a standard chopped ingredients that made for a lighter meal with great flavors. It paired really well with the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. The BLT was well very executed. You can't go wrong when you use a quality applewood smoked bacon as the foundation. The garlic herb aioli and the addition of avocado gave it an extra notch above your standard BLT. 

Our service was great and the prices were fair. This is on the list to be repeated next time we come out for spring training. The old Pink Pony may have galloped into the sunset but the newer version Pink Pony has every indication of being a reboot of a tradition for years to come."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first time here and not the last either. The place is hip and cool. I ordered the turkey pot pie was the finest I have ever had . Great service too. Love the menu too."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant just after 3 in the afternoon. We wanted a Guinness on draft and they didn't disappoint - lots of high-quality craft beers are available if you like that sort of thing. Unfortunately that's where the good part ended. We ordered the calamari to go along with the beer and it was the worst - a gritty cornmeal breading pretty much erased any trace of the calamari, which was probably a good thing. Once you got the breading off they tasted like overcooked rubber bands. After we got our food (we were eating at the bar) that was the last we saw of the bartender. She never once came back, even to see if we wanted another drink. Also all the sports memorabilia is gone. Bottom line - good for an inexpensive brew during happy hour, but not much else."}
{"text":"The memorabilia lining the walls is fun and interesting, the food was ok, we lucked in to a kick ass parking space and a table (with out a reservation!).  Service was fine.  Doesn't seem like a prime place for baseball player spotting, but it's a handy place to stop by right after a game at Scottsdale Stadium."}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place since my coworkers always want to go here but after being here 4 times now, I just can't. The service is always prompt, never missing a chance to offer another drink before you're finished. The kitchen has always provided the food efficiently and prepared properly. I recommend any of their pizzas, they always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great classic as usual with the modern update it is great!
Ask for Jeremy he is a great waiter!
Will return. ."}

Such a shame,  
Should have gone out with a bang,

{"text":"Great salad with salmon. My hunt loved the chicken sandwich. The fries are amazing. The best bartender ever works there, ask for Tori."}
{"text":"Beautiful and modern. Service is top notch and pizza was perfection, light & crispy. Burrata was heaven! Gorgeous decor and awesome happy hour deals. I highly recommend the new Pink Pony."}
{"text":"I have not seen the previous establishment but the new ownership did a great job with the new look and decor.  I sat in the comfy large booth and shared the Chopped salad (beautifully packed with colors of grilled chicken, diced cucumbers, sliced red bell peppers, bacon, mixed greens, corn, and pork bits) and the Pink Pony burger (website description: WI cheddar, crispy pork belly, avocado, garlic aioli, slow roasted tomato, bibb lettuce and butter bun - minus the fried egg) with fries. Too full for dessert. Since it was restaurant week they had a panna cotta dessert which is not on their regular menu. Asked if it was possible to sub that for their regular dessert and the waitress said they ran out and keep them for the restaurant week menu. What a bummer. I would have ate that one even when I was super full. 

It would be nice to add that to their dessert menu as a regular."}
{"text":"Wandering Old Town and yelping looking for a place to eat. Our first two choices looked good but too late for food it was music time. Wandered upon the Pink Pony and thought why not. We sat on the patio and they had a one man band playing and he was good. I ordered a drink and was happy with that but needed food. I went for the fried chicken. This was a great choice, the chicken was cooked perfect and full of flavor. Not greasy just crunchy and delicious. I have a happy belly.

 I did not want desert so went for a Pumpkin Pie Martini. Holy Hell this was good. Tasted like pumpkin pie with the graham cracker around the rim. Good choice for sure. This was a good stop. The name does not fit and may scare people off but don't be afraid. Jump on the Pink Pony and enjoy"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the atmosphere. Modern western with Boots on the wall. This Scottdale located eatery is perfect for a foodie. Very well attended and superfriendly/skilled bartenders who knew the menu and their way around their workspace. 

Only hangup, I walk right by the host and she did not even say hello:(. The was polite with a goodbye. They can earn that 5th star with me if I get a nice greeting next time  I come in. Other than that is was a great experiance."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! 

Decided to try it for my birthday dinner. Went on a Thursday night. It was not busy at all but we were there for 3 hours just waiting.... For apps, drinks and dinner. Service was horrible but I think we just got a bad waitress. I ordered a martini and it was served in a lo-ball glass. Then my moms hamburger was almost raw. She had to send it back and it took forever for them to bring it back to her and when they did they didn't had any of the onions or cheese that originally came with it. They did remove it from our bill thankfully. Everyone else's food, Chopped Salad, Hot Mess, Green chili, Bone in pork chop,was ok. Nothing special. 

Positives, restaurant is beautiful! And the pretzels are amazing! Also, the Octopus was really good but not near enough of it for $13. 

I will be crossing this restaurant of my list which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food with horrible service.  The waitress was slow and forgetful.  She spent several minutes hanging out at the bar near the kitchen with some guy who was most likely her boyfriend.  When we finally got the bill she shorted us change, which was fine because it was taken out of her tip.  The slow service can't not be blamed on the amount of customers because it was slow while we were there."}
{"text":"Was overall impressed with the new Pink Pony!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, entries and mixed drinks. We shared all!  We ordered; the Mac and Cheese sliders--such a cute idea, the pretzels with cheese--very good, I think the pretzels are deep fried,  a pizza with pork belly, lamb bacon and egg--very good, and mac and cheese.  Was impressed with the food and decor!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the steak salad. Probably the best I've ever had. Service was a little slow but friendly."}
{"text":"My first experience here was last weekend. The pretzel & beer cheese appetizer was the only good part about my visit. I ordered the Beef Tenderloin with a side of fries & mashed potatoes. For being a $30 steak I was expecting much more. It was over cooked and super salty. The fries tasted like they had been left out for hours & the mashed potatoes, again just okay. From service to food the overall experience was mediocre at best. I've had better steak at Outback. Will I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Had a group of 20+ for a private party in the back room. Food was a 10+, service was outstanding. Had a great time, will definatley be back."}
{"text":"We went to The Pink Pony tonight on the way home before catching a flight back home after a wonderful, sunny vacation in Arizona and we were very surprised by what a great place this was.  The waiters were attentive and the food was excellent.  If we find ourselves in Scottsdale we will put this restaurant on our list to go back to."}
{"text":"The Pink Pony was alright. The decor was nice but something about the vibe that i cant quite put my finger on didn't jive with me. The washroom was almost offensively bright like a school one would be not a nice gastropub one. The hostess was a little annoying when she told us to just wait a minute about 5 times when she wasn't doing anything else that I could figure out that would have taken precedence over waiting customers when it wasn't even busy at all.  The waitress was decent. She wasn't a cow but didn't do anymore than would be required of her which is fine I guess...Some people are over achievers and some do just enough.

Got a pizza to start out with and it was entirely blah. There just wasn't much flavour to it I thought. It was a wood fire type pizza and I generally like that kind of pizza to have some burnt to give it a bit of smokiness but it didn't have that.  I would prefer a frozen pizza from the grocery store to the one I had here.

I know my review has been rather negative overall but the redemption came with my burger which was delicious. I nixed tomato and fried egg on it and it was yummy. Undercooked from my specification and a little greasy near the end but overall very good and I would order it again. I also liked the sautéed spinach I got with it instead of fries even if they were a bit too salty. 

I wouldn't die to go there again but I could make a return visit. The burger was do- overable but skip the pizza!"}
{"text":"OK, nice place.  Food was good but it just lacked something!  Waiter was excellent, very helpful and knowledgeable.  Would I go back?  Maybe"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, my friend and I came here solely for the purpose of spotting some MLB players during Spring Training. Instead we found ourselves in the midst of Phoenix's own Cougar Country. This place was packed! The raucous ladies w. their cigs (you can still smoke in doors in AZ), the Neil Diamond-loving karaoke entertainer, and the sirloin special all proved almost as rewarding as a sighting of Danny Haren. Even though the players have undoubtedly found somewhere cooler to hang out, I still thoroughly enjoyed the old school steakhouse ambiance of Pink Pony."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about, I've eaten here several times since it reopened and the food is better than it was under the old label.

Their steaks are delicious and fairly priced. I've actually never had anything bad here, it's all been delicious. And that pretzel, definitely order it. Did I mention how good the steak is? Bonus- it comes with a side, so you don't have to order and pay for on a la carte like some of he other steakhouses in town. 



The interior provides for a great atmosphere for relaxing with friends. I've always found the service to be really good, and the food far above average.

Definitely give pink pony a try, it's delicious, reasonably priced American food!!!   Oh and hey make their own beer and fireball-like shots; try those!"}
{"text":"Met my friend there tonight bc we both wanted steak. This is supposed to be a steak place. Bad decision. 
It was my first time in and when I arrived, there was no one to greet or seat. I waited a few minutes for someone to notice us. Finally someone comes over and acts like the place is busy when there are tons of open tables. We get seated and the waitress comes over. She seems to be in the biggest hurry EVER. maybe there's somewhere she would rather be, who knows? She was in such a rush to get the order she just hovered. I ordered the prime rib and my friend ordered the tenderloin. We should've have gone to Houstons!! The prices were identical but the food was galaxies apart. 
My prime rib was $28 and I must have cut off half its weight in pure fat. I realize it's going to have a little fat but the cut was awful. I didn't get au jus either. The prime rib at Houstons is also $28 but amazing EVERYTIME. It's a beautiful cut with barely any fat. 
My friend ordered her $30 filet medium well and it came out charred and gray inside with no trace of juice or any wetness. Dry as beef jerky. 
This place better step up its game for the prices they're charging. I will not be returning
And...no salt, pepper or condiments on the table. Is this their thing or is the waitstaff really half assed??"}
{"text":"Great food, very expensive, but worth it for a nice meal. We had two drinks called infusions (shots but good) and grilled cheese sliders which were awesome. We also had a brussel sprout and kale salad, which was absolutely awesome. Total $40 though."}
{"text":"The Pink Pony is a scottsdale institution, I think. So I finally made it into here for dinner one Friday night. It's very dim with dark furniture & paneling - think supper club. 

It wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it was good and certainly very reasonably priced! I was sitting in a booth near the bar & the stage. I thoroughly enjoyed the lounge singer! He was cheesy & funny and he appears to have quite a following. While we were sitting there eating, the bar was filling up & up & up with folks in their 40s-70s, dressed to the NINES. (I want to be like that when I'm old!) They were singing & dancing and generally having a fantastic time. 

When my parents visit I want to take them here. I think they will think it's a \"hoot\"."}
{"text":"Hungry in Scotsdale and came across the Pink Pony. Very old timey and pretty groovy especially for this paticular area of Scotsdale. Overall the food wasn't bad for what you paid for. My boyfriend and I both had the Rib eye special for $18.00 bucks plenty of food and the drinks were cheap. I loved the decor it reminds me of what the Brown Derby would have looked like or at least what I saw on I Love Lucy except in a Baseball theme. They provide entertainment but unfortunatly we were there a bit early so none for us, but i'm guessing it would have made our dining expierence all the better.  I was hoping to see some sort of cheesy lounge act. Maybe next time. The service was friendly and prompt. So if you're into Old timey kitsch and cheap decent eats that's non commercial I would recommend checkin out the Pony the Pink Pony that is."}
{"text":"First time here found this place on tickets at work had a meal deal. I am so glad me and my wife came here for are 5 year wedding anniversary  the food here is so good no complaints from me awesome  service . Very up to date and modern with a smooth  vibe thanks for a great time  will come back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately quite a disappointment, came for restaurant week as the menu looked so delicious but we not only dealt with horrible service but overly cooked and super salty food. My group had to send back two meals. I appreciate the manager trying to rectify the situation but there was definitely insincerity in his offer. I honestly don't think I'll ever come back. I am not a difficult person to please and I'm sad to say this is the first negative review I have ever written."}
{"text":"This is a great cozy spot to relax and grab some good food. Nice clean atmosphere. I had the wood grilled salmon. It was delicious!!! Service was friendly and prompt ;)"}
{"text":"I can't think of anything positive to say about this place. For the quality of food you get here, I think this place is overpriced. My boyfriend got the fillet and said it tasted like it had been refrozen then cooked. I don't know what that tastes is like, but I guess horrible. I had the salmon and it was flavorless and overcooked so was the rice. The bread didn't taste fresh and I wondered if it was just bought at the grocery store and heated up in the micro. Our server was slow and ignored us most of the night even though there were maybe 4 other tables seated in the place. And the singer was well, different... Won't go back here and won't recommend this place to others.  :("}
{"text":"First visit to this upscale restaurant that appears to have been newly renovated.  

The design/decor was great, but the atmosphere was a little odd as the numerous TV's around seemed to fight w/ the upscale expectation/pricing.  

The service was disappointing as we had to ask for silverware, salt & pepper, lemons for our water, etc. I expected more at this price point.  The valet service was evidently not working this nt (which is odd for a Sat), but there seemed to be a garage next door.

The menu was NOT what shows up on Yelp.  The server couldn't remember them having some of these items ever and blamed it on having had 4 chefs over the last several years?!  In any case, the food was mostly good and well-proportioned/prepared.  They didn't serve bread (or at least didn't ask if we wanted some) and the salads were just ok.  The tenderloin was the best part of the meal!

The wine list was ok, but it always bugs me when u can't get a bottle of the wine you ordered (and enjoyed) by the glass.  Seems illogical to me.

With so many choices in Scottsdale, this place had better step it up if they're going to survive.  (I would have given a 2.5, but couldn't figure out how to do so.)"}
{"text":"The Can't Decide appetizer and their red sangria is delicious! Service is a little slow so I wouldn't come here if I was in a hurry.. But it has a nice relaxing vibe:)"}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix area on a few occasions and never got the opportunity to visit the famous Pink Pony in Old Town Scottsdale. Nice ambiance, even better sharing with friends and our lovely bartender, Ashley."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best service in all of Scottsdale.  Robbie, Cesar, and rihea are extremely good at their jobs.  It was seriously the best service I have had at any restaurant in my entire life.  You need to try this restaurant and see how unreal the service is."}
{"text":"The extra star is mainly for the service we had.  We needed to quickly eat and leave for a pub crawl so our waiter gave us quick and friendly service. The only thing was the food wasn't so great but also we weren't at an Italian spot and we got pizza hoping it would be good. It was just lacking flavor.  My friend got a burger which she absolutely loved so I think it was just the item we got that just wasn't one of their best dishes."}
{"text":"Crazy blonde bartender. Doesn't allow any fun in the bar. If you are buying a drink stay away from the blonde bartender with the white shirt. SHE SUCKS."}
{"text":"absofreakinglutely orders of magnitude better than the old place. Scallops fantastic, pork chop tender and juicy, pot pie fantastic. brick oven has actual coals as does the grill. PBnJ beingnets awesome."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the Pink Pony during my old town bar hop because from what I read about it, it seemed to be something I would like.  I usually love the \"old\" places but was not impressed here.  It's like they wanted to lose the old school feeling of the place and tried to change it and make it modern and cool but I feel like they failed.  It has a strange feeling inside and I had no idea what kind of place it really was or what they were going for.  The service was also pretty blah as well as the beer list.  Definitely my least favorite stop in old town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a drink at happy hour with my parents and sister while visiting Scottsdale.  We ended up staying for dinner and additional drinks! The food was amazing. I had the prime rib dinner with Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and a side salad! The potatoes tasted like homemade! The prime rib was cooked perfectly! My dad had the fried chicken which was great! My sister had the wood fired veggies! Only thing that she wish was that it was on a bed of mashed potatoes! 

The server and bartenders were great.  We also even got to talk to the owner of pink pony. He was great and personable. If you are looking for a good restaurant with great food and reasonable prices this is the place for you! I know we will be back when we travel for holiday next year!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Pink Pony on Wednesday with 2 others.  We ordered a drink at the bar and tried to order Sliders, only to be told that we could not order them because all Sliders would be going to a private party in the back room.  Really ?????   (The menu is small to begin with)  The restaurant/bar is nice enough, but I probably won't go back.  There are too many other restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"We stopped in one evening for happy hour to check out the facelift the Pink Poney received.  Wow...what a change to put this place in the 21st century!  The bartenders were great, the drink list was extensive and really reasonable and the pretzels with cheese and mustard were to die for.  We'll definitely be back again for happy hour and maybe even stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!!!  Just had dinner here.  Drove all the way from the West Valley hoping for a nice dinner.  I ordered the Prime Rib dinner.  After waiting almost 45 minutes my food came out very cold.  It was taken back and a few minutes later I received another plate.   There were items missing, but the server took care of that pretty quickly.  Although the food was hot it was tasteless.  My Prime Rib was over cooked, the broccoli was very bland and the baked potatoe also didn't have much flavor.  Salt and pepper wasn't even offered.  Also my Prime Rib was suppose to have included a pepper crust, but that was not the case.  After our meal the server brought us a dessert and said it was on him and left.   He didn't say what is was.  Good thing I'm not allergic to coconut.  Again. Very disappointed and a waste of money!  Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Drinks and appetizers are good. But if you like raw chicken for dinner then your crazy."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a late Valentines dinner. I brought a bottle of wine and at first they said it was a $35 cork fee then changed it to $20 to get us to come in.  I asked for a very private table and they put us in the back where nobody was. Very excited about that. We had visited a week before and excited about the menu and feel of the place. When the server came to the table I went over a few things about what we were looking for and it was clear right then that he was what we like to call a rookie. He left the table 2 times to ask other servers/managers questions and his descriptive words was as if we were at a sports bar. When I asked for the wine to be decanted he got someone else to open the bottle for him.  Then a few guys got sat right across from us when there were only 3 tables dining inside (kinda screwed up the whole private table thing).  We didn't need rockstar service to have a good night but the bartender was very accommodating and the food was awesome.  We always have a good time together but I would suggest having a stronger training program to get 4 and 5 stars."}
{"text":"With a name like, \"The Pink Pony,\" I was expecting a strip club.  I was pretty sure my parents and their friends wouldn't take me to see naked ladies dancing, but I couldn't help but wonder if they were undergoing some sort of dementia.  Once we arrived to the restaurant, I still wasn't convinced.  Cut outs of pink ponies adorned the exterior.  

Thank goodness, my parents hadn't lost their minds:  the Pink Pony was indeed a restaurant.  This was one of those old-style steak and dry martini joints, apparently frequented by the local baseball teams. Melba Toast and plastic packaged bread sticks rested in a basket on our table.  I wondered how long they had been there.

The menu was fairly straight forward:  a few different types of steaks and some seafood items, mostly fried.  I opted for the Pink Pony Special:  top sirloin and my choice of a potato and salad.  

My steak was served as I ordered it, medium rare.  The salad was nondescript and the potato came with a tiny ramekin of sour cream only.   The interesting items on my plate were the deep fried onions and zucchini.  

The food wasn't terribly exciting or tasty, but I liked this place.  It actually had personality in a town that has been taken over by large shopping malls and chain restaurants.  It boldly declares its character without any kind of shame.  I think that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Service we had was great. The wine and beer were good. The food....ehhh....spare ribs were bland. Meatloaf was bland. Green chili was bland. Bland pony.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow has the Pink Pony changed!  

Decor: 5 star

I remember driving by the old pepto bismol pink building with the giant wood horse.  It looked like a place where people came to play bridge.  The new restaurant front is awesome.  It's completely open to the street with modern touches, but it still keeps alive some Old Town Scottsdale charm.  The decor feels like a happy marriage between Ocean Prime in City North and Olive & Ivy at the Waterfront.

There are high booths for privacy when sitting inside.  The lighting feels a little museum like with spotlights, so I felt like I was on display a little bit.  There's a warm color palette with a neat all glass wine rack in the back. 

Service: 4 star

Service was great.  Hostess greeted us with a smile and showed us to the table.  They give you an old milk glass full of water to refill yourself.  The drinks came quickly, and the staff was always available.  The pacing was also correct, and they never bothered us towards the end as we were finishing our wine.

The only dink is that they left the menu's on our table all night which was fine for me.

Drinks: 5 star

They have a lot of beers on tap.  I was pleasantly surprised they were doing a special draft selection with Goose Island (from my home town of Chicago).  They also had some wines I have never seen at an AZ restaurant.  One of my favorite wineries in Sonoma is Gundlach Bunschu, and they had one of their table cuvee's on the list.

The mixed drinks looked interesting, but I stuck with beer and wine.

Food: 2 star

From what I heard, the menu has been \"dumbed down\" due to spring training clientelle.  Everything had the old Pink Pony steak house feel on the menu, except for a few appetizers (brats, grilled cheese sliders).

We ordered scallop crudo, beet salad, spinach and kale ravioli, and debris pizza (duck bacon, pork belly).

The scallop crudo was by far the best of the bunch.  Beet salad was typical.  The ravioli was very dry and the cheese on top overpowered all the flavors.  If I closed my eyes, the pizza would've tasted like a sausage pizza.

Overall:

I would wrap it up with what my fiance said before we left... \"I'd come back here for a few drinks after work.  The scallops were good though\"

Unfortunately, I put more weight on food.  There are plenty of places around town with great service and scenery to grab a drink.  I'll do a second review again when they change their menu after spring training."}
{"text":"Since my last review the chef and menu has changed. They still have that cool modern decor and also play cool music in the background. I didn't partake in alcohol but they still offer interesting sounding cocktails, craft beers and reasonably priced wine.

The Lunch menu offers some indulgent options that are carb heavy but also some healthier options too. To me the biggest change I noticed since my last visit was much more beef options on the dinner menu.

The tasty walleye pike sandwich I had last time was replaced with a house smoked salmon plate. It came out different than I was expecting and was more of a salad than a platter but still tasted good. The salmon seemed fresh and only had a light smoke so it tasted good to me. It was adorned with watercress, tomato jam, mascarpone cheese, roasted onions, fried capers and then topped with chopped up pony pretzels. The pony pretzels have a very buttery taste like Aunti Em's but taste good with the salad. It was nice that every bite had a different taste. This dish was described as also being served with beer mustard with it and I think they left that out.

My husband had the Hot Mess. It was basically two tortillas topped with a meat green chili sauce, some cheeses, pickled onions, quark and two eggs. This might be a signature dish here because it's very recommended and also very popular. My husband asked for the quark on the side because he thought he wouldn't like it. 

As our luck would have it the meal came out with quark so he sent it back. After a short time a new one came out with the quark on the side. The manager apologies to us about the mistake and does stop by after a few bites to ask how things are.

Not a solid 4 stars only because of human errors but I thought the food we tried was good enough for four stars."}
{"text":"Overall, we love the new menu but please, please, please bring back the Pony Burger!! (Onion jam is delish, btw)"}
{"text":"Not at all like the old Pink Pony - mucho updated decor, very modern.  They try hard to be upscale.  Limited traditional American food fare.  We had the steak.  It was cooked to order but quality was less that what I can do on the grill after a purchase from Cost Co.   Sorry, but for Scottsdale, there are better choices.   Waiter was attentive.  Not busy which might be because of the summer."}
{"text":"We have only lived here for two years, so we never experienced the original Pink Pony. We headed down on Saturday night. The place was empty, not a good sign. 
We really wanted to like it, but the service was slow and the food was okay but overpriced. 
Looking at their menu it's hard to describe what kind of restaurant this is. The decor reflects high end but the menu is so all over the place it is difficult to place it in one category. Based on their beer selection they should be more of a bar!
We won't be back unless they make major changes, especially service from the bar."}
{"text":"You want to like this place as it has a long history in Scottsdale.  We ordered the French Dip and a salmon salad.  In both cases the food was over cooked.  The beef on the sandwich was very well done and the salmon was dry.  You expect more from a place that bills itself as the best steaks in Scottsdale.  The decor is great but our food lacked quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to have dinner here and the hostess got us off to a rough start. She must enjoy her \"seating authority\" because she stuck us in a corner and when I asked to switch to one of two open four place tables she said she couldn't because she had groups of 4 coming in. 5 minutes later she sat a couple (not group of 4) to the exact table we wanted.  Our waitress on the other hand was awesome. The steaks were good but I ordered the NY strip and got a filet instead. I didn't make a big deal and it was good. The sides were disappointing tho, double baked potato looked more like a weak potato skin and the featured veggie was a small portion of plain broccoli. Cool name and layout but the food was just ok and the service was so so. Time to get a new hostess at the very least!"}
{"text":"The queen of Phoenix baseball eateries is closed. A sad, sad, sad day. The stories that were told in the place could fill the Hall Of Fame. In the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's it was out the door crowded. It was THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN.

Alas, the economy and competition have done their best to shutter history. So long sweet baby, I'll miss your special charms and Scottsdale is a lesser place for your demise."}
{"text":"Came in off the street with a large party looking for a few drinks and apps at about 3pm.  Apps were so good!  The pretzels was so yummy that we got another order - so much cheese sauce came with the first order that we told them not to bring any more!  That's a first.  Calamari was good and the cheese and meat platter was devoured.  Can't wait to get back to AZ so we can have dinner there!  

Also, the waiters and the manager were terrific - funny and accommodating."}
{"text":"Tito we aren't in Kansas anymore and this IS NOT the original Pink Pony. We made reservations for dinner on Friday night at 6 PM. All of the tables outside or close to the patio were reserved so we were seated in a booth. 

Our server was not extremely knowledgeable about their wine list and suggested cocktails. OK...we can be flexible. They have a nice selection of mules. 

We ordered the charcuterie plate as an appetizer and decided to share their 14 oz bone in pork chop. We also ordered a side bake potato however, if we would have known the pork shop came with mash potatoes we would have ordered a different side. No one needs to eat two servings of a potato. Our server should have informed us that the entree we selected came with potatoes. 

Someone where in the middle of finishing our appetizer a huge party was seated next to us. The huge party sucked all the servers attention to no fault of his own but he lacked the proper back-up to serve us adequately.

Our pork chop arrived medium rare and really wasn't edible but our busy sever didn't even notice or ask why we weren't eating. Thank God for the baked potato. 

I wasn't impressed and really disappointed. I won't be back to the Pink Pony unless things drastically change."}
{"text":"Way cool that is all I can say!!!  We also walked by and thought it was a strip club, but then peeked in and it was a very old school dining room..  Great service and food.. Had the Salmon and it was to die for.."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that the Pink Pony is sporting a new saddle... And by that, it's been remodeled/revamped! 

Embarrassingly enough, I have to admit that I have never been to this establishment in all my time living in Scottsdale. The pink pony is an iconic restaurant and a huge part of Scottsdale history, so it was worth a little visit.

I went after a two-day long staff retreat... And as you can guess, my rubber arm wasn't hard to twist as we were all in need of a drink, or two... maybe three. Who's counting? 

It's the beginning of July here in Phoenix, and no one in their right mind sits outside in the late afternoon this time of year, so we bypassed the cool looking patio/Arizona room-esqe entry and headed indoors. 

Inside we were greeted with a monochrome, sleek and modern decor with lots of booths and highboys to gather around. The place was pretty quiet but picked up after a bit. The demographic: tad on the older side, but whatevs.

Ordered a drink called \"the forbidden fruit\", at the recommendation of the bartender. Now I know what its deemed forbidden... No one should ever taste what I did! Unless you're a fan of taking an ENTIRE pack of sweet tarts, shoving it in your mouth, and chewing them up, do not try this drink. I decided to be boring, but safe and order some sav blanc, and it was the most mind blowing glass of wine I'd had all day ;)

We went to town on apps; pretzels and beer cheese, hummus, sliders (they were to die for), blue Cheese fritters and chili cheese fries. A perfect combination of gut rot and awesomeness!

Not a bad little place to head for a quick bite and some drinks... I'd go back."}
{"text":"When you check Yelp for 'kid friendly' in Scottsdale, you usually don't get a lot of hits. However, Pink Pony turned out to be quite kid friendly, IMO. One caveat: This was at lunch time. Both the hostess and waitress were very friendly with my kids. Pink Pony had a kids menu to color on, and crayons. We sat outside, which was very nice with lots of shade. Wifey and I had a 1st round of mules, which were delicious and refreshing, served in copper mugs. Some bars skimp on the mule cups, since they walk off often, but Pink Pony delivered the real deal copper cups. My wife had an Oaxacan, I had a standard Moscow Mule, both were 5 star. My wife had the Achiote Marinated Chicken Sandwich, which she raved about. She gave it 5 stars. Kids had grilled cheese and what was supposed to be meatloaf, both off the kids menu. I know we were taking a chance with meatloaf, but it seemed like a hard little beef nugget that one kid wasn't thrilled with. But hey, picky kids, right? I had the Blue Burger, which was had a nice sweet flavor from tomato jam and brioche bun. Burger was cooked at perfect medium, with a nice smoky flavor like it was done on my own grill. Burger was a little messier than I expected, but it's a burger! I'd give my Blue Burger a solid 4 stars. I asked for greens/salad as a side, but wound up with fries anyway. Not a huge deal, slight mistake from the waitress (who was a sweetheart). I never send anything back, so I just ate the fries. We had a 2nd round of mules, but they mixed up and gave mine to my wife. I took a call, came back, wifey had already finished mine! That's how good the mules were! Overall Pink Pony is a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretzel sticks with cheese and mustard was amazing!!! Totally ruined all other hot pretzel places! :) 
I had the chicken sandwich, it was good!! Husband had the blue geese burger, also good!! 
Friendly servers and staff. Covered patio in front for lots of fun people watching!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food and service have always been good.  They have one of the best craft beer selections on tap in town."}
{"text":"Last night Sandra and I went to the Pony with my brother. We had a 7:15 reservation and we parked around the corner at complimentary valet.  Nice. 
The place was a little busy but they got us right to the table. Drinks were there in a flash and our waitress made a great recommendation on the Trefethen merlot. 

We ordered a calamari appetizer.  I got the grilled Tuna sandwich. Sandra had the chopped salad and Bruce had the fried chicken. We ended it with coffee and the pecan pie/ice cream for all to share. 

First of all the service was great. Our food came fast. It came hot. Best of all it tasted great and hit the spot. My diet coke was refilled 3 times without asking, the table was cleared of dishes promptly and we did not wait a minute on the bill. THATS  service you hardly get unless someone's paying attention.

Now to the food. It was great! Not over the top and way expensive,  it simply left me full and satisfied...maybe even a little too full (my fault).  The first of our order...calamari appetizer came perfectly crispy and hot. Not soggy or overly greasy. The dipping sauce was pretty tangy and a good compliment.

The tuna sandwich I have to rave about. I ordered it medium, and in fact it came out just as I had asked...it was the perfect texture for a sandwich. The tuna had some pickled cucumber and lettuce along with a dressing all on a buttery seeded bun and it tasted great.  The sandwich stayed together  even after I cut it in half, and throughout the entire manhandling event. I powered through the first half, then started on the accompanying salad side which came lightly perfectly dressed. By the time I gobbled down the rest of my tuna I had little interest in tasting anyone else's selections. I was pleasantly full. 

I saw Sandra's  Chop Salad and Bruce's  Fried Chicken go down equally fast. The dishes were both plated nicely and looked appetizing.  I'll have to go back later to try those...something I look forward to.

After 2 minutes and a gentle suggestion from our waitress, a shared dessert was a must.  The  deep dish pecan pie affair was tasty and came topped with vanilla ice cream. I like lots of pecans on any pecan pie and this finale had a generous number. I wish there had been a little more ice cream but on the other hand, the remaining crust of the pie was still crispy and good to the last bite. With too much ice cream it probably would have been soggy.

I'm giving this night a solid 5 stars because it all came together at the Pony. Really...how often can you find nothing complain about and feel like you had a great meal at a fair price and the people treated you like someone important. No long wait. No bad food or service.  I'm taking everyone I know to the Pony when the occasion arises. I know it will be a 5-star event."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around forever, and has historic past.  I enjoy sitting on end round bar tables at the bar.  The Rib Eye with mashed is delicious!"}
{"text":"My out-of-town relatives love this place and I don't blame them.

You've got decent-sized dinner portions of good steak and sides....you've got an old school atmosphere...and it's in a walkable section of town.  Not badly priced either given that it's a steakhouse.  It's been in Scottsdale for decades and has seen the town change.  I hope it never goes away.

You can hang out there for a long time and nobody's in a hurry to kick you out.  I think one time I spent over two hours at my table just hanging out with my Aunt after dinner and having a few more drinks.  

I've got to give props to the one-man karaoke band.  I think he performs every night.  He can barely carry a tune, but he's part of the atmosphere and gets people dancing sometimes.  It's a happy place."}
{"text":"Living in AZ for close to eight years, I've driven by Pink Pony more times than I can count... but prior to living here in AZ, I lived in Atlanta, and the Pink Pony that resides in Atlanta is a little bit different than this one.  It happens to be a huge strip club!

I'd just thought I'd give a little bit of background on why I never made my way to the AZ Pink Pony until recently... nothing against strip clubs, but I think in my head, any mention of Pink Pony just made me think of strippers and not food or drink.  It's funny though, as now that the AZ Pink Pony has been completely renovated and re-opened under a new owner, I'm just now learning about all of the history to this more than 60-year-old landmark restaurant!

So, while I may not have visited in it's original condition, I can vouge for this latest version and can say that I'm a big fan... I met some girlfriends for drinks and dinner on a recent weeknight and we had a very positive experience.  All of the staff members we encountered during our dinner were friendly and attentive.  Our server, Beth, was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.  

In addition to a few glasses of wine, we tasted the Nosh Board, Farmer's Salad, the Pony Burger, the Kale and Brussels, the pretzel bread, and the Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cake.  Beth was up front with us about her favorite salad being the Farmer's Salad, and it was a good call, but worth noting that if you want to add salmon to it, it will cost you a hefty $14 on top of the $14 for the salad alone.  Also, if you go for the burger, you have to request it with the fried egg... the menu makes it seem like it will come with the egg automatically (and our did not).  The burger was still awesome by the way, even without the egg!  The rest of the menu looks tasty too... from an 18 oz. \"Niman Ranch\" Bone-In Ribeye to the salmon, scallops, grouper, and Turkey Pot Pie and more... there really is something for everyone!  I look forward to exploring more of the menu on a future visit.  

Next time I'll try a different dessert though; the Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cake wasn't all that... it was more like a simple spice cake; nothing special.  Lucky for us though, the night we were there, we also were able to have some of a special grand re-opening sheet cake... 

The redesign of the restaurant has a clean and classy feel to it.  I love that it offers a private room in back and a nice patio out front.  Needless to say, our evening was great from start to finish, so I say giddy up... if you're looking for somewhere new to check-out, you can't go wrong with the (new version of) the Pink Pony!"}
{"text":"The Pink Pony has been remodeled and it looks so much better.  The front is open now with a sitting patio area.  Much more modern look and their drinks are still good!!!"}
{"text":"fancy exterior and interior, clean tables and restroom. it's a rather expensive restaurant but the service was disappointing. i had to scream(not literally, but she barely checked on us) at our server every time I wanted a refill. i only went to celebrate my friend's birthday but i were to eat alone, i would've gone to a different restaurant in that area. i didnt even finish my food. french fries weren't fresh, and my chicken was overcooked. on top of all, i got the impression of them just wanting us to leave (it was about closing time). i don't think i'll eat there again. four people, paid about $120 there are wayyy better restaurents in mill avenue for that price range."}
{"text":"Great Food & AWSOME service! Will is an AWSOME server! We have come for several years & this year to the \"new\" Pink Pony, the ambiance has greatly improved with the same great food that brings us back again & again!  We highly recommend this restaurant & will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and had a blast! The bartender is super amicable and friendly. We were the only two at the bar and felt right at home. 

We ordered the octopus, the yellowtail sandwich and the market fish special main dish. It was delicious 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic the revival in design was outstanding. The changes to the menu however leaves so much to be desired! The shrimp appetizer was very good and was the most flavorful dish. We tried several items and all were bland. They need a do over and update to their menu offering and to add some flavor!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and two other couples went there last night. It was kind of centrally located between all of us.  When we got there, each couple thought the other couples had been to the Pink Pony recently but none of us had in years.

It was NOT good. The menu if very limited. The waitress had little knowledge of how to wait on tables. I new we were in trouble when she served the water glasses with her hand on the top rim.  We asked for straws three times before she brought them and when she did, they weren't the kind that are wrapped so she just dropped them on the table. Yuck. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich which was pretty tasteless. My wife ordered the salmon which was obviously frozen and not heated correctly.  Her veggies were cold. 

Two of us ordered meatloaf. They said it tasted pretty good but the presentation was so bad.  Instead of a big slice of meatloaf it was more like crumbled meat loaf. 

One ordered some kind of steak. Out came a big, burned piece of meat.  She couldn't finish it. 

Even more scary was that it was a Saturday night and the place was empty when we got there at 6pm and half empty when we left a 8pm. 

I highly doubt that I'll ever go back there."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with this experience.  Just coming back to Scottsdale after 6 years, to find it had changed from cool, old school steak house to a newly remodeled typical Scottsdale look.  Lost the history and charm, food was not good.  We ordered the chicken sandwich that was a bit dry and onion rings that were so small they consisted of nothing but onion skin and fried batter.  I think they were going for a fancy look and missed the mark at the expense of flavor. The service was okay, prices are cheap.   Don't  waste your money on the specialty drinks.  We tried the watermelon \"tini\" and a black cherry mojito and both were not worth finishing.  Didn't muddle the mint, so no flavor from that at all.  We won't be going back. :("}
{"text":"The place is very modern food is amazing defiantly order the pretzels and then blue burger great ice tea also order the ice cream sandwich.   Great for large groups and family as well lunch hour   Great views of out side. Dining area"}
{"text":"We used to come to the pink pony every time we visited Scottsdale. This was our favorite restaurant in the downtown area, we loved it!  when we first drove down the main st, we saw this restaurant and thought it looked like a strip club with the pink colors and ponies, it was just weird!  We said, we have to try this place! I looked them up and they got 4-1/2 star rating, so we went.  The place was a ghost town when we got there and thought maybe we should leave. We ended up staying and had such a great dinner!!! They gave us their bread with infused oils and olive tapenade, which was delicious.  Then we had a soup, salad, and filet, with a bottle of wine. This place had great food and we decided every time we visit Scottsdale, we'd dine here!  Fast forward a year or so, the food had changed. They no longer offered the bread with oils and the salad that we loved, was not so good. They said they had a new chef that improved the menu.  The pink pony lost its spark with us that night. Food was still decent. It just wasn't amazing any more :(. Now looking at the remodel pictures and reviews, sad to say we won't be back! We liked the dark old school weird vibe we got from this place. Now, it's more open and casual and bright. What a bummer. We had this place on our top 10 best restaurants. Wish this place had stayed the same."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place...step back in time with amazing decor, baseball memorabilia, and caring service.  This restaurant  was the first one built in Scottsdale (and a different location first), and the floors were handmade wood...before tongue and groove.  The menu includes its specialty of sirloin steak, but I had the liver and onions and my sister enjoyed a mouth-watering hand-pressed burger.  Stiff drinks.  Fruit cocktail on the menu.  

We expected Frank Sinatra to walk in the door at any minute.  The bar singer Steve York (on Friday and Saturday nights) reminds you of a cruise singer...fun...engaging the audience.  This was the place to be during spring training time, and owners Charlie (who died in 2002) and Gwen knew all the players by name and handed out a free steak dinner to the guys who hit homeruns. 

This is a place not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Pink Pony for a work dinner with important clients.  I was embarrassed!!  This place looked great but had terrible service!!  The host was a guy who looked surprised we were even there.  We had reservation by the way.  The server was more interested in the \"up sell\" than taking care of us.  To one point another sever even said that is the best you can do when asking if we wanted Doubles for drinks?  What are we in a airport bar?
Food was okay at best.  One of our steaks was served raw so they took the steak back cut it and cooked it to temp?? They cut the steak?  They should have provided a new steak cooked to the correct temp.  Not a cut up piece of meat.  Anyway, this place is a joke.  So many options in old town go ahead and skip this one.  Maybe the next new owner can get it right.  

DON\"T GO!!"}
{"text":"Who wouldn't want to eat at a place called the Pink Pony?!  Very dated-looking on the inside.  Think 1960's supper club.  Still, they don't disappoint in the meat department.  Great steaks!"}
{"text":"Wow do they know how to cook a steak . Great location for larger parties . Server remember everyone order and food came out perfect . Only think that sucked was they ran out of bison and 32 oz tomahawk . Drinks like Bonnie and Clyde was excellent and served in a copper cup"}
{"text":"The executive chef of the Pink Pony personally gave me a call. I was very impressed with his concerns and vision of his restaurant. His sincerity was genuine. We will definitely give the Pink Pony another chance. We gave the restaurant a second chance...unfortunately same experience. Oh well."}
{"text":"Good green chile pork. Very poor peanut butter profiteroles (so hard to mess up). And amazingly poor service. Long list of errors, but highlights include 1hr for our food, 20 min to get our food. Server was nice but wasn't managing our meal service and didn't check on us.  When we finally asked for our check, she said \"your dessert hasn't come out?\"  She would have known if she had checked in.  Only gets a second star based on the quality of the pork (though even that they screwed up the first time)."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when we came here. Last time I was here, it was dark, outdated, food was , well, meh. The overhaul of the place, and the menu, has paid off. We enjoyed great happy hour specials, great service, and super food. The meat dishes are good, but I really loved the salads. We tried two, one with meat one without. I will say that everyone we were with loved their dishes, from the sliders to the HUMUNGOUS BLUE CHEESE BURGER that even a large man will not be able to finish off. Oh, and we loved the wings, they were smoked, with a Frank's cream sauce that was a bit mild for me. But the chef spiced up some for me and we loved them. No complaints. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great happy hour, great vibe.  I dream of the pretzel and gooey cheese appetizer, paired with the Bonnie & Clyde Mule cocktail.  Love the outside seating too.  One of our fave places in Old Town."}
{"text":"Having grown up in the valley of the sun I have lost count the amount of times I have driven past Pink Pony. For whatever reason, this weekend was the first time I had tried it. I thought since they had remodeled it, it would be the perfect time to try it! So this past weekend when my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to check out, we decided on Pink Pony since he was as curious as I was. 
We made a reservation for 7:30 on open table, when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We were sat in a booth in the bar where it was extremly loud. Why they sat us in there I will never know, there were open tables all over the resturant. Everytime someone got out of the booth behind me my seat would move, not wiggle but legitimately move. We were greeted by our friendly waitress, she was knowledgeable of the menu, and offered several recomendations. 

We ordered the Wood Fired Octopus as an app and a Romaine salad. Both came out at the same time super fast which was kind of annoying. We had ordered a 36 ounce ribeye to share and we were told that it would take 40 minutes to cook, so the spacing of the food was slightly questionable. 

The Octopus was ok but not great -  it was Spanish Octopus, Garbanzo Bean Puree, Chives, Crispy Garbanzo Beans - Olive Oil, Salumi Butter and Banyuls Vinegar. It was slightly chewy and need some sort of acid on it - I squeeze of lemon would wake this dish up quite a bit.  $13.00

The Romaine salad consited of baby romaine, parmesan
 country bread croutons, crispy white anchovy and a citrus & parmesan vinaigrette. Again the salad was ok - the croutons was still pretty chewy, the vinaigrette was lacking a bit. It wasn't bad it just wasnt great. $9.00

As I said above we ordered the 36oz Bone in Ribeye to share which came with 2 beers for $85.00. Since neighter of us drink beer we asked if they would subsitute something else for the beers, which they did without any hesitation, which was nice. We had asked for our steak to be cooked med rare plus, when it came it was so over cooked that it was almost like eating cardboard. We debated for a good 5 minutes on weather we should say something because we had already waited 40 minutes for the steak and we were both pretty hungry. So we ate it err he ate it. 

I finally said something to our waitress - the manager came over and said oh it looks like several of the outer areas of your steak were cooked more well done. And told us that was normal. We informed him that the entire steak well done and not med rare like we had asked for. I get it we were eating it but that doesn't make it ok. He offered us free desert. 

I just don't understand how that steak even left the kitchen. There was ZERO quality control. Between the cook, and the waitress someone should have noticed this steak wasn't even cooked closely to how we had asked. 

I was super disappointed with my meal here and wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone. $150.00 down the drain. 

Bummer"}
{"text":"Swung in here before a Giants game this week. It's only been open a couple days but the drinks and food we had were on point. Good service. Huge beer selection and knowledgeable bartenders. They did a great job (and clearly spent a lot of money) on the remodel. It's not the classic dark steakhouse that it once was. The menu is definitely not like the old Pink Pony...in a good way. A lot of variety on the menu so there's something for everyone. I can only give four stars at this time as we only shared a few appetizers, but when we return for a full meal and if it is consistent with the appetizers we had I'd gladly give it five stars."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the place was closed!  We ate at Bandera's next door!  Bartender at Banders told us the Pink Pony was closed for good...the end of an era...thanks economy!!!  We will miss you Pink Pony!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here in a year or 2 it's a must. Beautiful place and awesome menu. Prime Rib and half price wine on Wednesday is awesome"}
{"text":"Right on scottsdale rd. waited very long even though we were the only customers. The meat for the burger was terrible with chunks of stuff in it. The skirt stake also had a very bad taste in it. Staff was nice and courteous. Would not go here again."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I just don't.

So we go and wanted to sit on the patio and enjoy happy hour.  They don't *do* happy hour on the patio. do not get me started on businesses that don't offer happy hour menus on their patios. Come ON, it's Arizona.    Let me also point out that it was completely empty. EMPTY.  there were 3 couples on the patio and NOBODY inside.   Our waiter \"made an exception\" for us.  Insert my eye roll here.

The HH menu offers $1 wines (eh), and a variety of other drinks such as craft beer, mules, speciality drinks. We stuck with wine.  They also offer a HH food menu.  We ordered the blue cheese fritters and the wings.  I'm sorry to say they were both terrible.  Now, they were served to us literally 2 minutes after we ordered , which to me signals not so freshly made food.

I feel confident saying that because the wings looked mummified.  THey were dry and brittle looking. They really didn't taste any better. The wings have no sauce, coating, nothing. They are simply fried wings served with 2 dips, neither of which 'went' with wings.  The blue cheese fritters were slightly better, but not much.  Overcooked, over breaded and with a slight blue cheese twinge.  They were nothing to write home about. 

There was an obnoxious table that eventually sat down next to us.  These four individuals starting playing loud club music on an iPhone. Loud enough for the entire patio to hear.  It was beyond rude and obnoxious.  When we said something to our waiter, he asked US if we wanted to move.  Um, no, but you *could* tell the rude customers to turn their personal DJ system OFF.

We won't be back again."}
{"text":"I was taken to Pink Pony for a first date.  First impressions from the outside is that it's a small, casual restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  In fact, I've been in the area a few times and never noticed it before.  Once inside, my impression changed immediately.  It is very clean and inviting.  The decor is very simple and modern.  We were seated at a booth for two, but it was not cramped.  My date chose the Pink Pony because of the mule menu; there are *seven* types to choose from.  He had never had one, so we each picked one to try and compare.  First round was the traditional Moscow Mule for him and the Tower of London for me.  They were both refreshing and well mixed.  The second round we tried the Bonnie & Clyde for him and the Oaxacan for myself.  The Oaxacan was my favorite, but I like all things prickly pear (blame the desert rat in me).  My date preferred the traditional mule, which is never a bad choice for your first time.

We each ordered steak, I got the NY Strip Steak (only because it was the cheapest red meat on the grill menu and I didn't want to run the tab up too much) and it was delicious.  It came with a salad, grilled brussel sprouts, and fingerling potatoes.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It didn't *need* the sauce that came with, but it was a bacon demi so I had no choice but to use it.  My date ordered the ribeye that was on special and practically licked his plate clean.

The Pink Pony, like my date, really impressed me and will definitely get a second visit.

The reason for my 4 stars is the bathrooms.  The restroom handles were horseshoes welded together into \"M\" and \"W\",  super cute and fitting with the theme.  But the W was pink.  I get that it's the \"Pink\" Pony, so make both bathroom handles pink.  Not just ladies like the color these days.  I'm not an ultra-feminist, but that rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere. Just a short walk to other bars in the area. My meatloaf was excellent!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and a fan. Went for dinner the first time and food was great. Service was slow but it was like week 3 so I can't be negative about that. 

Went for hh last week and really likes it. Great drinks, wine and food specials till 7pm. No complaints at all. Might be our new  go to hh place."}
{"text":"Disappointing. With all the restaurants in such a close vicinity to each other, you would think each restaurant would up their game to provide exceptional customer service; this restaurant doesn't even provide the basics. No Salt and Pepper shakers on the table and not even offered. My food took forever to arrive and when it did the vegetables were cold. I ended up eating my food by myself because the other person's food was cold and had to take it back to heat, upon its return, the prime rib was overcooked, missing items, etc. The server mumbled to us that it should be taken off the check but he never did. He came back and slapped a dessert in front of us, no explanation, no mention of what the dessert was, just left it and walked away. Nice. This place is so inconsistent that it doesn't warrant another visit. Too many other places to try instead."}
{"text":"If you haven't been, you need to go ... I've been many, many times, and the service is always good, the food is always consistently good, and the drinks are not expensive and are potent - I like that!  Just had lunch there - Friday about 12:30 - had the chicken fried steak special - huge plate of deliciousness - they have 3 lunch specials everyday - Monday thru Friday.  I love the steaks at dinner time.  I always get the same thing - the Pink Pony Special - a sirloin steak a baked potato a salad and a fried onion ring and a fried zuccini ring with fresh homemade biscuits - $16  ... give it a go ... ask for Linda - she's the greatest!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  There were maybe 10 dinners  in this entire restaurant and we had terrible service.  Vincent, our waiter was absent for most of the service.  We had to hunt someone down to get our waters refilled and cocktails were just OK.  We ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees.  Appetizers were very good, entrees were average at best.  My Med-rare steak was overcooked, the pork chop had a funny taste and fish was over seasoned.  ' We would have sent them back but, VINCENT WAS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We were charged a 20% gratuity, because we had six in our party. (which may explain our terrible service). Menu price point was very good but, we would not return or recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The pork chop WITH the Bacon Jus and mashed potatoes was very good! The complementary salad was blah and probably had pre made dressing. The Malbec was decent and only $7. My servers were excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Top notch food (apparently they have a renowned chef), decent service, prices are as fancy restaurants go, great ambiance, I love it.  You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  Everyone at our table left satisfied.  I personally had a bit of the beet salad and for my main course, I had the Pony Salad with smoked salmon.  The beets were deliciously sweet but a little on the smaller side so it'd be perfect before your main course.  The Pony Salad was a little more sizeable, less sweet as it was topped with blue cheese and bacon bits, and the smoked salmon was a fantastic touch.  Though I would love to try it with their sirloin next time.  Taking off a star because our waiter disappeared for a good long while after dropping off the dessert menu.  Granted we were a bigger group, so maybe he didn't want to disturb us, but really we just wanted to get our desserts.

The ambiance was great, it was a quiet night and the music was pleasant - not too loud but audible.  The layout was gorgeous and the home plate at the entrance was definitely very unique.  I wouldn't say it'd be date night-worthy (unless she's into sports), but great for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"The bar area is nice but the food here was AWFUL! Unless you're just stopping in for a drink, KEEP GOING. There are so many places close by to get a delicious meal...this just definitely was NOT one of them."}
{"text":"This is what I call an upscale burger joint...really plush booths, nice bar area, but you'll find the typical pub style items on the menu, but expect to pay $12-15 for your burger.  With that said, they were good burgers.  I actually had a BLT + A (the +A was the avocado).  Nicely toasted and stuffed with good filling - quite nice.  I ordered the buttermilk style onion rings.  These sounded better than they tasted.  They are a little greasy - thin sliced onions - not my favorite.  Friend had the standard burger with goat cheese and fries.  Looked really good and you get to pick how you want the meat, so it's \"have it your way\" prepared.  A cute group of young people wandered in dressed in holiday outfits for a drink.  That wasn't part of the show there, but it was a lot of great costumes to enjoy.  It took me awhile to figure out if I was supposed to use Pink or Pony when I went to the restroom, but I made the right choice.  Decent food, good service, worth a try."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nice trendy place. Good kids menu as well. Most or all food made in house. Pretzels were awesome. Kid friendly place in Old Towne Scottsdale. I'll be back here again when I'm in town. Everyone who works there are friendly a plus."}
{"text":"Disappointing!!  We went there for dinner on Saturday night. Had reservations at 6pm, and we were seated right away! Our server was great and friendly. 

However the food was extremely bland. We ordered the shrimp appetizer, which was okay, it came with large shrimp. We ordered the meatloaf which was...meh...honestly nothing special.
And the Green Chili pork. Now that was SO bland. It lacked so much flavor and had no spice at all. The most flavorful part of that dish were the burnt edges of the tortillas, so that doesn't say very much.
would NOT recommend ordering that at all. 

The atmosphere was cool but after a $60 bill plus our tip, we left with no desiree to return. They really need to work on adding some flavor and uniqueness to the dishes."}
{"text":"The hot mess is delicious, supposedly the pork chop is to die for per our server (Justin). Speaking of which Justin was amazing, actually the entire wait staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My GF had the pretzel fondue and it was perfect. Buttery soft bread mixed with homemade beer cheese, delicious! My taste buds were high fivieing each other throughout the entire meal."}
{"text":"Walked in after today's Giants game. We stood and watched the manager and the head waiter argue over staff rotation. We watched the hostess take several calls. We watched several other staff come to the front kiosk, try to talk to any of those 3, stare at us, and leave frustrated. This SERIOUSLY went on for 5 minutes. No hello, no please wait. We observed no less than 6 open tables. When the hostess finally acknowledged us, she stated there was a 45 minute wait. Sorry you can't staff appropriately Pink Pony, learn how to run a restaurant. I went a few doors down and am enjoying drinks and dinner at Banderas."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Great service a la Jeremy. Best server ever. 
Spareribs were deeeeelish. My kids ordered the best, most interesting chicken stripswhich were offered on the kids menu. A couple of us had pizza and thought it was decent. 
Hostess staff was inviting and warm. Very responsive, attentive staff. I'm impressed. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't paying attention and saw the images online of the old restaurant, kitschy design and all. I thought that's what we'd be going to but nope. My fault, but i wasn't expecting a modern restaurant...

...which was fine, but the food was just average, combined with below-average service (3 servers for 3 tables and they couldn't get it quite right).

I left feeling like a dopey tourist who made a dopey choice only tourists make.Again, my mistake, but maybe you can avoid the same fate?"}
{"text":"No. Just. No. Valentine's Day. Incredibly slow and amateurish service. Raw pork chop at the bone. Steaks brought out cold. Brussels sprout side dish was 2 Brussels sprouts and the rest carrots. Nope. Total whiff."}
{"text":"I work near the \"pony\" and will go here for a cheap Prime Rib lunch once and a while. It's not bad. My complaint about this place is that nothing is fresh. I had dinner there last night and from the cellophane wrapped crackers on the table to the obviously bagged lettuce to the previously frozen mixed vegetables, nothing was fresh. The Pink Pony draws an obviously older crowd, I am in my 30's and was one of the youngest people there. This place has more of a standing as a Scottsdale landmark than a good steakhouse. The Karaoke singer guys is entertaining though."}
{"text":"My husband and I were strolling around Old Town Scottsdale the other day trying to pick a happy hour. The Pink Pony caught our attention because of the gorgeous tables they had set up in their open patio. After checking out a couple other spots we decided to give the Pink Pony a try. Upon walking in we were really excited about the decor. Nice modern clean feel. Really nice. We sat at one of the high tops near the bar. Happy Hour here is daily 3-6. It includes $2 off starters and some random drink specials. $6 wines. ect... The Happy Hour wines were actually really nice. I was happy with the choices. I ordered the Garnacha and my husband got the Pinot Noir. Both were good. And generous pours. They have a \"Bar snacks\" menu that you can order from anytime. I got the beef sliders and the prime rib sliders. Beef sliders were average. The prime rib sliders were very good. $6 for each one. My husband got the wings that were on the starters menu. $8 for happy hour. Fantastic flavor. We generally like them crispy and the server said next time just ask and they can make them crispier. Great sauces served with them.  Service was pretty slow considering it was not busy. But otherwise I would go back. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Took the family there for Easter lunch and was really looking forward to visiting the Pink Pony again.  We had been there years ago (before the closure and reopening) and had some nice memories of the place.  Old Town Scottsdale was packed (Easter and spring training ) and we walked past a couple of packed restaurants on our way to the Pink Pony.  I was a  little surprised when we arrived at the restaurant and found that it was almost empty.  

There were only two other tables with guests so we were seated promptly.  The restaurant is gorgeous, and had several pieces of art to remind you of their close association with spring training baseball over the years.  Our server arrived quickly and got us settled in with drinks and an appetizer.  The Pink Pony pretzels came to the table quickly and were tasty.  We placed our lunch order and hoped that the lunch entrees would be just as good.

Unfortunately the lunch entrees were a disappointment.  The bacon on my mom's BLT was burnt (not just crispy, but burnt), the chicken in my son and wife's chicken sandwich was very dry and the Wood Oven Vegetable Medley I ordered arrived with a small portion of 2 slices of carrot, 3 small mushrooms, 3 small squares of chili pepper, and 4 small fingerling potatoes.  The menu described these as \"herb marinated\" but there was no taste of any seasoning whatsoever.  It was served with cole slaw and baked beans, but the steak sauce listed on the menu was missing.  None of us finished our lunch.

Overall it is a lovely space and the service was very god, but the food was a big disappointment.  As the restaurant was virtually empty there is no excuse for the food.  I'd guess the poor food has something to do with the lack of customers.

Not recommended and we will not return."}
{"text":"First time here, and with the exception of a great waiter, the food was not so great.  Strip steak was tough.  Fried chicken was dry and not as crispy as it shouldve been.  Veggies were overcooked.  As for ambience, I was expecting a classic venue from the 40s, but instead they modernized the room with an open kitchen.  Nothing special.  That pretty much says it all."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town so we decided to eat here since the place looks really nice with outside seating.   We ordered the pretzel to snack on and it was delicious. The cheese sauce was bland, probably because of the beer mixture.  We ordered the fried chicken and the meatloaf entrees.  The chicken was bland and they smoked the chicken as well as frying it and the smoke flavor takes away from it being fried.  

The meatloaf came out in pieces not one big piece which I'm accustomed to, it was burnt and had very little flavor.  At least the drinks and the service was good."}
{"text":"This is a Scottsdale treasure of history. Don't let the new face lift fool you. It's a classic place with plenty of old baseball stories. The steak was incredible!"}
{"text":"What a rip-off this place is. I'm not sure what is more disgusting, the food or the prices. They charged me $18 for coleslaw on bread with fries, and they couldn't even do it with smiles on their faces. The service is about as terrible as the food, and they don't take their customers very serious; my server was wearing gym clothes to work."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had the chicken sandwich with the \"onion rings\" and it was amazing. A treat for certain!  The staff is very courteous. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The oldest restaurant in Scottsdale is something worth checking out. The service is amazing. The food isn't maestros so don't walk in expecting something it is not. One night I was there with some buddies. It was pretty dead and it was us and some elderly \"cowboys\" at the bar. I guess they had live music that night. The gentleman who was going to sing came up and wanted to check with us if it would be alright if he preformed, he explained his songs could be a little vulgar. Obviously we didn't care, how bad could they be? WOW! I have never heard anything so vulgar in my life, and they were country & western songs. It was amazing! Now don't be scared off like this is a regular occurrence. I am sure they aren't trying to offend their clientele but if you don't mind try and check it out."}
{"text":"Great Day! Bartender was funny, and nice to us, and also the food was just what the doctor ordered! Everything is made from scratch, and their beer selection is amazing! I have to say the ambiance is just as spectacular as the service! Great decor, and good vibe! I will definitely make this a regular place!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK IN SCOTTSDALE.  Hands down.  I don't think a word was said during dinner."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a conference and was apprehensive of their restaurant choices.  My colleagues and I stumbled upon the Pink Pony and I was an instant fan!  They have great atmosphere, decent beer menu, and their happy hour pricing on those delicious little pizzas was totally on point.  Unfortunately, it's unlikely I'll have the opportunity to revisit the Pink Pony but I am super happy I discovered it while I was there.  It's a winner!"}
{"text":"Delicious redone oldie in old town Scottsdale, I had the farmers salad and shrimp cocktail. Both were fresh and delicious.. Ribs were good but not the fall off the bone style, more chewy and Kansas City style BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I knew of this place being a famous steak house in Old Town, but never had the chance to dine here. They recently renovated the space which added to the appeal of coming here for dinner. I had a great time here and really enjoyed the food. The service was great, the server was attentive but not too attentive to where you can't get a word in with your company. We both had steaks which were both great and potatoes as well. 

The vibe in the restaurant is cool too. Not old timey like I thought it might be but since they renovated it I'm sure that was squashed. 

I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  We were so happy that they have re-opened.  The walleye fish sandwich was great, the pony burger was huge, and the Sicilian pizza was very tasty.  What put this place over the edge was our server Vincent he was very attentive, knew about the items on the menu, and had great stories about spring training, just a really great young man."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Cocktails! This joint has an entire section of their menu for Moscow Mule variations. 

That's it. End of review.

Nooo. I kid. 
But if you're a fan of Moscow mules take a Lyft here. Partnered with a drinking friend during Happy Hour we were able to sample four of the six available. All include ginger beer. $5 during HH!

Yes, FIVE dollars.
[Be still my heart.]

Happy Hour is sweet. Mon-Sat 3 to 7pm. If you come on Sunday a bottle of wine and pizza (or prime rib) is only $20. Monday 1/2 priced wine. Tuesdays offer $4 craft beers. 

My partner in crime narrowed our eating options to street tacos ($3/piece) and a $7 pizza. (What can I say? I'm a cheap date.) The tacos we had were amazing. I'd eat those again in a heartbeat. The pizza of the day was delightful.

This is a stunning restaurant. Outside seating for when the The Oven temperatures are not in effect. The bar has great seating. (You can comfortably enjoy a meal there.) Booths abound. Pink Pony has *tons* of baseball memorabilia. On the sidewalk is the original home base plate from the Scottsdale Stadium!

Being greeted like family at the door by the owner set the mood. I *adored* my visit to Pink Pony."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, especially after hearing that they have an entire menu of mules... I love mules! I went here for happy hour with the husband and love the new decor... very modern with a hint of cowboy. Anyway, I had a coconut/lime/rum mule and we split the pepperoni pizza. The mule was delicious, though definitely very light on the ginger, I liked the tropical flavors. The pizza was fairly mediocre, the dough tasted like frozen... bland and soggy... the pepperoni was good. I would possibly come here again for mules, but I would probably pass on the food."}
{"text":"Management contacted me after my review and requested details to improve service.
Glad to see they care!"}
{"text":"Well this was a big disappointment.  We went there after a recent spring training game, based on the reputation of this place as a hangout for Giants and Giants' fans after the games.  Apparently that reputation died when they remodeled a few years ago.  Other than a couple caricature drawings of ballplayers from days past, there was nothing at all that made this place a hangout for baseball fans.
We were hungry so we stayed and ate.  I had one of their wood-fired pizzas.  Suffice it to say I've had better.  One of our party had their chili.  It had a mole sauce which was a nice variation but it definatately needed seasoning other than just spicy.  Basically they ought to re-name the place McYuppie's Generic Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Second time since I've been here with the remodel. I think they would have been better off keeping the old school vibe to this place and updating the bar and certain sections. Food has not been as good or consistent but the drinks are still good and a friendly attentive staff"}
{"text":"I went there tonight  (Friday) at 8 pm and there wasn't anyone in there, which I don't care at all but I believe it's because the menu is very small it needs at least 10 more items. Some more entrees for health conscious people, like some chicken breast, not fried  chicken (although I love fried chicken! ) I Really enjoyed the atmosphere it was so clean and beautiful. Pink pony had so many beers on tap and a great wine selection. Our bartender Maddie was probably the best bartender I've had in awhile she knew her surroundings and was very quick to serve us. Also when we left other employees graciously sent us off with a warming \"have a great night\". Btw check out the bathroom signs.... I love it! In summary I think the atmosphere and staff were excellent, but the limited could detract from their potential."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say....it was surreal. I used to work here back in the day and when it went downhill and she sold it, I just never went back. It was fine, food was pretty decent, the service was great but it seemed so......sterile. so robotic and weird. We found some things we wanted to try on their website but when we got there, we were told they were no longer available. Change that shit.  So...we tried a different appetizer and it was fine. We got some drinks and asked for straws and the server just dropped them unwrapped on the table. Strange. Like, wrap them in a napkin and drop them. Ew. They were so dead and I thought,  thank god I no longer count on this for my income.  I wouldn't come back. No real need to. Its a weird vibe and an uncomfortable vibe."}
{"text":"We had family in town for the holidays and we wanted to take them somewhere special. The reviews came in positive, so we decided to try the notorious pink pony.we thought the food was below average, not worth the money we paid. The rib eye steak was good not great, the sides were blah. To sum up our experience !! I will never ever eat there again, I won't even recommend to my worst enemy. 2 thumbs down !!!!"}
{"text":"A lively spot with great steaks. We kept waiting for the drag divas to come, but they never did. Sadness. What a deceiving name for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went early dinner and enjoyed some great. Food in a nice atmosphere with excellent and attentive service. 
We started with am excellent choice of the nosh plate.  Great choice of cheeses and meats. Thoroughly enjoyed it 
For dinner we had the pork chops and the Turkey pot pie. The two large pork chops were perfect and the pot pie was the best ever. Home made puff pastry and perfectly cooked on the inside the vegetables were slightly firm but not over cooked.  Fantastic. Great service!"}
