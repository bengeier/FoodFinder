{"text":"I guess you get what you pay for. Lunch for two was less than $15 but the chili cheese dogs were tiny and hardly had any chili, and the 3 way potato also had hardly any chili. Severely disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got such high reviews. I walked in expecting Ben's Chili Bowl, but this place turned out to be the worst. Seven-Eleven chili tastes so much better than here. Wendy's chili tastes better. Maybe I like certain style of chili. 8 Coneys (chili dogs) and a cup of vegetarian chili with baked potato cost us $26. I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in Florida and my family from Cincinnati would come visit us. My Aunt Audrey (rest in peace ) would make this stuff from scratch. The only difference between hers and Skyline is that hers was made with LOVE.                                                                  Now I live near Pittsburgh and this stuff is nowhere to be found. When I go visit my fam in Cinci, Skyline for chili and Gold Star for a coney is a must visit.                                 Last Christmas my sister and I made a visit to the B.A. Sweetie candy store and found out Skyline was right around the corner. We had our own Christmas miracle.My profile picture is from our visit in December. I even bought a Christmas bulb and a T-shirt.              In fact on this day when my sister and I left we got a to go for her son and our brother who we delivered it to him at work after our hour and a half trip home. He was stoked for his early Christmas gift. One of the best gifts you can give a person is nostalgic food. I have 4 older brothers and 1 younger sister and we all love it. Cincinnati style chili is true soul food for us.                  However, I do agree that Cinci style chilli is a required taste (my wife does not like it and it breaks my heart). I guess you can't win them all. Today the same brother that received the early Christmas gift and I are in Cleveland for our daughters' dance competition and you better believe we are going to drive 30 minutes out of our way to hit up Skyline!     I would give it 10 stars if I could. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Cincinnati where cheese coneys were the pride and joy of the town. Skyline vs Gold Star Chili. Here in Cleveland, no one seems to care. None of my friends have any idea what I'm talking about when I rave about this place. Regardless, I was thrilled when my wife and I moved to Parma, to find that there was a Skyline right down the street.  If you're looking for an unbiased review, read on, because I will rave about Skyline until the day I die. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Made the misstep of putting my fork down for a sip of water and boom - hit a brickwall and now I can't finish the 5-way medium and coney dog.    I look up and all the local regulars have their heads down and don't look up till their plates are clean!"}
{"text":"We took our granddaughter there last night.  She got a hot dog which was OK.  I had  3 way chili, my husband had 5 way chili.  Both of ours were inedible.  The spaghetti was mushy, the sauce had a funky taste, the whole dish was barely warm and the cheese just sat there.  The waitress never came back to our table because we were going to order each of us a hot dog.  There was one gentleman at a table near us and that was it.  The servers stood behind the cash register talking and we couldn't get anyone's attention.  The waitress flew by and put our bill down and left.  Never once asked how things were--she could obviously tell because our plates were barely touched.  I decided I would tell the cashier when he asked how the meal was exactly how I felt.  He could barely tear himself away from his conversation with the servers and didn't even ask.  Shame on me for not telling him how nasty everything was.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"You Cincinnatians know good Skyline in the greater Cleveland/Akron area is hard to find.  But if you live in Northeast Ohio and you're a fan of the famous/infamous Cincy-style chili (\"chili\" to some), the restaurant in Stow comes close enough.  I ate here with my best friend on a Tuesday night.  We came in about an hour before close (customer faux pas, I know, sorry!!!).  By that time, it was self-seating.  We were the only ones there.  They were starting to clean up, and one of the waitresses was vacuuming, but she thankfully stopped after we sat down at one of the cleaner booths.  The service was equivalent to any other Skyline you'd get in Cincy, and about the same amount of wait time even though we were the only patrons.  Bowl of oyster crackers to start, drinks came quickly, and so did my much-anticipated four-way and cheese coney all the way (fact: if you want to order a coney at Skyline with everything on it, you must learn to order it \"all the way.\"  It's a tradition).  I'm giving the Stow branch four stars because although it didn't rival a Colerain experience (is that even possible?), the quality of the chili was LEVELS above that of the Parma Skyline.*  LEVELS.  It was almost home away from home.     *I mean DO NOT go to the Parma Skyline."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and competent.   It's also a clean and well maintained place (though it's not sit-down like the Cincinnati Skylines).  It's good for a fix, but the chili quality seems uneven compared to other Skylines.  Sometimes I'll go there and it will be very flavorful and other times it seems bland.  Sits in the pot too long?  Previous day's batch?  I don't know, but I've also thought that it might be a sourcing issue since they're so far away from other Skylines."}
{"text":"I have never been to Skyline before today. I have been seeing their ads while watching my hockey games and the food looked so good. We went for the first time today and I was very disappointed. The chili was horrible. It was so thin and watered down you could hardly taste it. It cost us 40 dollars for 4 people and you don't get much for that. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Huh? Haven't got the slightest idea why people like this popular eatery.   Chili wasn't what I expected. A little more liquid than I expected and not much in terms of taste. Everything on the menu is basically chili covered or filled. Whether it be a burrito filled with chili or spaghetti topped with chili. If you like the chili then the menu must sound awesome. However personally I didn't like the chili so Skyline Chili was a HUGE disappointment.  Terrible service the day I went. Ordered a gallon of sweet tea for my table to enjoy during our meal. Basically we received the tea at the end of the meal and it came in a gallon jug. O and the taste was just as bad as the chili."}
{"text":"\"Hi there, welcome to Skyline\"  that's what you hear when you walk in the door... and they even look up and make eye contact as they say it, it's almost as if they actually mean it.  I am a big fan of being acknowledged when I walk into a restaurant or store, so this is right up my alley.    Cincinnati chili is different from the chunky chili you may be expecting if you have never been here, but give it a shot- it's delicious!  After reading some of the reviews, I can see that some ppl don't like the \"cafeteria style\" atmosphere of the restaurant, but the friendly staff really makes up for it.  There is always someone around to see if you need a drink refill, and to make sure everything is good.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots- it's yummy, inexpensive, and clean!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Skyline and Donna and her team made it a very enjoyable first time! They took the time to recommend different items and went above and beyond make sure I had a great experience. It's rare that you get that kind of service at a \"fast food ish\" restaurant so I was pleasantly surprised! PS the vegetarian chili was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have two thoughts about Skyline Chili:  1: I am so full right now I still can't move right, and it's 14 hours later.  2: It's actually pretty good food. The chili has a really pleasant combination of spices that defies its fast food image. Its worth a try."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best hot dogs, crackers, noodles, and CHILI make this my favorite restaurant. The chili tastes very good and unique, the hotdogs are small and tasty, the noodles are soft and the crackers are crunchy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Work trip to Ohio, and I had to try skyline chili.  Not the best service ever, we waited 5 minutes before walking to the counter, then We were noticed.    I had ordered the 3-way , all i got was a plate of spaghetti, mid chili, and a mountain of cheese  :(......It tasted really good, cause I had not eaten anything all day.  Once I finished half of the plate, I realized it's nothing special, or good, a lot of cinnamon, and chili powder, and noodles.  The combination the worst gas in the world, melts paint off walls.   They say the Cincinnati chili is different, NO; NO it's not, reminds me of Texas chili, with out the beans, just more meat.   If you want real chili go to New Mexico."}
{"text":"We have a similar place by us called Dixon's Chili so I was super excited to try this place!  I tried the 5-way (chili with beans, onions and cheese over spaghetti) and I was beyond impressed.  The chili has cinnamon in it so it has a different flavor to it which I personally loved!!  There was a ton of cheese on top so that also adds to the fantastic taste of the dish.  My kids had the pups and they had good flavor to them as well.    I would definitely be back if we lived closer."}
{"text":"Hick food that is of minimal nutritional value. It's probably worse than McDonald's. There is nothing tasty or nutritious about it. The coneys are gross; the sausage is reminiscent of canned Vienna sausage, something that should never be eaten. Moreover, they pile on the cheese...GROSS!  Their 3-way chili spaghetti is equally disgusting. It's nothing more than empty calories, and it does not feel very good going down. I feel bad for anyone who subjects their digestive system to this \"food.\"   Your body is a temple; treat it as such and stay away from this."}
{"text":"I have been taking friends to Skyline for nearly 15 years now and very nearly without fail they have all been hooked.  Rest assured that those sparse few that didn't enjoy it are not associated with me anymore.  I don't need those kind of people in my life.   There are plenty of people who have covered the chili recipe on here at great length so I'll skip that all together.  Two things that don't get enough attention are their absolutely addictive hot sauce that has just enough kick to let you know it's there but still adds flavor.  Also, their sweet tea is not to be missed."}
{"text":"I am not sure why anyone would go to Skyline and be upset about \"minimum nutritional value\".  Did you look into the food you are about to eat AT ALL?  It's chili, noodles, and a pile of cheese for pete's sake.  I don't think anyone (maybe except for our clueless friend Wil W.) is going to Skyline for a healthy meal.   I feel sorry for people like Wil W., who don't look into the food they are about to eat, and blindly eat something that they obviously have no business consuming,  then have the audacity to judge others who enjoy it.   Bottom line: health nuts, this place isn't for you.     I grew up in Cincinnati, and this Cleveland area locale brought me home.  Polite service, excellent food, and quick.   If you enjoy chili, with either noodles, or a hot dog, topped with cheese, check this place out.  It's different, but I find it delicious.  If you are concerned about possibly putting unhealthy food in your \"temple\", you may not want to try it.    And if you do, don't come on here and whine about how horrible it is for you, because anyone with half a brain can put that together by simply looking at the menu."}
{"text":"These guys were the best. Had to try something local while in town and this place was it. They were all so great. They treated us awesome, told us all about the specialty chili and how to order...food was so good! They even gave us gift bags on our way out since we were all from out of state. The waitress was so nice and helpful. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the big deal about this place. The Chili was soupy and the best part was the hot sauce.  Not what I would call a great example of chili."}
{"text":"one my favorite places to grab lunch on Saturday. food is excellent. the service is very welcoming. extremely kid friendly.   my favorite dish is the chili bean burrito. I also enjoy the 3 way, and you always got to get at least one cheese coney."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time tonite. It was a pleasant place....very sweet and informative waitress. She explained everything about the chili to us.  Brought us samples of the chili.  I'm sure the ppl that like this type of chili find it phenomenal. ...however it was very over spiced with cinnamon....which I understand is there way of doing it. It just didn't seem balanced to me in the flavors. It would be a good base to layer some more flavors to it.... It was very quick service....but is should have been. Everything is very hold able and fast in its own rite. .. Based on the service and quickness...I would come back---IF I liked the chili. But it just wasn't my daughters and I cup of tea.  Wish they had some Michigan coney places around..lol  Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I am from Cincinnati.  love skyline chili. I have visited the Skyline in Stow several times.  On 2 different occasions  they have been short on supplies that have  affected  my order. Out of onions Out of French Fries.  I believe the staff take short cuts. Both times was 1 hr before closing."}
{"text":"As someone who has never been to Skyline in the past, I have to say that I am very satisfied with the service I received, and the overall quality of the food.  I went for an early dinner it's my girlfriend (of whom introduced me to Skyline Chili) and the restaurant isn't an overly big place, but not cramped by any means. It is a very clean place as well.     The waitress that greeted us (and also served us) was very nice and polite. She made suggestions on the menu upon learning that I was new to the restaurant. The waitress was also very prompt with delivering our drinks and food and asked (only once) if everything tasted good.    The food we received was outstanding. It was fresh, hot, and tasted great. The presentation of the food we ordered was perfect as well.     Needless to say, we will definitely be returning to this Skyline Chili in the near future. I would also recommend this location to anyone who is wanting to try something new as well!"}
{"text":"Good chili but with a twist. Originated in Cincy.. If you have never  tried a 3 way or a cheese coney, you are really are missing out! Try the haberno cheese if your lucky to be there when they have it, it will wake up your taste buds with a spicy kick! Mr. Underwood runs a fine shop!"}
{"text":"Skyline Chili would be a tie with Chipotle for my last meal on earth. Their food is unique and delicious - I have been coming to Skyline Chili, particularly the one in Mayfield, with my dad since I was a little girl and have always loved it.  Name anything on the menu and I have tried it. Everything is great. I usually always get a coney and a five way, but once in a while I will go for the five way potato which is really great too. I love hotsauce, and this is the *perfect* food to drench it on. Skyline's hotsauce is great too.  Now that I am done raving about the food, lets move on to service. Everytime I have been here (and I've been coming here for years, don't forget) the waiters are friendly and attentive. They don't bug you too much while you are eating but make sure your drink is always refilled at the same time. Some of the waiters remember us and catch up on how  we have been.  Overall a great place to relax and have a filling, delicious meal for a great price. I love this place."}
{"text":"Born in Cincy, raised in Columbus (2nd largest market), I know my Skyline. This location does the brand proud, fast and friendly service with the great skyline taste I love. Sweet tea was amazing as always and the store was nice and clean. Will return to this location."}
{"text":"Darn good food for a really cheap price.  I love their chili, some people hate it because it has cinnamon in it...Greek style.  I think it is very good and I usually get the cheese coneys which they put an absolutely ridiculous amount of cheese on...in a good way.  I like their hot sauce because it is super hot.  It is great on their coneys.  The fries are more of a string style...and they are nice and crispy.  Service is good and they usually have your food out extremely quickly.  Overall, you should at least try one of the Skyline Chili locations of you have not already."}
{"text":"It's Skyline so it has to be good! It's the closest one to my parents house and one of just a few in the Cleveland area. The problem is it's Cincinnati Chili and the people of Cleveland just haven't taken hold and called it their own yet! When we went in it was empty, completely empty and we found out that even some of the staff doesn't actually like the chili. Not to throw anyone under the bus, but if you can't appreciate the delicious combination of hot dog, chili and cheese or spaghetti chili and cheese how can you get people outside of Cincinnati to fall in love with it.   As a Cincinnati native, raised in Cleveland and now living in California I feel like I need to spread the Skyline chili love to as many people as possible and my husband will definitely take credit for introducing many people to the joys of Skyline.   The food is great here, give it a chance and know that it will be different than other chili dogs and even though spaghetti and chili sounds weird, I promise it really is good! Try it and enjoy the experience, It's Skyline Time!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. Pretty good little joint if you like 3 way chili. Service was good. Very good portions for the price. The spaghetti wasn't over cooked like a lot of places do.   I'll definitely have to go back and try their chili dogs and other items. The service was good and the servers were pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't spend a whole lot of time here, since I was grabbing a quick meal to go while spending the day at Ray's Mountain Bike Park.  This Skyline is modeled after the rare cafeteria model of Skylines.  I must be honest, it's not my favorite, but it was definitely fast and efficient.  I was in and out in about 5 minutes.  The chili and coneys were pretty standard for Skyline, so definitely a win there.  May have to visit again on future trips to this area."}
{"text":"I don't know how I missed reviewing this temple to fastfood chili. I know the two NE Ohio skyline locations like the back of my hand. Screw it if that statement makes me sound like a big fat fatty. Skyline is a must stop for anyone passing through Ohio. Unfortunately, if you are driving I-90 or I-80, this location, or the Greens of Lyndhurst are your only two options.   Unlike Cinci Skylines, this Parma location does not offer table service; instead you can pick up a tray and get your chili on cafeteria style.   Taking US 30? Stop in Ontario near Mansfield and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ew.... You know when I first walked in it didn't look appetizing and after trying the 2-way which is chilli on spaghetti and the chili cheese fries, I was solidified in my thoughts... Its horrible quality chilli and they put too much cheese for me. It just doesn't taste good, I will never be back!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have been to several Skylines from here to KY.  Every other shop is proud of their chili.  They want you t taste it.  They hand out dishes of the stuff.  They push on you any way possible...which is fantastic.  This place acts like the chili is some back room side item.  Almost like it is an embarrassment to them.  I have been on 3 occasions now and every time I have to ask for additional chili to put on the chili dog.   You have to remove the cheese, pick up the dog and look for the red stain to see if they even bothered.  Once you realize that you plate may have passed quickly past the chili pot without a stop over, you can raise your hand and ask for some.  Rather tedious though.  And it is only in this place.  Go figure."}
{"text":"When my son comes home from college in PA this is the first place he goes!  Never had a bad meal.  This is comfort food that we have enjoyed ever since we stated going to Cincinnati Reds in the \"70's.  We will keep coming back.  If you never have been, then give it a try.  A real regional tradition."}
{"text":"We first tried Skyline on our honeymoon of all things - I added hot sauce at that time, unfortunately, before I realized what Skyline chili is!  Now I love the taste.   I have to have mustard and onions.     Our service was great here.  The food was piping hot - this is the FIRST time I've been to a Skyline that served hot chili.. thank goodness!!      Give it a try, you'll have cravings."}
{"text":"Being new to Ohio, I get to experience all these institutions for the first time. I have to admit, after eating the canned stuff, actually visiting a Skyline Chili was not at the top of my list. I wanted to have something different for lunch the other day, so I decided to take a chance and check it out.   First impression of this location was great. It was in a nice shopping center and CLEAN. The service was quick and friendly and the portions were generous, yet very affordable. I ordered the 4 way chili spaghetti with onions. I took my first bite and it was heaven. I think I inhaled the plate in under 5 minutes. It was so good. The thing that sets them apart is definitely their chili seasoning. The cinnamon is a strange addition, but oddly it works VERY WELL.   Under $8 for a lunch is definitely doable. It's the kind of thing I'm going to crave at least once a week. Thank goodness it's close to work."}
{"text":"The food is great! Full loads of chili and cheese on your plate. The staffs are very friendly and make sure you get everything you need and enjoy the food. Highly recommend this place for a try, good food nice people and fast service."}
{"text":"A cut above fast food ... and inexpensive. Extreme cheese coneys are my go to meal but today mixing it up by adding a buffalo chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Been here just once so far. The chilli is good but different. It's a \"Cleveland\" chilli so it's more liquidy. They have veggi chilli which is a plus which they call beans and rice but it tastes really good.   The owner is really nice. I think it's something in the water here in Cleveland (steel particles?) that makes people nice."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to a chain restaurant  with my child where there was not a changing table. This restaurant does not have a changing table in the male or female bathroom. Shameful!"}
{"text":"At Skyline chili it's simple; it's about the food and good service.  Depending on where you go, it's either table service or, like here, it's more of a cafeteria deal, but the food's plentiful, the dogs and chili are tasty, and I really enjoy the simplicity of it all (oh, and did I mention the mountains of cheese:). With good food, good prices, and good company, it's a must to make a beeline to Skyline:)"}
{"text":"This location has great service which makes the entire experience that much better.   3 way with onions all the way! Might not be too many ingredients but it sure tastes amazing and also light on the checkbook."}
{"text":"One of the only places in North East Ohio to get Cincinnati Chili. The food is unique. The service is quick and absolutely beyond reproach."}
{"text":"I am a cheese fanatic. I order extra cheese almost everywhere I go. So when I visit Skyline, I don't even have to ask lol. I love the 3 way with 1 chili cheese dog on the side. It's affordable and extremely satisfying. The restaurant is clean and the service is quick."}
{"text":"This is such a unique place to me being from Virginia, but it was a nice experience.  The ladies working here were super helpful and friendly and can apparently tell by the look on your face if its your first visit, and if it is, they give you a coupon for a free hot dog on your next visit.  I was in shock by the amount of cheese they put on any given item on the menu.  My arteries, I'm sure, were not pleased.  I really like the setup thats not quite server style restaurant and not quite fast food - as said in the other reviews, its more cafeteria style, but I'm okay with that.  The taste of the chili was different than what I expected.  It had a nutmeg flavor to it which was different, but not bad. I'd probably return, but if you love yourself, don't go there too often."}
{"text":"Cincinnati chili in Cleveland!!! Heaven!!!   You have to know what you are getting into with Skyline. This is not normal chili. It is an acquired taste. I lived in Cincinnati for years before I finally \"liked\" it and then went from like to LOVE.   Unique - noodles, chili and cheese? You bet! Oyster crackers to soak up any extra on your plate? The best.   I moved from Cinci to Colorado and have to order it online. Parents live near Cleveland...this is now a required stop whenever I am in town...   This location is unique...wasn't expecting the cafeteria style, but the employees were super friendly and moved you through quickly.   The food is exactly how I remember and so much better than making at home! Hint of Cinnamon and chocolate in the chili...loads of cheese.   Don't forget the peppermint patty at the end...no experience is complete without \"dessert\"!    Now if I could get them to put a Skyline in CO!"}
{"text":"I love skyline chili! First experienced it in it's native cincinatti and travel to the location on stow once per year. The staff is always friendly and service is great. Quality matches what I expect from a skyline"}
{"text":"If you like the Cincinnati Chili this is your place in Akron to get your fix..People either like it or hate it.   If you like it this is your place.  Usually service is quick and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Ohio natives rave about Skyline Chili, so we made a stop at this location to try it for the first time. We ordered a Coney and a Three-way. Both were god awful. The chili is a gross mushy gritted texture with a lacking flavor that is compensated with a strange sweet element (brown sugar?) and the hot dogs are certainly not beef, but tasted like cheap sour pork.  The staff was very pleasant and friendly and super accommodating when they overheard us. Dietra wanted to make sure we had a good dining experience and brought us complimentary andouille sausage coneys which were not awful. It was a very sweet gesture that we appreciated very much.  Nevertheless, I threw up the entire meal in the parking lot. I wish I was kidding, but the food was so bad that I actually threw up as soon as I got outside.  Service was good. The restaurant was janky. The food was disgusting."}
{"text":"Skyline is an Ohio restaurant landmark. It's something we're known for, but isn't executed as well as it should be. The chili is what I like to call your \"base model\" chili. It's got hints of cinnamon and chili powder, but lacks salt, heat, the tang of a tomato base and dimension of flavors I think a chili should have. It's definitely geared to appease the masses of people with boring palates. It's definitely not appealing when paired with a bunch of overcooked, watery spaghetti that is piled high with shredded cheese that barely melts in entirety. The coney dogs are equally disappointing, as they are small, boiled hot dogs placed on bigger buns that they don't fill and piled with the ingredients of your choosing.   ...If you do make it to Skyline, do yourself a favor towards a decent, filling, and relatively tasty meal by ordering the five-way potato and top it with sour cream and hot sauce. The portion is large for the price, and the potato is hot enough to melt the cheese on top."}
{"text":"Skyline Chili is a Cincinnati cult classic. We've been to Skyline many, many times. It's so good! The chili cheese fries are delicious, as well as the 5- way (chili, spaghetti, cheese, beans and chopped onion). The Caesar salad is fresh and crispy, and the dressing is really good. The Buffalo Chicken salad is delicious as well. Even the loaded chili cheese baked potato is good. I don't think there is a single thing on the menu that my family doesn't like.   This Skyline is clean, and the servers have always been helpful, pleasant and prompt in checking- in on us and refilling drinks.   It's become a tradition for us to each get a mini peppermint patty at the cash register when paying (chili and cheese don't make for the freshest breath! Ha ha!) and even pick up some cans of Skyline to take home.  Our family always enjoys going here, and it's a great place to take the kids. They bring bowls of crackers for each person when you are seated, so that keeps the kids occupied, and the wait time for your order is very quick.  They even provide bibs if you need them. Absolutely 5 stars! And we will, of course, return again and again and again!  :)"}
{"text":"Give me a 5-way or deluxe bean burrito any day!  It's strange how the food tastes identically to the bonefide Cinti Skyline's but there is something missing.  I order 10 chili dogs w/ cheese to go the other day.  They were not used to an order as such and the staff did not know how the wield the hotdog paddles (not sure what that gizmo is called) for large orders.  So basically, they miss the flare and the extremely fast pace.  People behind me were having to wait.  I personally feel\" to go\" orders should automatically include napkins, hot sauce and oyster crackers.  I thought it was odd that I had to ask for those items."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We went there on our way to KY and I have never been there and our friends laughed, Because I never been there, so glad they took me there... I LOVED IT!!  The chili was sweet and soooo different over spaghetti and topped with a HUGE mound of cheddar cheese!! Can't go wrong there!! We will be back real soon I hope!!! =)"}
{"text":"I didn't go here nearly enough, and now I've been going multiple times a week!  Pros: The service is fast and friendly, the tables are clean, and the food has been delicious!  Cons: The only one I can even think of is that restroom could use some deep cleaning.  I really enjoy going to Skyline. Management has come by and asked me how my meal was every time I have been there in the past few weeks. The bottles of hot sauce on table are clean and full. I usually load too much hot sauce, and I usually get my drink in a to-go cup to cool my palette. They usually have oyster crackers and bibs ready if you need them.  The coneys are very tempting, but I usually go with a 4-way with onions. Before my friend brought me to this location years ago, it would be something that I wouldn't even try. I am glad I went. I lived in South Carolina for years, and this Cincy style chili is not available down there. It's a shame.  One of the worst parts about this restaurant is out of their control. I really dislike the parking lot. It's limited and space and has 1-2 spots in front of the restaurant partially blocked by a traffic directing island.  After writing this review, I think I've convinced myself to go to Skyline tonight!"}
{"text":"Friendly service! Good food. Cinci chili and hot dogs! Recommend for a quick bite to eat !"}
{"text":"This is the perfect fix for being homesick for Cincinnati! The food and customer service isn't as good as at the Cincy Skyline's I've been to, but I'm happy it's nearby. Skyline is an acquired taste, but it's satisfying and cheap!"}
{"text":"I know Skyline is a classic.  But the 3-Way was perhaps not the best way for me to go.  The service was quick and I did appreciate that the shredded cheese was bagged separately for my to-go order.  The chili sauce had a flavor I couldn't quite put my finger on.....nutmeg?  Or maybe cinnamon?  Maybe it's an acquired taste.  I couldn't not stop at Skyline since it was right by my hotel.....but I think I should have gone for some hot dogs."}
{"text":"I was a former manager for this location at the turn of the century. So I have very high expectations of the service and food. All of those were well met today.   I now live in New Jersey and do not get to the Cleveland area as much as I would like, but Skyline is ALWAYS on my to do list. My wife had a 4 Way and I had 4 Bean and two Cheese Coneys without onions. The food was spot on and our server was excellent. The General Manager did an excellent job of doing table touches and interacting with all of the guests.  It was definitely Skyline Time!"}
{"text":"What on earth is better than Skyline chili? Friendly service and great food as always."}
{"text":"Every time I get out this direction, I have to stop. I like to eat lunch early and they open at 10:am which is nice. I recommend the coney's and 5 way. The hot sauce is a must try."}
{"text":"Drive Through Review  Large 5 was was plenty for dinner for 2.... ordered a cheddar potato for lunch tomorrow.  5 Way Chili - more cinnamon than I remember, but the spaghetti was cooked well, the beans were not mushy, and the cheese was sharp.  Potato - well cooked with the same cheddar as the little shredded bags of joy that come with the chili.  Take out containers - THE WORST EVER... the plastic bag even leaked!!! No holes... the grease seeped out of the seam! Both containers were covered in greasy slime by the time I drove the 5 miles home... even though neither moved a bit.. the bag didn't even twitch on the passenger seat... grrrrr."}
{"text":"I really like the chili and chili dogs, but the customer service is not good. I recommend the food, but double check your order. They have forgotten food I've paid for every time I've eaten there."}
{"text":"My love for Skyline Chili began when I was a college student near Cincinnati. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. 3, 4, and 5 ways of all sizes (I prefer them \"juicy\"!), endless coneys, chili cheese fries (veggie and regular), burritos, potatoes, salads. Everything is excellent!  I've been to many skyline locations. They are all great and this one is no exception. The staff is super friendly and passionate about skyline (try it and you will be, too!). The restaurant is always clean and the service is quick.  If you are a first timer, definitely go with the 3 way. That's spaghetti, Cincinnati chili, and a heaping mound of shredded cheese. Add onions or kidney beans to make it a 4 way, or both to make it a 5 way. A small is too small and a large is too large for me. Regular is the way to go! And, I definitely recommend at least one cheese coney with everything. (I get two!)  If you are looking for something new, the Burritos are excellent. Chili, wrapped in a tortilla, with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and a small dollop of sour cream on top. When I was in college I'd get both a 4 way with onions and a burrito! Oh, the good old days.  My girlfriend, who is vegetarian, always gets the veggie chili cheese fries. Let them sit for a minute while the fries soak up the chili, the cheese melts, and everything begins to stick together. Then just add ketchup and dive in!  For dessert, get a peppermint patty, pull off little pieces, and eat them between two oyster crackers like a sandwich. Don't ask, just do it!  Tip for vegetarians: This place is excellent for vegetarians! They serve two types of chili - the original Cincinnati chili and a vegetarian black bean chili. So, pretty much anything can be made vegetarian. They even serve chili cheese sandwiches (a coney with no hotdog). So, you can get your coney fix, as well! Also, the Greek salad is great, coming full of feta, kalamata olives, and a tasty dressing. Try one if your not too full from all the other amazing food you've eaten!"}
{"text":"This is an absolute favorite for me! While probably not the healthiest lunch fine option, I find myself frequenting skyline at least once a month. The staff and dining room create a friendly environment. Food portions are good along with quality. My only recommendation is that if you're trying to avoid grease, you should eat somewhere else. I'd definitely recommend at least giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I had a good memory of eating at Skyline Chili when I used to visit Cincinatti - I was in Akron for a professional event and visited this one about 30 minutes away.  It was not anywhere as good as I remember, the spaghetti was way overcooked to a mushy consistency, and the chili was just ok.  Either my memory is failing, things have changed for this restaurant chain, or I got a bad meal/picked a bad location."}
{"text":"Don't come in after 8 pm. They are more interested in cleaning the place then getting your food. We waited 20 minutes for our to go order. The chic wrap had 4 small pieces cause they were out of it but of course we are home before we know this. The only employee doing anything with food said \"it's not my fault\". So it is those annoying customers fault. It was disgusting that allll the cleaning products were on the food prep areas.  Think twice about coming here after 8 pm. Clearly night management is weak."}
{"text":"Lowest common denominator food.    If I really, and I mean ree ah leee loved my elementary school cafeteria, and I were pining to recreate that experience, I would enjoy Skyline Chili.  I didn't, I'm not, so I don't.  That there hasn't yet been some kind of federal law reining in this tragic misuse of the word \"chili\" is an enduring mystery.  I can think of a few other words more apt:  mild sauce, red dressing, schmoog, driz, or perhaps \"get that stuff away from my mouth.\"  There is no way they could possibly have spent any less on this \"food\" without risking an FDA raid. My quick calculations, standing in line  (in LINE?)  was about seventy-five cents for the average platter of water (laced with something they consider \"chili\") over spaghetti.  Bland.  Uninspired.  And people stand in line?  They wait for this gruel?  I think the only reason you should stand in line, with a tray, for your food is if you're doing two to ten in Rikers.  And I doubt any of those guys would eat this, either.  (I take it from the people who gush over this place that way down in Cincinnati, a suburb of metropolitan Covington, Kentucky, they think this is the best meal on our green earth.  Fine, then keep it down there.  Here are a few cities closer to Cleveland than that:  Detroit, Pittsburgh, Niagara Falls, Canada.  Do we emulate any of their culinary fetishes?  Is there a Primanti Brothers opening in Tremont?  An American Coney Island in Crocker Park? No.  Nor should there be in this case.)  Workers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Like a good display of cleavage, this place is easy to see but hard to get into without serious effort.  You've gotta navigate a bunch of Steels Corner suburban wasteland sprawl to get to the little strip mall that houses Skyline.  Beware the roads with grassy medians!  It's too easy to drive on the wrong side if it's dark out.  Now with Skyline, either you like the chili or you don't.   Any time we went to Reds games when I's a kid, that meant stopping at a Cincy chili parlor, so I got the bug as a youngun.  It's Cincinnati-style Greek chili, far different than the supposed million or so varieties of heavily tomato-based overspiced slop that most Americans are used to.  Cincy chili is more of a sauce consistency (thinner) than a meal in itself, it's flavored differently (cinnamon?) and it's great on everything.  Most dishes include chili on spaghetti (\"Ways\") or hot dogs, covered with a fucking huge mound of shredded cheese.  Seriously, the copious amount of queso used here keeps Wisconsin in business.  Skyline is styled somewhat like Steak-N-Shake, a middle ground between fast food and full dining, where fast food is served to you on plates with silverware.   The service at this Skyline has never disappointed.  Somehow, they seem really focused on keeping drinks full, even for thirsty lardasses like me.  ¡Muy apreciado!  Here's a tip: go Monday nights.  All you can eat Ways and Dogs for like $8.99.  See if you can beat my record of 17 cheese coneys... I don't think you can, because unlike you, I've transformed public displays of gluttonous embarrassment into an art form."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Cincinnati chili you don't know what you're missing. It started out as a popular restaurant downtown Cincinnati and grown tremendously over the last thirty years. Its made with and interesting combination of cinnamon and chocolate. A bit more watered down than coney chili but a very unique flavor. They serve it on hotdogs, in a book or spaghetti either 3, 4 or 5 way. This location is hit or miss because of the service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love! Makes me miss living in Cincy ;) Get a 3-way and a cheese coney. Don't forget the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Worst chili of all time. Soggy cheap hot dogs. Pasta is not al dente at all. Better off opening a can of chili and pouring it over Ramen Noodles. They use a heavy amount of cinnamon in their chili and I don't think they use ground beef. I think they just call it \"meat.\" Overload of cold cheap cheddar on everything."}
{"text":"I'm going to say it and wait patiently for the backlash: Cleveland-style chili sucks! While I will use this review to cover Skyline Chili independent of other places, I want to point out that this style of chili is what this area of the country is known for and quite frankly I think it's terrible. It doesn't mesh well with my palate. I realize that by saying this, I am trampling on a long cherished tradition in this area. And frankly, I'm sticking to it. I realize that your mothers and grandmothers fed this to you as a child... and on their behalf I apologize for years of abuse.   Chili should be hearty and robust and spicy. Heck if you want a decent chili, go try the one at Zoup. It at least resembles a real chili. Skyline chili has a texture that reminds me of cream of wheat (and not in a good way). But beyond that it is relatively flavorless with the exception of some odd taste that is somewhat reminiscent of cinnamon. It's also served in a really weird way - on noodles. I am fairly adventurous but these textures and flavors just didn't mesh well for me.  I think another thing that bothered me is that, being unfamiliar with this style of chili, I felt confused by the menu. The staff weren't very helpful when I expressed my confusion either.   I'm glad you all love this chili but I'll pass on it and find some real chili!"}
{"text":"The only reason a three, is for the decor and a slight attitude from one of the people behind the counter.  The food was great as usual, been here many times, just the first as a yelper this past Friday. Get the same thing all the time three way and a Coney. Would like to try the menu. And just a word of advice to the Skyline higher ups, you should expand a bit, the one in Parma is the only one in the Cleveland area......"}
{"text":"If you come here while on drugs, it's Highline Chili. If you come here with a man and a woman and you're attracted to both of them, it's Biline Chili. And if I come over to you and say \"what's a nice Yelper like you doing in a Chili Parlor like this\" then don't worry, that's just Myline Chili.  What to get: The 5-way. Or a 3-way, with me. Boom. Um: No really the 3-way is a thing. I'm not being dirty. I would never be dirty.  I wouldn't usually give a chain 5 stars, but this particular chain has exceptionally good Chili. Not the best in Cincy, mind you - that would be Dixie Chili (6 way) or Camp Washington Chili. But in terms of an exported franchise, you can't do much better than Skyline.  Service here is pretty good, portions are hefty, and the taste of the Chili is pretty damn spectacular. Even when I'm not hungry, put a plate of this in front of me and I'll wolf it down and woof it down at the same time, thus managing to imitate two related-but-different types of animals, which is a 5-star feat in and of itself."}
{"text":"Yummy, do not pass this up. 5 way chili medium with two coney's. Da bomb dig!  Everyone of these that I've been to so far always makes me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most pathetic excuse for chili I have ever encountered. A quarter of a star for omitting beans, but that's it. Canned Wolf and Hormel chili are better, and that is really being generous. Sorry, this Texan expected better. Shame on you."}
{"text":"My home away from home.  To experience Skyline is to understand the struggles and joys of Oho."}
{"text":"Gotta love the classic!  If you haven't had Cincinnati style chili, give it a try. Don't expect the Texas style chili most everyone is used to. This stuff is more like a sauce. Have it on some spaghetti.   Yeah buddy!!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this one for years and had never been, but I know I'm a fan, I even buy their chili at the stores when I'm hankering to make my own 3 way :) Got it to go, and the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5, it was very lacking in the most important ingredient: the 'Chili.' My wife got a potato 3 way and I got the regular 3 Way, both definitely needed more chili. Still loved it and will go back, guess I just have to ask for more Chili. Staff was friendly and quick, got in out out great! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The chili is always consistent. I am shocked at how dirty this restraunt is. Under staffed and the owner/manager does nothing. Stands around and has no desire to take care of customers. This is now three weeks in a row with the same results. The staff mimics the owner lazy."}
{"text":"A sloppy mess of an overflowing dish. It was a 4-way. (A mound of spaghetti noodles, the special recipe chili, onions and and overload of cheese on top.) Mmmmmm... As a side I had a Coney Dog. (A hot dog, and it's bun, loaded with chili, onions and cheese.)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Walk in the door and they are treating you like you own the place. Very cordial folks working here. 5 way large oh my, don't forget the hot sauce and say plenty of cheese please! Yes, I will keep going here. They even said thanks for coming in as I waddled out."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting At All. The time of my visit the restaurant wasn't clean (floor dirty and some tables that were empty had yet to be wiped off). Service was mediocre, the chili wasn't a wow factor considering it's what they are known for. I like cheese but 2 lbs on my bowl of chili was extreme. My first and last time there. Just didn't work for me."}
{"text":"I personally like this place.  It is quick, cheap and provides me with a pick-me-up! I always get the small three way.    Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"A chain that's seen better days.  Quality and look have gone down hill.  Needs major attention from chain managers"}
{"text":"So, there we were, minding our own business and driving along the freeway when my partner-in-travel spotted the little Skyline Chili sign! Our opportunities to have Skyline Chili are few and far between as we live up near Detroit, so we usually only have it when we go down Cincy way...or prepping it ourselves at home using our stash of canned Skyline Chili brought home from those trips (and the commenter who said it just isn't the same is correct...). Imagine our surprise when we spotted an outlet in Cleveland (a place we actually get to a couple of times each year. And it was lunchtime! An unexpected treat for us :) This outlet is tucked into a network of strip mall stores, but it had a nice friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Need a Skyline fix, but you're on the opposite side of the state from Cincinnati?  No problem.  All you've come to expect from the original Skyline locations in the Queen City is here -- the quick and friendly service, the three-ways bursting with yellow cheese, the bibs, and the oyster crackers with \"hot\" sauce.   This location is almost always busy, but we've never had to wait for a table.  Sometimes you will have to wait a bit longer than you might expect for your food, but that's if an influx of carry-out orders happens to come through right before you sit down.  Typically, the food is out within 5-7 minutes of ordering.   Vegetarians, do not despair!  3-, 4-, and 5-ways can be made with Skyline's special black-beans-and-rice mixture, which also fills their scrumptious black bean burritos.  In my opinion, it's even better than the original chili that made the chain famous.  If you're a chili fan, though, you can buy cans of it (or, better yet, packets of the seasoning mix) at the counter.    Note: they take credit cards, but you'll need to pay at the counter.  Feel free to leave the tip in cash at the table."}
{"text":"one of my guilty pleasures.  I seriously love this stuff.  I tend to always order way too much to go and just graze on it later in the day.  5 way is the way to go and they give you a TON of bagged cheese.  The chili isnt your traditional chili...its Cincy chili and has cinnamon in it and much thinner.  Whatever it is....I like it.  The mini loaded little hot dogs.....oh my goodness.  Employees are ALWAYS nice and friendly.  I dont come here as often as I want to but they are always helpful and patient with me while I stumble around the menu.  If this place had a drive through...look out."}
{"text":"I wish we had continued down the street to Retro Dog.  Talk about the most unhappy staff, grumpiness at its finest.    Blah food, blah staff.  The only reason I gave it a two star rating is cause my husband likes this stuff.  I couldn't think of anything worse to eat."}
{"text":"helloooooooooooooo, lovah.  thank god for this location, otherwise i'd be subject to eating cans of store bought skyline in my own home. depressing to say the least, since no one - no one, can reproduce skyline shredded cheese. it's like air. cheese air. and it is good. even better than the cheese is the chili. it's original, and unlike any other chili you've tasted. it's got a kick, but it's sweet. no beans and a little sauce-like. do not accept imitations. three ways, four ways, five ways - all perfectly acceptable ways to reach heaven. tack on a coney dog (or a burrito - they're getting creative these days,) and indulge.  disclaimer: skyline has been known to induce food comas. eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"After my first trip, I wasn't amazed--it was just OK. Shortly thereafter, I had dreams about it. Soon enough, I went back, and now I have around half-a-dozen frozen boxes in my freezer and even more cans. Skyline has made me an addict."}
{"text":"I honestly don't see what the hype is about with this 'chili'. It looks like dog food & doesn't look very appetizing when it's slapped on over cooked noodles.  The only things that make the chili somewhat edible is the mound of cheese & hot sauce.   At least the employees were very nice & helpful though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend grew up with skyline chili and I have never had it before until yesterday.   I happened to be on the east side and decided to pick up some take out and surprise him.   I chose two coneys, one with cheese, a five way spaghetti and a baked potato with chili and cheese.   My favorite and his was the potato although the other items also tasted good.  The hot sauce is amazing to top off the dish. Perfect pairing :)  The staff was super friendly and quick.   I am writing this review more as a take out  review rather than dine-in. I like places with a full bar for dining in ;)"}
{"text":"Skyline is wonderful, and I often consider it a gift from the gods of Cincinnati. Coneys, 4-ways, chilitos, I love them all. Unfortunately there seems to be an issue with Skyline quality the farther away you get from the Ohio River.  I really enjoy being able to eat Skyline in Cleveland but the flavor you get down in Cincinnati is just better. Heck, it's a touch better at restaurants in Columbus, but nothing touches the Cincinnati flavor when it come to Skyline.  Still, this place is awesome, It's the first Skyline I ever went to and it has a unique cafeteria-style  that's not found at any other Skyline Chili that i know of. If you're looking for the best coney in town, Skyline Chili is the place to get it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it. I ordered the chili three way. The small was enough for me. The chili has kinda a sweet taste to it that I can only describe as cloves. They also had beans and raw onions served with finely shredded cheddar cheese on top. My friend who came with me is a vegetarian and was happy to see a vegetarian chili option on the menu. Service was good and the place was very clean. I would definitely come back here.  Next time I come back I plan to try the chili dog covered in the shredded cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"Skyline chili is one of my biggest addictions. It's a unique blend of spices with a chili and spaghetti and plenty of shredded cheese, definitely something you need to try. The Ridge Road skyline chili has great customer service and a clean and inviting atmosphere. Also, try their sweet tea, it's great."}
{"text":"Always good service and good food. The staff is very upbeat and attentive. Great pricing. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Skyline Chili I am in the addicted category. Skyline Chili is a staple of the state and one of the few reasons I continue to live here. I have to have it at least once a month. Yum Yum Yum.  One cannot deny the unique flavor of Skyline, nothing comes close. If you've never been here you may be thinking \"Chili on spaghetti?\" - YES! And you need to try it to believe me!  It is not expensive and it sure is good!  This location is clean, fast, and super friendly.  They also have a kids eat free night & other theme nights but I forget which is what. (Sorry).  5 out of 5 forks!  (real ones!, not sporks)"}
{"text":"To be fair, something terrible would have to happen to me at a skyline for me to rate less than 5 stars. Obviously, I love skyline. Any trip to Ohio requires a visit. Eat the largest 5-way that you can and worry about the consequences later."}
{"text":"Really unique and good. Gotta try it once in your life"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place two stars, because the service was so good. I guess Greek style spaghetti just wasn't 'my thing'. The bright light of this whole experience was the chili dogs, which were actually quite enjoyable. Make sure you nix the beans, they're not needed."}
{"text":"The first and only time I went to a Skyline Chili was in 2002 or 2003 during a trip to Cincinnati.  I do remember liking the chili, but I don't think I really appreciated it as at the time I wasn't that big on chili.  I don't know man, I used to be kinda stupid.  I am older and wiser now and I was looking forward to Skyline during our trip to Ohio.  I did have a can of Skyline chili a couple of months ago (thank you, Walmart) but I was waiting to go to an actual Skyline.  We finally went a couple of days ago.  I decided to get a loaded chili bowl that included beans, onions, sour cream and of course the chili and beautiful mound of cheddar cheese.  Of course the bowl was delicious.  I definitely ate it all and was sad when I ran out.  But at least I saved room for frozen yogurt.    The only thing I can really say is that my boyfriend and I were both wearing Kylo Ren shirts (we totally did this by accident, I swear).  One of the guys behind the counter said to me, \"I gotta tell you, I did not like Kylo Ren\".  Okay.  I don't go to people telling them I don't like whatever is on their shirt, but I do enjoy a good nerd conversation sometimes.  As long as the other person agrees with me or I get to tell them their opinions are wrong and they are stupid (kinda kidding).  \"Well, that's your problem,\" I say, half-jokingly.  Spoiler alerts to follow if you haven't seen The Force Awakens for some reason but still plan to...  \"He almost got defeated by a girl that had no Jedi training,\" he says.  \"Well, he's still an apprentice himself,\" I say.  I seem to remember my boyfriend telling him something about \"almost\" not really counting.  I don't know, I was feeling pretty heated by then.  And I LIKED Rey.  \"He killed his father,\" he counters.  \"Do you not know how Star Wars villains work?\" I ask.  This somehow was the end of the conversation, but at this point I was mildly annoyed with the guy as was the boyfriend.  He's lucky I don't take a star off.  Buddy, don't talk shit about characters your customers like.  If we were at a party I probably would've schooled the shit out of this guy but ultimately made him my best friend because man do I like to argue, but I was just trying to enjoy some post-Cleveland Zoo chili with my boyfriend, his dad and his stepmother.  Anyway, I'm back in Tennessee and Tennessee doesn't have any Skylines.  I did go to Walmart today and buy two cans of Skyline chili, though."}
{"text":"5 stars for the best chili on the face of the planet!  Cincinnati chili at it's best with a mildly spicy chili sauce on top of strangely yellow spaghetti and topped with great big mounds of yummy cheddar!  I soak it with hot sauce and enter nirvana while consuming this incredible meal.  There's nothing better after a night of abusing your liver but it's also awesome at pretty much all other times as well.    So sad that we don't have any restaurants like this in the great city of Chicago.  I have to store up on this chili-goodness when traveling to Indiana, Ohio, or Kentucky.    So so actual location.  Cafeteria style.  You walk up and the food is slopped onto a plate and handed to you."}
{"text":"I moved up to Cleveland from Cincinnati about a year ago and this place is always a safe bet for good food and friendly service. In fact I would go so far to say that this location tastes even better than SOME of the original locations in Cincinnati for some strange reason. Call it a difference in freshness, effort, service, whatever?   Anyway, I Just gotta have my weekly chesse coney (mini chili dogs) fix to avoid getting homesick and packing my bags. Also 4 cheese conies with hot sauce is the ULTIMATE hangover cure just take my word for it. Many people just can't get into the whole chili with spaghetti thing (the 3-way) but if you like the unique taste and texture of the chili you will be an instant Skyline addict. It's not just dogs and chili either they have a variety of alternative options on the menu as well. Wraps, chilitos, salads, etc... All of it excellent!"}
{"text":"Regular 3-way, two cheese coneys with everything.  And so it has gone for me for the past 18 years, from age 11 to age 29.  And so it will go until the end of days.  Skyline Chili is on my very short list of foods that I would consider requesting as a last meal if I were ever on Death Row.  Why I would ever be on Death Row is a mystery, but I digress.  \"Cincinnati Chili\" is really more of a sauce than it is a chili.  You can order a bowl of it, but you shouldn't.  I almost broke up with a girlfriend, once, because she failed to listen to my expert advice in this matter, and then had the audacity to tell me that the chili sucked.  Skyline chili is one of two places where I never know what I want my last taste to be.  Yes, I'm a last taste guy.  Taco Bell is other place.  Sometimes, the added flavors of the hot dog, onions, and mustard seem like the way to go.  Other times, the purity of the 3-way is the answer.  The good news is that, if I make a mistake, I can order more food and have it quickly delivered to my table and right the wrong.  Speaking of quickly, that is one often underestimated aspect of nearly every Skyline Chili I've ever stepped inside.  They are fast as all get-out.  If they are not busy, they are as fast as any fast food chain, and the food is far better.  People who live in regions of the country that are not serviced by Skyline or some other variant of Cincinnati Chili are truly missing out."}
{"text":"You either love Skyline, some other Cincinnati variety of chili, haven't experienced it yet, or hate the style after trying it only once. This location is better than average, despite the difference of the chow line cafeteria service.  Friendly staff and always a great value.  The thing about Skyline is consistency, and this location is always up to the task.  Occasionally you need to ask for crackers, but I love that it is here.  On my way tonight for a check in.  Don't forget to finish with a couple of York mints.  That's 'Nati style complete.  Ask for an inverted 3-way, to see if they know what's up."}
{"text":"Skyline Chili!!!!! It's chili with crackers, cheese, noodles and beans! I don't have this often because of the carbs but when I do I enjoy it."}
{"text":"I wanted a slice of Cincinnati food and Skyline Chili hit the spot. Staff was courteous and restaurant was clean. Luke made a great impression...knowledgeable about products and very friendly. I think he has great management potential.   And did I mention how those 3 cheese coneys hit the spot. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"For me, this was a place worth trying once but not to come back. Interesting concept and tasty chili, but just so heavy and unhealthy it really will make you suffer after you are done."}
{"text":"\"What's the big deal?\" I said to a friend when I was visiting them in Cincinnati a couple years ago. But when another friend mentioned hitting this place after a movie in the area, I thought, \"Aw, what the hell.\" But this joint totally hit the spot, kiddo. You have to face the fact that the spaghetti and/or hot dogs are simply a conveyor of massive amounts of chili + cheese. Accept it, live with it, and love it."}
{"text":"I am a fan of skyline. I tried for the first time in Columbus and really have loved it ever since. For what I can tell people either love if or hate it. My husband and I love it. To be honest I don't think about it very much when we go out but I love the 3 way and my husband really enjoys the coneys. Mmmm now I want skyline....  PS: not diet food but very delicious!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants. The customer service is phenomenal, you are greeted immediately when you walk in which I think is very nice. The food compliments the great service, the chili is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"When Im feelin a little high on myself and I wanna come down a few notches I eat some horrible food so I feel like crap.  Evenflow.  The manager workin the counter was super sweet and as nice as peach pie.  We ordered to 3-ways.  Had a coupon for a FREE one so I took the second one to-go and she didn't give me any grief even though I was being a pain in the ass.  Food was good.  Even my lil one liked it.  We split the one, took the other home for later.  Essentially, I got 4 meals for like 6 bux!  Not bad.  If ya eat this whole thing in one sitting your colon must hate you.  To burn off these kind of calories you would have to walk to Lodi and back.  I saw lots of single women dining in here which I thought was odd.  And, by judging by how busy this place was I can see why Americans are the biggest on the planet.  Tables need to be bussed more often.  There was no fewer that 8 table around us the whole time we ate that had peoples trash laying around.  The ambiance gave me shivers of delight.  How about have trash cans at stations and let tubby walk to over.  God knows we need the exercise.  Oh, and don't use the toilets unless you need to shoot up...or vomit....or both.."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst tasting regional trend I've ever encountered. Ground beef chili with cinnamon? Yuck. Cincinnati can keep their gruel.  Hopefully 10+ year old Food Chanel reruns hosted by the guy from Double Dare will be the last time the world will be forced to hear about this stuff."}
{"text":"Worst regional trend ever. Ground beef chili with cinnamon. Yuck. Cincinnati trash. Best left for 10 year old Food Channel reruns hosted by the dude from Double Dare."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Skyline - it's an acquired taste.  My husband is from Cincinnati, and his family would always go to Skyline multiple times when visiting.  The first couple of times, I didn't \"get it.\"  It is indeed kinda sweet, and does indeed have a bit of a clove/cinnamon taste.  However, after a few visits, you start craving it, and then the next thing you know, you NEED it from time to time.    I get a 5 way, my husband gets a 4 way (no beans).  Neither of us love the hot dogs (called Coneys) - they're fine and all, and my mother in law SWEARS by them, but they kinda turn my stomach somehow.  Try one on the side, it might be your thing.  The only reason for not 5 stars was that this location is pretty run down.  It could use a sprucing up.  Other locations I've been to have always been much more spick and span and not aging so poorly.  Also, it is cafeteria style, which I've never seen before, but no points off there - it was just fine."}
{"text":"I have been coming to skyline for years and it never fails to satisfy, the food is soooo good even thought it makes you feel stuffed after. The staff remembers my and my family because we go often and they're all extremely kind. Will always come back."}
{"text":"I like their chili 3 way! really dense comfort food. They are a bit wild with the cheese though lol. hmmm  I see why my friend likes it so much. The greek salad is ok. I got my brother a burrito. I still have some vouchers so my return will be... in some time. Worth a little bit of carbo load :)"}
{"text":"When I think of a typical chili, I think of a hearty, chunky, meaty stew with beans and spices.  About Skyline chili, it is completely different.  I would call it a meat sauce finely blended with spice.  Almost gravy like texture with a completely different taste than a regular chili.  People say it's the cinnamon.  The coneys with everything rocked.  The classic combination of the hot dog, chili, onions, mustard, and cheese works well.  These are small so order more than one to satisfy your appetite.  The 5-way spaghetti is interesting and is growing on me.  I'm still getting used to the texture of the chili with spaghetti.  My favorite so far has been the chili deluxe and bean mix burritos.  I have been to Skyline several times, and it's growing on me.  Definitely an acquired taste.  Service is okay at this location, and it is not too expensive.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Ohio I want to go to Skyline.  We weren't able to find one on the way into town but found this one close to my bro bro's place.  He actually didn't know it was here.  I don't think most people from Cleveland would know of these locations as Skyline is more of a Cincinnati thing.    Anyway, we found this location and it was pretty much the same as any other Skyline I have been to.  The food was on point but the people serving were obviously different.  People in Cleveland are not the same as the people in Cincinnati.  The only thing odd that was pointed out by my friend was that they still had tube televisions mounted in here.  You would think that they would want to upgrade that."}
{"text":"Skyline is a love or hate place. I went for my birthday... I think it's safe to say I LOVE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Skyline is my not-so-guilty pleasure. Because I am a proud consumer of this deliciousness. Four-way, onion, inverted FOR LIFEEEEE."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Aveeage service. Would it kill people in the service industry to smile every now and again?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, back in the day I was a huge fan of Skyline chili. However, over the past few years I feel like it's started to go downhill. The food just doesn't seem as fresh. The inside of the restaurant isn't too great, it's clean and stuff but just looking a little outdated to me, and not in the cool outdated way. The prices are kind of expensive for what you get, you have to pay extra for cheese, sour cream and all the necessary toppings that should just be included! What's up with that?  The service here was also nothing special. In fact I kinda felt like we were being rushed out before we were ready to leave... I hate that feeling.  Maybe I've become a snob because my family figured out our own take on Skyline chili and it's delicious... it's left me unimpressed when I actually go to the restaurant. Maybe they just don't put as much TLC into their chili as my family does, maybe it's the old looking cheese that I had to pay extra for on my chili that kinda resembles dog food... I'm not sure but there's just something about this place that isn't sitting well with me anymore after years of loving it. Sorry guys, not a fan anymore."}
{"text":"Came in with high expectations. Was very disappointed. The chili was bland. The hot dogs were similar to Vienna Sausages but worse. The Buffalo Chicken wrap was tiny and contained almost no chicken and was basically all sauce. All of their menu items are bland and superficial. They try to make up for it by drowning it in a pile of cheese. It may fool and appeal to some, but not me and my family. The only positive aspect was the service. The employees were kind, helpful, and accommodating. Cleaned up our table afterwards."}
{"text":"Skyline is one of those restaurants that is an acquired taste.  The first visit I had about 15 years ago in Cincinnati I was unsure if I liked it. I remembered the unique chilli, coneys, and fluffy shredded cheese often. I also thought of their hot sauce and how darn good it was on the coney. I have been back numerous times, and when I moved to Stow, started frequenting the location here.  The location in Stow is not the best as it is not easily seen from the Steels Corners exit off Route 8. The restaurant is typical size with seating and lunch counter style bar seats. The staff is a mixed bag. Some days they are spot on, others they are inattentive and seemingly vanish for extend periods.  The food is the star. The chilli cheese coneys are amazing as are the chilli 3 and 5 ways. I've also had the chilli cheese burrito and it is okay. Love their hot sauce, and the fries are decent. It's a great inexpensive place for a bite plus they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Is this place under new management? The food is still good quality, but the staff is so odd. They don't know what is appropriate public conversation. I'd fire any server sitting around texting on her phone. One of the servers relatives has a mass on their thyroid and lungs. He also had a colostomy bag operation last year. One of the cooks is so happy he got to make out with a girl at the lake last summer. She was from Parma.   Can I just eat my sinfully unhealthy meal and not have images of shit and teenage lust running through my head?"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, it was a clean and quiet place to eat.  It's not that yummy as I thought it would be, but that's no one's fault.  I would come again, but frankly, it wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"C'mon, how can you not like Skyline?  Considering the only other thing Cincinnati has given us is Jerry Springer, this stands high above that.  A 3-Way and a coney, it's as simple as that..."}
{"text":"Before I get snarky comments about how I don't understand Cincinnati chili, I've had Skyline before. What I had here tasted completely different.  This place catered lunch at my office about a month ago. I knew I should have stayed away when the hot dogs were this really pale flesh color. Not pink, FLESH. The texture in the meat was off-putting; I've never had a hot dog quite like this one. The pasta was really, really mushy. Like I could feed it to a newborn and know they couldn't choke on it. The actual chili had an odd taste to it, I couldn't put my finger on it. It tasted nothing like Skyline I've had in the past.  The salad was good. But the salad was just iceberg lettuce, tomato and cucumber. I'm not sure how they could have messed that up.  I felt sick the rest of the day and felt worse when I went home.  I was originally going to one-star this review, but the salad wasn't awful so the meal wasn't a total wreck."}
{"text":"I am a Skyline lover.  Fell in love while living in Louisville but no longer live there. Now when we visit my in-laws in Cleveland we always hit this Skyline. Consistent and so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've always heard of Skyline Chili and have seen cans of it in the grocery store but never had tasted it.  I am a big fan of chili dogs or even hot dogs in general so my visit to Skyline was destined to happen sooner or later.  I ordered 2 chili dogs with cheese and onion (how I like it) and I really enjoyed the flavor of the dog, softness of the bun, bite of the onion, and the cheesy goodness.  My only complaint, which happens to be the mainstay here, is the flavor of the chili.  Now it didn't make me sick and I ate every last drop of it, but my chili preference is more spice less sweet, which I assume is coming from the chocolate.  However, my wife loved hers and is always bugging me to go back, which I probably will at some point.  This place is a lot bigger then it looks.  Overall 4 stars based on food quality / taste, options regarding other dog joints around town, speed / accuracy of order, and cleanliness of restaurant.  I'm not sure what it would take to give a hot dog joint 5 stars but I think it would have something to do with stripper poles and a stack of ones.  DISCLAIMER: I don't care too much for sweets.  I think I overdosed as a kid and completely blame my mother for purchasing a solid, dark chocolate bunny, weighing over 2 pounds, for Easter when I was 7ish.  I used to eat this darn thing until I got headaches.  I think it took me 6 months to finish.  So to this very day, anything that has a sweet taste to it, I really try to avoid cause it still gives me headaches."}
{"text":"When we realized this Cincinnati staple was available in the Cleveland area we were beyond excited! And this location did not disappoint. The staff was very friendly and the chili was just as we remembered -- good ol' comfort food.   DO say yes to the crackers and DON'T attempt to swirl the spaghetti around your fork. ;)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan at all! My husband likes it, so I'll give it 3 stars, but my girls and myself didn't. The chili has an odd taste to it. Fries were way overdone,. Disappointing since I love chili dogs. Staff is very friendly though!"}
{"text":"Skyline has been in my gene pool since I was a wee thing. My mom was the opening manager at this location when I was 1 so I litterally grew up on this stuff. So yes, I'm partial to this skyline. My dad was the first customer ever so his signed dollar hangs on the wall (true story).  Skyline chili is really an acquired taste, but you need to give it a chance(I love it). And if you don't like it, give it another chance or else I'll judge you.   The coneys are one of a kind but I always get a four way which is chili over spaghetti with beans. The interior has declined over the years but when I went for lunch last week it was spotless. Also, the workers were so fast it blew my mind. I could watch them make amazing chili creations all day. Oh and I forgot to mention they had diet dr pepper as one of their fountain drinks!  Minus one star because the new owners took my dads framed dollars off the wall... And I'm obviously still salty about it."}
{"text":"Chili here tastes very unique and in a good way! I would definitely come back :) I ordered two cheese coneys (each coney is fairly small), a side of regular fries, and funnel cake fries. All were delicious."}
{"text":"A Cincinnati establishment making moves in NEO?? Only for the hardcore Nati fans (and those that crave distinct chili over hot dogs and spaghetti noodles). Not quite the layout of a typical Skyline in Cincinnati, but you know from the moment you walk in to this location where you are. Get ready for whatever your order (cheese coney with no onions, four way with beans) to be loaded with my favorite part, the bright yellow cheese!!! Probably based off the nostalgia of my college days at X, Skyline is one of those experiences that after the first few bites, it's a trip down memory lane. After that, it's all dependent on how your body will react at that moment! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like the coneys but why in the world are they so small? I do not remember them being the size that they are now. The hot dogs are literally half the size of a regular hot dog. I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a regular size dog. Weird...  Staff is great though and they are quick."}
{"text":"As a former Cincinnattian, I'm always overjoyed to discover a Skyline Chili in my travels. Enjoyed a 3-way and a couple of cheese coneys at this location, with the friendliest of service. If only Skyline would expand their geography and open some locations in the southeast!"}
{"text":"Skyline Chili is for people who don't know what chili is and have recently been paroled because this stuff is straight up slop. It is a liquid concoction of gelatinous groundbeef sans any actual chili beans that smells like someone pooped out cinnamon. It's a big giant no, never again for me. Ohio has a lot of issues and this chili is the top of the list."}
{"text":"A+ for taste! --- I have been daydreaming about this place (as well as Bishop's Chili near Chicago) ever since both were profiled on the Food Network.  I'm glad the Food Network steered me in the right direction.  Ambience (at this Brooklyn, OH location): cafeteria style.  Food: 1) Chili: think of it as more of a sauce than a chunky stew. But, You do get free samples, and once I had a taste, I was HOOKED. It was a very complex medley of flavors, somewhat reminiscent of Indian spices.  2) We got a small order of chili \"5 way\" (a bed of pasta, topped with this heavenly chili sauce, accompanied by freshly-grated cheese, chopped onions, and kidney beans.) I caught myself trying to sop up the chili with the complimentary oyster crackers.  3) We also got a coney dog (Basically a chili cheese dog with a bit of spicy mustard). This was also a hit, and the mustard added complexity to the order.   They do sell the chili in 4-pack cans. I just wish they sell locations (ie, franchise) to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Expectation Management 101:  If you have expectations about anything in life, it's vital to examine them to prevent being let down. Take this classic use case:  When in Ohio, I know I can get 5-Way Chili, and I know what to expect. It's a small clump of overcooked spaghetti, topped with sub-par chili, cheese, beans, and onions. Each ingredient is meh at best, and if you don't have any memories of eating this drunk, it's doubtful you'll find any redeeming qualities. BUT, I know all this, I know it's crap food for drunks at 2am, and that's why I love it.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/skyline-chili-cleveland-2?select=lrQYh_ieGfcoRnKTeDKn-g#lrQYh_ieGfcoRnKTeDKn-g  Nice simple slop. It's cheap and efficient and I wouldn't change a thing. The Coney dog itself is bland as all can be, but topped with their weird chili and huge pile of super mild shredded cheese, you can't go wrong.   So since my expectations were pretty darn low, it was easy to walk away from a place like this happy and content."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Older Skyline but was very clean and in my opinion so much better than the normal fast food places. Sit down service was great and fast. I never give 5 stars and this one was well deserved."}
{"text":"Skyline Chili, the Cincinnati staple, is a great place to stop for lunch and grab a Coney (or three) and a three-way pasta dish (spaghetti, cheese, and the famous Cincinnati Chili).  At first, you'll probably be grossed out by their style of chili, what with it being thin and generally looking like dog food.  But once you dig in, you'll be taken with this delectable delicacy and want to come back for more.  Just to repeat, it's not what the average Clevelander thinks chili is, it's Greek-style Cincinnati chili made with a hint of chocolate and cinnamon.  Keep an open mind and you'll be sure to enjoy Skyline."}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure of Cleveland!  I went their with my friends one time and we were so WOW'd by this place. I mean, literally, it was so good. We had coneys, ways, fries, funnel cake,  possibly everything available on the menu and I have to say that you wont go wrong choosing any of them. We also went for the \"hot\" option and that really added another layer of flavor on this already-so-good chilli dish. The coneys are kinda small, so be prepared to order more. Their stuff is also very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Hometown favorite from Cincinnati. Living in NY now and had a craving. Hospitable team but quite slow to greet. Better service the other day; but it is \"quick casual\". Overall ok. Would come back"}
{"text":"Love Skyline Chili - whenever we roll through Ohio I search for the nearest location to get my fix.  I usually get the 4-way with onions but sometimes I opt for the Coney dogs - tasty.  I actually have bought the canned version of their chili mix to span the infrequent visits, though it is not the same.  I just cannot get the fluffy cheese right.    My digestive track can no longer tolerate two visits in the same weekend but I wish I could..."}
{"text":"I'm not always in the mood for Skyline Chili, but when I am, it is literally the only thing that will do.   I love both the original and the meatless five ways, and the tiny little hot dogs are sooooooooooo delicious. I don't want to love them, but I can't help it!  But the most important thing to point out is that in the years I've been going to this location, I leave every single time commenting to whoever I'm with that the people who work there are the NICEST PEOPLE EVER!!! Seriously! Don't they ever have bad moods???  Tip for the lactose-impaired, like me: if you don't need the entire mountain of cheese, get the chili spaghetti, which is a little bit cheaper, and then siphon a little from your dining companion to sprinkle on yours, assuming he or she isn't a greedy gus about their cheese."}
{"text":"On my Culinary food tour of Cleveland, I found out about this place on Tony's show and also UnWrapped. This place is very local and very no frills place. The menu revolves around Chilli and hotdogs. This place doesn't have table service like the others. So you pretty much order at the counter and eat at a open table.  I got 1 Cheesy Coney and a small 5 way. The coney is a chili dog covered in cheese and the 5way is spaghetti with the chili sauce, beans, onions and cheese,  I really liked both items. The chili spaghetti reminded me of chili back home from Hawaii from Zippys. I kinda of wished I got a bigger order, but I know we were going to Jack Frost donuts after for desert so I did not want to get full at Skyline chili.  Their chili is not what you think chili is. Its a difference type of sauce which is more meaty is what i can describe it.  I will also say that the staff there when I went was really friendly and even gave us a small sample of the chili and after that we already knew we were going to love it.  I will actually go out of my way to come to this location when I'm back in Cleveland because of how nice the staff was."}
{"text":"Classic Skyline Chili. Unlike most stores, this one is walk through the serving line, pay and sit down. Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"Well I'm from Cincinnati and I stay in Stow for business once a month.  While I'm here this fills my Cincy Chili craving...Always pretty consistent.  As everyone says you'll either love it or hate it.  That's true with all of the Cincinnati Chili."}
{"text":"Great service, horrible product.  What is this mess?  They have 100 tables and two people are eating in there.  The hot dogs are like Vienna sausages.  What's with all the flavorless cheese?  It saddens me."}
{"text":"Such a unique taste. Chili bowl with spaghetti is a must but you cannot forget the hot sauce. It will light you on fire. Great for a rainy day treats."}
{"text":"Continuing on my HRC quest, I was driving through Cleveland and went to Skyline based on watching a show on the Travel Channel.  The coney dogs were really tasty (bite sized) and the service was quick.  The staff were cool to talk with and very hospitable, as we arrived minutes before they closed for the evening!  I really enjoyed my experience here and would come back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place/taste might not be for everyone, but the staff are friendly and it's true Skyline.  I personally love it and was glad to find one so close.  It's a regular in my restaurant rotation.  Wednesday nights they have activities for kids and families, normally a craft or something like that for the season, check it out!"}
{"text":"Always friendly. The seasoned meat sauce is the best. Get your \"chili\" 3-, 4-, or 5-way. That means spaghetti with beans and/or onions, meat sauce and cheese. The chili dogs are delicious. Good Greek salads. Lots more. Sit at the counter, a table or booth. Buy the sauce and a souvenir to take home."}
{"text":"Skyline is always a winner for lunch and dinner. Some stores have counter ordering. Some have waitresses. I prefer a waitress. The chili is served on spaghetti with a pile of shredded cheese. Oh, so good!  The best part is the oyster crackers you can munch on. If you want you can purchase cans of the meat sauce, which we do and take on a vacation, or give as a gift."}
{"text":"If you want Skyline, you can get Skyline here!  3 way.  4 way.  You know what you want, just order it.  So what about this SkyLine?  It's okay.  We come by in the evenings and it's almost as if they set out to appear closed?  The blinds are drawn (at night), the light in the front is off, the darkened glass...it all makes it look unappealing.  Inside, there is usually a pleasant worker or two who ask how your day is going and the like.  I don't know if it's me, but it always seems to take longer than I'd expect to dish out some pasta and chili.  Is it wrong to wait impatiently when nothing needs cooked?"}
{"text":"I love their food!!!!!  Skyline Chili is the Best!  I come from Arizona just to enjoy their food!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Skyline Chili for some time now and I have to say that I wasn't too impressed. You would think being a chili restaurant that the chili would be phenomenal, instead it was just average. I ordered the regular sized 5 Way Chili which comes on top of steamed spaghetti noodles with onions and cheese, but I upgraded to habanero cheese which was pretty delicious.  The first thing I noticed about the chili was the scent of cinnamon, it wasn't super overbearing but it was noticeable enough. I meat that they used is finely chopped up which makes for a consistent taste, although they didn't use any special ingredients to make the chili taste unique, just average. Plus, it felt like there was more noodles than chili, not the best ratio.   Would I go back? Probably, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go here. I actually prefer Wendy's chili over this place."}
{"text":"So, I have a confession to make. And, yes, people on yelp are the first ones to know about this. I have a guilty pleasure, and it's going to eat at Skyline. I never take anyone with me - probably because I know how bad what I'm eating is for me, and I never tell anyone that I went after I've gone. The only people who know are me... and the employees... who - no matter how much time goes by between visits - are so friendly and talkative that they seem to remember me!! Now that I've gotten that off my chest.........  First and foremost, I've never tried the actual Chili, but everyone I've gone to Cinci locations with has loved it - people who I've talked to who have said they don't like it is usually because they use chocolate / cinnamon in their chili and they don't care of that.  But, I've been frequenting skyline for years now. My best friend is from northern kentucky, so going to visit him years ago usually meant at least one trip to Skyline. I used to always get beans and rice with heaping amounts of cheese on top and cheese fries. That was until I moved to Cleveland 2 years ago and discovered that I had my very own Skyline on ridge road!! Every time I go, I get a chili cheese sandwich with beans and a three-way with beans (spaghetti, chili or beans, and cheese). Their oyster crackers and hot sauce are AWESOME.   Like I mentioned earlier, the employees are freakin awesome! Legit. Hilarious, friendly, and fun to talk to.  I love me some skyline."}
