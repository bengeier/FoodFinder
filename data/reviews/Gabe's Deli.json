{"text":"Just ate HALF of my tower city, filling and delicious. I have been here once before and it has been too long since. Better taste and value than Cleveland Pickle. I'm not hating, just giving a point of reference. The value part is not subjective."}
{"text":"Small but quaint. Delicious bagel and sandwich concoctions. Lovely spacious patio. Not a ton of drink options. Good for a quick breakfast or lunch - and quiet enough for a meeting or interview spot."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches....not so much the service.  If you don't plan at least 24 hrs in advance for a larger order than one sandwich, they will yell at you for making them run out of bread.  Apparently they only plan for so many sandwiches a day.....I say poor planning on your part shouldn't keep me from my sandwich! Love the sandwiches, just not the service."}
{"text":"Gabes is my favorite sandwich place in Cleveland!  Classic deli sandwiches with top notch ingredients and craftsmanship. Owners are the best! I live in the neighborhood and go at least once a week. Murray Hill is the best Italian style sub in the area.  
Market at the Fig sandwiches are the only equal I have for Gabes, but Fig sandwiches are more gourmet than \"deli\"   Check out Gabes Deli!"}
{"text":"WHAT A GEM!

I really don't know where to start. I've already been here a few time and can't decide what my favorite thing is or what I wanna try next. 

Sandwiches are HUGE, well proportioned & underpriced. The meats and cheeses are top quality, the lettuce and tomato is so fresh, the bread is soft and they are built with love. 

Soups are amazing! Fresh ingredients and perfectly balanced. I've already tried 4 different varieties, lol. 
Southwest corn chowder
French onion
Red wine mushroom
Zucchini parmesan
(Some photos included)

Best tip is to follow them on FB to catch their daily specials, including sandwiches and housemade soups, pasta salads and potato salads. Gabe is a legitimate chef and quite a nice host."}
{"text":"The food at Gabes is amazing! It is a great little sandwich shop located right on Clifton rd. The sandwiches are fresh and huge! Make sure you say yes to the wonderful homemade pickles too! The sandwiches are named for things in Cleveland which is cool! Only reason I can not give the fifth star is silly but true. The hipsters who work here are kinda pretentious. It is not a very friendly environment and seems as though it is a huge pain for these people to serve you! But the food is off the charts so I deal with the service! Deal with the hipsters the sandwiches are so worth it!"}
{"text":"A great sandwich place is hard to find. I loved Moca, but this place is fantastic.  I came here for quick lunch and it didn't disappoint. An amazing sandwich, Voodoo chips (soo good) and soda for very reasonable prices. 

I'm looking forward to summer when I will be in the area more for lunch.  A place like this in your neighborhood.... You can't help but want to be a regular."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the dude is a major dick. I think he's the owner. He acts like he's being bothered when you order or ask a question. Customer service is more than half of the experience and Gades is horrendous. If you dont like Cleveland Noone is holding a gun to your head."}
{"text":"Want a huge sandwich that is filled with flavor? Then you need to go to Gabe's! My favorite sandwich is the Tower City. It's bacon, turkey, and white cheddar and this thing is huge so I always have left overs. The staff is always a delight and even though they only sell a small amount of sandwiches it always seems like they get better everyday."}
{"text":"So glad Gabes opened up in the neighborhood. Bomb ass sandwiches. 8-10 bucks each but well worth it. The $10 buck ones are good for 2 meals tho. Favorite sandwich so far is the Tower nothing crazy just a solid sandwich think club on steroids. 

Accidentally showed up at 5:58 when they were closing at 6:00 (didn't know they closed at 6!at the time). And the owner whipped me up my sandwich without a second thought and no one likes the guy who shows up at 5:58!! 

Check it out worth your time and money!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because I like a good tasting sub. I hate supporting corporations as well. So a nice sub shop is a cool addition but I wasn't happy. I got the wild thing. It was literally all bread. Had a little bit of horse radish sauce. It literally had a slice of each meat very thin slices and one piece of bacon. And the rest was cheese. I was disappointed. Especially because I spent $11 dollars on this sub!! Very expensive for what I got. I had two other friends try mine and they all said the same thing. They also were out of a lot of things when I was there. In today's economy I feel like you need to do something unique to stand out especially when your around many other sub shops. I was hoping they had some hot subs as well."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich spot! Gabe's is a must try if you like huge sandwiches, generous portions, and quality ingredients. Enough sandwich to fill you up and snack on later. I ordered the Wild Thing. I recommend the sandwich if you like crispy bacon, turkey, ham, roast beef, and salami. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out because of all the great reviews other Yelpers have given this restaurant. 

I stopped by for lunch and I was greeted right away and was shown the menu as well as the board of specials. I opted for The Wilsher which is Turkey, Havarti, Mayo and LTO on Ciabatta. My eyes went wide when I saw how huge the sandwich was when he went to bag it up. Some people might complain about the prices but you definitely get your moneys worth with the size of all the sandwiches. No skimpy portions here! 

I can't wait to come back to try another sandwich and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"I came into Gabe's for lunch because the sandwiches sounded intriguing and yummy and I was right! I got the American Splendor and it was very tasty and fresh. I also got their soup of the day which I believe was zucchini parmesan and it was pretty good. I definitely want to try some of their other sandwiches but maybe a different soup. Just wasn't my jam. Place is super cute and clean. Super nice people too."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches.  \"The Tremont\" so far has been my favorite with its giant slices of brie. The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Moving someone makes for sore muscles and hungry bellies so my daughter decided to treat her mom to lunch after packing boxes. She gave me three different restaurant choices, but decided on Gabe's since neither of us had been to a good deli for awhile. When we first arrived I noticed that the place was empty. Hard to believe after eating there. Probably because it was after the lunch hour on a weekday. Anyways my daughter and I were greeted by two very nice people. One was Gabe and I didn't get his assistants name, which is my bad, but she was great. They were very helpful with their a amazing menu and two people that are horrible at making food decisions. I mean seriously when your faced with one delicious choice after another how the heck do you pick? We finally decided on Tower City and the Deerhunter. We figured that we would swap halves and get to try two sandwiches. Win win! Let me tell you Gabe does not disappoint . Each sandwich was amazing. Heaven between two slices of bread. The Deerhunter had the most tender roast beef and the cheddar and horseradish sauce made an epic sandwich. I'm drooling just thinking about it! The Tower City was a club sandwich times 10!! I loved it so much that I ordered one to go for my husband. I figured he would would be wondering how I got the stars my eyes. He loved it. I will be making another trip out to Gabes's again very soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Gabes! I eat here at least once a week. You get so much food for $10 it's insane. It's always fresh and always good. The owners are also very friendly and make you feel welcome every time you're in there. The tower city sandwich and strangers in paradise are my favorite."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are on par with Gourmand's Deli in Valley View or Lehman's Deli in Westlake. Fresh baked bread, quality meats and cheeses. Enough sandwich to split or save some for later."}
{"text":"Stumbled on Gabe's. We're told right when we walked in that it's going to be a 30 min wait for sandwiches. We weren't in a hurry so we stayed. 

We all chose the half sandwich and chips or salad and a Drink. The half a sandwich was huge. Awesome. We all got different sandwiches. I got the potato salad. It was good. But in a tiny little container. My friends chose the chips and they got a huge bag. Who knew...???? Next time ok now. 

Everyone loved their sandwich. Bread was good, and the deli meat was really good too. Good size portion. It was $10 for the combo meal. They definitely look to give you your money's worth. 

One of the people in my party asked for some extra bacon they could pay for. We were told they have a definite bacon and bread count. They would tell us if we could buy some extra bacon. No one came back to tell us. So guess they had a low count and could not spare. 

Overall I enjoyed my meal. The girl who waited on us was a bit abrupt not mean just stern and matter of fact. Maybe kinda hurried bcuz they were busy. 

I'd give them another try."}
{"text":"Decided to try Gabe's out after seeing good reviews on Yelp.  Upon inspecting the menu, I was torn between several and asked the woman working the counter  what she recommended. She told me that the Tower City is their most popular sandwich, so Tower City is was. Reading the ingredients, it's basically just a club sandwich, so my expectations weren't super high, but the first bite literally made me say Oh My God.  It was, without doubt, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm not sure if they bake the bread in house, but the sourdough was perfect. It was obvious that the meats and cheeses were high quality and the mayo (which I usually HATE, but left it on after another reviewer said it was good) was fantastic. had to have been freshly made. 

At $10, it's not the cheapest sandwich you can find, but it's so enormous, I can't picture anyone being able to eat the whole thing in one sitting. I seriously almost went back the next day to try something else on the menu. I didn't, but I can guarantee I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite. Talk about a place founded on freshness.  They use quality fresh products."}
{"text":"I've had the bird town sandwich and the tower city sandwich so far. Both have been amazing and exceptional quality. The ingredients are nice and fresh. The tower city is my favorite out of the two. I thought it was pricy for a sandwich, but then you get it and see its big enough for two! I saved half for dinner later on and it still tasted as if it were just made. This place is good!"}
{"text":"I was hesitating when I ordered my $9 sandwich.  Some places charge large and serve small. Definitely not the case here. This thing was HUGE! It was definitely enough to share.  Great little place with a great product! Nicely done Gabe. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went with my boss out to lunch today and we decided to split the Lakewood. First off HUGE sandwich. Good prices, nice people basically the whole package. I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"I will admit my sandwich was good, but I did have to wait over 30 mins for a deli sandwich is just a little much. It seems like a couple runs the deli and were upset with each other because there were two orders prior to me. The compensation of me waiting 30 mins for my $9 sandwich was a free bag of chips."}
{"text":"This legendary sandwich shop is now closed. Owners are moving to Austin."}
{"text":"If you think you have tried the best sandwich you have ever had--you haven't. 

And you don't have to trust me on that. In fact, I urge you to test my theory and go to Gabe's yourself. Because these sandwiches made my face fall off--that's how good they are.

First, let me get this out of the way... Gabe is a sandwich god. Don't question it, just trust his taste combos and let yourself melt into Flavortown. And if you can help it, try not to take away ingredients or sub anything out. I doubt it would ruin these sammies, but still. Gabe knows what he's doing. 

Second, I feel like Cleveland has been missing a damn good deli for a while now and I couldn't be happier that it's Gabe's filling that void. 

My mother and I stopped in for a late lunch and found an empty restaurant. We stood in awe of the menu because every sandwich looked amazing. We settled on the Tower City (me) and The Deer Hunter (mom) and decided to swap halves to try them both. Tower City is like a deluxe club featuring toasted sourdough packed with turkey, ham, bacon, white cheddar, shredded lettuce and sliced tomato. The Deer Hunter is tender roast beef, cheddar, lettuce-tomato-onion and homemade horseradish sauce on a farm roll. 

The Tower City came out and I realized I was already staring wide-eyed, pondering how I was going to unhinge my jaw to eat this beautiful \"tower\" of goodness. Yes, the name is appropriate. If you're thinking a club sandwich is just a club sandwich... YOU ARE WRONG. I want to die eating this sandwich. It's perfect in every.single.way. And it's big enough for two meals. The Deer Hunter was just as delicious, and I'm really not an onion or mayo-based sauce kind of person. But the combo of these ingredients together made this one of the best things I've ever tasted. And that roast beef was some kind of tender perfection. When we managed to come up to breathe, my mom and I mumbled these things to each other: 

\"Jeezus... I just want to live in this sandwich.\"
\"I just can't stop eating it. It's so good I just can't stop...\" 
\"What this guy does here is magical. He makes magic sandwiches.\" 
\"I want this every day of my life.\" 

Oh, and they have Old City Soda. If you haven't tried this stuff, you're in for a great surprise of goodness. 

I can't wait to come back to try their brunch items, homemade, traditional deli sides and bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet. They had apparently already done most of their business earlier in the day and were even out of some items. Still, this offered me the opportunity to chat with the owners who seemed like pleasant enough people. 

I went with the Terminal Tower $10 which is your normal club sandwich just with some fancier sounding ingredients (kettle fried turkey, aged swiss). The size fully supported the price, and it was an A-Okay sandwich (good but nothing special), just a little dry in my opinion, could have used some more mayo. I got a side of their homemade clam chowder $4 to go with this. Again, A-okay tasting. Not a creamy thick soup, but had more of a broth like texture to it. 

There was also the American Splendor $9, this was a really tasty veggie sandwich and I would definitely get it again. Pasta salad and potato salad sides are $1.50, are in 4oz containers I think?, and are a nice way to round out your meal. Also great that they mix up their side offerings so one day it could be ranch potato salad and the next it could be creamy corn pasta salad (making this up, idk all their offerings, check their website). 

Depending on what you get if you want a sandwich, side, and drink you're looking at $11-$18 for a meal which seems a little high for a deli, but it is in line with all of the other unique sandwich shops in the Cleveland area (Herb n' Twine, Bogtrotters Doorstep, Cleveland Pickle. Although I'd say TJ's Butcher Block has less frills and is more affordable). Overall, not bad, I would check this place out again."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to live down the street from Gabes! Great food & great service, every time!
I usually end up getting the Tower City, eating half and having the other half for lunch the next day. Every sandwich is huge, and definitely worth the price.
If you get the chance, make sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Man... talk about something delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. I was so pleasantly surprised when I tasted the Zucchini Parmesan Soup! I was like Oh my goodness this is so good! lol. I had The Tower City sandwhich, which I was not expecting it to be three slices of bread... which was a little too much for so I took of a slice of bread and dove in... it was delicious! I also tried the Garlic Corn Alfredo Pasta Salad also yummy!  I decided to stay and sit on the patio to enjoy this beautiful day. It was a nice mini getaway from work."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about this place; I've even tasted the leftovers of a friend's sandwich (yum) so I figured there is no way I could be disappointed.

I'm sorry to say, I left disappointed. I ordered the Lakewood sandwich. It was a little wimpy. There was way too much bread for what was on the sandwich. For $9, I expected more. I ended up taking the top bun off just so I could taste the flavors more, which seemed to help.  Good, not great.

My boyfriend got the Wild Thing, which he really liked and thought was delicious.

I ordered the butternut squash soup. I love butternut squash, I've never encountered anything with it that I didn't like. This soup was flavorless and watery. It was supposed to come with sour cream, it did not (we got our order to go so I didn't realize until I got home). Adding pepper didn't even give it somewhat of a flavor.

For the hype and price, I expected A LOT more. I don't think I'll be going back for awhile."}
{"text":"Located on a corner. I parked right on the street next to it. 

Clean place and friendly folks.  

Lots of sandwich options.  Read the huge chalkboard menu then place your order at counter.  They have A few tables for dining in.

I got the special of the day which was called 'German Herman' I believe.   Black Forest ham/Munster cheese/spicy mustard/LTO on ciabatta.  Also got a Cajun deviled egg for $1. 

The deviled egg was perfect & delicious!   The sandwich was huge!  You definitely have to smash it to get a bite!  I'm pretty sure I'd spend more at the grocery store on the meat and cheese then I did on this whole sandwich!  And for me, the sandwich is two meals or good to share.   The bread is a little dry for my taste, but fine.  I tend to like a bread soft on inside yet a bit crusty on the outside on my sandwiches. Overall the sandwich was good tho! 

Looking forward to trying other sandwiches, their soups, pasta salad, potato salad...etc"}
{"text":"We often want a GOOD sandwich and sadly they are hard to come by.  Most places don't have quality ingredients but that isn't the case with Gabe's.  We stopped by for a quick lunch yesterday and we were pleasantly surprised with this place!  I had the Big Bird and my husband had the Tower City, we both had a side of the potato salad.  The bread was SO FRESH and everything was absolutely delicous.  My sandwich was turkey with fresh mozzarella and pesto on ciabatta - OH SO GOOD and the portions are huge.  I could only eat 1/2 of my sandwich but my hubby managed to chow down his entire beast of a sandwich that included turkey, ham, bacon, swiss, white cheddar and MLT (Mayo, lettuce & tomato) on wheat bread (you can get it on sourdough as well).  We will definately be back and we look forward to trying  the daily soups too!"}
{"text":"As someone else said, this place might be hard to find if you've never been here if they didn't have the bright signs in the fence. Not sure if these are new or not but I totally would have missed it without them.  

The inside is very sharp. Dark colors minimalistic and clean. Staff was friendly! Not overly chatty but extremely friendly and able to answer my questions (what's a voodoo chip?) 

The menu consists of 12 sandwiches all around $10 (except for the muffuletta which is $8, $15, or $25). They have a rotating selection of soup, pasta salad, potato salad, and deviled eggs.

You can do a combo meal of a half sandwich and soup, or half sandwich sides and a drink for $9 

I love their commitment to local and fresh ingredients. It's not your run of the mill cheap deli sandwich which I like. Also the old city soda was SO GOOD. I'm not really a soda drinker I don't know what possessed me to buy it but I'm glad I did. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The veggies were fresh, plentiful, and crispy, the soup was flavorful and hot, the bread was toothsome enough to stand up to the balsamic dressing (I got the Stranger in Paradise), the service was efficient and friendly and the price was fair.. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place - if you haven't been you are missing out, Cleveland! I have a daily craving for the sandwiches here and can't stop thinking about them. Everything on the menu is extremely flavorful. Highly recommend the American Splendor - one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. Can easily find parking on Clifton or W 105. Friendly staff too - glad to have a great business like this in the Edgewater area."}
{"text":"Been about a year now since I first came in. Wasn't wow'd the first time, but wanted to give it another shot even though it's a bit of a hike for me to get there.
That said, we had a much more enjoyable experience this time around.  We had a really delicious potato salad this time (deviled egg style), and for sandwiches we had a tower city and a Murray hill. The quality of all the ingredients was really high which I loved, so my criticisms are tied to the idea of enhancing that fact, and I hope will be taken in that spirit!  More than anything else what I felt lacking was seasoning. I really wanted something to bring out the depth of flavor not only in the meat but also in those wonderfully thick slices of fresh mozzarella. There was table salt and pepper available, but I would truly have loved fresh cracked pepper and sea salt put right on the sandwich for me. My girlfriend said much the same before I even voiced the thought.  I'll admit my personal love affair with maldon goes deep, but I really do think it would be a tremendous enhancement.  On a somewhat more subjective note, I would have loved some garlic in that vinagrette, but maybe that's just me!  
My other note is this: I found the bread to be very distracting on both our meals. I know that sounds silly, yes it's a sandwich, but when I have a giant stack of prosciutto and mozzarella in front of me, I want to taste them! I really felt like the size and density of the ciabatta hid the flavor too much. We actually tore out the middle piece from her club and I ate my second half on that, open faced, and it made a huge difference. I do realize it wouldn't be prudent put that sandwich on sliced bread, but maybe it's worth looking at some other options (different ciabatta provider? Nice crusty baguette?). 
Regardless, I'm glad I came back, and appreciated you popping out to check on us too. Hoping to give you that 5th star the next time around Gabe!"}
{"text":"Hello, fellow Yelpers! As a fan of big deli sandwiches, and a resident of Lakewood, and being in need of lunch, I decided I had to try this place. I'm happy to report that I'm super glad I did! Now, on to the details...

First, the good: contrary to what I've read on here, I didn't feel at all unwelcome by the guys working there. We discussed a vintage photo on downtown Cleveland on their wall as my sandwich was being made. Speed of service wasn't an issue, as I was the only customer (it was 1:10 on a Wednesday). It took a few minutes, which is about perfect. Any longer would be annoying, any shorter would indicate much of the sandwich is prepared ahead of time.

I decided on the Birdtown, since I am both Italian and reside in Birdtown. (Creative choice, right??) The Birdtown is basically a caprese sandwich with turkey added: it's roast turkey, thick-sliced fresh mozzarella, thinnish-cut tomato, and a generous double spread of basil pesto on fresh cut ciabatta. It's simple and delicious. Portions are stout, but not impossible for a hearty lunch. (Well, maybe for our trusty Lego construction worker there.) The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and just the right thickness to play nicely with the other ingredients. I'm a fan of pesto, and this one does not disappoint. Again, there's just the right amount there to integrate and not dominate. The use of fresh mozzarella - especially in 1/4\"-thick slices - is superb. Being less salty than its low-moisture brethren, the flavor is milder and therefore needs more of it to stand up to the other ingredients. While I usually look for more meat in my sandwiches, I have to admit there's just enough turkey here to anchor the recipe without overpowering the rest of the flavors. To add more would imbalance the sandwich - which brings me to my sole small gripe: the ciabatta.

The bread itself is wonderful: crusty, mildly sour, reasonably sized, solid in the hand, and yet still gives a satisfying and not overly laborious chew. The issue here is quantity. I feel like if the middle third of this mini loaf had been removed, the resulting halves would be perfect. As it is, the bread blunts the flavor of the ingredients a bit too much. It's like being at a concert where the bass guitar is too hot in the mix: while it sounds good, it drowns out the other instruments somewhat. I found myself straining for a guitar solo of turkey and pesto and got the low rumble of ciabatta instead.

Oh! Almost forgot to mention the pickle. What a cute lil gherkin - and tasty, too! It was fun getting that instead of the usual dill spear. A great accompaniment to a great sandwich.

One last note: you need to know *exactly* where this place is before you go. There is almost no outdoor signage. Thankfully, the address is clearly printed on the awning.

To summarize, this is a solid sandwich shop whose fare justifies its price. Definitely worth a visit - on a regular basis!

UPDATE 6/16/16:

Went back yesterday and brought my father. He got the Lakewood and I got the Tower City. Both sandwiches were delicious! The Lakewood features a balsamic glaze, which my father described as \"slightly sweet... maybe a little too sweet.\" Otherwise he felt the sandwich was well worth the price - and this is coming from a man notorious for his simple tastes and frugality!

The Tower City is monstrously large club sandwich. Much like my Birdtown from a week ago, all of the ingredients are fairly simply, yet clearly above average in quality. The bread is hearty and has a perfectly compliant crust: plenty of texture without sawing at the corners of your mouth like sourdough or traditional Italian bread often does. It also held up throughout the meal, which is a testament given everything it was tasked with containing! The bacon was thick-cut and flavorful without relying purely on salt flavor, the turkey and ham were excellent and sliced very thin, and again, the tomato could not have been executed any better. Currently one of the priciest sandwiches on their menu, but quality and quantity make this sandwich a value."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now for lunch on the weekends and this place never disappoints.  The sandwichs are great, staff is friendly and I am starting to think it maybe be a top 5 sandwich shop in all of cleveland...

My favorites are the Ohio Bella & the Murray Hill."}
{"text":"I had driven by this place so many times cruising down Clifton, when I found myself in the neighborhood looking for a lunch spot, I decided to check Gabe's out.

They were slow, but it was a weekday afternoon a little after the usual lunch hour. No waiting for me! I was very impressed by the menu. There was quite a bit to choose from, but not so much as to be overwhelming. I really like how fresh everything was and that they get all their bread locally.

I did the half sandwich and soup combo. Both of the soups they had were new to me, but I tried the zucchini parmesan, a take on broccoli cheddar I assume. It was delicious! For the sandwich I got the Birdtown which was also darn tasty. 

You might be turned off by the prices in comparison to say a Jimmy John's or some place that offers 5 dollar footlongs, but you definitely get your money's worth. Not only is the food better, but the portions are generous. My boyfriend had me grab him a sandwich (the Deer Hunter) to bring back and he could only eat half of it.

I definitely would recommend Gabe's if you're looking for some deliciousness between two slices of bread."}
{"text":"I was sad to see moca go. It was a nice spot. But now here comes Gabe, the  sandwich God. Lol well almost. Stopped in blindly. Not knowing what to expect. Simple menu and straight forward. I wasn't overwhelmed with menu selections, 9 core selections plus a daily. And each sandwich was its own entity. I hate when two menu items differ by one ingredient. They also offer soups which I didn't notice until I was on my way out. That menu is on the opposing wall. 

Walked in and was immediately greeted by Everyone. Gabe was kind enough to give his recommendation. I settled with the \"Murray Hill\" and a side of pasta salad with a pickle and a water. My total was $12. I paid, loaded up my arms and found a seat.  

This sandwich is Huge! Thick bread. Cheese is sliced 1/2 inch think. Proper amount of meat. For the ratio. With some applied pressure I was able to get a whole bite and it was very tasty. Dressing wasn't overwhelming everything worked. The thick cut mozzarella was so delicately decadent. 
Furthermore I'm not normally one to take food home. But this thing was too big I was full after only half.....so maybe a half size option in the future(wink wink)??? Sometimes two meals are better than one. And I'll be happy with a second meal with a sandwich of this caliber. 

I was expecting the usual with the pasta salad. Oil vinegar Good seasons etc. but low and behold they have crafted a parmesan dressing tossed with artichokes. To be honest I could have made a meal of this alone. I slammed it before I was able to dive in to the main event. 

All in all, the price was on point. I definitely got my money's worth of food. Especially since I can make two meals out of it. I'll be back. 

*Have to buy water."}
{"text":"This place is everything I've ever wanted in a sandwich shop and more.  Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a huge fan of delis and sandwich shops in general... They usually have that weird smell and they either half ass everything (cheap ingredients thrown together)  or overdo it with what I consider unnecessary ingredients.  I'm a traditionalist; give me sandwich with just a handful of good quality ingredients,  and I'm a happy camper.  This place does exactly that.  No frills sandwiches,  generous portions and carefully crafted. 
The space is beautiful,  light and full of open space inside with plenty of seating and a nice big chalkboard menu so you don't have to lean over the guy in front of you to see what they have.  Service was good,  I didn't feel rushed and they were helpful in answering questions and making recommendations. They will also bring your sandwich out to you if you order in. 
The price cannot be beat, around $10 but this sandwich is enormous,  not quite up to the size of Slyman's,  but pretty close.  What I especially appreciate is that their sandwiches are carefully stacked in nicely packed layers so you get a perfect bite every time. For myself,  I could only finish half of the sandwich... And I consider myself to have a pretty good appetite if that helps give you perspective. 
What really sets this place apart is the ingredients.  Everything from the high quality meat and cheese,  to the fresh veggies,  to the bread... Oh the bread! It's all just perfection.  They also have some nice sides to choose from,  Old City Sodas and homemade potato salad and pasta salad.  White people salads aren't really my thing,  but from what I can tell they switch up the different kinds of salads which is a nice touch. 

This place definitely exceeded my expectations and can't wait to try more. 
I'll be back Gabe's Deli... Soon."}
