{"text":"Oh my goodness by far the best calamari salad I have ever had! The dressing was lite yet not to the point where I couldn't taste it! Yummy! I would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"Absolute perfection ! The dinners were art at it's finest. Swine schnitzel like you were in germany, and the deserts too !  Lots of options, with natural meats and plenty for the vegetarian as well."}
{"text":"We enjoyed yesterday's evening meal at the Tonto Bar and Grill so much that I am writing this review this morning.  Our wait staff and servers-Jennifer and Katie Rose-were friendly and professional, and the arrival of everything from water to dessert and coffee was perfect.

So was the food.  We enjoyed our choices so much that I would happily order everything again:  corn chowder and harvest salad, sandals and walleye, and a to live for (!) chocolate cake served with coconut sorbet.

Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  We were told that the restaurant sources local grown and organic ingredients, which is to our liking as we mostly eat only organic at home.  

Our meals were as tasty and satisfying as our experience was romantic and blissful.  We look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, as is the service. Tonto Bar NEVER disappoints. Go."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with a friend, great food Penna pasta with tenderloin tips. WOW, really good, the chicken corn chowder is out of this world!! Great service to boot!! I have been going here for 10 years and have never had bad service, you will have a great time with excellent food!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always been happy with the food and service.  We have happily spent many a special occasion here.  We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Met some friends here. Ate on the outside back covered patio. They had heaters and it was wonderful! Not too hot or cold. Started with an arugula salad. It was ok. I think it could have had a bit more flavor. Then had the special which was bacon wrapped scallops with risotto and asparagus. Scallops melted in my mouth. The bacon was a bit fatty but the scallops were cooked perfectly. The risotto and asparagus was wonderful as well. Drank a cosmo and skipped dessert. We had good service. One of the other couples come here a lot and say it is always good food and service and our experience was the same. Make sure you have a reservation especially if you want to eat outside."}
{"text":"3 stars mainly for the entrees. 

The bar service was lacking and the wrong vintage of wine was served to us that was far less in substance but not in price than what was on the wine list.  The manager seemed apologetic but offered no discount. We left 1/2 the bottle sitting on the table. :(

The entire meal was saved by the entrees. The root beer braised beef short ribs were superb in taste and tenderness. The ancho rubbed beef fillet was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stopped by for drinks and appetizers in the afternoon . What  a beautiful setting on patio looking out  towards golf course and mountains  . This place is first rate inside and out , will be back for dinner next trip"}
{"text":"The location is stunning but the rest...EH!
This is the 3rd visit in three weeks.. two lunches and one dinner. My biggest disappointment is the staff. The first time we had a lovely waitress but the other two times, the wait staff was surly and prickly. It's as if none like their job. The bussers brusquely took the plates complaining that they were heavy. One fellow collected the silverware  clanging it on the collection of plates. There were other issues that make me unwilling to go back. 
The ladies restroom is tight, nasty and hard to get the towel dispenser to work. 
I love the varied menu. Tonto Grill has a lovely patio with heaters and umbrellas; it has the potential to be a five star."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going here since i moved to the valley and have never ever been even remotley close to disappointed! every single thing i have had here has been delcious. i usually start with the ahi temura roll then i move onto soup, i love a good corn chowder and tonto has some of the best, slightly smokey and nice and chunky, i have tried almost everything on the menu and usually notice when they add something new (such as the butternut squash soup) excellent! my favorite entree item so far has been the chilean sea bass which just melted in my mouth. I think it was a featured item though because i have not seen it since. service is always good and the atmosphere is excellent, i recogmend a nice sun set dinner on the patio."}
{"text":"Our little family went here for lunch on a Sunday. We go there before the lunch crowd and we were totally digging the scenery. We sat in the closed in patio over looking the golf course. My husband has played the course a few times which started a conversation about moving to a golf course. That's another story...

We went hoping for a brunch, but all the items on the menu (even weekends) are lunch/dinner items. However, the special for the day was bananas foster waffles. We both go that and, oh my goodness, was it good!!!  I didn't eat again until late that night and it put us both in a food coma. The orange syurp was amazing and everything went so well together! 

The downfall was our mimosas were about the same price as our entrees, so our total bill was $60 for breakfast. However, I do get to go back in a couple of weeks for a reception with some fellow alumni, so I am happy to know I will be trying other foods there also!"}
{"text":"I've now given Tonto Grill 2 opportunites to wow me but they can't seem to get it right. First visit I had the walleye fish. The fish was dry, under seasoned and overcooked. The best part of the meal were the carrots and potatoes. Second trip was last night and they missed the mark again. I got the short ribs which were fine but didn't blow me away. They were stringy and more fat than meat. As for the service...I got the excellent arugula salad as an appetizer but unfortunately didn't get to finish it because the server thought she should throw all the food at us at once, rather than pay attention to whether we were finished with appetizers before sending entrees. Since there were space limitations on the table, I had to give up the delicious salad or deal with a cold entree because the beef, potatoes and green beans were already barely lukewarm. I have been disappointed twice now and won't go back. There are too many other restaurants that get it right to waste my time or money here. A BIG disappointment!"}
{"text":"To celebrate our anniversary and my aunt's 82nd birthday we decided to go to Tonto. My aunt made a 5pm reservation for the outdoor patio. She and my uncle arrived on time and were seated at a table they did not like. Since there were many vacant seats closer to the golf course they asked to be moved. At that time they were told that those tables were reserved. My husband and I arrived a few minutes later and he spoke to the host. Eventually they allowed us to move but let's just say the whole ordeal was quite embarrassing and I am shocked that elderly people would be treated that way for no reason. The place did fill up, however, there were always open tables in the desirable spots so I have no idea why they took such a hard stance in the beginning. I never quite got over it and for that reason alone I will not go back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch here sitting outside on the patio which overlooks the golf course.  I had a special of beef stroganoff made from short ribs and crimini mushrooms that was excellent.  The house made bread was good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is an old standard of Cave Creek. One of the places that seasonal visitors and locals look to for a special memorable dinner to enjoy the incredible beauty of AZ...Save it for later people....absolutely terrible. 
My Eighty year old parents and myself were driven out by rude, un-accommodating staff that basically just don't understand respect. Food is incredibly overpriced and mediocre with impersonal run through wait staff that attacked us for leaving. On the way out the other foursome that left bonded with us to go enjoy dinner somewhere down the trail. So that was good. 
Overall, What a shame. Tonto should be great. So sad. Don't waste your money and dignity."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a pleasant lunch here with my carefree grandparents-in-law who recommended Tonto as a delicious place. When we first entered the I thought it might be full of retirees and rich Arizonians but I was pleasantly surprised to find a crowd of all sorts enjoying lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking a pretty view of the golf course and elegant Saguaros. Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. 

Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) 
I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. 

My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view. 

Worth a visit, whether you're a local foodie or traveler."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent dinner here the other night - we had great service on a very busy night (the Final Four games were on), too.

My meal:
Three Sisters salsa trio: nice way to start a meal for a group. Three different salsas (two red, one green) with homemade tortilla chips and fry bread. 

Barbeque glazed salmon over squash/sweet potato hash and a tamarind sauce: I haven't had a salmon dish this good/unique in a long time. Highly recommended.

And, the obligatory margarita (known as a \"Tontorita\" here) - very good.

We sat inside, but the outdoor seating area looked great! Hoping to visit again someday soon to enjoy the outdoor setting in person."}
{"text":"Excellent food, worth the price, the menu has classics (your choices of burgers and mesquite-grilled meats) and some more imaginative dishes. A good choice (5+) of salad bases to combine with either of 5+ meat/fish small portions on top. The \"three sisters\" salsa and breads starter is a local favorite and worth a try. 

It does not get five stars for two main shortcomings
- Wine list: pretentious and overpriced (and the wine by the glass is more by the half glass)
- Service: we got our mains while we were hardly 1/2 way our shared starter. And we were not the only ones that evening nor in the list of review. I smell a trick to try and maximize table turnover. Management was sensitive to bitter complaining, though (free creme brulee which was far too heavy anyhow)"}
{"text":"Good place to get off the main street and away from the noise,great food also,take someone you like.....patrick"}
{"text":"This is my families favorite restaurant! We usually cook at home but when we go out we choose Tonto Bar and Grill.  We LOVE their grass fed hambergers.  Try it with a huge portobella mushroom and swiss!!! Sit outside and smell the fresh cut grass from the golf course too!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here last Friday night. My date said it was delicious.  She was right. The small dining  room was crowded for a Friday, especially right before the Balloon festival. Are server Mary Lousie was attentive and explained in detail the specials and the menue items. We choose to do the fresh Salmon with sphagetti squash and the Beef Tenderloin. Since we told her we wanted to share she split the meal for us without any charge. We have a small salad. The wines by the glass were limited but good. We choose the La Crema. Driving and wine tasting in AZ is not a good idea. The meal came promptly and boy was the encrusted salmon to die for.  The beef tenderloin was soft and at medium perfect.  The portions are large at the average price per entry of $22-35. You might be asking for a doggy bag for your spoiled pup.  Since it was a date set up by her daughter one of the hostesses the server must have known. He he.,  When we told her no room for desert she insisted.  Next came out a cold plate with a special box filled with two homemade truffles compliments of the chef.  Wow what a treat. Also it was nice touch to have the frozen writing on the plate tell us to enjoy this every.   This place will certainly be a highly recommendation for the special event when I am looking to splurge a little. Bravo to the staff and Chef."}
{"text":"I had a good meal here.  A couple of things to know:

- I read a review on here calling this place casual.  I wouldn't call it casual.  There were two of us who went after hiking and I felt a little uncomfortable wearing our hiking gear even at a late lunch around 3pm.

- We sat on the back patio and it was beautiful!  Great views!

- This place is not cheap.  It was over $60 for two of us for lunch.  We each had a salad and one glass of wine.

Beautiful views, good food.  Just want to make sure you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service were excellent. We initially requested a table in the sun but then changed our minds as it got quite hot quite fast. The staff graciously moved all of our drinks and appetizers to our new table without a fuss. 

The food was delicious - a little pricey but combined with the view, it was just right. The view is breathtaking. Beware of the margaritas. They are scrumptious and sneak up on you quite quickly!"}
{"text":"So I just wrote a very honest review of Cartwrights, which I HATE. This place I love. Odd considering they are owned by the same people.

Anyway, this is a really good place to eat. I recommend keeping it simple. The appetizers are great, can't go wrong with any of them. They claim the best burger in the valley and you know what? They may be right. It is fantastic. The shrimp tacos are also very very good.

If I had a criticism, it would be that some of the more complicated entrees are a little \"out there\" but there is enough great food on the appetizer and sandwich menu to have a great experience.

Furthermore, sit at the bar, thats where it's at. The bartenders are great and never fail to deliver great service and mix very good cocktails."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I understand they used to be good.
Employees had a very bad attitude and were not helpful. We had reservations but were stuck next to the kitchen doors. That was fun and very loud. Asked to be seated else where but denied, even though tables were empty for the entire time. 
Food was very poor for the expensive price. VERY POOR.  Very Expensive. Not a good value and extremely disappointing. WE had heard good comments, but they did not turn out.
They had kids as hostesses and wait staff on duty. It is not their fault, as they had not been trained. It is management and owners fault.
Tonto is a good example of a restaurant depending on their old rep. Has not been updated in years, old and tired looking.
Too bad."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for 8 years.  Service was just adequate at best.  Had to send my fish back several times as it was not cooked well as requested.  A highlight was always the delicious bread basket but now you have to request and there is a charge.  Disappointed...I am wondering if there has been a management change."}
{"text":"Everything is outstanding, the service, food and views. I highly recommend reservations during sunset to enjoy the awesome views to go with your delicious dinner"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere... a little pricey, but worth it if the weather is right and you can sit on the patio and watching the golfers play. Service was slightly slow today at lunch, but the experience was enjoyable as we were in no rush. The indoor seating was empty and I would hesistate to go here if I had to sit inside."}
{"text":"Had the BLT with sweet potato tots. My husband had the corn beef. Both were very good.

I would recommend this restaurant. Great view of the golf course. Have yet to play the course."}
{"text":"Im giving this place a 1-STAR because of the RACIST and UNPROFESSIONAL seaters/hostesses they currently have. I went there with a literally old friend of mine yesterday and did NOT find these two \"girls\" friendly and accommodating at all. They were shocked the moment I came in with this American friend of mine because Im an ASIAN and younger than the rest of the crowd. They were just staring at me for the longest time that made me feel \"UNWELCOME\" instead of helpinge and my friend. They might have even thought that I could not afford any of their meals. If they only knew how much a Nurse Practitioner (and soon to be a Nurse Anesthetist in Honor Health Thompson Peak) like I make, then they're gonna realize that I can order their most expensive meal and wine everyday. Their salary combined wont even amount to a fourth of what I make. Anyway, we went there because my friend wanted to reminisce because it was her and her husband's favourite restaurant.

So on our way out, they were still staring at me OFFENSIVELY. They could not help but just stare at me disgustingly (SPECIFICALLY THE BLONDE hostess). I dont think the management did a good job of picking the right people specifically the \"front row\" of the business. Too bad every body else is also complaining about their NEGATIVE experience with their STAFF.

If the restaurant owners are reading this bad review, please, TRY to train your hostesses. Your business will go downward spiral because of your nasty staff. Their actions are UNACCEPTABLE, RACIST AND INTOLERABLE. Those two girls just made your company look ao bad so Im expecting that these two will either be sanctioned, fired or trained (at least)."}
{"text":"Wow, quick slide downhill for a formerly reliable and favorite restaurant.

I brought three visiting family members from out of town for dinner just before 6pm today.  The main patio was full and we were offered the option of bar patio, which was empty except for one other party.  
Placed a drink order promptly. Took about 10 minutes for my drink to arrive; server said she \"forgot\" my brother's order (Coors Light).  Slightly annoyed, he just requested water, not wanting to wait another 10 minutes for something to drink.  
Another wait until server returned for order.  After we placed our order, two more parties arrived and were quickly served meals...still no food for us.  Server reappears with a bread basket that was not ours, then disappears for another 15 minutes.  Finally server returns and apologized for delay, said we were at 25 minutes  (wrong, it was at least 40 minutes) and she knew that was too long, said kitchen was busy and order would be \"right up\".   Another 10 minutes passed, at which point I went inside looking for manager.  Initial waitperson I spoke to simply walked away.  Another person realized I needed help and got the manager.  Manager indicated she would check on order and offered cocktails.  I replied we just wanted our food. Less than a minute later, the food arrived.  Clearly, it had been sitting for at least 15 minutes, as evidenced by room temp food and congealed cheese on Ruebens and burgers.  Disgusting.  We got up and walked out; after 75 minutes our patience was shot, and clearly there was to be no satisfactory and timely resolution.  What should have been a nice relaxing evening had been ruined.

A server who is incompetent is bad enough, but the issue extends to management if there is no process in place to insure that customers are being attended to in order and that plates do not sit around unclaimed.  Before sending this sorry food out to us, there should have been some inquiry by the manager as to what the issue was and the quality/timing of the food.  Serving up inedible food after an extended wait simply amplifies the bad experience.  Totally inexcusable."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times in the past, so hoping for a nice lunch on Sunday June 7 we arrived for lunch shortly after 12:30pm.  The dining room was less than half full and we were immediately seated right next to a table of 12 or more ladies.  The hostess left us with a menu and there we sat.  For just over 10 minutes we sat waiting for someone/anyone to acknowledge us, bring us water or promise to be right with us.  We watched the hostess glancing around from her podium and wait staff gathered at their station, and after a couple more minutes we decided that was enough and got up to leave.  We walked directly past the hostess on our way out the door and she didn't say a word.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"The first place we take friends visiting from out of state. Very well done southeast style design. If the weather allows sit outside on spacious patio. Service is always friendly and professional. Food is consistently good. Only issue for me is that the menu offerings rarely change."}
{"text":"Wow, our friends recommended Tonto Bar and Grill and so glad they did.  A wonderful meal, great service, ambiance....what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Ha, how I long for the good old days! The days when you would sit in the back patio of Tonto Bar and Grill, soak up the great atmosphere while anxiously awaiting a succulent dish to please your pallet and a healthy appetite.

Well, those days are gone!  Our experience last night left us so disappointed. The passion to deliver a total quality dining experience is gone and so are we, never to return again.
 
It's about the money now, your money, and how much they can get for as little as they can give. So keep in mind, these restaurants that once burned brightly have a responsibility to earn your business every time you pull a chair up to their table. Tonto Bar and Grill's light has been extinguished only to be surviving off a once was reputation."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a date night.  The food was excellent, the drinks were good, and service was wonderful.  I loved the ambiance!  It was a little pricey, but worth it.  We sat next to the fireplace on a cold, rainy evening so our table was VERY romantic.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch last Saturday afternoon. We had soup and salad that was mediocre at best. Ordered a lemon drop that was so-so and over priced. On the positive side, there is a good view of the golf course."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Tonto Bar and Grill. We live in Cave Creek and visit Tonto Bar and Grill often, never disappointed.  Nice South West atmosphere, excellent service. Pleasant view of the golf course from the outside patio. You may even get a glimpse of a bob cat or coyote snooping around. My favorite food for lunch is the Reuben sandwich. It is big enough to share. It is a little spicy because it has some jalapeno peppers but you can ask them not to add, sweet potato tots are very tasty. My husband loves their Golden Corn Chowder soup. Salads are always very fresh and crispy and also big enough to share. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had lunch in the New Year's Day 70 degree sun along the golf course so that was a plus right there.  My Mom and I enjoyed a delicious lunch (cobb salad with calamari side, street tacos with white shrimp).  Just what we needed and fun too.  Will go back! Yay!"}
{"text":"You've got to be kidding me.....

My parents just moved to the Cave Creek area and so we went for a visit. I figured if we are going to the sticks, might as well go all out and hit an authentic southwestern place, so I made reservations at Tonto. 

The decor is definitely southwestern but way over the top cheesy southwestern. 

The food is, well...., the food is just not good.
I've never and I do mean never gone to a place where every meal picked at the table was bad. Pork Schnitzel is not really schnitzel, more of a poorly breaded piece of pork cut up into triangle slices and it was extremely tough. Spring Pea Risotto had the consistency of paste, Diver Scallops did not taste fresh and the Calamari on my Mother's salad was like rubber. 

And finally the service, what can I say other than the service just flat out sucks.
Waitress had some kind of piss poor attitude. I would have been better off asking the floor tiles to serve us. 

Not going to beat around the bush and give 3 or 2 stars saying I will give it another try because that ain't gonna happen."}
{"text":"Best Unique Southwestern Upscale Restaurant and Golf Golf Course View in Cave Creek !"}
{"text":"Wow, very impressed. With the spa and golf course on site it would be easy to assume quality mass production meals that are good but not real good, typically predictable but NOT HERE! This is excellent scratch made food. Great choices rich in flavor. Good service, great atmosphere, good view and really not too busy. It gets full but not like it might down south. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"After a week in North Scottsdale we found Tontos' and decided it was the best spot we had tried.  Loved the classic old western decor and atmosphere and the food was the most interesting we had in the area. The short ribs were amazing and served with the stacked sweet potato dish made for an awesome meal. My husband had the German pork snitzle with warm potato salad.  Was a little leery about ordering a classic German dish in old west type of restaurant but he said it was the best he had ever had. Inside, or out on the lovely patio, a charming place to spend the evening!  Look forward to going again on my next trip to the desert."}
{"text":"Dinner was a great experience for all four of us.  I wish I had noted the name of the bartender, she was incredibly nice and very helpful before we sat for dinner.  The food was very well prepared.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer which comes with both corn and flour tortilla and fry bread and two three salsas, great presentation on that and all the food.  I wish the salsa had more heat, but that was just me.  My wife had the salmon, just about perfect, and I had the New York Strip which was a very flavorful but tender steak.  Based on other reviews, we sat outside and actually ended up a little cold, also very little to see because we were there quite late.  I'd like to come back and eat more at around twilight or during the day."}
{"text":"Have been there twice in the past few months.  First time was during the busier snow bird season.  My wife and I were seated quickly.  Order was taken and then they forgot about us.  Tables next to us got their food quickly but ours never came.  Spoke to the manager who offered to quickly make our entrees but we left since we had somewhere to go.  Tried it again about 3 weeks ago.   It was not busy but the service was again terrible.  We wanted to order drinks but could not get the attention of our server who was standing at the ending of the room talking to the other servers.  We finally had to ask one of the busboys.  Our food came relatively quickly.  My wife ordered a hamburger.  It was so greasy that the bun was saturated with grease and not edible.  We complained to the manager who offered to bring her another.  We decided to leave after finishing the appetizers. Would not go back.  It is unfortunate since we live  min away and would love to have a good neighborhood place."}
{"text":"My husband came in at 8:50 on a friday night. Place was full. we were hopeful it was going to be a great dinner! Hostess, a young girl turned us away and said they had stopped serving dinner! If owner knew they would be furious!  W edrove another thirty minutes to Mortons Steak House where we spent $300.00 and were treated like Kings. Too bad."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue overlooking the golf course, with upscale southwestern décor and good food.....best burgers in the area!
Sitting outside on the patio at the end of the day watching the sun go down is a treat."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was great. However, lost one star though because food bill was comparable to Ruth's Chris steakhouse but the quality of food was not on par with the price we paid."}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant annually.  I ordered the jalapeño corned beef sandwich with sweet potato tots, which I lived in the past.  The sandwich was skimpy with two slices of fatty corned beef, little cheese and too much sauerkraut.  The tots were overcooked with burnt edges.  I was insulted that they served this food and expected a hefty cost.  This is the last time we visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends from Scottsdale. Very southwestern ranchy vibe. Sat on covered heated patio but could not appreciate view in the dark. Very accommodating service. Customized meal for my food restrictions. Fresh homemade bread was very good. Grilled salmon a bit mushy. Deconstructed creme brulee was yummy."}
{"text":"I am just going to tell you to go to happy hour.  Bartender was adorable as were the other patrons seated at the bar.  Beautiful spot in Cave Creek.  I guess I need to go for a meal for a full review.  But go have a cocktail."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way back from Cave Creek Stables. The decor was great but the ambience was a bit flat (people must eat early lunch because at 1:30pm, the place was dead). 

Service was very fast and portions were good. Only issue is that they completely messed up our order and gave my wife the gluten free option instead of the vegan (so the salad had cheese when she is lactose intolerant). Otherwise the food was good."}
{"text":"We took some friends to Tonto Grill and they absolutely love it and so did we. Great food, wonderful server and good drinks. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Basically this place really need to justify its prices. Ive been all over the country, and visited different parts of the world, spent years on the French Riviera, and cant figure out why this place is so expensive.

Nothing on the menu was perfect. I had to get my order custom made, and left kind of disappointed. The overall quality was pretty good, but I was expecting to discover something amazing, or at least win a cash prize.

Decor was typical \"Spanish Style\", which they probably didnt have to spent a lot on since thats what all the places in the area are like, except the track homes and the strip malls.

So what I am asking Tonto Bar, is for you to give me a reason to come back. Also, keep in mind that I am vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food here is great and sitting outdoors during the nicer weather is a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food and service have seriously gone downhill at this restaurant, which used to be a favorite. The service was make-believe good--server circled solicitously, but our food arrived congealed and cold. The short ribs, which I've had here before, were small, fatty and greasy, covered with mystery gravy, and hideously overpriced for bad cafeteria-style food. Don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"They took off the blt, make you pay for bread, and the salads got smaller. Dang it. We used to come here at least once a month. Love the views and the service is always amazing. Just a little bummed! All of the good places end of going down hill due to cost."}
{"text":"Lovely setting and very delicious and unusual menu items   The tacos o had were super yummy. I have heard the corn chowder is delicious and will try it next time"}
{"text":"Hostess was not inviting. Seated us on the patio in direct sun when many seats were open in the shade. I requested to be moved but it seemed to be an inconvenience. The staff seemed like they didn't want to be there. Good food but for the price management needs to focus on training their employees. Particularly the hostess. First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"I was so very disappointed today at lunch.  I have been here several times and had great service.  I was surprised today to have a server that couldn't have cared less about our service.  He was very curt when we questioned him about menu items etc. At one point he turned his head and rolled his eyes in my direction.   After we finished our meal I heard that there was a lunch special....why weren't we told about it??  I asked him about the special and he said oh sorry I forgot to tell you.    We sat for 30-40 minutes with empty glasses of water.  We had to ASK for everything??  We just all felt like his lack of attention was very distasteful.
   Now on the other hand the food as always was good!!  I would have liked to have had the fish and chips.. we will be back because I feel this is an isolated incident but he needs some customer training."}
{"text":"This is a favorite whenever I come to Arizona to visit my family.  The view is fantastic and the food even better.  The waitstaff and is always friendly and helpful and puts up with my dad's antics (aka really bad jokes)  On my last visit I had the ahi tuna rolls and practically the whole bread basket by myself.  I also had the rioja wine.  Everything was delicious!  The weather cooperated and we were able to enjoy outside dining in the relaxed atmosphere and watch the wildlife on the golf course and the mountains in the background.  I can't recommend Tonto Bar and Grill enough."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Tonto.  Just had the sand dabs . . . never ever had sand dabs before . . .  ridiculously delicious!!!

On a wickedly busy night, with private parties in the main rooms and patios, Tonto still delivered with excellent service and great food!  It is my \"go to\" restaurant when we have company from out of town!"}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered Tonto B & G while on a shopping excursion to Cave Creek.  Tonto reminds me of the La Quinta Resort in California except a lot cozier.  The retro Mexican/Arizona vibe is awesome and the menu was interesting.  The BLT sandwich was HUGE and the sweet potato tater tots were awesome.  The shrimp tacos were also tasty and a light way to enjoy lunch. Can't wait to return for an evening cocktail followed by dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with great food. They have a separate vegan menu which is awesome but make sure to ask for it because not everything on it is on the regular menu.  Service was great and the food was super flavorful!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was very good. The corn chowder was phenomenal. The view was amazing. Definitely recommend sitting outside if possible.  Our lunch was fabulous. Our service experience was great."}
{"text":"Time for a menu change. Food is good, service great. At some point new items would be positive"}
{"text":"Terrible service from one of the managers. Long brown hair with glasses. Do not recommend for the service but the food is outstanding and the lower patio is breathtaking."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the corned beef hash and like always good service great scenery and great company great resort to"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The food is always great. The southwestern influence is subtle. The indoor space is gorgeous but we prefer eating outside. The views are stunning. Please dust the outdoor fans & light fixtures! The wood repairs should be next."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere,  quaint.  Patio lovely, nice view of golf course.  Service was good.  Problem for us, way over priced.   Prime Rib sandwich,  $14...it was tasty, but very little meat.  Salmon dinner guest liked, price fair.   But $12  for house wine and $10 for draft beer, too pricey.  For 4 of us two drinks a piece averaged $40 a piece including tip. Giving 3 stars for over all experience."}
{"text":"Our weekly jaunt. I love the place and the Caesar is fabulous especially with a side of anchovies. The seasonal soups are a must. Scenery inside and out fabulous."}
{"text":"After avoiding this place for some time After bed experience about one year ago, decided to give thus place another chance and ...... If you like late 80's beginning 90's cooking with mediocre service you may like this place"}
{"text":"A lovely place for an outdoor lunch.  Good food and very pleasant setting on a golf course."}
{"text":"Hi All,
Since my review last march, I am pleased to say that the Tonto improved significantly. 

My wife and I  tend to frequent the facility every 7-10 days and the food quality has improved 100%. 
We have not had a disappointing meal and the service is excellent again...

So.. all who read this I suggest you get down to the Tonto in Cave Creek, they are back as the Number 1 eatery in Cave Creek..

WELL DONE"}
{"text":"I will Never go back.  The only redeeming thing about this place was the view.
The food was Sub~par.  The service was poor... The margaritas weren't even good.
It was maybe 3:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was not even a busy time.
With so many places to choose from why spend$$$$"}
{"text":"We've dined here four times now and it keeps getting better. The beef tenderloin is so tender and the bacon wrapped shrimp are huge! Huge! I love the prickly pear margaritas and we always get dessert no matter how stuffed we are already. The warm chocolate buttermilk cake is like a souffle and comes with a little cup of chocolate sauce to pour on top. That's awesome."}
{"text":"Tonto's consistently offers a great overall experience. Food is always prepared well, atmosphere is nice and service excellent. John and Cody do a really nice job."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in lunch today at Tonto Bar & Grill.  I ordered the entree size Tonto Salad with added avocado, thinking it would be a knockout given the Tonto name, and my dining mate ordered the Reuben with sweet potato tater tots.  The Reuben was very good - generous serving size, nicely grilled, and served warm.  My entree Tonto Salad was also served warm, very small for an entree serving size, and overly coated in dressing making the butter lettuce soggy and limp.  The salad consists of sliced horse radish, halved cherry tomatoes, and sunflower seeds, all of which were very, very scarce. I was charged an extra $2 for the avocado which I'm happy to pay but it consisted of two slices placed on top, perhaps 1/8 of a whole avocado. Service was very good but server should have been embarrassed to serve the Tonto Salad. We are fans of Tonto and Cartwright's but won't be returning to Tonto anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food here is stellar. The ambiance and views are wonderful. The service is the best in town. This time round we had the scallops and the sand dabs, both were very  enjoyable."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this restaurant. It is located on a golf course and resort. The restaurant is decorated and a Spanish style with a rustic feel. The food is really good. I had a salad but it was really fresh with avocado and yummy chicken. They have these rolls that are pretty bummed too. Give this place a try for sure."}
{"text":"The last time I was here might have before Yelp existed!  I was always a big fan and was looking forward to my first visit since 2009.  What I positively recalled from my last visit was the Tonto burger, the great views of the mountains nearby and the calming ambience of Cave Creek.  All of those recollections were confirmed along with a great dessert of a coconut lemon tart with a couple of chocolate chip biscottis for dessert. If you need an escape from the Valley hustle and bustle and have some time for a great evening, Tonto Grill is the place to head."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here after a round of golf.  We had heard that the restaurant is superior and the dishes re interesting.  We were not disappointed.  The interior and exterior of the restaurant are so appealing in different ways.  Inside it is rustic with lots of wood; very warm and inviting.  The outside patio is on the golf course and is so pleasant. Its two tiered so everyone has a great view of what's happening on the course.  We both had corn chowder which was fantastic.  My husband had a Reuben on that he really enjoyed.  It was very large so he took half home.  The French fries are the kind that are very crunchy.  They must dust them with something.  I had a Caesar salad which was not to exciting but nothing really wrong with it.  The wait staff and hostess was friendly and efficient and the space was spotless.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ate at Tonto Bar and Grill for Valentines dinner 2016. The southwestern theme throughout the restaurant is done in beautiful taste and the backdrop of the golf course makes eating here magical. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and service is good. Great place for lunch but beware it is very highly priced. However the quality is there, just doesn't seem like a place that is so expensive when you first sit.  So savor it if you go!"}
{"text":"If you have not dined here before, it is a must. It is one of my favorite restaurants in cave creek and the state for that matter! The atmosphere and menu is very unique and the service is always great. I love that it's not your average chain restaurant. When it's good weather, you can dine outside and have views of the golf course. Definitely make a reservation because it's very popular and gets busy, especially on the weekends. If you love it here, you can try their sister restaurant up the road called Cartwrights. Similar southwestern menu but a little fancier."}
{"text":"Love Tonto Bar and Grill but disappointed that they changed their Happy Hour. You might as well just enjoy their dinners for almost the same price. They used to have $5.00 drinks and apps. Now they take a couple of dollars off their regular prices. No real HH any more."}
{"text":"One of the things I love about this establishment is they consistently have fantastic food every time I go. Very creative and the location is beautiful. Don't miss their prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"We had a large and very excited party (with reservations) and the entire experience could not have been nicer! The servers explained things (to us easterners) several times and were superior with special orders and a few substitutions. No water glass was ever unfilled (we even spilled one and they were right on the spot to clean it up). We divided the check between two families and they were happy to do it - and they were accurate! The food was great (I had the chicken and creamed corn) and it was plenty to eat, well-seasoned and piping hot - not easy to do with that many people in the group. I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone - even though the resort it was in didn't look like it was doing too well.

Even in the off-season, the restaurant was full and we ate fairly early (6:30). Tasty, reasonably priced for vactioners, and a lovely event."}
{"text":"I had a dinner here with friends. The menu is varied, with everything from soups, burgers, and steaks and chicken. I had the burger, it was OK but in my opinion, a bit on the expensive side, even for the location. Same for the soup. Average to slightly above average food, at much greater than average prices. I probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Had a really lovely lunch on the patio. Great service, dog friendly, delicious gluten free options, especially the GF bread basket."}
{"text":"The brunch menu screams assembly breakfast with no toast or substitutions. Maybe it was too early but seemed we were the only people there. The serving crew was over staffed and untrained creating many useless interactions and hapless attempts at service because they had no short term memory. Beautiful place but needs just a few professionals to make it a goldmine. The manager was worthless. I feel sorry for the kids she hires."}
{"text":"If I could give Tonto 50 STARS.... I would! We just had dinner there Sat..(9/5) and it was beyond Perfection.... from the phone call to make the reservation, table by the window, exceptional service.... and the Food~. . .Best Dinner we had had in a long time~~ 1/2 the price of  Bourbon Steak.. 10 times the flavor and Value..... can't wait to go back  many times~!!.Thank you so much to the entire Staff.... and the Bar is very nice~!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this restaurant from watching reviews on channel 8, my husband and I decided to take a drive to cave reek for lunch and check this place out! We had an excellent lunch on the patio and got to watch golfers too! It was a fantastic lunch and we will be coming here again soon!! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner in the old room next to the Bar area.  The food was fine but the service was pretty painful.  It was one of those dinners where to get the next thing we had to flag down our server or someone else.  I ordered a cocktail and waited almost 15 minutes for it to arrive.  We had to ask for bread and for the cocktail glass to be removed and for another wine glass to be brought and we had to ask for several other things as well.  It is hard to enjoy dinner and company when you are waving at servers all the time."}
{"text":"We have been going to Tonto Bar & Grill for nearly 20 years. It has always been one of the places we take all of our visitors. Our tab as a couple is always close to $100 (including wine) and we don't begrudge the price. One small thing has been bugging me from our last few visits. In the past, the bread basket was complimentary but now they charge $3-$4 for it. The excuse that I was given was that they had too much wasted bread. So rather than make the bread basket complementary \"upon request\" (like Zinc Bistro) Tonto is charging for it. It seems like management was just looking for another revenue opportunity...not what I would expect from an upscale restaurant when I'm spending a \"Benjamin\"."}
{"text":"Tonto Bar & Grill has been a place I have frequented many times.
I have taken clients there, out of town visitors and my wife!
The food is always excellent.
And the view of the golf course is just breathtaking. 

But last week I decided on a whim to grab dinner there, as my family was away, and I was driving by.
As I was on my own, I decided to sit at the bar.

Wow! What a great evening. Met the barkeeper, Brittany, as well as another couple that was eating there. It felt like I was with family. Despite the fact that Brittany was serving us, as well as all the other waiters, she still found time to chat, and keep us amused. 

The fillet was, as to be expected, awesome! And the evening went by like a flash.

I eat out a lot, as I travel all the time. I will be eating there more often in the future."}
{"text":"Tonto was excellent from start to finish! I can't wait to return!!! We visited for restaurant week and had a great experience. We made a reservation and were seated right away. I ordered the tortilla crusted crab cakes for an appetizer and my Hubby had the salad. The crab cakes were sooooo yummy and tasty! The roasted chile slaw was a perfect pairing for that added crunch and the flavor of the chipotle aioli topped everything off. Hubby's Harvest salad was very good as well and all the flavors worked very well together. For the main course I had the Ancho chili rubbed filet with asparagus and Manchego scalloped potatoes, which were to die for!!! Hubby had the orange barbecued salmon. He really enjoyed this dish!!! Served with spaghetti squash and a sweet potato hash. Flavors meshed very well there. Dessert was the icing on the cake. Hubby had the chocolate cake with a butter pecan ice cream and I had the lemon lime merengue pie. YUMMMMMM. Both were extremely good and we savored every bite :) also tried their chocolate kiss coffee desert drink which was excellent. We give this place two thumbs up!! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We were out there for brunch today and the food was exceptional.  Due to food allergies, they helped accommodate me, even though they had a set menu for Easter. I hate being \"that\" person at the table, but our server was so sweet and helpful.  We were a party of 4 with an infant, and even when I walked around with my granddaughter, everyone was so friendly. Thank you for a wonderful brunch experience!  I would love to try your normal menu, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful golf course view. Corn chowder delicious. Burgers and tacos ok.  Margarita just ok too. Not much taste. So glad there was a special menu for our gluten free person. She usually has to ask so many questions.  Have to pay for bread.  We did have a beautiful day and good table with an umbrella. Lunch time. Kinda wish I hadn't made our group go, but you never know. It's a 3."}
{"text":"My family and I went for lunch and we all loved every bite!  The flavors were amazing!  I had the shrimp tacos and didn't expect it to be so good.  I'm from Chicago where the restaurants are so much better than the typical boring, flavorless chains you find everywhere here. Something so little as the fries where outstanding - even when cold!  Our server was very professional and pleasant who told us the restaurant has been around for 21 years!  It must be doing something right.  The ambiance was relaxing and warm - upscale casual and very rustic.  Lunch was pricey but well worth it.  I'd rather spend extra for a memorable meal than waste it on mediocre bland food that I can make better at home. 

A great place for a date night, clients, out of town guests or just when you want a wonderful meal. One of my favorite restaurants and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Friday night and not many customers due to being off-season in the valley! The water server was by far the best staff member of all! The waitress was short and felt rushed with no one in the restaurant! When we had finished eating she came to the table and said \"menus\" we looked up and was like what?!?! She then said \"menu, coffee\" I answered the check please, and she just walked off....I am not sure 100% but I think that was her desert pitch?!?! Please train your staff to wait tables! 

The food is ok, not great but ok, the pricing does not even warrant the quality of food, even for a the area! 

If you are a tourist go to other places in the area and I am sure you will have a much more enjoyable experience for your money! Please train your kitchen staff to simply steam vegetables!!"}
{"text":"That was awesome!  BLT and a Sam Adams on a beautiful day.  Sat outside looking over the golf course and it was absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"My Wife picked this spot for her Birthday dinner. Great choice! Never even heard of this place before. Now, part of the 5 star experience has to do with a few intangibles that were beyond their control: Weather was perfect, about 80 degrees. I'm usually not a big fan of dining Al Fresco (outdoors), but this evening was just perfect. They have a very nice patio for dining, overlooking the sunset, cacti, and a golf course. No bugs, no excessive heat, no wind...All things that can spoil a Desert Dining Experience.

Food was fantastic. She had crab cakes as an appetizer, I had a beet salad with greens, goat cheese, and vinaigrette dressing. Entrees were filet mignon with au gratin 'taters, and I had a braised short rib in a root beer sauce, french green beans, and a squash side dish... Both veggies were excellent. Dessert came with our prix fixe meal, and they made a swell Birthday cake ensemble for her, and I had a relish creme brûlée that was perfect.

I definitely will return to this place, as I saw people ordering (southwestern) hamburgers with sweet potato tater tots, for about 12 bucks. Looked great.

Service was really professional, not overly friendly, just spot on. This would be a great place to take out of towners to experience a Southwestern dining experience. Near perfect!"}
{"text":"OOOHHH I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! FIrst you drive through beautiful Cave Creek, Arizona!! The surrounding mountains are so gorgeous. The views are breathtaking! You stop at Rancho Maniana and there is a Restaurant at the Golf Course and it's the best!!! The atmosphere is gorgeous and the food is delectible! The food is mouth-watering in every bite! This place is a \"must see\" on our list every time we visit Arizona! (almost every year!). They have \"different\" menu items than some other places and some of your every day type of things also. They have an outdoor patio that has marvelous mountain views and the golfcourse of course! Their desserts are special and yummy and their main dishes are always made with the best and most delicious foods!"}
{"text":"I chose Tonto for my birthday dinner and my husband reserved a table in the patio. When we got there, they attempted to seat us inside. We said we had reserved the patio. They looked again & seated us at the \"cocktail\" patio. This is NOT the nice patio and our plans to eat dinner while we watched the sunset and overlooked the golf course were over. This patio is on the side and has no view whatsoever and seemed to be for bar overflow. Our waitress was fine but we were clearly being rushed through our courses. Our entire meal (appetizer, salad, entree & dessert) was over in an hour. We've had better paced meals at Chili's. We spent more time in the car coming & going than we did eating. The food itself was just ok. We spoke to both managers and neither seemed all that apologetic though one finally comped our app & dessert. They had so many opportunities to make it right and never did. I doubt we'd ever go back and I honestly can't think of one reason we would."}
{"text":"This restaurant has it all. Attentive staff, fabulous food and ambiance like no other in Cave Creek.  In particular, the split pea soup is the best I've ever had. Omg. It is so delicious that I can't go there without ordering it. It is just that good! The desserts are beautiful and decadent and you can tell that they've just been freshly made. Wow. This to me defines the perfect restaurant. Lovely.Delicious. and guaranteed to make your day."}
{"text":"Cave Creek is my favorite little town. It makes me so so happy! We've vacationed at Rancho Mañana many times throughout the years and Tonto Bar and Grill brings back all the happy memories with consistently good food over the decades. They have the best staff, quality food, allergy-aware and those views!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Tonto Bar and Grill a 5 star, but I just can't do it...

My fiance and I met some friends for dinner on Saturday night.  The property was gorgeous, the ambiance was perfection, the server was delightful, and the food was amazing... 

The real problem was management.  

As we settled in to a nice quiet dinner, a family was seated behind us and soon after, the child began to screach.  And screach.  And screach.   The bone chilling, eardrum piercing kind of screach.  

My fiance asked the manager to move us, but I REALLY think the manager should have moved the family or asked them to take their little one outside.   I would have expected the parents to be courteous enough to think of that for themselves, but that's not the world we live in apparently.  

Anyway, we were moved to the smaller, less comfortable dining room, however, we could STILL hear that child screaching from the other side of the building over and over again throughout the evening. 

Probably half dozen or more tables were also moved from the larger, nicer dining room and away from the inconsiderate family during the time we were there.  So, basically, the rude family got a \"private\" dining room with a view while all the other paying customers had to be relocated.  

This was extremely disappointing!!!   If I am going to be pay $80+ for my meal, I definitely expect better!    We were hoping to come back when the weather turns nice to enjoy the outdoor patio, but now I am not so sure it's worth the risk.."}
{"text":"Hmm..I had high hopes with the other reviews on this restaurant. Great view of the golf course, but very disappointing on the food. However if you like your asparagus old & burnt..this is the place for you! 

In all fairness, the server did offer to replace the asparagus, but at this point I had already waited 40 mins for my meal. Not to mention a simple request like no croutons on the salad couldn't even be followed either."}
{"text":"Ummmm,  just ok... Started with salsa guac platter for table / good. Guac was watered down with salsa and had chunks of jicama in it. Was good but not for everyone.

One of the BEST PARTS OF MEAL -I started with the \"harvest\" salad with no protein added.  This was GREAT BY ITSELF... The perfect blend of flavors. The sweetness of the fruit and the bite of the vinaigrette  finished by the sweet and creamy of the cheese and salty of the nuts.  

 BUZZ KILL- For my main course I ordered the honey bbq salmon on spaghetti squash and sweet potato.   At the recommendation of many yelpers.  I Asked for sauces on side, as I am very sensitive to salt and sauces have a lot of sodium hidden in them not to mention the xtra calories.  The salmon was not fishy but was very very salty almost as if it was if it was soaked in salt water.  A trick restaurants do with frozen fish to hide the fact the fish is not fresh or to hide fishy flavors.  NOT GOOD PEOPLE!!!!!

The SAVING GRACE and WORTH THE TRIP TO TONTO!!!!

The SOUR CREAM LEMON LIME CHEESECAKE!!!!

Can I get A SUPERFREAKINGRAJALISTICLICKYOURPLATE GOOD!!!!  I was in a TRANCE NO ONE TALK TO ME SO GOOD GOOD!!!!!

Made me forget about the other issues for a little bit.  But not long enough to NOT WRITE A REVIEW... Sorry TONTO but you need help!!

Shared the cheesecake with a few other people and kinda wish I had my own."}
{"text":"I live in Desert Hills and I always forget about this place.  Thanks to Restaurant Week, we went there again and it was delicious.  We were starting to suspect the bartender had some sort of time travel machine because our drinks arrived nearly at the same moment we ordered them.  Our meals were tasty and the service was great.  Beautiful setting."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, we decided to try it. So glad we did! We sat out on the patio overlooking the golf course. Great setting. My husband had the organic burger, he said it was one of the best he's ever had. I had the Tumbleweed salad with calamari on top. The calamari was cooked perfectly; not tough or chewy. All the staff was delightful. Will return if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"If you don't want Indian fry bread or a biker bar or spending big bucks at the boulders.
I guess you come to this establishment.
Kinda loud, food is generic Southwestern fare.
A pile of people congratulate here..
  Like sheep to water I guess"}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite restaurant up here in Cave Creek. I think more than half the draw is the view. While I choose to live in the desert and love it, there is something distinctly calming - and cooling - about looking out over a vista of green. Watch long enough and you'll see javelina and possibly bobcats and mountain lions out on the gold course. The menu says it changes seasonally but I haven't really noticed a change in the last year. Not a huge selection of food but nicely edited - try the two pasta dishes, which are our favorites. Service from the waitstaff is great, but I took a star away for the hostesses. They're all like 16 years old, never, ever smile or make you feel welcome and have proven to be utterly unhelpful when asked even something as simple as how long the wait would be. We've also called ahead to reserve a specific table, told it wold be held for us & had this little blond cheerleader tell us too bad, so sad, not her problem. I always kind of steel myself for those initial couple of minutes, but once seated it's a wonderful experience. Just wish they would hire grownups to man the front."}
{"text":"Had the chance to Tonto Bar & Grill thanks to some friends in Cave Creek who have been here before and suggested it!  We just enjoyed the patio, happy hour and the fire place.

I didn't eat, but a desert was shared by the girls and they loved it!  The atmosphere is classic desert!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times in the last three years with a ladies lunch group,and s book club.  Nothing to write hone about..hum drum food,nice service and great views. They can accommodate large crowds"}
{"text":"Great ambience, especially on the patio, great waitress who has very attentive and nice. My girlfriend and I both had the salmon and it was damn good. Tons of flavors dancing around, from sweet to spicy (but not too spicy).  All around, a really great experience."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and it was really fantastic! Besides an extensive regular menu, Tonto has a vegan and gluten free menu...yummmm. I started with the caprese salad which had three fresh mozzarellas (ancho chili, sage, hibiscus) made on site paired with three thick slices of heirloom tomato and micro sage. My cousin suggested their spaghetti squash (a side) to share and it was delicious! It is seasoned with grilled onion and tossed with wilted spinach...so good! My meal was a torta with layers of mashed anasazi beans, green chiles, chopped tomatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and a bunch of other stuff and was accompanied by whole grain baked crackers. It was a great blend of textures in the torta and all the flavors mixed seamlessly. My cousin had an ahi tuna roll that looked like it had been covered in tempura - she loved it. 

The flavors of everything we tried really stood out. I would go back in a second!"}
{"text":"Yummy - you  can't go wrong.  The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Food and ambience is still great, and the original review still stands after 10 or so more visits, but the salads have shrunk to about 1/4 the size previous which is so disappointing. An entree salad is no longer enough for a meal so the value just isn't there. After 3 disappointing and paltry salads, I'll be ordering other items."}
{"text":"Played the awesome golf course (shot 85) and had lunch outside on the patio. Everything was delicious and satisfying. The Tonto-ritas were refreshing and the white shrimp tacos to die for. The avocado crema served on the side was a perfect compliment to the ancho chili sauce on the shrimp n veggies. My wife and I visit this area once a year to spend time with family and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Go for happy hour and sunset. Everything is great, skip the salads. Nothing like the actual meals. And great dessert choices too."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a beautiful evening which is always a good start to a dinner with friends. The drink list was adequate and the wines by the glass satisfactory. The calimari appetizer was excellent. The squash soup and corn chowder were wonderful. My wife really enjoyed her pasta. I was excited to see veal liver but the preparation disappointed me and the vegetables were not very flavorful. Service was excellent: good waitress with a trainee and a busboy who was attentive. This is a favorite of our friends. I m not sure it is great but we did have a good meal with good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here recently and both enjoyed the Short Ribs- excellent flavor and the sweet potato casserole was amazing. I also had a Prickly Pear Margarita which was excellent. It was very busy on a Saturday night and loud, but we sat on the patio which was very nice and heaters were running to keep us warm. All in all, great place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for an early dinner after a great round of golf, celebrating a very special \"90-degree-on-June-11th-day\" in the valley!!!

Seriously, when can us locals enjoy a beautiful outdoor patio with such a stunning view in June?!!! We had to properly celebrate!

We had great service, from the hostess to the runners and server! Everyone was terrific and the food was the highlight!  Every bite was a delight of flavors, and we can't wait to come back and try other dishes from such a creative menu!

They even had a choice between two non-alcoholic beers, properly poured in a frosted glass at our table. I don't know why, but it's pretty common that beer without alcohol somehow gets treated less-than at most places. Strange, but true!

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"We will travel many miles to go to a good restaurant - including an overnight trip to Tucson or a weekend in Santa Fe. 
We have been meaning to try the TBG, but due to very inconsistent reviews, we had put it off. 
\"Inconsistent\" defines our experience at TBG this week. 
Worthy of 5 stars: 
The location, decor, view, and ambiance. 
Our server was also attentive and friendly. 
Our drinks were great also. 
Atmosphere: We were lucky enough to sit on the patio at dusk. The golf course/mountain/saguaro view was stunning. A small herd of javelina even ambled their way across the course. 
Worthy of 2 stars: 
Menu: I thought it was fairly boring from the beginning. No signature dishes or anything very unique. It would have made sense to have something Southwestern. 
Because of the golf course, I do understand the need for more casual sandwich offerings, however. 

We each had a cup of corn chowder - something  I love. It was served sloppily with a puddle of soup under the bowl and I could clearly see where someone had attempted to wipe soup off the saucer (a smear the width of a finger). 
The soup was average - very little corn, potatoes in large chunks too big for a cup of soup, and it could have used more flavor. (Some roasted poblano). 
I had the Tumbleweed salad with chicken. Just an average salad. Even the dressing wasn't that great. 
My husband had the Root Beer braised Short Ribs. 
We both felt the reduced flavor of the root beer was just too distractingly sweet. (Have no clue why they would then choose sweet potatoes as an accompaniment). 
In summary, we really wanted to love this place and again admired the setting as we left. We agreed that if we ever come back - it would be just for drinks, appetizer, and to enjoy the patio. 
They really need to up their game on the food!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for dinner at sunset.  Beautiful view and great food.  We have been going here for 15 yrs.  Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I have come here several times since it is so close to my house.  During restaurant week, we decided to invite some friends to experience this place. This year it was $40 per person which is ok for the location.  We had not been here in a while.  The location is pretty nice and if the day is beautiful, you can enjoy dinner in their beautiful patio.  To start I had the beet salad and my hubby had the crab cakes, those were delicious, I wish I had chosen that.  I love beets, but my salad was not as great as I have had before.  For our entree I had the salmon and the hubby had the filet, those two dishes were amazing.  On the other hand, the desserts were underwhelming.  I prefer the dessert from the regular menu, specially the sticky caramel meringue terrine, yum.  If you go for lunch or dinner, the hamburgers and salads are HUGE.  An how can I forget my guilty pleasure, the bread basket has little corn bread muffins, those are the bomb, I could eat a dozen.  No wonder my pants are a little tighter now."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio and it was a great atmosphere. The drinks and food were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, impeccable service, beautiful surroundings. Their menu has enough southwestern touches to add culinary interest but not too much to make the food too powerful or overwhelming with the spices. Have been going here for 10 years and still is my favorite for lunch or dinner in the Town of Cave Creek. My only complaint is that they stopped serving their jalapeño rolls this year, MUST get them back! 
I used Open Table app online to make my reservation and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"The menu offers variety of dishes covering from Southwest, TexMex, All American,  etc.  Quite tasty on the items I have tried thus far and the service is good to excellent. Their veal liver was superb.

Atmosphere is quite nice, if you are seating outdoor patio area as you get to see the golf course."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great outdoor patio. Wonderful cocktail menu. Not a huge selection for vegetarians but definitely doable."}
{"text":"Southwestern ambiance, small gem!!  Tucked in, next to the golf course with indoor and patio seating.   Ranch/Hacienda decor with an awesome intimate bar.  Two for lunch today!  BLT and Ruben sandwiches with side salads were very generous in portions.  Probably the best BLT for me; fried tomatoes and thick sliced bacon with brioche toast.  The Ruben was equally as good.  Everything was fresh and we'll assembled and made.  The house made Salted Caramel gelto was, well...delightful.   A return spot from now on, and will bring guests."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly by the ambiance, view of the 11th hole and the surrounding area and the friendly staff. We had just finished a very long 18 holes and went to the restaurant at roughly 4:30 for a very early dinner.It almost felt like lunch it was so darn early! Service was very attentive so that we had enough time to review the extensive menu with very many delicious sounding items on it. We both ordered soup - a creamy yet light textured four mushroom blend with deep mushroom flavor, the corn one was tasty yet needed a little bit of spice to bring up the flavor. 

The buffalo chicken sandwich was the bomb. A crispy and brown, beer batter fried boneless chicken breast nestled between a moist pretzel bun, blue cheese crumbles and a ranch dressing/aïoli. Spicy buffalo sauce was on the side so as to not make the crisp chicken soggy. That's when you know the chef knows what they're doing. OMG - super delicious!  

The shrimp tacos where also amazing. White shrimp cooked with peppers and a spicy red sauce and served in a hot little cauldron - actually a mini molcajete. The tortillas were good and as I filled and made my own tacos I was amazed that I had enough filling for all of the tortillas. At last count it was at least 20 shrimp and these were not tiny ones, they were of the approximate 31 to 40 count size, so there was about half a pound of shrimp (before cooking) in this order. Very good value. The cilantro sour cream sauce that came with them was very tasty with a good hit of cilantro and garlic flavor. 

The chocolate cake which was supposed to be one of those molten types was overcooked and did not have a soft center, but it had good flavor.

Good beers, decent wine choices and very nice service."}
{"text":"So disappointed last night.  One of our favorite places. Food is still consistently good however service( not our server) was so fast we could not enjoy our meal.  Entree arrived while we were still eating appetizer.   Tried to clear table while I still had fork in my hand. When it came time to leave we couldn't find anyone to tell about our experience.  This does not reflect on our server but the kitchen and other staff.  So sad. This is not the first time this has happened there.  Doubt we will ever go back."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in cave creek. The views from the patio are breathtaking even if you don't play golf. I can't even decide what I like best about the menu. Drinks, wine, appetizers, dessert and everything in between is consistently good. Even when we've had an unexpected problem with a dish they have always been quick to make things right. They have a pretty decent happy hour. It's a kid friendly resort but I've heard on other sites that you might want to leave your baby at home. That's ok with me because it's a fairly romantic place and I'd rather your kid not ruin my date night. Other than that, go there."}
{"text":"After scoping out this place online I was pretty excited to try it out and impress some friends with the expansive Vegetarian and gluten-free menus I saw online. We didn't meet there until after dark - and dark it was. We were seated outside where luckily the heaters were going, but there were no lights to show off the golf course - which, I do get given conservation of many means, but it was a bit disappointing nonetheless. It was just dinner outside on a chilly night next to a dark abyss. I guess the key is to make a reservation or make sure you can wait around for an inside table. 

The waitress was friendly, almost a bit overly so but still very nice.

The food was a disappointment for the non-vegetarians. My husband and I each had a burger expecting them to be amazing (they usually are at fancy golf courses) but no, we were both very let down and unimpressed. The veggies that our friends had looked tasty and seemingly more enjoyable. I'm certainly not out in Cave Creek often, and we made the trek from Surprise (visiting fam for Thanksgiving) to give our guests a good experience. I honestly wouldn't recommend this place based on my visit. I'm still bummed over it!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The setting is spectacular right on the golf course with a beautiful view of the mountains.  The service is good.  And the food was really quite good.  I enjoyed the chorizo and potato quiche with a southwestern caesar salad and my husband enjoyed the steak sandwich - 3 medallions on a blue cheese bruschetta with green beans and potatoes.   All in all, a very relaxing and enjoyable lunch!"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out. They sat us with a 2yr old and a 1yr old but no children's menu. When we asked our server if there were children's items she apologized and brought one but I heard the hostess lie and tell her we told her we didn't need one.  We were swatting at flies the whole time which was super annoying. And with the tables around us doing the same it was super distracting. Our server was nice and food quality was good except.....my wife pulled an 8 inch hair out of her sandwich! I waited until I paid the bill to let our server know about the hair so she knew I wasn't jacking around. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Will never be going back or recommending; rude hostess staff and poor reflection on Management.     

Upon arrival, the hostess wouldn't seat me on the patio because patrons wanting drinks were restricted to the inside bar area and the outside patio was for dinner reservation guests only.  I was shocked because it was 3:30 and many patio tables remained vacant - there was hardly anyone in the entire restaurant!!!   I even offered to order food and would gladly give up the table when they needed it for dinner but the hostess still refused to seat my parents and I outside.   Who turns away a customer willing to purchase alcohol and food + give you back a table for dinner guests?   The entire interaction with the hostess staff was rude and a poor reflection of the entire management.    My parents were in town visiting from Chicago and wanted to enjoy the warm weather sipping a cocktail on an outdoor patio.    I'll be drinking, eating, and enjoying a patio at another restaurant moving forward where they appreciate a repetitive patron."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Tonto.  In particular, the salads and other vegetables were well-prepared and unlike other restaurants a great deal of care was taken to make the vegetables unique and tasty.  Sadly, that quality no longer seems as high.  Everything is still good, just not worth a unique trip.  Plus, it's kind of pricey given the level of food.

That said, there is nothing better than looking out from their patio while sitting in the sun.  Definitely, a five star setting."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, rating went down because our server, well, he wasn't good at all. Lack of customer appreciation and service. We had to tell him thank you, instead of him thanking us for coming in.

We were seated outside which was perfect because the weather was PERFECTION. Little drops of rain didn't stop us from eating a spectacular meal. We ordered the calamari, all rings, such flavor and delish. We also got ordered the Orange-Barbecued Salmon which had
sweet potato, poblano & grilled corn hash, spaghetti squash with spinach, roasted garlic & mesquite honey jus, TO DIE FOR! We also ordered the Root Beer-Braised Short Ribs
Boneless beef short ribs, sweet potato, caramelized onion and leek gratin, preserved
orange broccolini, again, everything melted in our mouths. The food was great, the service could be better!"}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine in Cave Creek. The service is always good, and the food is on point. I just wish they would bring back the hummus app!"}
{"text":"Poor food!  The Ruben sandwich used to be exceptional. Yesterday it was very disappointing. It was dry, no jalapeños and skimpy on the corned beef and sour kraut. 
My wife had the walleye that also used to be exceptional. Yesterday it was a complete joke as to the portion size of the fish.  It was literally smaller than what you get on a McDonald's fish sandwich. No exaggeration!  After complaining, the manager brought us another tiny piece of fish that was way undercooked. At this point we left and will not return."}
{"text":"Well, they removed the BLT, ( from the menu ) sad, ....at $9.50/ I expected a better \"Bloody Mary\"....the arugula salad was over dressed ( soggy )...I would like to see my scallops lightly bronzed on both sides...( not on only one side )...we sat down on Sunday around 12:30, had to wait for a 2nd glass of wine ( you know what I mean ) no 5 star makes you wait, for anything, including the check....we waited and waited, then left with a bad taste in our stomachs...."}
{"text":"Lovely anniversary dinner - food is always to die for here - never a bad meal.  They accommodated my sons ask of pasta/cheese - my short ribs were amazing - my husband had the pasta with tenderloin tips - he was in heaven.  My aunt had the steak and loved it - my parents inhaled their dishes.  The ambience/atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.  We had a wonderful server Saturday evening who had a great sense of humor just adding to the wonderful visit.  Our anniversary was not 'announced' but our server's attention to detail was incredible as he overheard a conversation and took action to bring us a plate with chocolate goodies.  We shared a bottle of L'ecole with our entrees - - everything was perfect. A++  Can't wait to return. Cave Creek's hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Update 11/21/16: Dinner last night at Tonto Bar and Grill and it was a winner again.  Sand Dabs and Walleye were excellent.  Both fish were very fresh with superb raiins.  Great service, too."}
{"text":"Yelp search for vegan food led me and my mom here nice little place on a beautiful golf course. Friendly, knowledgable staff made my inner server glow when they knew which plate went where. Quite a few vegan dishes, delicious local wines. I really dug that they took a lot of local ingredients and added a nice flair to their menu.
Glad I came!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is fast. I always get their organic grass fed beef hamburger. Their patio is so nice. You get a great view of the golf course and ambiance is nice inside. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love bringing my out of town friends and family here. Awesome food, great service and beautiful views. Worth the drive and worth every penny. Love it!"}
{"text":"This was recommended while I was in the Phoenix area and it was a great choice for lunch.  The views (which are better from the outside patio but it was too hot for that) are nice and the food was above average.  I had the white shrimp tacos and they were well seasoned with great flavor.  The presentation was nice as it was an assemble your own on your own plate.  They could have easily enough called it a de-constructed taco. My collegue had the salad with scallops.  Two large scallops over greens, etc., and a Syria infused goat cheese.  Have to say the mauve color was rather off putting but the flavor was not.  Our third person had a burger which was just that but it did have sweet potato tator tots.  I would go back if I lived there."}
{"text":"beautiful view. little out of the way. food/drinks were decent."}
{"text":"We visited Tonto while traveling to Phoenix for work.   Gorgeous sunset from the outdoor covered patio.   Definitely worth the drive to enjoy the golf course grounds while dining.  The salsa sample with guacamole was our favorite.  Definitely a must order.  

Excellent, prompt service, whether it was delivering drinks or food, or refilling our water glasses.  

Nice variety of cocktails.  We sipped several different mules, martinis, and margaritas.  The bartender accommodated our requests to minimize the sugar,sweeteners in our drinks.  

I ordered the barbecue salmon.  It was okay, and that's why 4 stars.  The salmon was slightly over cooked and not fresh tasting.  The sides were fresh, but almost too many flavors within each accompaniment.   

I would return for the views on the patio over drinks and salsas."}
{"text":"Having had to give up golf due to the fact that something had to give a few years back it is not often that I get to a golf course. 

The Tonto Bar and Grill is sitting right on a beautiful Arizona course. A course I would be in trouble if I played as the fairways are narrow and the greens are small...from what I could see anyway. 

But this is not a golf review so lets get to it.....

Arriving at Tonto for our 6 P.M. reservation a little early so we could soak up some of the area I was mildly surprised by a group of women riding beautiful horses right in front of us and just in front of the sign for Tonto Bar and Grill. It was one of those things that just seemed right. 

Walking the path to the front door you are met with the usual AZ landscape fixtures...cactus...etc...but the lighting and structure are very warm and welcoming in that old west decor way. 

We are met by a couple of hostesses that oddly enough could not find our reservation. This was particularly odd by the fact that I still have the email confirmation response from them for the exact date and time we were there. Oh well...

We were seated outside overlooking the course and the Arizona countryside. The sky was clear and the weather was perfect. It was quite beautiful to say the least as the sun was going down and the painted sky darkened. 

After discussing whether or not to go with a bottle of wine the group decided to head off in their own respective alky direction. 

I ended up having the Dogfish IPA and it was a little mild for an IPA but good nonetheless!!

Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed/distracted/other and was not as attentive as one would expect at a place of this caliber. 

Her shortcomings did not frustrate the group as much as it could have and that is in large part due to the fact you can't help but be relaxed here.

Second beer FINALLY arrives and entrees are ordered!! 

I went with a NY Steak and asked for a substitute potato dish instead of the Yukon Gold fingerlings. 

Asking for a substitution of Sweet Potato Au Gratin seems easy enough but in the end it came a side dish. (See earlier statement about overwhelmed server)

The steak was overcooked but delicious. It was even better after I scraped off the unnecessary blue cheese. 

The Sweet Potato Au Gratins were a masterpiece. thinly slice potato stacked (think lasagna) about 3 inches high!! 

Everyone enjoyed their dishes and coffee and desert was ordered. 

The coffee was fine and the fruit covered creme  brulee was excellent!!


I look forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"You have to sit outside. Prettiest views ever! I think it's so great they have a separate vegan menu. I had the vegan tacos and they were delicious. I had to assemble them myself though. For the price I think they should serve them with a better presentation. The vegan gluten free dark chocolate cake with coconut sorbet was fantastic. It's pricey here, but that view makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"The Tonto Bar & Grill is a South West Style Golf Resort Restaurant with a large patio that overlooks a lovely desert golf course. We decided to try Tonto for dinner this time for restaurant week. I latter figured out the restaurant week price of $44.00 for my three course meal was about 50 cents different than the menu.

The weather was nice so I asked to be seated on the patio. I asked for a table in the shade and they pick a table in the blaring sun. At the time there are only two tables seated on the patio with 90% of the other tables available. This sort of rubbed me the wrong way at the time. I try one seat and it's facing the sun blinding me. I get up to try the other seat and the sun is burning my back. I say this table won't work for me. Then they tell me that the sun is only temporary.....Next they offer to seat me inside..how weird is that.....with 90% of the tables still available....Then they offer to set up an umbrella BECAUSE I MUST HAVE THAT TABLE in the blaring sun. I said I'll try it....and it was tolerable so I stayed there.

We get house baked bread and soft creamy butter that's good. Next we get appetizers of Crab Cakes and Compressed Arugula Salad...Both are very good.

All of a sudden they start watering the lawn. I GET SPLASHED with water a few times....

Then dinner arrives....
I get the Onion Crusted Walleye. I thought it was odd that my plate contained two very large piles of tarter sauce on both ends of the plate. I go to try the Walleye. It's almost good....actually it was good until I hit the bloodline and rubbery skin that's covered with onion crust.I was able to eat around it on the three pieces. The shredded carrots were steamed with no added flavor and were topped with fresh spinach. The Walleye in Fish Stick shaped pieces sat on top of what they called a Roesti Cake. It was potatoes that were semi mashed, shaped like a cake seasoned and lightly fried.The potato was good.

My husband got the Root Beer Braised Short Rib. The best part of the plate was the Sweet Potato Casserole with Cheese. It was tasty.......I tried a bite of the rib. It's stringy and sort of dry and very sweet. My husband insisted that I try the green beans. GOD they are a smoke bomb. I actually had to spit the green bean out. I thought the green beans were inedible but maybe other people would like them that way.

Lastly the desserts arrive.
We get a decadent Warm Buttermilk Chocolate Cake with house made pecan ice-cream and a Lemon-Lime Sour Cream Meringue. Both plates are filled with lots of details and extras like assorted cookies and a whimsical cute hand made sugar bumble bee. BOTH DESSERTS are VERY GOOD.


Once seated service was efficient.

Appetizers and the Desserts were VERY GOOD!

Dinner :(

Lovely Patio"}
{"text":"It's pricey, but the food is spectacular. There wasn't much on the menu that I didn't think sounded great. I would have given it 5 stars but out service was pretty slow so I just couldn't pull the trigger on that :)

Sit on the lower patio, the views (especially of the sunset) are amazing.

Definitely will be back. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed at 6pm."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's time I finally reviewed it. I went last night for my birthday and was so glad I did. They have a really special treat for birthday celebrants. Food, drinks, and  ambiance, all excellent. The only tiny negative - we had a smart aleck waiter who thought he was funny but wasn't. No problem we will just make sure we are not at his table next time."}
{"text":"Great food, superb service, wonderful menu.  My go to place for an elegant date night ... as Yelp says \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I's  favorite spot . The food is always great including the drinks . The staff is awesome and the grounds are stunning. A must try .....you'll be hooked !!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting but that's it. Service very slow, prices very high, and the food wasn't good. The real kicker of this establishment was having to wait in line to go potty. One urinal and one toilet. Hardly crowded but I still waited in line to go. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Visiting for a week, my wife and I had a date night out to Tonto.  Knowing Binkley's was down the street and being from the Bay area where good food is king, we didn't not want to get all caught up in a meal.  Instead going to Tonto, the food was good and atmosphere very nice.  I recommend the Corn Chowder soup but the Pork Chops I had were a little overdone.  Otherwise, if you are looking for a $100+ dinner for two....I would recommend if in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Wow. Great service. Clean space. Amazing views. Tonto meaning smart comes true to life at this restaurant. The food options are great paired with interesting ingredient combinations. A must go to if you're in the Cave Creek, AZ area."}
{"text":"I live in Phoenix and go to Cave Creek for a nice excape from the city. The lower patio is the best place to sit and enjoy the view. Decently priced food and a must try is the bbq salmon, spaghetti squash & spinach I substituted scallops potatoes instead of whatever it comes with."}
{"text":"Try the 3 sisters app- great fry bread and salsas. Gluten free bread for an up charge and great tacos."}
{"text":"The go-to restaurant in downtown Cave Creek for incredible food and ambiance.  Be sure to enjoy your meal on the outdoor patio if you are dining there anytime not during the summer.  Pricey, but worth very penny.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious burger (corn-fed) and Romaine Brie Salad - we split both, and it was a great meal, accompanied by sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting. Gorgeous Southwestern dining ambiance. Excellent eclectic Southwestern food. Great martinis. Nice place for event."}
{"text":"Busy at lunch so went outside to the patio to get seated sooner.  Had the nachos and fry bread with awesome sauce and guacamole.  The best part was the salmon.  It had an orange and BBQ tasty glaze.  Yum. Good service, good eats."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here, sit outside if you can and you can watch the golfers. Food is good, service is great. Nice, will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service every time I have been here. The servers are trained and knowledgable and well rehearsed without being stuffy. They also get a lot of help from the AMAZING crew of support staff who bus tables and deliver food. It's almost worth it just to go there to watch them strategically bus a table. They can carry so many plates without worry. I mean, it's hard for me to adequately express how impressed I am by these guys. 
Anyway, the food is always good, with fresh, quality ingredients and prepared with care. 
Tonto-Rita's are no joke. 
It's a little pricey for me but worth the money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Taken here for dinner earlier this month, April 2013. I'm from out of town.

The service was good. The atmosphere is very nice, especially in the evening. It's a busy, lively place.

We had several appetizers and a salad each. The seared tuna was pretty disappointing. It looked and tasted far more like sushi than what I expected from the description. The shrimp tacos were OK, nothing special. Hey, we were in the desert, can't expect seafood to be great, I guess. The fried bread and different salsa dips were good. All in all, pretty adequate, just not much more than that. 

With drinks, appetizers, salads and soft drinks, our bill for 5 came out to $150.00. Not cheap for what we ate.

I'd go again with a group, but would consider other local choices as well."}
{"text":"There was a great atmosphere here and we sat right on the golf course! The staff was extremely friendly and made sure everything was okay with us. They even have a Vegan menu, which was amazing. I had the Vegan tacos while my friend had the Mediterranean \"Pasta\" which was very delicious. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good priced vegan meal with a view in carefree!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat lunch after hiking at Spur Cross Ranch Conservation Area down the road.  There were twelve of us on the patio enjoying the surroundings and new friends.  I started with Sam Adams (a necessity after hiking) and some really delicious bread.  Several of us ordered the Crispy Iceberg  Lettuce, Fried Calamari, Wok Vegetables and Chili Garlic Dressing with the dressing on the side.  In asking the difference between large and small the waitress commented the large has been compared to a trough so we all ordered the small.  More than adequate with lots of hot calamari.  It turned out the chili garlic dressing was mild so we all piled it on.  

Good times on the patio after a great hike along three trails with wildflowers, giant saguaro and even a riparian area that was saved from developers a dozen years ago."}
{"text":"The Tonto Bar & Grill is located  at Rancho Manana which was a former dude ranch. The atmosphere is rustic southwest. The patio has a huge fire pit over looking the golf course 

Service was friendly and prompt. Our Server Nicole was helpful in helping us navigate the menu which is an authentic taste of Arizona with a wide selection and some great choices not found at most restaurants. 
The Tortilla Red Chili Pork soup has Anasazi beans, cotija cheese, cilantro and avocado crème. This soup is hardy and full flavor. The German Pork Schnitzel is tender and served with house made potato salad, lemon caper butter, sauteed green beans, herbed carrots and a grilled lemon. An old world dish with a southwest twist. 
Sauteed Pacific Coast Sand Dabs with a choice of potatoes, malt vinegar butter, roasted Brussels sprouts and gastrique onions. For the starch I choose the sweet potato hash with corn and chiles. An excellent combination of flavors. I consider Sand Dabs a real treat as they are not readily available"}
{"text":"One of the best lunches ever!!  Started with a wonderful margarita - house made, none of that awful sweet and sour mix.  I had the grilled long stem artichokes with a local cheese, chorizo fondue.  Absolutely delicious.  Great bread as well. My sweetie has the blt with fried green tomatoes.  Ate it all - which is unusual.  Came with great fries.  Our waiter, Martin, was great.  He couldn't get higher marks for service and graciousness.  Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit.

I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an \"A-OK\" rating, I just can't.  If 3 stars were for \"OK food\" then I'd give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better.

PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  

Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.  

But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, I'm gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the food that was served at my sisters wedding at Tonto bar and grill. The location of where they set up the reception is beautiful. There is a large tree next to it and it's overlooking the golf course. I'm not sure how involved the restaurant was in regards to the decor of the actual wedding so I will just talk about the food. They served three appetizers: empanadas, shrimp ceviche, and a caprese with burrata. The empanadas were honestly the best thing I ate the entire night. They were crispy on the outside and I don't even know exactly what they were filled with but they were delicious. I must of had about 10 of  these things throughout the night. Shrimp ceviche was good as well and the tomatoes with burrata were good but the tomatoes were so big that it was almost hard to eat them. The entree is where it went downhill for me. They served a southwestern style salad with a chipotle ranch dressing type of dressing. I was not a big fan of the side dishes that they had and for the main entree they served a pork tenderloin and a bbq chicken. I thought that the pork was flavorful but I heard from some people that there pork was pretty dry. Chicken was just okay but there was only bbq sauce on top of it and I wanted some more flavor. The appetizers got the night started off right but the entrees and sides made the experience mediocre for the food. There was also a discrepancy about the alcohol package that my sister and brother in law purchased with their meal package. They had told them that beer and wine was included, but at the end of the night the employees were stating that they needed to fork over $650 for the beer and wine. Hopefully they can get this fixed because that would be pretty messed up if they said it was included to find out that it wasn't."}
{"text":"If you ask me, the name \"bar and grill\" is deceiving. I hear that and think Chilis, Zipps, etc. Well, let me tell you, this place doesn't come close to being placed in the same category as your standard bar/grill. My parents are Cave Creek residents, and boy are we glad that Yelp helped us stumble across this place. 

The ambiance is great. Nestled in a resort on the golf course- gorgeous location with soft lighting. We sat on the patio which was enclosed and kept very warm on a cold day in the dead of (an Arizona) winter. 

The service was top notch. Our water glasses were never left less than half full. Those bussers were on it. The server made great recommendations and gave good insight on menu options. 

We went with the guac/salsa trio as an appetizer. It included a generous serving of fry bread and deliciously double fried tortilla chips-- so so good. The fry bread was a unique touch you don't typically see served with salsa/guac, but more restaurant should pick up on the idea!! 

For entrees, our group ordered a variety of stuff and we stole bites off of each other's plates, so we luckily were able to try a lot. The pork schnitzel was the table favorite- hands down. The lemon sauce served with the dish was heavenly. The bbq orange salmon was a close second, but very fishy. To be expected (duh, it's salmon), but I expected the sauce to be more overwhelming in taste. Not a bad thing, and definitely a delicious cut of salmon. Both pasta dishes were good, but I would not order those over the other options. Even the bread and butter to start was deelish. The blt got a good grade with sweet potato tots, as did the veggie dish-- just not standouts.

We'll be back!! I recommend it highly. Now, looking forward to trying their sister restaurant-- Cartwrights. And one last important thing to note- chocolate mints at the exit from the (free) gum ball machine. Gotta love that!!"}
{"text":"Located at the Rancho Mañana Golf Resort in Cave Creek. Beautiful setting. Get there in time to view the grounds by setting outside before the sun sets.
Good selection on the menu including steaks, chicken and fish."}
{"text":"Epic food either fancy or simple.  Consistent year around which is tough in a seasonal resort town. 

We have never had a bad meal.  Great staff."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! The vegetable nosh was fantastic! The short ribs were delicious! We wish we could have been seated outside. The atmosphere was great!
Dessert, chocolate cake, was super as well! Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week ($30). 

I had the arugula & manchego, candied Arizona pecan, sun-dried cherry, green apple salad with the pistachio vinaigrette. It was waaaaaay overdressed. Which was a bummer because the salad and the dressing were both good. I guess there is such thing as: \"too much of a good thing.\" 

My entree selection was the pork schnitzel served with warm German potato salad. Despite still being pink inside, it was tough for as thin as it had been -- not sure what happened.  I brought half of the pork home and it was barely better the next day. 

Of course, I had to save room for the white nougat semifreddo which was a great ending on warm summer evening.

The setting was pretty and the portions were generous. The food was good but not \"destination worthy,\" which is my measure for that fourth or fifth star, when places are outside my \"bubble.\" Mind you: I WILL (and often DO) travel for food. This is a place I would definitely stop at if I were already there but probably not make the trek to Cave Creek just for it."}
{"text":"I admit my rating may reflect that TBAG was our third attempt to dine out last Saturday night.  But dang, it was good!!!!

By the time we arrived at Tonto, it was close to 8.30.  We had spent almost one hour at the first restaurant hoping that we might eventually get food; only 5-10 minutes at the second establishment before we said: we're going back to Cave Creek----then there was the drive back from Carefree, so we were starving.  And we still needed to make sure the restaurant was vegetarian friendly.

Tonto IS vegetarian friendly! In fact, they have a menu that has a page of vegan offerings and a page of gluten-free. Wow!

Tho it was late, we never felt like a burden.  All the service was outstanding.  And the food was FABULOUS!  We way over-ordered because we were so hungry, but they also have eco-friendly take-away boxes!

We have decided Tonto is our new favorite Cave Creek restaurant.  (Altho we still love Heart & Soul)"}
{"text":"5 stars for perfect ambience, service, and affordable menu choices in addition to $$$$ menu choices. There is something for every palate and budget on this menu. We ordered a bottle of inexpensive $30 Chardonnay, a sushi roll, and 2 salads with 6 oz chicken. The salads were huge and delicious... We could have easily split 1 and made it a meal! The sushi roll was good but not off the charts, but worth a try.  The salads were approx $12 each... Amazing price for such stellar resort style surroundings!  We will be back! Next time will try the prickly pear margos!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing place to celebrate my birthday. We sat on the lower patio and enjoyed drinks, spectacular food, a sunset and a hole in one! (I can't promise you will see a hole in one) The staff was friendly, food outstanding, and the atmosphere was stellar."}
{"text":"My family of 6 people ate dinner here last Saturday night. We sat outside on the patio and received excellent service.  The food and drinks are spot on!  It is a busy place so make reservations.  It is in a golf community and used to be an old ranch so there are mature trees and beautiful landscaping."}
{"text":"We loved this place and hope to return someday. Brenda was our server and she was knowledgeable, attentive and amusing as well as a hard-core mom of teenagers.

We ordered bloody mary's, which we often do, and Brenda was the first server EVER to offer Absolut Peppar vodka which we always request anyways.

The food and wine was fabulous, I was happy with the wine selection which included a few local wines. The 4 of us shared a shrimp appetizer and a tortilla/Indian bread with salsas appetizer. Our salads were superb. I ordered a butter lettuce salad with lemon dressing. The ingredients in every bite were so fresh. For an early dinner my Mr. and I split a beef medallion which came with red bell pepper mashed potatoes. Delish.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for years and finally did! I was expecting so much more tho. My BLT was fantastic, but another person in my party ordered the BLT and her bread was over toasted. The service on the other hand... the waitress, Nicole (I think) was rather rude. She had a bit of an attitude when telling her what couples where on what tab, then rolled her eyes when another person asked for a mixed drink. She also was rude when clearing off the tables but realized it and finally said \"excuse me\" but again with a bit of a attitude. The bar tender was also pretty rude. I'm not sure if it was his first night working in a higher end restaurant but when I went to the bar before happy hour was over he lied and told me happy hour was over and that I would have to order my drink from my server. I later found out you couldn't order a drink from the bar if you had a table but the happy hour only took place in the bar. We would have loved to sat in the bar area but they didn't have a table large enough for all of us. Other than those 2 the place was good. The other servers were on point when filling up our waters and making sure we had plenty of bread and butter. Maybe it was just a bad night for Nicole the server and the bar tenders first night there. But when working in hospitality rolling your eyes and getting an attitude is not the best."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that gives you massive portions to allot for their somewhat higher pricing. However, overall I felt it was worth it.

We dined on the patio outside, along the golf course, in the evening when it was cooler out. I had a salad, which I mistakenly did NOT order the half size! I was brought a regular full size which could definitely feed a small family. Haha. Very tasty and fresh, I really enjoyed it.

Our server was a bit aloof. She just didn't seem to be there and maybe was a little stressed out or overwhelmed. Very sweet girl though."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad  meal at Tonto Bar and Grill.  The food is delicious (try the Walleye) and the ambience doesn't get much better any where else....Great seenic vistas on the large outside patio."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Made a reservation with open table: all time slots available. Arrive at restaurant and are taken to first table in the bar with a private wedding party. Incredibly loud and warm. Not close to being worth a $200 dinner. Expressed our displeasure but too bad it would be at least 1/2 hour for another table. One dinner out of four was an issue and the extremely generous manager offered us a desert on the house for one of the worst dining experiences ever. Trust me the attitude of the restaurant is not worth it. There are many great restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This is the place I go when I want to bring a friend to dinner or a guest from out of town. The atmosphere is so nice, comfortable, not loud, not crammed in. Small bar area. The Chef is phenomenal!!! Great for vegetarians also."}
{"text":"They wouldn't accept photo ID, we drove more than 30min there after work and they wouldn't let us order a drink with photo ID. Bartender was very rude, totally ruined our mood for dinning. Then later they canceled my reservation on OpenTable even we ordered already. I guess they were afraid we are going to leave a negative review in OpenTable and people can see it. Overall it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and always enjoyed the food.   The back patio is very nice and with 2 levels it offers a lot of seating.     We recently came for dinner on a Friday night.   

The Compressed Arugula salad was excellent.  I asked for light dressing and it was perfect.    The Black Cod dish was also very good (except for the potatoes which had a very odd flavor and texture).  My husband really enjoyed his   Prime Rib Steak and Cheese.   The Lemon-Lime Sour Cream Meringue Pie was a disappointment.  The crust was far too thick.    

The food came out quickly - far too quickly in fact.     I was not even finished eating my salad (and I am not a slow eater) and the entrees were served."}
{"text":"Tonto does a good job of infusing southwestern flair into the menu with prickly pear margaritas and Bison steaks.  I just get the feeling that sometimes one can go too far.  

Salmon with bbq sauce?  My short ribs were nicely cooked but they were smothered in a sauce which sort of distracts from the flavor.  Other items were equally hit and miss.  

The crab cakes are surprisingly good with a nice spicy slaw."}
{"text":"I am shocked that no one has reviewed Tonto Bar & Grill since Francesca's 4 star review back in March...

I've been to Tonto Bar & Grill a handful of times and I've never been disappointed.  Most recently, I went for lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  My BF and I sat outside and enjoyed the fresh air and beautiful view of the Rancho Manana Golf Course as we dined.  

I will agree with Francesca that this is a rustic but extremely classy restaurant.  It's warm and cozy inside and has the feel of a lodge but serves higher end cuisine... \"all natural\" meats and a variety of fresh salad, soups, veggies, breads, and desserts prepared daily.  I recently learned that Tonto uses many native AZ products and supports the Native SEARCH seed program (whatever that is but it sounds really great).

Back to my Sunday afternoon lunch...
After taking a while to peruse the menu and enjoying a fine basket of fresh bread and butter, we decided to share a large Cowboy Cobb Salad with Lemon Herb Vinaigrette and Crumbled Bleu Cheese.  The salad came with chicken, bacon, egg, tomato, cucumber, and an avocado fan on top.  It was the perfect size for 2 to share and they split it in the kitchen for us which made it easy.  Since we were hungry we each ordered a side item as well.  I had the acorn squash - it was seasoned just right and melted in my mouth... I would order it again and again - it tasted like candy!  I think Jared was envious of the squash since he kept coming back for more.  He ordered the barley and mushroom risotto as a side and he enjoyed it but it didn't compare to the acorn squash.

Service was pretty good although our side items were not brought out until at least 10 minutes after our salad.  The view of the golf course made up for that easily, as did the fact that we were in no rush. 

In past visits, I've tasted the salmon, scallops, and grouper as well as several of the veggies.  I love that the menu has so many options to choose from... there is something for everyone from the meat and potato lover to the strict vegetarian.  It's really fun to go with a group so you can taste a little of everything.

Tonto Bar & Grill is a great spot that is worth venturing out to if you're looking for something different!"}
{"text":"Quintessential Arizona Dining....beautiful views and excellent food.  There is a reason this is the most popular place in town!"}
{"text":"Although we have golfed here several times, this was the first time eating at the restaurant and we really enjoyed it. The ambiance is very nice. Very rustic cowboy with higher end dining done in a casual setting. If your a golfer, a local or vacationer, all is welcomed and it feels comfortable. This would be a great location to take out of town guests to. We had the corn chowder and tamale crusted crab cakes to start and then we shared the entire which was the Pork Schnitzel. We enjoyed all the dishes. Great food, setting and service. The patio in colder months is heated and the views are spectacular."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for me and my girlfriends. The food is always good, and the ambiance is relaxed yet very pretty. I have yet to have a dish that I don't like."}
{"text":"I had be shrimp tacos and they were fantastic!! Highly recommend!! The atmosphere is pretty nice and fancy. Great service and awesome appetizers!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable vibe here.  Warm and cozy decor complete with good food and service.  Moderate pricing.  The outdoor patio is especially enjoyable on a pleasant aggression or evening."}
{"text":"Great views, great food. Love it. Enjoy bringing out if town guests here or going here for special occasions."}
{"text":"From soup to nuts this was a great place. The view is spectacular from the outside garden. The only negative would be the food is served rather quickly between courses. The server advised me that in the future just tell them to slow down a bit and it will be done. Nothing bad to say about this place"}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict , great service and wonderful golf course views on Tonto Patio. Nice setting to take that special someone."}
{"text":"This place was so awesomely good. It had a cozy atmosphere, a great waitstaff, and the food was to die for. The flavors were robust and interesting. We had the Three Sisters Salsa, the special soup (a lovely, mildly spicy Pozole soup), and then I had a Tumbleweed salad with Mesquite-grilled tenderloin. Other at my table had the tempura ahi tuna roll (and it was a HUGE hit), the white shrimp tacos, and the penne pasta. Each and every one of us were impressed. 

For a bunch of out-of-towners looking for some tasty Arizona eats, this was the place to be."}
{"text":"Not that good anymore. The happy hour is ok. If your looking for a great place in that area, go to the lariat in carefree !!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked on a beautiful golf course. Nestled in with views of the greens the food was plentiful and the service attentive. 
The waitress didn't use a pad and remembered everything. Plenty of vegan and vegetarian options and a staff wanting to please. The vegan chocolate cake was amazing. Great place to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here on several occasions and it is awesome!  The bread they bring to the table (made there) is wonderful and warm and the food is so good. I really like the grass-fed burger and it is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Being on a golf course, the views are really nice too."}
{"text":"My friend was in town house hunting. We were exhausted and hungry. I remember the hummus trio app on the menu. My friend is a vegetarian. We ordered the trio which was very good. I enjoyed all the fresh cut veggies on the plate. We both ordered salads. I had the compressed arugula salad. WOW! Delicious! I am craving this salad. I like that you can order two different sizes with the salads. 
Our server Nicole (I think that was her name) was fabulous. The servers assistants are on spot filling our glasses of Arnold Palmer's. Great experience for my friend who will soon be a Creeker!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite in Cave Creek or anywhere, for that matter. Friendly staff, unequaled ambiance and outstanding menu. The corn chowder is a meal
In itself, and the best burger of local corn or grass fed beef in the West more than satisfies. If you want a mid afternoon bite with your cocktail, the crispy deviled eggs reign, or dip into Three Sisters Salsa...delicious! Worth a drive into the country...you have time to experience this special place!"}
{"text":"I usually don't go this low with the stars but this restaurant deserves it. I had come across the country to visit my family and the first night here we went to this restaurant. I called to make sure my therapy dog was allowed, they said yes. I have heart failure so my dog can detect if my defibrillator will go off when I am not home. I also have PTSD from being so ill for 33 years. I have a lot of medical problems but I don't look it, and I was still almost half the age of most diners. A very elderly man started being very rude to me because of my therapy dog who weighs less than 8 pounds. He was two tables away and my dog didn't bark or bother him in anyway. This man asked me what was wrong with me \" it was really none of his business\" I started with my 3 kidney transplants and he laughed and said he had a shoulder transplant. What ignorance! He was getting loud as was I. Not the server or manager or anybody from the restaurant came over as a matter of fact they were snippy with me. I have never encountered anything in my entire 53 years of life like this. They allowed me to bring in my pet because it is the law yet did nothing when I was being humiliated and berated by this man. My family member had to stick up for me when he wouldn't shut up! As for the expensive food? The crabcakes were bland. The scallops tasted like nothing as a matter of fact the best part of my meal was the little bit of food they put under the scallops. The strip steak and filet were fine but the Mac n Cheese and Asparagus were not. You can decide if you would like to pay for that kind of service or food. If you are handicapped I would steer clear of this place!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely am in love with the steak with blue cheese butter, but the last time I went, well it frankly just sucked.  It was Father's Day, so I'm hoping it was because they were so busy... but I hope the next time I go I won't be disappointed.  Please DONT start sucking!!!  I've been bragging about you for everrrr!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a nice view of the golf course.  A good selection of food and/or salads.  The food is always tasty and wait staff are pleasant.  The only things is it appears a bit dark in the restaurant.  Sometimes it is hard to see the menu with the lack of lighting."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Tonto Bar & Grill is my favorite place to eat in AZ.  We've been coming here for special occasion dinners for close to 10 years and I've never been disappointed.  If the weather's nice, definitely get a seat on the patio - amazing views with occasional javelina sightings!  I always order the schnitzel and it's AMAZING - though the burgers, pastas and salads are incredible as well."}
{"text":"This is such a cool. Restaurant.. I go here quite often, with family and friends.. beautiful  view of mountains,  and golf course, the food is good,  and they have great Margarita's...."}
{"text":"The food and service were just average tonight. I was surprised how long it took the waiters to light the outdoor heaters knowing the sun went down a 1/2 hour prior to the heaters turned on."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Tonto last night. The Mexican martini was fantastic made with real lime juice.  The gazpacho was amazing with a bit of a Mexican twist (jicama and a small amount of spice).  The ancho rubbed filet was just right and accompanied by potatoes with manchego cheese was a real winner.  We finished our evening with a slice of the lemon lime meringue pie.  Really one of the best meals we've had in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Our go to place for when we want a nice dinner and feel like being pampered a bit. Great menu, nice drinks and always top notch service.  Do your self a favor, have lunch on their patio on a beautiful day over looking the patio or on a gorgeous evening on the patio.  You will love it. The prices are just a tad high for us to go often but 100% worth every penny.  Make reservations for the weekends because there is usually a wait. Love this place."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer was great! But the pasta we ordered was flavorless. It took a while for our server to come back and re fill our drinks and they were not busy. But hey everyone has their off days."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now, once with friends who took me, and the other time with my husband.  Both times it was great!  The service was really good, and the food is great.  The atmosphere is casual to fine dining, an in between.  The history of the building and art inside is really cool!  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!  The people are always so friendly, and the atmosphere is fantastic!  It's romantic, family friendly, and relaxed all at the same time.  The food is great!  We especially like to dine out on the patio."}
{"text":"Great view! There was evening a wedding going on there. Wonderful food and a great place to bring out of town guests during good weather."}
{"text":"Nice looking place , stopped in for an early dinner , staff was very friendly , Sara our waiter very nice , started with the devilled eggs which we didn't care for much , wife had the orange crusted salmon which was awesome , I had the prime rib sandwich it was also very good , for $65 we thought it was well worth it , looking at other guests dishes we would like to come back and try something new"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints.  Great location, service, food and drinks.  The tontorita is the best margarita and their guac and salsa with homemade fried bread and tortilla chips is amazing.  This is the real deal. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my wife and I's favorite restaurant in town. The appetizers are great and if you can get a seat on the patio during sunset it is breathtaking. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"John and his team run a great place.  The ambiance is great, menu impeccable, and love the wylie javelina that roam the property.  I take guest here all the time."}
{"text":"This is everything you want dining in Arizona to be. The views from the patio area were beautiful. The menu has solid choices at each price point. I would highly recommend the chips and salsa appetizer that comes with guacamole and fried bread. The interior has a very authentic feel."}
{"text":"The menu looked fabulous but every meal at our table was average in flavor and appearance. The meals were quite pricey for lunch; I had the onion crusted walleye which was $26. The fish was moist and the portion size was good but the meal was quite bland. I also tried one of the cocktails, the Wild Silvestre Cooler ($13). It was syrupy sweet - like not drinkable. I asked for them to put it in a larger glass with more soda water and lime - this made it drinkable but not good. Overall, the customer service was good, the setting (outside patio overlooking the golf course) was very nice but the food was disappointing. I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, and food is, as always, delicious.  Price point for 2 for Anniversary Luncheon was around $100 after tip, no drinks.  Parking is tight if you get here during \"peak\" hours.  High percentage of seniors in the \"audience\" just as an FYI--nothing wrong with that, just not a \"younger crowd,\" as to be expected, I guess, in Cave Creek.  Everything is pretty much organic and expertly prepared.  Lots of menu variety.  Eclectic interior that in one section lets you cozy up by the fire.  We have always enjoyed eating here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"How totally incredible to have such exquisite fine dining after a long day of museums, hikes, and visits.  You will need to make reservations at least 2 days in advance.  The chef prepared our meal in such a way that every layer of taste was delivered with perfection.  I had the smoked salmon with white cream sauce, lemon and capers. We were seated on the patio facing the golf course with heaters going and the stars were out.  The staff was superb; everything about this restaurant makes it our HIGHEST recommendation for fine dining in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The perfect afternoon at Tonto is 2 prickly pear margaritas, the Three Sisters Salsa with a side of guac, and dessert. Their desserts are often-changing (sometimes, just made for that day) and awesome! We are usually the youngest people in the place. But, we are usually there on Friday afternoons or weeknights.

When there for dinner, I get a burger and sweet potato tots. The margaritas are good...not weak like some of the local places. I am pretty happy after two. 

If you go on your birthday, tell them. You get this little box with a couple of handmade chocolates. TO DIE FOR! Also, follow them on facebook. They post pics of new dishes and dessserts a few times a week. Sometimes we change our plans based on these pics!"}
{"text":"We returned to Tonto Bar & Grill for our 2nd visit.  We are staying at the Rancho Manana Resort, so the restaurant is very convenient.  We ordered the grass fed beef burgers with fries.  They were cooked perfectly and the taste was awesome.  We try to stay with our organic and non GMO diets as much as possible and this was the perfect solution for us.  Can't wait to come back to Cave Creek and eat here again."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite restaurants. Had lunch there yesterday. Each of us got a salad which was mediocre at best. The price of a salad was $16 without any protein. I got the Cobb. I had to hunt to find the peppered bacon. Mostly romaine and some halves of cherry tomatoes. The lemon vinegrett was not great either. My friends felt the same about their salads - expensive and not very good. The drinks were expensive and small. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and practically had to beg to get a drink k of celery and a pickle in it.   Sorry Tonto's but it is not likely I will be back due to disappointing food and a server that didn't have the smarts to make it invisible to the customer in order to give them what they wanted."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, views and food, everything Arizona has to offer
AND MORE, the staff is always friendly food is always excellent
and atmosphere is peaceful and sooooo southwest....
the furnishings unique and menu always changes, love it!"}
{"text":"This place  used to be our go to place in Cave Creek. But yesterday 3/16/18 was the worst food that we have ever have in many years. My wife order the Ruben Sandwich, the meat was very dry and hard. This being 1 day before St Patrick's day you would think that they would have a good supply of corn beef on hand. I ordered the cream corn soup as a starter, there was absolutely no corn! It was almost like warmed up milk. My main course was the Prime rib and cheese steak sandwich, with grilled onions. I kid you not, there was less than 1 oz of beef on the sandwich. There was about 3 oz onions, which over powered the taste. The meat was not what I call Prime rib either. I should have sent it back, but we had been waiting a long time and we had other tings to do. The Kicker is when the waitress came to ask about our food, she made a comment that the best Prime Rib sandwich that she likes is just down the road! This used to be the place to bring our out of town guests for a great meal; BUT NOT ANY MORE!"}
{"text":"We used to love this grill.  The previous chef left and they hired some young chef who can't hold a candle to the previous chef.  Too bad, we really liked going up to Cave Creek for dinner.  Better pass now."}
{"text":"Food, service, and ambieance was excellent! Definitely recommend take a nice drive to cave creek to enjoy the scenery and beautiful weather this time of year. I had the filet, it was delicious! Wait staff was attentive, one man adjusted umbrellas continuously as the sun was setting to be sure no one had sun in their eyes!"}
{"text":"The service was great as was the entire staff we encountered. The food was a disappointment.  Happy to pay relatively high cost for good food but this place didn't deliver."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Carefree area.  I have never been disappointed with the food.  I love to sit outside and look at the golf course.  They light heaters at night, when the temperatures drop on the course.  There is a great small patio off of the bar that is very nice, too.  The staff is extremely attentive.  It is a beautiful place.  Many of the \"locals\" dine there, so that is a great recommendation.  It can be semi-casual.  It is a good place to take a date or out-of-town visitors.  All in all, it is a classy place with fabulous food..... grass-fed beef, too!!  The vegetable nosh is extraordinary."}
{"text":"Hamburger (corn fed variety which means it's from Iowa) was good, chips and salsa were ok but what I loved about this place was sitting there for 2-1/2 hours and looking out at the beautiful yard with the hill in the distance.  Boy, when I find a guy to go out with we're going there....muy romantico!
Cute, clean, nice place and would I go back?  Yup...sure would.
The lunch to me was just okay, but I was with a whole bunch of girlfriend and with the good service and excellent view...well, it was just a perfect place for a long chat."}
{"text":"The setting, decor and energy are a 5 star. Sitting outside, under heaters if the night is cool, with candlelight and golf course and mountain views is spectacular. The menu includes burgers and sandwiches, seafood, vegetarian and beef dishes. The problem for us was that the food was lousy. Short ribs were dry, pasta bland with a crunchy something in it that was odd. A side Caesar salad ($7) was boring and tasteless. What a disappointment. The setting is so charming that we might go back but we'd try burgers and see if it's better."}
{"text":"Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! We ate in the bar. Lovely setting. Yummy food and cocktails. Great service. My BLT with fried green tomato and avocado was delicious. My friend enjoyed their tacos. I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos, which were fabulous. My mom had the chicken tacos, which were less flavorful than mine. (She also didn't like that she had to put her own lunch together. I thought it was fun and I like to control the condiments, so I was perfectly happy to assemble my tacos). 

Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, nice beer list. I haven't eaten in Carefree, but my guess is that it's worth the short drive to head over here for lunch in the middle of a Carefree shopping day!"}
{"text":"We've been to their other restaurant several times so we thought we'd love this place.  The service was ok, although we did need to hunt down a server on a few occasions to fill our drinks.  The main dish of pork schnitzel was too greasy, I barely touched my plate.  The salsa appetizer was good, especially the indian fry bread. We'll probably give it another try since we are locals, but we liked Cartwright's so much better."}
{"text":"Tonto Bar & Grill continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the North Valley.  The food is consistently impressive.  I have had multiple items including the root beer braised short ribs and various seafood items.  None have disappointed.  They have a few beers to choose from and full bar.  The deserts menu changes seasonally and not being a big dessert guy, have to admit theirs are delicious.  I highly recommend sitting on the patio near sunset.  The patio is right on the golf course, but not close enough to get an errant ball.  I've been there about 5 times and every time I say we should go more often."}
{"text":"Went to Tonto Bar and Grill the day before Thanksgiving to pick up our Thanksgiving to go order.  I'll talk about that later.  We decided to stay and order a couple of apps an drinks at the bar.  The beers were great.  Their chicken corn chowder was the best I've ever had.  The three sisters salsa and chips was good but not the best.  The guacamole was pretty delicious, I will say.  I look forward to going back.  We picked up their Thanksgiving to go for the next day and that was quite delicious.  Being from out of town, we didn't want to spend all of our time cooking for two people but we also didn't want to dress up and go out so we got dinner from them.  It was a great decision.  The food was delicious and was enough to have leftovers for the day after Thanksgiving.  Love this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was a bit apprehensive about dining at Tonto Grill. My husband and I ate here perhaps 8 years ago and cannot recall anything memorable. In addition, some of the reviews here gave me pause, however, the three other diners and I were exceptionally happy with our dining experience here. 
The service - friendly, professional and attentive. The staff were every thing you want in a fine dining experience. Nice job Nicole and Devon. 
We started off with calamari and crab cakes. We really enjoyed our appetizers, particularly the crab cakes layered on roasted chili slaw. The slaw was a wonderful compliment to the crab cakes which had a beautifully crusted outer layer. We really enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures.
For our main courses, two of us had the walleye pike, one had the filet, and another had the seared scallops.  As I was taking my first bite of my walleye, I heard a unison of mmmmm around the table as the other 3 diners took their first bites. The flavors of each protein and its accompanying vegetable side were absolutely delectable. I had the opportunity to sample all the entrees - each was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. We spoke with the Chef Miguel to extend our thanks and congratulations on such a remarkable and enjoyable meal. 
To top off the entrees we each ordered a dessert - lemon meringue pie, buttermilk chocolate cake, chocolate coconut cake and creme brûlée. I would consider the desserts all A+ as everyone finished theirs (except me who could not get another bite in). 
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here except for one small misstep - the coffee - which was way too strong. It was an exceptional meal and we will certainly recommend Tonto Grill and Chef Miguel."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food is always consistently fresh and good just wish they'd broaden their draft selection."}
{"text":"I guess our server needed us out in a hurry. I barely touched my salad before the entrees came. The drink orders weren't right, and there was a child just running and screaming in the bench seats. It all ruined a relaxing night I was looking forward to. The food was very good, though."}
{"text":"We are moving to this neck of the woods soon and even though we'd dined here a few years ago, we wanted to try it out again, now that it's in \"our neighborhood\". SUPERB!  We had two friends with us who loved it and were surprised, like us, at the \"upscale-ness\" of the menu.  The food was beautifully presented and really delicious!  We had the pork schitzel, barbecued salmon (and our guests had something else I can't recall what).  We all loved the food.  The ambiance is cozy, \"Old West\"...charming & intimate.  Our server, Nicole, was a doll.....funny, informative, & very accommodating to our questions & requests.  There was a wedding on the patio and it looked like the guests were having a ball  (it was a lovely setting).
Toto Bar & Grill is Definitely now on our list of \"regular\" dining experiences.....as good or better than many of the chi-chi, high-end restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We found the best food - quality and value - at golf resorts.  Go figure.  Staff seemed to outnumber guests, but they weren't in the way.  Portions were very generous considering the reasonable prices.  Tuna roll appetizer was a meal in itself.  The house burger (i got the grass fed version), cooked just as I wanted it (medium rare), and with the fixings I was completely stuffed.  Their special wine was a Stag's Leap - need i say more?  We sat on the terrace overlooking a fairway and green, and surrounded by gorgeous mountains, saguaro cacti and vast blue sky.  I was happy to pay the bill."}
{"text":"The food here has gotten better over the years. Have been coming here about 5 years now when we visit my sister. Love the salads and the fish dinners.  We will continue to come every time we are in town."}
{"text":"We eat here fairly often, and while I am not happy with some of the portion sizes/prices, it is still always a top-notch experience. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable and the gluten-free offerings are among the best anywhere. One of the best restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Had reservations for four last night.  Place was slammed with people, very crowded.  We were told we had to wait later than our reservation time, then when seated, told we had to wait for drinks because the bar was backed up.  For an upscale restaurant, poor planning, intentional overbooking - felt rushed and not relaxing like a diner. Waiters pushing through waiting crowd in the foyer. 

Arugula salad delicious but crab cakes overpowered by flavor of the corn and the calamari boring, not hot.  The main dishes bland, just average. Overall disapponting."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ventured out to Arizona for a weekend. We came across Tonto and decided to give it a go for lunch (looked beautiful from the outside, set in a country-club setting with amazing vistas). 

We began our meal with the 3 sisters salsas and chips. The chips were homemade and absolutely incredible. The accompanying salsas were also delicious. 

I ordered a burger and it was incredible. Without question, one of the top 10 I have ever eaten in my lifetime. I'd detail it all, but pretty much every aspect was good. 

One of the better meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is the place to bring visitors and meet friends.  Food is always good.  Servers are prompt and informative about specials, etc.  Nothing is more wonderful than sitting outside on a warm winter day, watching the golfers and javelinas and having lunch with friends.  I love the salad choices...with or without protein.  Have been going here for years....with gratitude!"}
{"text":"Excellent Az wine and appetizer menu.  Pricey, but worth it.  Kind of out in the middle of bfe, do make sure you can drive afterwards.   Oh and be on the lookout for wild boars running around especially at night."}
{"text":"Great and civilized dining.  Good menu.  Atmosphere is worth the visit.  Have had dinners and lunch there.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. A true taste of Arizona in a picturesque dining room.

Their burgers and Steaks are especially impressive, but really everything I've ever tried has exceeded my expectations. 

They also have an in-house pastry chef - so desert is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Love eating outside overlooking the golf course or in the bar. They have a fabulous burger and great martinis. Try the happy hour. 
They serve Walleye and sand dabs, which you don't see very often in AZ.
Very pretty setting."}
{"text":"Cave Creek probably has the best restaurants per capita in Arizona!  In business since 1994, Tonto Bar and Grill may be the dean of Cave Creek fine dining.

We had a Saturday reservation at 5:30pm and by 6:00pm there wasn't an empty seat in the place.  As aptly described in Cameron K's review, the tontorita is not to be missed!  Mine was lightly splashed with orange juice and I look forward to another one soon.

I don't normlly pay much attention to the obligatory basket of bread, but Tonto's was freshly baked, flavorful and served with whipped butter.

The salads are completely fresh and the presentation is excellent.  I had the compressed arugula and Spanish manchego cheese salad with candied Arizona pecans, sun-dried tomatoes, tart cubed green apples and pistachio vinaigrette.  Like the tontorita, I look forward to having this, again, soon!

My entree was a bowl of penne pasta with sauteed beef tips, black beans, corn, tomatoes, red onions, and feta cheese in a very mild red chili sauce.  I hate to use the old cliche, but it was a taste explosion in my mouth!  It was delicious beyond description.

Finally, my two friends and I divided dessert three ways and we had the warm buttermilk chocolate cake with candied pecan ice cream and warm chocolate sauce.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it was off the charts at about a 30!!!

This is a favorite place to take out of town guests.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is excellent and the food is marvelous.  It is a place that guests will long remember and talk about after their visits to Arizona."}
{"text":"Buh-Bye Tonto.  I have been going to Tonto for 13 years.  This has been my go to celebration restaurant, birthdays, anniversaries, retirements, Saturday afternoons, etc. After today's experience, I'm taking a sabbatical.  The veggie nosh portion has been shrinking for at least six months.  Today I ordered the Manchego scalloped potatoes, the sweet potato leek onion gratin, the spinach, asparagus and carrots.  The carrots were unremarkable in flavor.  Spinach was good but literally was a mere three bites, TINY portion.  Asparagus was too charred, all 6 spears.  The Manchego potatoes were drowning in butter and cream, which is delicious but disallowed any significant flavor or texture for Tonto to call their own. The sweet potato gratin had a little more flavor but was, like the spinach, a child size portion.  

I usually order the lemon caper sauce but today I tried the basil pesto cream.  Ga-ROSS!  Seriously, tasted like detergent was the primary ingredient, basil was undetectable.  

The service has also been declining.  Gone are the servers like Judah and Cody.  The last server I had (before today) was indifferent and almost irritated (white dude, receding hairline, tidy beard).  Today's server was SLOW and also indifferent.  Katie did not stop by after the food was delivered by runners to see if all was well.  After 8 minutes I flagged down a busser to advise that my mom was missing spinach,one of the five portions of her Nosh, which reminded me that my last nosh had also been served missing the spinach.  How do  you leave off one of five things?!  A side of spinach was delivered. It was a grown up size and I was jealous.  Katie eventually came to ask about dessert, we asked for a menu, she delivered and then disappeared.  We wanted the warm chocolate buttermilk cake, two of them.  But by the time she returned to learn of this, our disappointment ruined the moment..  The bill, I'm not kidding, took FOREVER.  I sent my mom out ahead of me.  She stopped a manager to chat about the food experience; the manager did acknowledge that the portions were smaller and added that it was because people were taking leftovers home.  Uh, yah, that's called breakfast.  The manager must have cornered Katie to brief her on our disappointment, which only caused me to sit there longer waiting for my credit card.  Katie was sorry we did not enjoy our lunch.  The bill was not adjusted.  No dessert to go offered. Just \"Sorry\"...for less food, less taste and poor service.

The bussers and runners were AMAZING.  Somehow that hasn't changed.  They are professional, diligent and cooperative.  

Tonto, I'm out."}
{"text":"Two words... buttermilk calamari!  Melt in your mouth calamari was the perfect way to start our dinner.  I had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection.  My husband had the short ribs and enjoyed every bite.  This place did not disappoint and we had a really enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"The entire room is wood wall to wall and dark.  We didn't sit on the patio because it was warm outside.  Service was good in the beginning but about 2/3 through our meal the server was gone and never seen again until the bill was finally brought to us.  We ordered grass fed beef burgers and they were rather dry.  Nothing was special just ordinary you could get anywhere.  Kind of pricey for ordinary fair.  I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The food here used to be outstanding, not today...we both ordered the tonto burger $13.50 ea. I don't know where they are getting there beef from these days but it was horrible and the fries soggy!!Our waitress Cara did not\" cara\" a bit about service, had to wait at least 15 minutes for our bill! We would always bring out of town guests here for the food and views...won't be doing that anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"Service was great...food so so. Salmon special was not great. Chips and salsa was enough for 8 of us. They sat us in the patio and although there were heaters it was very uncomfortable. Wouldn't choose to return."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my girlfriend and her food was great! My tacos were decent at best, but that burger she had (goat cheese burger) was amazing! The only knock I have for this place is the corn tortillas were stale and it smelled a bit like there was a sewage issue. Sounds worse than it really was, but overall it was a good experience. I'll be back to see if those things have been resolved!"}
{"text":"Tonto Bar & Grill is always a great place to grab a drink and some appetizers after a round of golf.  It's also a great place for lunch and dinner.  I can't say I've ever had a bad meal or bad experience here.  I also can't say I've ever been \"wowed\" here either.  Overall, it's just a really great place to relax and have a few drinks or a great meal."}
{"text":"It's Sunday. You got the special car out of the garage and need a good destination to take it that'll allow you to open it up on the way.  And it's been way too long since the last vacation so that your shoulders seem permanently affixed to your ears.  A trip to Tonto Grill left me feeling like some might feel from an afternoon at the spa - if one were into spa treatments.  After finally getting around the 40MPH-in-the-50MPH-zone signtseers, we were able to get full throttle for a few miles before reaching that No Car Fun Zone called Carefree.  But it was enough.  Let's drive over to Cave Creek.

Our food was more than enough.  Started with a cocktail, which got me a weird look from the waitress but she politely obliged...they must not do much cocktail business at lunch.  It wasn't so great, so think I'll stick to iced tea or wine in the future.  The food was outstanding.  The sesame and poppy seed encrusted bread they left at the table was full of flavor and just the right level of chewy.  I got the day's special - lamb chops on cranberry-orange risotto.  Though the lamb was a bit pinker than the medium I ordered, it was still excellent; so tender and full of juicy flavor.  The risotto was amazing - nuff said.  Lunch partner loved the open faced steak sandwich sitting on a pile of mashed potatoes and topped with a tempura battered onion ring.  Of course I snarfed the leftovers. The wine based sauce with mushrooms was wonderful.  Wait staff was very eager to please and gladly fulfilled every request, but usually they did it before we had to.  Creme brulee for dessert was some of the best I've had.  So we sat and sat at our patio table on the green tree-lined golf course.  After a bit there was a distinct popping sound - ears releasing their grip of shoulders.  aaaaahhhhh"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today on a business trip and can't say enough about how awesome this place is and the scenery was...settled right on the golf course and majestic mountain views all around is the setting for this place.  Immediately when you walk up you can smell the food permeating from here and I was immediately looking forward to what was to come. Walking in a very rustic old southwest feeling and an awesome patio setting. We were greeted right away by our server and she went over the daily specials. I personally decided on the BBQ salmon and wow this was cooked perfectly and the sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash were amazing. This a great lunch sized portion and very light. Great hidden little gem and highly recommend you stopping here for lunch or dinner if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm writing this on behalf of my parents' experience.
My parents drove to this restaurant from Mesa (50 minutes each way) for their 27th Anniversary, and made reservations for Saturday night because my mother had been here before for lunch and loved the view and ambience. 
They asked to be seated on the patio, but was told by the hostess that it would be 45 minutes, and they ended up being seated in a not-so-great location by the door. They viewed a number of empty tables on the patio, and noticed people being seated on the patio. They then went back to the hostess and explained that it was their anniversary and wondered if they could be seated on the patio or another better location, and they were rudely told once again that they couldn't be seated on the patio or moved to a better location because it's a highly sought after area, and if they want to sit on the patio they would have to wait 30 minutes or they should have asked about it when they made the reservation (which wasn't made clear over the phone). 
They ended up not leaving, and endured additional poor service - water wasn't refilled, food took a long time, bill took forever (they had to hunt someone down to get it to them), etc. The restaurant attempted to make up for it by giving them one truffle on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate, which they denied because of the poor service and horrible experience. My parents rarely go out, and when they do they dress up and want to go somewhere nice, so this experience left my mother in tears. No one was accommodating, the service was horrible and everyone was rude to them. This is shameful for a restaurant to do to a couple who are trying to celebrate a special occasion, so they will never make that drive again and go back to this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for AZ restaurant week and It did not disappoint. The smell of the food cooking alone is amazing. Love the AZ decor and ambiance. The menu showcased some of their best dishes. I did crab cakes as my appetizer, the filet as my meal and lemon merengue pie as dessert. My hunny did the crab cakes, salmon, and then chocolate dessert. ALL of it was Delicious! Amazing presentation! We sat outside and it was gorgeous. The service was good. The steak was top notch! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Awsome setting offering indoor-outdoor seating.    Something for everyone to eat.   Great service, reasonable price.   Suggest reservations as they are busy."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this another star. This has always been one of my favorite restaurants. I love the ambiance and always bring out of town guests here.
The other night we ordered the corn chowder, which I always thought was the best in the area. It was nothing like it had been for the last several years. We asked our server what happened...her reply was...well maybe tonight's chef made it differently!  What? People return to restaurants because of consistency.
We were a bit disappointed....will go back, but not for a while."}
{"text":"Great food and cuisine.  The mescal and three sisters were a nice touch.  Food was well prepared and the service was outstanding. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"We always take out of town guests here for the amazing views of the golf course and great food. We almost always see some wildlife right around sunset on the patio. Very friendly servers. Even the basic burger is delicious right up to the entrees."}
{"text":"We are in a dessert coma.   The chocolate cake is crazy good.  The fruit sorbets are also incredible.   We enjoyed our meals during restaurant week.  Special highlight was the root beer short ribs.  Yummy!  Really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"ALWAYS count on the grill for good food, service and a terrific view. Tonto for lunch, Cartwrights for dinner.   :-)"}
{"text":"First time here, we sat at the bar, Julie was the sweetest bartender. She recommended an appetizer and asked us very often how everything was. She made an amazing margarita! She made our whole afternoon, we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"My husband chose to come here for his birthday dinner last night and we've dropped our review from 4.5 stars to 3.  When checking other reviews today I saw comments on the wonderful basket of bread. We spent $215. before the tip and never saw nor were we offered any bread with our dinner. The Gemill chicken pasta was very much enjoyed as was the Schnitzel.  The Walleye was good tasting but Mushy which made me wonder if it was real Walleye or just not fresh. Being from Minnesota and eat our share of Walleye, this didn't hit the mark. Comparing the picture of the Walleye meal to a picture 1 year ago of the same meal, the quantity of fish was reduced by 1/3 (2 fish sticks instead of 3). The Black Cod for $38. Tasted very fishy and we all knows that means not fresh.  The corn chowder was good, the squash soup, only fair...mostly cream and barely more than room temperature.  The birthday boy had a side house salad for $9. which he described as old and wet, not fresh and crunchy.  The menu was more limited than we remember, though they still had my favorite wine and the manhattans were very good.  Comparing the cute pair of good chocolate truffles in a 'paper chest' to the huge piece of ice cream (mud) pie that the Tonto Verde Mesquite Grill gives for a birthday dessert that can generously shared by 4...even 6, it doesn't compare.  All in all, our new favorite place is the Mesquite Grill."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food selections are always changing- great place to eat a relaxing lunch and the food quality is exceptional. excellent service"}
{"text":"Always spot on, always the happening place and excellent views and atmosphere.  We have been coming here for years and never once had a bad experience.  The wait staff is spot on and always friendly.  HIGHLY recommend this place either for lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it on 'Check Please Arizona' (PBS) a few months ago. I finally got to go for my birthday last night and was not disappointed. First of all, I love that they have a gluten free menu and not just one or two items, on the contrary there are quite a few GF menu items to order. If you are GF, please let your server know right away and they will bring out freshly baked GF bread for you. It was just scrumptious! The butter melted on it and was so yummy. 
Our server was really on point. I wish I could remember her name, she was very attentive without hovering over us. The busboys were always making sure our waters were filled. The ambiance was really great. The interior dining area is picturesque, Old West-ish but cozy, warm and yet classy.
I started off with a Pinot Noir and the Tonto House Salad . The salad was wonderful and the size was perfect(appetizer size). My friend got a Merlot and the Caesar salad. For my entree I selected the Ancho Chili-Rubbed Filet. Oh. My. Word. Probably one of THE best steaks I have ever had. Medium rare done to perfection. The presentation was quite lovely.
My yfriend got the Mesquite Wood-Grilled Venison Tenderloin Medallions. Had a bite of that and it was just divine. Save room for dessert because you will be sad if you don't. I got the GF/vegan Chocolate Cake, it was served with raspberries, a raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. My friend got the creme brulee. SO good. Seriously, we were in a food coma by the time we hobbled out to the car. The sun was setting and naturally it was another gorgeous Arizona sunset, a perfect ending to one of the best meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"We go here often for the ambience and the view and sitting outside on the patio. The food is just so so, and they never really change the menu ever. And now they charge for bread. It's not a very friendly place for service, but it's nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"The Tonto Bar and Grill use to be a favorite of mine when I was in the Carefree, AZ area, after tonight I'm not willing to make the drive from Goodyear to Cave Creek just to eat there.  As usual the food was great, but the service suffered as I've not experienced before. We were seated across from the door between the kitchen and the dining room where wait staff were constantly coming and going, but it gets better. At one point a waiter was entering the dining room from the kitchen with a plate in each hand, he kicked the kitchen door open so hard with his foot that the door sprung back and knocked one plate from his hand, which landed on the floor and broke splattering plate material and food. Shortly after, a second waiter came through the kitchen floor and slipped on whatever was on the floor (heavy Mexican tiles), landing on his bottom, and broke several more plates and splattering food which hit the back of my guests feet. My one guest was also hit on the backs of her legs with pieces of the broken plates (we picked up three large pieces of broken plate before leaving). Staff came over and apologized even though this was not their place, where was the owner or Manager? The young gentleman who fell apologized to us even though he should have been sent immediately to the urgent care since I'm sure he must have hurt something in the fall and he did admit that his elbow was quite sore, but he had work to finish."}
{"text":"Have been for Lunch and Happy Hour and have not been dis appointed! Great lunch food and enough variation to make most people happy. And a great place to take out of town guests. You can sit right next to one of the golf course greens and watch some golfing. Happy hour food is not huge portions, but tasty too!!!"}
{"text":"Took out of town guests here, and wanted to impress. We had reserved lower patio seating, and everything turned out great. Ambience excellent, food was fine, and the service very good. All in all, for value, the best restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, patio and service. Delicious bread and lunch menu. Our party of 4 loved every item we ordered.

One of the best S/W inspired restaurants in the entire valley. Far better than most valley S/W/Mexican restaurants and well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I like the setting and the ambiance but I think the owners are really greedy. The food is so overpriced and service has gone really downhill. What a shame ! I used to love Tonto Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on the planet. Great staff and amazing food. The root beer braised short ribs are my favorites. The sweet potato accompaniment is fabulous. That being said, there is nothing on the menu I haven't loved. Great wine list, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Too many good things to say about EVERYTHING!
If you haven't been, get there! Every thing on the menu is tasty.
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting and wonderful food!  I had \"BLT Revival\".  It was amazing!  The cornmeal-fried green tomatoes were an excellent touch and I couldn't get enough of the lemon-basil aoli."}
{"text":"A favorite of ours. Enjoy sitting out on the patio next to the golf course, service is always outstanding and food is amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for our anniversary. Overall, I say it was good. It doesn't quite match what I remember it being years ago, but maybe that's just rose colored \"back in the day\" glasses. 

We shared the crab cakes for an appetizer, and they were pretty good. We also both got the mushroom soup, which we both agree was really great! 

For our entrees, I got the orange BBQ salmon, and my husband got the bison ribeye. Now, I really liked the salmon, and the sauce on top of it, but the veggies underneath had a taste I didn't much like, and the little mounds of veggies on the sides were pretty tasteless. My husband also wasn't a fan of whatever his bison had been placed on top of, though he enjoyed the bison itself. That was a bit of a let down on a $40 plate. Ouch.

We both also got desserts. He got the creme brûlée  and I got the apple pumpkin stack. His dessert looked really nice, and he said it was good. Mine was just ok, with not much in terms of flavor standing out. Very so-so. Our plates were decorated nicely with anniversary wishes, and we got a little box of chocolate as well for the occasion, which was nice. 

One rather big issue we had was the temperature of the room. It was boiling. There was a fire going and it really wasn't needed. I get it for the atmosphere, but we didn't enjoy eating our dinners while sweating at the table."}
{"text":"If you are in town and you want to try this place and are lucky enough to score a reasonable table, you might enjoy this experience overlooking the golf course. They charge for everything, including bread. The dishes are a little cullinary experiment. It is nice if you are looking for something different. I would not suggest making a special effort to try this place. Desserts are delightful but not worth the expense for the three courses."}
{"text":"The harvest salad was great.  Went here for lunch with my husband and mother-in-law (sans child) and had a really wonderful lunch.  I had the heirloom gazpacho and it was fantastic :)  I tried it due to other Yelp reviews and it was definitely worth a try.  We had lunch on the patio, which was nicely shaded, and it was the first time in my life that I actually thought a golf course view was pleasant.  (I'm not into golf, so I generally don't care about golf courses).  Had a New Zealand wine with my salad - super.  I wouldn't recommend this establishment for small children, but it was a great get-away place to have lunch without your small child ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of attending a wedding here on Saturday night.  The service was top notch, the passed appetizers were tasty and the seated dinner was off the charts.

I opted for the tumbleweed salad, which was romaine lettuce, black beans, corn and some amazing BBQ ranch dressing.  I was a bit unsure as I am a salad purist, lettuce, cheese, bacon bits and croutons but I literally cleaned my plate.  For my entree, I opted for the filet, medium rare, served with asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  This entree was perfectly content owed and so delicious that I got the uneaten portion to go.  Our hotel didn't have a microwave, so I put it into a zippy bag and brought it home to Texas.

Other salads, the beet salad and the arugula ones were good but I think the tumbleweed was the best.

Other entrees included the salmon (cooked perfectly), the sanddabs (meh, according to our friend), the venison and the NY Strip....all good.

Hubby and I so enjoyed the ambiance and the food, so we returned today at lunch.  We started with the appetizer of three salsas, guacamole and two kinds of chips and Indian fry bread.  All were good, but the guacamole was the star here.

Hubby ordered the salmon entree and ate almost all of it.  It was perfectly cooked to rare, which he said was the only place ever who has delivered on that request!

I opted for the cheeseburger, medium rare, and it came out pink, juicy and flavorful.  It came with a house salad, which I upgraded to the tumbleweed, at the cost of a full side salad for $9.

Overall, this place has a very relaxing and pleasant atmosphere and food variety and taste combinations you won't find elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Took clients to dinner here, the service was excellent, we were seated immediately, my steak was juicy, tender and very tasty, seasoned perfectly. The Salmon that others had was reported very good, but maybe a touch too much glaze. We also had two deserts the Key-lime and Dark Chocolate cake, both were amazing and melted in your mouth. Portions were not huge but just right. It was a very good experience."}
{"text":"I went here at night so I didn't get to see the great views, but the dinner was good especially since I wasn't paying :)"}
{"text":"My partner and I decided  give it a go after not being there for a year........We felt at that point that it was getting a little tired.....But tonight.....It is hard to describe how good and solid the food was. Really, and the service, 5 star all the way....the food was   just straight away the best we have had there, ever.....amazing and you can't believe how we were really not sure what to expect, but this was just so welcomed. A really nice time and the setting, Terrific Cesar Salad,  Sand Dabs with mashed potatoes, tiny organic carrots and sweet green peas in the pod, with an amazing sauce , along with the home made bread and the butter and what a great night.......can't beat it anywhere in the area...."}
{"text":"I saw an ad for this restaurant in a magazine and decided to give it a try.  Good marketing I guess?  We drove up and although it was a bit hidden, the view is amazing.  The inside is really pretty - nice touches to make you feel like you are in a native American dwelling.  

We started with the 3 sisters salsas and chips.  OMG the chips were all homemade and delicious - there was a warm bread/soft taco and then the tortilla chips.  The salsas were all really good and interesting.  Each one had a different flavors and the portions were huge - easily enough for 4 people.

I ordered the BLT with house salad.  The dressing was delicious I seriously would have bought some if they bottled it.  The sandwich was huge!  Slices on avocado and huge strips of bacon, what more could you ask for?

This was one of the best meals I've had in Arizona and I'd go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Tonto has nice indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor is especially pretty weather permitting. It's not unusual to find wildlife roaming around here. I've seen bobcats and javelinas on prior visits.

The food is also really good. The salads are always good. Their appetizers are delicious and portions are large enough to share. 

Their dinner entrees are really good too. Recently had their burger and it came out juicy and flavorful with tons of toppings. 

It could get crowded here during the weekends so I'd recommend making reservations. Parking is decent and there are street parking if the parking lot gets full."}
{"text":"Looking for a romantic place to take my BFF @cburg we visited Tonto's. After a great walk through the neighborhood and an amazing Tontorita (highly recommended) in the patio, we enjoyed a marvelous dinner. This place would clearly be a five star if only we could have found some way of arranging a reservation during sunset. My advice? Book ahead. (And plan to enjoy a Tontorita, or three)"}
{"text":"Best sea scallops iv ever had. Great atmosphere -and view of the golf course outside. Plus the service was amazing."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 14 for New Year's Eve and everyone had a great time. Everyone enjoyed their food, not one person had a complaint. Everyone said their meals were perfect. The service was great especially what is probably their busiest night. I has the walleye and it was delicious and perfectly cooked as was my husband's filet mignon. The sweet potatoe soup was delicious and I think we all could have had more it was so tasty. Good prices and decent size portions with great atmosphere. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. I only gave 3 stars because each time I've gone to the restaurant side the service is pretty bad. Had trouble getting the correct drinks and then refills were almost impossible to get. The bar however has excellent service with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Out of our six people, four ordered the walleye. It was wonderful. Hilo was a fantastic and attentive waiter. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If we think about going to dinner in the area, this is always on the top of the list.  Service is usually pretty good (I'd give it 4 stars) but the food and the atmosphere is so great.  Love the walleye and still can't believe they have it here in the damn desert.  Best thing away from the Great Lakes!  The salads are unusual and dressings made from scratch.  The only complaint is there is always too much food so my husband and I have learned to share.  Well, that's not so tough.  Love sitting outside in the evening, yes, even in the heat, since there is a nice breeze when the sun goes behind the hills.  Only been here for dinner and a cocktail party but I understand they serve all day."}
{"text":"A great local restaurant wirh local ingredients.  We have pkayed the adjacent golf course many times and liked to get lunch here. This time we had dinner and for vegans they have a  special menu which is fantastic.  I got the vegetarian nosh which is a choice of various vegetables,  startches, and sauces. They  also have fresh baked bread that you can purchase to start. My two buddies got a Reuben and the other a pasta dish. They both loved their meals. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Excellent selection and wine list. Server was all up on her organic grass fed/finished schpiel which delighted me to no end. Split the shrimp tacos which were delish. Not a bad dish at the table. I'd RUN back!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 9 with 2 small children. Our server was fabulous and the food was to die for. This is one of my favorite restaurants. We were on the patio and the sunset was so beautiful. It was a great night."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is a total hidden gem up in Cave Creek. I'll keep this short and sweet.

1. sit outside near the golf course
2. order the root beer braised short ribs
3. order a burger
4. if you're going with a large party get the salsa assortment for an appetizer.

This is a perfect date place. It's quaint, has the ambience of Lon's for a fraction of the cost. IMO, their service is in the top 5 of all restaurants I've been to in Arizona. There's no way you can go wrong with Tonto Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"Absolutely ideal. Food was delicious & patio in the sunshine looking over the lush golf course was so relaxing. The corn chowder is a MUST!  Thought my husband was going to lock the bowl in public. He always talks about how a dish can be improved.  Instead he thought the crab cakes were the best he has ever had. The Cobb salad was fresh & light. Perfect afternoon meal after some time on the tennis courts."}
{"text":"I can't give this place enough stars!!! I love the food, ambiance, service-it's the best! They change their menu from time to time but if they have the Reuben sandwich on the menu-get that as they use house made pastrami. In the past, they have also had homemade Gazpacho (but I think they may have taken it off the menu)-that's another favorite! The golf course view is a relaxing setting. Love this place!"}
{"text":"For $14 you get a salad which is so small. The quality of food is not good the quantity is way too small and the prices our way too hi. Might be ok for out of state visitors who would not come back."}
{"text":"We haven't been to TontoGrill in a couple of years. We decided to check it out and we're very pleasantly surprised. We went early before it was crowded and had a delightful dinner overlooking the golf course. They had the heater on to keep us toasty warm. Service was excellent and everything about our meal was great. I had the chicken pasta which was better than I remembered it. It is a very nice relaxing atmosphere when it is not hustling and bustling with people."}
{"text":"Tonto has very good food, but I expect more for such a pricey restaraunt. I ordered the Corn Chowder with a Cobb Salad. The chowder is incredible, but there salads tend to be soaked in dressing. The waiter brought them both out at the same time, which was a put-off for a restaraunt that touts itself on the higher end. Overall great service when we go there, but bringing out both entrees at the same time is something you'd expect at a diner, not a higher end establishment. I was told by our waiter, that was the way they do it. Maybe he was new, but he didn't seem to get it."}
