{"text":"Great service!   Great atmosphere!  Great food!  The milkshake varieties are unreal!"}
{"text":"First time to the Belmont have to say my girlfriends and I loved the retro decor and causal atmosphere.   The service was good but not exceptional you should never have  to ask for the other half of the order or have two out of three people served with someone waiting for their food.  The food was good and everyone in the restaurant seemed too be enjoying their meals.  Was it the best Eggs Benny I have ever had ....... no it was good.   Would I go back yes but would I wait outside in the cold for a table with high expectations no."}
{"text":"Passed by many times but went in for lunch today for the first time. Had to order the Smoked Meat Hash with a milk shake. The hash was great and the portion size was huge. Two thumbs up. The milk shake was OK, can't quite put my finger on what was missing.   Service was quick and friendly. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of diners in Calgary mainly because breakfast is good no matter what time it is :)  Located in Mardaloop, this one has a great 50's neighbourhood feel! The food is great! Prices are reasonable, portions are huge and they serve bottomless hash browns, need I say more? I will anyway... Don't be discouraged by the long lines in front, it usually moves quickly and they will bring you out coffee to keep you warmed up. Staff is awesome and you see very few new faces behind the counter... I've been looking at some of them for 7 years now, and that is a long time for this industry!  Be warned though... It is only open until 4 pm :( Too bad... 24 hours of this place would be the best gift we could get..."}
{"text":"$20.50 for a basic breakfast is a bit pricey. Nothing about it was amazing. It wasn't bad. Just a basic breakfast."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here since before the fire. The menu is the same but the food seems different. Ate here on a Monday morning. Several basic items like English breakfast tea and gluten free bread were out. The service was very slow and it took about 45 min for our meals to come out. One of the orders was wrong (asked for no croissant since there was no gluten free bread and it came on a croissant) the food was good but my Montreal smoked meat hash was mostly potato and light on the meat. We saw several people waiting outside for a table while there were a few empty that just hadn't been cleaned yet. Overall, decent food slow service."}
{"text":"Mmmmm delicious. This spot is proof of a smartly run Diner. They don't try to grow and water down their brand. They keep things consistent, tasty and fast. They have been their for years and their is always a line up.....there's a reason for that. Belmont has the best Hash Browns in the city!"}
{"text":"Small diner of about 20 seats. Very salty hashbtowns and breakfast burritos. Maybe just my tastebuds, but I don't like too much salt on everything on the plate. Good diner coffee. They made pancakes in the shape of cat faces , so fun for the kids. Don't forget to order smaller plates for kids or for those with smaller appitites. They charge accordingly. Quite pricy fo what it is."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable little diner the Belmont is!! I have been to the Belmont a few times and each and every time I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience there!!!  Felt just at home. The food and the service is consist and you will enjoy every single bite!!! Atmosphere is warm friendly and retro, like the olden days!!!  A really fun place to sit enjoy, breakfast, or brunch  and a nice cup of coffee.....worth your time and every cent!!! I will be back.....Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden treasure! You have to try their eggs benedict, you'll never be the same. I've been here three times now and had consistently great food and service. Cons: if you go on a weekend morning you may have to queue up outside BUT they do serve you free coffee out there while you wait."}
{"text":"Our first visit here today. Asked locals what they recommended, answer, everything is good.  Settled on the loaded omelet and it was delicious.  Good coffee too. Service very friendly. Will definitely be back on our next visit to Calgary."}
{"text":"gotta love Belmont Diner... its a cool spot, its on the small side ( seems like most breakfast places are) I dont mind sitting up at the counter though!  they have the best malt chocolate shakes! combine that with eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and toast!   Makes for one delicious breakfast! This spot is another one of those get here early because the line ups can get long.. and if its crummy weather your gonna be stuck outside waiting as well!"}
{"text":"Always worth the wait. Super busy and that is part of this restaurants appeal.  Staff are friendly and attentive. Food is fresh tasting and super comforting.  Last week four of us went for brunch. I had poached eggs with a potato  pancake and rye toast.  Pancake was nicely made. Just greasy enough. Non stop coffee. What is not to like.?"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was on a croissant and it was the best eggs Benedict I've ever had! Unreal! I am so happy this place re opened after the fire. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"My love affair with the Belmont Diner is quite strong. I've been regularly coming here for Saturday brunch, and the food has always been spot on. Usually I alternate between the French Toast and the Veggie Eggs Benedict. Both are really great options. Service has always been great. One of the staff members, Cheresse, is always friendly and welcoming. She remembers my mom and I every time we have come in. She always makes sure we are well cared for. So glad the owner was able to bring her back! Honestly, when the fire came through last year, I was worried about whether this gem would ever re-open. So glad to see that it has. It really is a great little place!"}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast place! I've been there twice with my fam, both times on a Sunday afternoon, and we all left full-bellied and satisfied. There is a bit of a line-up (often going out the door) but it moves quickly and the food is totally worth it! It (the food) is classic, comforting, filling, and totally delicious! I recommend the grilled ham eggs Benny, Montreal smoked meat hash, and Monte Cristo. These and almost all the other meals are served with bottomless hash and/or toast, which is nice if you have a big appetite. They also serve really tasty milkshakes in several flavors. As for the atmosphere, it feels really authentic and modern-diner cozy. Overall, I'd say it's one of the best breakfast joints in town!"}
{"text":"The Belmont is definitely my favourite diner in town. I'm not certain that it's the absolute best meal I've had in a diner in Calgary but, I can vouch for its' consistency and all-around goodness. I've been there now countless times, under countless circumstances and I never leave unsatisfied.   My most recent visit came during a brief stint working the graveyard shift. I stumbled in on my way home one day just after they opened to feast on a pancake breakfast and some bottomless coffee. The effects of the butter, bacon, syrup and caffeine all culminated into a strong sense of euphoria. It was probably from my lack of sleep but, still pretty great in any case. I'm glad that I can go there and not feel ridiculous for mumbling incoherently and grinning at my eggs after they've turned green from mixing with the blueberries in my pancakes.  If you decide to check this place out for yourself I would recommend that you do like me and try to avoid the weekend traffic. Also, never order the sausage for a side (it's usually dry and just really lame). Other than that I feel that everything there is a pretty safe bet."}
{"text":"I live right close to this diner, the food is unbelievable the service is even better!   I had the eggs Benny... Which I could order every single time I come here."}
{"text":"The Belmont has, in my opinion, the best beef sausages in the city. It's always busy here but turnover is pretty quick, so you won't wait in line too long; and if you are waiting outside the staff provide you with coffee as you wait. Classy.   The chefs prepare your food right in front of you and often deliver the the meal themselves, which is a nice touch. My favorite here is the buttermilk pancakes (one chocolate, one banana) and a side of beef sausage. Delicious, simple, satisfying.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good place for Sunday Brunch  We wanted to check out Belmont because of the great Yelp reviews. What a neat little place situated in Marda Loop. The place was busy on a Sunday afternoon but nothing out of control. The two of us were seating pretty quickly.   My boyfriend picked Calgary's only omelet. It was VERY good with the Montreal style smoked meat. I'm not a fan of omelets myself but I tried a bite and it was amazing! What's better about this omlete is that you can pick as many items as you want ont he list and you don't get charged extra. Concept! I had the Breakfast Burrito. It was very yummy and VERY filling. I couldn't finish it but I enjoyed every bite.   We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Located in trendy Marta Loop with great ambiance and antique booths the Belmont is one of the best places for breakfast in town. Lineups can often go out the door or even around the corner but you tend to get in relatively quickly (especially if you are alone as there always seems to be an odd seat left at the counter). Compared with the other trendy diners in town the Belmont actually seems to keep the same staff for more then a few weeks so be prepared for great service. If you're a regular customer they might even know what you're going to order and make suggestions. Alone, you can watch your food being prepared behind the counter or just sit back with the newspaper and wait the few minutes it takes to get your meal.  I suggest trying the Calgary sandwich and the vegetarian eggs benny.   Good eating!"}
{"text":"I don't get how the Belmont Diner has 4 stars. The food is typical diner food that's on par with a Denny's or Humpties. The service was brutal.  The pancakes were undercooked. The server tried to say the blueberries added extra moisture and the pancakes were fine even though they tasted like flour. Asked to have hash browns to replace the undercooked  pancakes, but would keep the eggs and bacon. The sever clearly had a problem with that. From that point she completely ignored us and we had to ask another server for the bill. Forget about asking us how the meal was or providing further coffee and tea.   The Belmont Diner couldn't care less about their customers and it seems their cooks can't make the most basic foods like pancakes or hash browns."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait in line!  When a friend suggested brunch on Thanksgiving Monday, I couldn't believe that I still hadn't been to the Belmont! So, I trekked up to Marda Loop and we chatted in line for about 15-20 minutes until we got a table. Not too bad a wait on a warm fall day!  The service was friendly and quick, and although there were many appealing items on the menu, I had to try the Montreal Smoked Meat Hash. It was definitely worth the price of admission! Though, next time I might ask for no banana peppers. They add a nice flavour, but I am sensitive to vinegary things!  I'm always looking for a great brunch option, and since I am now a south-side dweller, I think that the Belmont might have to be my new brunch home!"}
{"text":"Great, small diner style eatery.  Belmont Diner has surpassed Nellies as The no.1 destination for breakfast foods in marda loop (and arguably the SW).    Prices are reasonable, the locale is clean and unpretentious.  Food is great, large portions but not over the top.  The Banana Pancakes and the Hash are must haves, simply the best.  The only down side would be the wait on weekends, as this is a very small restaurant.  Hopefully more locations are to come."}
{"text":"Breakfast to me is the best meal of the day. When else can one have all the selection that is breakfast/brunch? All the fruits, cereals, meats etc...The Belmont includes all of this with a diner atmosphere and very pleasant service. I have been cooking professionally for 30 yrs and always enjoy the simple things...soul food...food that reminds you of Mom or Grandma. This is the place to experience this...Well done."}
{"text":"Dropped in here Saturday morning and had to wait in line, so although not great for us waiting it showed it was popular.  Had Huevos Rancheros (spelling?) was pretty good, her indoors had French Toast she finished the plate so all was good!  Coffee was good, service was friendly, food was good and would definitely go back, recommend it for breakfast!  Oh they take plastic now!"}
{"text":"Classic little diner with classic diner menu -- if you want something tasty and quick, or if you want to feel like you're having breakfast or lunch in 1956, stop in here.  Nothing fancy or snobby on the menu -- just simple, good food.  I usually go here for breakfast.  I love the traditional eggs, bacon, and toast here, but pretty much anything you order will satisfy your needs.  Coffee is plentiful and the brew is tasty.  Service is quick -- especially at the bar.  Everyone is friendly and pleasant to deal with.  Only downside: arrive after 9:30 and you'll find a line out the door.  You need to come early.  However, it's worth getting up for (even on a Saturday)."}
{"text":"Came back after the unfortunate fire to get my fix of fluffy pancakes. Fluffy they were not, centre undercooked as a matter of fact, still batter in the middle.  Husband had the heuvos, previously flavourful and memorable, this time was very bland, no love to the dish.  Must be the different cooks also felt like I was at a club the loud music they were playing, and I noticed other breakfast item ($14-15) on the menu does not come w/ bacon or egg - extra.  Really? This is just basic breakfast done average, we will not be back."}
{"text":"What a great little place in Marda loop, it's quite small so I can only imagine the line up during the busy weekend. Amazing breakfast and great service.     By far way better than Nellies or The Loop! Decent"}
{"text":"I would like to be able to give this place 3.5 stars since I tremendously enjoyed the atmosphere, but I wasn't blown away by the food (really the most important aspect of eating out) but since I can't, oh well, three stars it is.   I had the Montreal smoked meat eggs benedict on a croissant. It was good, but it felt like the amount of meat was overpowering the lovely croissant and hollandaise. Now, granted, I got what I ordered and maybe I just wasn't in the mood for miles of meat. But even so, I think it's important for the components of a meal to have some semblance of balance to them.  (The only other complaint I have is that the eggs were under-done to what I specified, BUT I sympathize with that since I believe that everyone has slightly different ideas of well done/medium etc.)  With that said, I will still come here again and try something else off the menu! It's just such a great place to not give the food a second chance. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Diner in town!  Loved their clubhouse and French toast for over 10 years!  Love the friendly service and consistent quality."}
{"text":"You know it's located in Marda Loop, so you know chances are high that I'm gonna love it. But let's be honest, even if Belmont Diner was located in a part of the city that I wasn't already partial to, I would still fall head over heels in love with this classic-style diner.   Not only is the decor perfectly diner-esque, but the food is delicious. With unique breakfast plates, sandwiches and classic milkshakes, Belmont Diner is where you go to have mouthwatering breakfast...in style!  The staff is friendly and efficient and like my fellow Yelpers have already mentioned, they offer UNLIMITED hashbrowns with your meal! SOLD!  Remember though - cash only!"}
{"text":"The breakfast food was decent but the service needs improvement. The server did not check on us once during our meal and my eggs benny had a hair in it so I had to seat there staring at it and not eat my food for over 30minutes while my friend finished her food. Server did not check on us once. When I told her about the hair, she said she would reflect it on the bill and gave me 15% discount. I probably ate about half of my meal before I noticed the hair, so don't think that was very nice or fair of her to give such a small discount. Won't be coming back. Giving 2 stars because the diner has potential and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Meh ... I'm not really into the hipster diner brunch experience. Food is good though it's really hard to mess up breakfast fast food"}
{"text":"I love Belmont!! whenever I have a friend in from out of town and we're looking for a breakfast spot I always take them here. The omelet really is the BEST in the city, Every time I go I think I'll try something new, but as the saying goes, if it ain't broke..."}
{"text":"#144  You would think it was the NBA playoffs as many times the ball was dropped.  Let us start with the good:  Buttermilk pancakes for $12 included strawberries and chocolate chips and to include bottomless hash browns and endless toast (more about the latter two in a minute). Glass of water  The pancakes arrived in about 10 minutes or so. So so good. Still no mention of hash browns or toast being ordered since not offered (and later never offered).  This is where it went downhill.  It was the Marda Gras Street Festival but it was not busy in here. No wait for a booth. In retrospect, knowing that Belmont is usually busy, should have been a tip-off.  Finished the panckes and after 30 minutes, still empty water and tea pots (the other patron had ordered tea).  I finally asked about the hash browns and toast and the toast was ordered. After 10 minutes, I had to inquire again about hash browns and toast, the toast arrived sans hash browns. Then, asking for the hash browns again, they finally arrived.  Did I fail to mention the check was placed on the table before the pancakes were finished?   My four previous trips were not like this; I hope this is an aberration but my experiences tell me there is a 60% chance it is not."}
{"text":"The easiest review! Everything is fantastic! If you go mid morning on a weekend, there will be a line, but it is TOTALLY worth it! I love love love the cody scramble, the eggs benny and the hash!! So amazing, I'm there at least once a month. YUMM!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat to much breakfast that is not super healthy - sometimes it is just fun do to that.   And you can often wait in later line for it too.  Have enjoyed this Marda Loop gem many times since 2003."}
{"text":"Welcome Belmont to the 21st century! They now accept DEBIT and CREDIT !!"}
{"text":"I've tried so many diners in my new city and I still dream of the Belmont's Montreal Smoked Meat Hash, 2 lightly poached eggs with Hollandaise on top, of course!  I am at T minus 6 days and counting until I come home for Christmas and you can be sure that the Belmont will be my first stop for breakfast (always be there within 15 min of opening to ensure you're not waiting in line, especially on weekends).  Love the waitresses, most ditzy girls working in restaurants don't have anything on these girls, only 2 are needed to run the entire place like a well-oiled machine.  Chefs are a treat to watch, we always sit at the counter just so we can stare in awe at their speed and cooking abilities!  Everyone who comes to visit me in Calgary always gets taken here, it's a local treasure....skip that crap that is across the street and wait in line over here instead!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place came back after they suffered from a fire last year. Just really solid diner fare, this is one of our go-to brunch/lunch places.   Place is a small location with a cool, classic diner atmosphere. I'm happy to sit wherever, whether it's the stools/bar, a table, or a booth. Tables can be pretty compact. What with the small size, the weekends can get pretty busy and you often end up waiting outside, but sometimes they're nice enough to bring out some coffee!  Me, I love the pancakes (chocolate chips and bananas, thanks!) and the B.O.B. (breakfast on a bun, veggie). The girlfriend, she loves the bennies, and each time I've tried one they're awesome. I don't love the hash browns here.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I only have two checkins here but I've probably been here well over a dozen times.   The Belmont Diner comes with a real vintage furniture. Gotta love that.   As for the food - always great and the coffee cup never runs dry until you say stop.   The staff are real personable too. Much appreciated.   It's a smaller place so if you want to be guaranteed a seat, you best arrive when they open at 7:00am because by 7:30 the place is full and you'd be a waitin!  I'll be back unless you run out of bacon."}
{"text":"Quick service and food delivery, had eggs Bennie with ham  Came on a sliced croissant  Hash a little cold and dried out  Ham very salty  Eggs done nicely  Croissant soggy  With coffee $18"}
{"text":"Apple pie milkshake!  If you head to the place early you can get a seat. The staff are super friendly and I haven't found anything on the menu I didn't love."}
{"text":"Best breakfeast in calgary hands down ! Only you have to line up for a long time to get in ."}
{"text":"Great little hang out in a nice neighborhood.  The Omelet with Montreal Smoked Meat was surprisingly great. I was afraid Montreal Smoked Meat would not work in an Omelet however I was wrong - it goes great! The cool thing too with their omelets is one price gets you as many toppings as you want; and they don't skimp on the cheese either!   The prices are reasonable, portions huge,  and the are staff fast and friendly - I will be back!  Also this is one of the few places that serves REAL Maple Syrup with all the French toast, waffles, pancakes, etc with no additional charge."}
{"text":"Great little greasy spoon dinner in Belmont. The place only seats 33 so expect a wait. Upon arrival you'll have to write your name on the wait list, there really isn't much space in the front entrance to accommodate anyone waiting for a table. Fortunately they have a patio with two gas fireplaces for you to sit around. While you're waiting outside for your table the dinner offers you free coffee self server with the pot and all, on a cold day you'll really appreciate this. Once seated the menus are located with the condiments on your table, the service is prompt and friendly. They offer pancake art as an option, my son ordered the Chicago Blackhawks logo it came out the size of a plate pretty cool to say the least. The portion sizes are large, I had the smoked meat omelette with hash and toast, I couldn't finish it. They offer a small selection of craft beers as well. If you're looking for a weekend brunch spot look no further the Belmont Dinner has you covered."}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast around 33rd SW!! From the moment that my sister and I were welcomed over to take our seats at the counter, the entire experience was a perfect start to our Sunday.  We started off by splitting an Apple Pie milkshake. Good call on sharing! Unless you can polish off the contents of the full glass plus the additional rest of the milkshake in the metal vessel, in which case, I commend you. The first sip had me mmmm!-ing, as the milkshake tasted exactly as would a slice of apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   We proceeded to select one meal each from their two-sided menu of yums. My sister decided on the smoked meat omelette, and for myself, the Calgary sandwich tickled my fancy. Both dishes were served with endless hashbrowns, tres cool! The food arrived surprisingly promptly, as I was anticipating more of a wait because the diner was packed full. Our food was filling, and ridiculously tasty! We were supremely satisfied with our food, drink...everything, really.  Gotta love the authentic and genuine feel of this place; from the friendly service to the scrumptious food, affordable prices, and the endless hashbrowns, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast, friendly service. Chuck Norris breakfast was excellent, and pancakes were fluffy and yummy. Smallish old school diner with booths, tables and counter seating, as well as outside benches with fire pits. Recommended!"}
{"text":"What a keeper this place is!  If Marda Loop ever comes up in conversation with a Calgarian, without a doubt, so will Belmont!   Atmosphere: Love it. Love it. Love it. It's a cool retro diner, but very intimate. They maybe have 6 booths? and then the awesome bar, where you can watch them prepare your meal, and a couple of two tops by the window! Such a quaint environment.  Food: Delish! If you crave breakfast as much as I do, this is the place to go! The breakfast is good, the prices are even better! What more could you ask for?  I had the Huevos Rancheros. Yummy in my tummy!!!  ****THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT**** - I am such a kid at heart. I love me some milkshakes. And they hand spin their delicious concoctions here. I had the malted chocolate, and I would go back purely just for that.  I recently acquired a friend who literally lives across the street from Belmont... I think I am going to need to make up excuses to stay the night, and spend my mornings there!"}
{"text":"That was the worst breakfast I've ever had in my life. My Montreal smoked meat omelet was dry\"my son spilled his kids apple juice as soon as we got it in and we were charged for it. bill was $82 not worth it at all."}
{"text":"A brand new discovery for me and it was pretty random.   I like it when I discover 4+ star places by randomly stumbling into a door because I'm starving and need food and then discover their yelp love later.   Endless toast and hash browns are a cute touch - their rye is marbled... and maybe it's the kid in me that loves the fun aspect of marbled rye bread but I would order it again just for that.  My table ordered an omelet with smoked meat (likely why they get so much yelp love) and a french toast (which is good but not the reason to go there).  The hash browns are good - flavorful and dare I assume fresh potatoes not the frozen kind you see reheated here and there on most breakfast plates.   Their prices are very reasonable (especially if you indulge in the extra starch helpings) but it's not a place for people watching carbs or fat... and probably on any diet really.  They deliver the cheque with double bubble which really compounds the kid feeling I mentioned with the rye bread toast.  I don't know if I'd travel out of my way to make it here again but I would stop in again if I was around."}
{"text":"The Belmont Diner is a great place to get brunch while experiencing a real blast from the past.  Want to sit at the bar and watch your food get made? That kind of experience has disappeared from the more modern approach and I think that's unfortunate. It is a fun way to get your day rolling when you see the talented and experienced cooks preparing many multiple meals at the same time without any issue. The food when you get it is also delicious. I understand the benedict is one of the most popular items on the menu but I opted for the pancakes instead. I was not disappointed.  Are you convinced? You want to go checkout the Diner now? Well you should probably only bring one friend if you want to get in there without too much of a wait. This place is very popular so expect the possibility of waiting outside on benches with free coffee. I would assume it would be less busy in the morning but I have never tried going earlier in the day.  I will definitely be back and I cannot wait to try one of those milkshakes."}
{"text":"Wow! Great spot for brunch. You'll need to wait in line on the weekends but it's well worth it. Endless Hashbrowns but you'll probably be full once your plate if done. The best veggie burger I've had (I'm not a vegetarian) Check out their sister restaurant off 17th. Galaxy Diner. PS they serve real maple syrup, not the aunti J stuff."}
{"text":"Decent little diner with amazing coffee. Friendly servers, amazing hash browns! Small joint, so be prepared to wait a while for a seat or go early!"}
{"text":"Had the Chuck's breakfast hash and it was delicious. What's great about this place is that you can always get their half size meals and they're still a huge dish!!   I was very happy with the customer service I had there. It was my real first time visiting Calgary and the people here are just amazing and super sweet. Our server came to us many times to check up on us to see how our food was and if we had enough water.   The food was delicious. I had poached eggs on mine and the hash was not too salty and not too oily which makes it perfect for me. Would definitely go again!   What's better is that right across the street is PIPS (boardgame cafe). So after brunch, might as well go for an hour of game day with your friends."}
{"text":"Marda Loop needs another breakfast diner! I love that Marda Loop is developing into a thriving community. I like to support local business and often frequented Belmont Diner for this reason. The food is authentic diner fare and when I used to go the service was friendly. I did not mind the 20 minute to 1 hour wait.   I have eggs, coffee and toast at home but sometimes you want a dining experience with a vibrant and friendly atmosphere. You may be disappointed if you want the same at The Belmont. They may have gotten to big for their breaches and definitely need competition to wake up . I waited outside for an hour with my friend. We ordered Bennies, coffee and Minosas .  I typically eat like a middle aged yellow lab, fast and with gusto it's a bad habit. We had not taken the table up lingering by any means. We decided we wanted an extra round of toast and the waitress informed me with a fake annoyed smile that they usually did not let people stay for more than an hour, I knew we had sat down exactly 37 minutes as I had a call at that time we were seated.I asked her how long she thought we had been there for and without batting an eye she lied and said 50 minutes,  but added she would do this for me because I was a regular, once we picked our jaws up off the ground ... It made me sad for how greed has been exchanged for  the customer experience. She or management overlooked that we waited outside for longer than we had sat down,  and  BTW, why have lovely fire pits if you don't ever seem to turn them on?, we ordered drinks at a diner !!,  we were not lingering aimlessly we ordered more food! I had left a good tip with my meal, And finally, they used to give little bubble gums with bill, when I asked why they stopped it was because minimum wage for waitress went up so they had to stop the bubble gum...: really ?? How cheap can you be. I'll never be returning, the Beltliner is a good alternative and the wild rose pub next door has breakfast."}
{"text":"I love breakfast - a lot. So much so that quite often my weekly \"treat\" is to go out for all-day breakfast somewhere. I find myself going to the same places over and over again, so today I made the decision to try out Belmont since it's not too far from home.  The decor and atmosphere is really cute - exactly what you'd expect from a \"diner.\" I went at about 2:30pm on a Saturday, so any crowds were gone and I was one of only a few tables. There are only about 10 tables total, so I can imagine that peak hours it would be quite busy (like The Loop across the street).  The menu is small but offers something for everyone. While the Eggs Benedict are supposed to be a specialty, I ordered a The Cody, which are eggs scrambled with vegetables. The kitchen is open so it's fun to watch the staff doing their thing while they work. The food came quickly and was piping hot. Instead of little bits of veggies in the eggs, there were tons throughout, including big pieces of tomato on top - fabulous! I really enjoyed the bread as well, which was a multigrain/flax I think. The only part of the meal I wasn't crazy about were the hasbrowns, which tasted a little undercooked to me, so much so they almost tasted like something out of the freezer warmed up. However, this may have been a one-time thing - I'll have to try again - and, while I can't eat that much, the hasbrowns are supposed to be bottomless, for those with big appetites.  The service was prompt and the server attentive. By the end of the meal, when I hadn't even finished my first cup of coffee, she asked if I wanted one to go. She came back with a fresh cup of coffee, complete with lid - especially timely because I took my dog for a walk immediately after. I appreciated the gesture!  All in all, definitely worth a visit, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Service was quick, food was  great, waitress was awesome!  (really cute too ) Get there before nine on the weekends or you'll be in line."}
{"text":"I am new to the marda loop neighbourhood but have eaten at the sister restaurant Galaxie Diner in connaught a bunch of times, so I expected the same fare... Somewhat disappointed with Belmont...  We were in super early on a sunday morning, and the service was fast,  but the fare was meh at best. Had the crab cakes eggs benny- which I have ordered many times at galaxie and loved, but here it was mediocre. Crabcakes were not fresh, and the hash browns were those frozen kind from a bag... what? I recall Galaxie service real potatoes not those pre-frozen mini cubes...   Having said that i will definitely give them another shot- the apple pie milkshake is worth it alone, very very good! I want to beleive this was an off day, or that the early chef hadn't quite made it through his own cup of coffee yet..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Not a whole lot of seats so the wait can be a while. Looking at the menu, there wasn't anything that stood out. I had a medium poached eggs benedict on Montreal smoked meat and that's exactly what I got. Not too salty but just good food. The hash browns on the side were nothing to rave about but I enjoyed them. The meal was around $14 which is the norm in this city but cheaper compared to some of the popular diners.  I'd come back to this place. I just wish it had a bigger seating area!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for brunch. It's been a long time though so we noticed the menu changed. Still great prices but the bottomless eggs and hash browns are gone. Doesn't matter really as the amount of food they load on your plate is way more than enough. As a typical Saturday for this gem is busy, they have a wonderful waiting area outside with free coffee. Very nice touch. Once inside, the old school diner theme makes it that much more appealing. We tend to get seated at the counter, which I recommend as it enhances the feeling of a back in the day restaurant. And you may have the best view ever of them making the most yummy looking milkshakes around. I have yet to enjoy one though... but I will. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Because of the quick table turnovers, watching the staff makes me exhausted. Good for them! I got the traditional breakfast with bacon, hashbrowns and eggs, YUM. Comes with toast. Previously they had raisin bread as an option but no more. I did miss that. My guest had an omelette. It was a bit pricey but there was no limit on what you can add to it. The list was HUGE. And it came with toast and their extremely flavorful hash browns too. Let's just say the toast stayed on the plate as the omelette itself was filling enough. Great little place for breakfast/brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot. The seating capacity is 33 people so expect a line up anytime. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everyone knows breakfast is the most important meal and frankly breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. In fact I could probably eat breakfast foods for all three meals per day... I love it that much! Don't be intimidated by the line at the Belmont Diner (there will be a line) it moves fairly quickly and man is it worth the wait. This place is fantastic. The boyfriend and I split a huge omelet and also ordered one pancake on the side. The best part, they can make your pancake into any shape you want. My friend got a transformer and I opted for a unicorn. Talk about talent! Our food was unreal, the service was great and frankly there is no place I would rather spend my morning. I love you forever Belmont diner!"}
{"text":"Eggs benedict with montreal smoked meat.  It was the best breakfast of 2012 so far, in all it's 3000 calorie glory."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 9:15am to get a booth. 10min later there was a line up out the door. It's Wednesday! I can't imagine what weekends are like here?!?  Friendly server chatted with us and topped up our coffees every 15 minutes. We love the rustic diner decor with stools and a counter and an open kitchen. This place is very small but has a good menu selection.   Hubby had a 3 egg omelette and you can choose from a variety of toppings for 1 price. They don't charge by topping like most places.  I had the Chuck Norris/ potato pancakes topped with signature smoked meat topped with 2 eggs any style and rye toast. Both our meals are largely portioned and absolutely delicious!  Why did I not know about this place sooner?  Absolute gem in Marda Loop with free 2 hour parking behind the building even though it's an Impark lot.   For those who have read my previous reviews, I love flavour but not over salting. I was worried about the Montreal smoked meat but it was moist, flavourful and nicely spiced. Hubby's omelette was man sized full of meat and chunks of veggies. I've added pics to show what it looks like under the eggs of these 2 dishes so you can see portion sizes. We will definitely return to try their lunch burger selections. Note that they close at 3pm."}
{"text":"Glad it's open again. .I had the Belmont burger - de-lish! It's a great local spot. Everything I saw go by looked great and the smell in here is intoxicating.   Pet peeve: visa machines set to encourage you to leave a 20% tip."}
{"text":"Can't decide if you want to eat here? Let me share some info:  - The hashbrowns are bottomless. They are the little cubes and have a good amount of lemon pepper on them. They are well cooked, but not crispy and the perfect amount of buttery.  - The apple pie milkshake is possibly my favorite thing IN THE WORLD. I travel often. I eat often-er. That is one tasty milkshake.  - If you don't like breakfast stuff, they make a mean bleu cheese burger.   - You can order every topping in an omelette if you want and you probably should. It's delicious.   - You can get a smoked meat eggs benny.   - The benches are hard, the coffee's not great. This place is designed to get as many people in and out, with full stomachs, as possible. If there's a line, you won't have to wait too long.  - The sausage isn't too greasy.   - They have multiple kinds of hot sauce, cheese whiz and Kraft peanut butter. I judge breakfast joints on that (and you should too)."}
{"text":"Items Ordered: Monte Cristo - Grilled Chicken Breast and Montreal Smoked Meat with Cheddar on Egg-Dipped Bread w/ Breakfast Potatoes Pancake Art - Blueberry R2D2 with Pure Maple Syrup  Located on 33 Avenue SW, as 'neighnborhoody' a spot as any in Alberta, Belmont Diner has been charming locals since the year 2000, though much of the décor and charm date back almost ninety years prior.  Temporary closed by a fire in 2013, but since reopened and greeting regulars as well as new faces from 7a-3p on weekdays, and until four o'clock on the weekend, those hoping to experience the family-run space without a wait are encouraged to arrive early, 7:25 on a cold Sunday finding just a dozen patrons present, four local Police Officers enjoying big plates of Eggs, Toast and Meat just a few feet from my counter seating.  Staffed by just two so early, a young female server in a tuque assisting the grill man in an open kitchen, it was with conversation about the restaurant and local area that time was passed after selecting two plates, the menu a laminated two-side job with a focus on diner staples and the occasional clever idea here or there.  Doing diligence in reviewing the menu prior to arrival, the clever \"pancake art\" undeniably a draw, it was with deference to the kitchen that an oblong shaped disc of golden Buttermilk Batter studded with Blueberries was presented, the idea immediately identifiable as R2-D2 and just as quickly devoured with a light smear of chilled Butter plus pure Maple Syrup added to taste.  Given the option of Ham or Smoked Meat for the griddled Monte Cristo, unfortunately no deep-frying to be found, it was just as the Pancake was nearing completion that the Sandwich stacked with Cheddar and a Chicken Breast was served, the flavors good on their own and even better with seeded Raspberry Jam from Kraft, though the cubed Potatoes were unfortunately undercooked and thus left on the plate with stomach capacity saved for the day's additional dining stops."}
{"text":"'Twas a 5 star meal for sure. Finally a meal worthy enough to be named after Chuck Norris."}
{"text":"I'm going with the consensus on this place!  5 stars out of 5 for sure!  I love myself a good diner, and Belmont definitely didn't disappoint me!  It serves all-day breakfast, which you can't go wrong with.  Who doesn't love a good egg at 3 in the afternoon?  Actually, I'd say their menu is mostly breakfast food.  They have a bunch of sandwiches and burgers to choose from, but I normally go straight for the breakfast menu.    One of the amazing things about their menu is that, regardless of whether you get breakfast or not, you receive BOTTOMLESS hashbrowns with your meal.  That's right, you can eat as many hashbrowns as you want!  A couple of the little potato chunks were a little too crunchy, but they were still delicious.  I usually can't handle a refill on the 'browns, but it's nice to know the option is there.  It's a pretty cute setting inside too.  There are old posters around the place, like Coke and flour ads, as well as pictures of old diners.  They have seating around the kitchen area and can probably fit about 30 people in there at capacity.  The service was really quick too!  You could be in and out within 20 minutes, if necessary.  Everyone inside is super nice, which makes it a great time.  The only problem, I recommend bringing cash since that is the only form of payment they accept.  Lucky for me (someone who never has cash) they are trusting enough to let you run across the street to grab a few bucks!  I love you, Belmont Diner, and I'm not ashamed to say it loud and proud!"}
