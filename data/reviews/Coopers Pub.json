{"text":"This place used to be the place to be. Recent few years they have gone downhill. Service is non-existent on a busy day. Food wise it is nothing to write home about. Their dusty cajun flavour wings were really good once upon a time. I think the kitchen changed thats why. I posted a picture of a feather stuck to my wing. Totally
Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Coopers Pub was probably my worst dining experience. I came with a group of guys & we all ordered wings. When we got our wings (1 hour later), they weren't even the ones we ordered. I think I was eating some sort of sweet wings, meanwhile I ordered hot. After all that wait, the wings were just 'ok'. Definitely nothing special.
 
What truly defined my experience was the terrible customer service. Waited 30 minutes to get acknlowedged, an hour to get my food, and another 30 minutes to get my bill. The waitress was extremely rude and forgot about us, although it wasn't even packed.

Because of my 3 similar experiences to the one described above, I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting service. Sat down for twenty minutes and didn't even get a single person to get our order. A dozen people came in after us and were all served and had received their drinks. Sad too because I've been here couple of times and live around the corner for almost 12 years now. I will never be back nor will my friends. 

Don't want to say this but we were a party of two coloured."}
{"text":"Friends meet up here sometimes for the raptors game best think we get all the time are the Dusty Cajun wings soooo good.."}
{"text":"The interiors may look shabby and the service (at times) slow but this is a place that provides great value for money. Good variety of beer and good food make up for all shortcomings."}
{"text":"Just because Mississauga don't really have a good wing/pub place, we go here almost every week. Wings are moderate like those frozen kinds you get from grocery store and make it at home. We go to chill, drink, watch sports, etc. 

When it gets busy on sports night or wings night, service does get terrible just because they are so busy. I remember, we sat down and did not even get a menu for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the soccer game. Took about 15 minutes to finally have a server to hand me a menu, and the food (Buffalo wrap) took over 30 mins. Yes just one wrap. The servers are not friendly, and are not personable. If you have the time (to waste), then come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't complain.  Ordered wings online and they came exactly the way I ordered.  Tasted good and a fair size order for the price.  I never visited the location but if your looking to order late night wings I'd recommend these guys.  I asked for extra crispy and honey garlic on the side and they came perfect in about 45 minutes. The only thing keeping me from a 5, is the fact they never have a wing night you can order cheaper wings like places like chicken land."}
{"text":"First off, I'm biased.  I've been coming to Coopers for about 15 years.  It's not the greatest pub in the world, but it's one of those comfy places to go to for a Leafs game, or just to chill out.  

The wings are good and pretty cheap on a game night.  The beer selection is decent, but seems to never change.  I usually go for wings but other menu items like fries, burgers, wraps are pretty good too, standard pub fare.

I recommend it on Leaf game nights, especially in the winter.  Beats Boston Pizza or Jacks any day of the week.

In the summer, hit up a place with a patio instead - this is the one thing Coopers lacks."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to coopers once and sometimes twice a week for years now. It has everything you would expect from an Irish pub. 

Pros:
1. Great location, very central and easy to access.
2. Good prices for alcohol and food.
3. Friendly and personable staff.
4. Major sports events usually are on TV

Cons:
1. Gets very busy during the leafs games
2. The wings are average, not bad but not great either.
3. Undercover police tend to harass the patrons on week nights to check for drinking and driving. 

My Favourite items on their menu are the greek salad, the burger, veggie platter, and of course their cold beer."}
{"text":"We went for wing night-they were okay, but the wings were definitely smaller than regular wings elsewhere.  There was a Leafs game on so the place was pretty full and the atmosphere was pretty fun but there wasn't anything interesting enough about the place to make me really want to go back."}
{"text":"Great staff very friendly very comfortable place to watch any sporting events or just to relax."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bar itself and the atmosphere. The staff were professionals and treated us well during our visit. My friend had a few beers and I had a virgin Cesar. My Cesar drink was amazing and just perfect. However, the food was disgusting, they used poor quality meats and the turkey meat on my club had expired. My friend ordered chicken bites and they were pieces of old thigh meat which smelled bad and were stringy. I actually wanted to vomit after tasting my friends chicken bits. The waitress was aware of this and felt bad but agreed that this food was spoiled and less than par."}
{"text":"Restaurant is dark as hell... their servers look like they want to kill themselves and hate the fact that theyre working there... only reason ppl go there is by default because of the convenience, and their wing night (which they are increasing in price progressively)... Have you ever watched a bar scene in a mob movie that's set in the 70s? Well if you want to relive the shag carpets, dim lighting, woodtrim bar, and servers born in the decade prior, then you should totally go to coopers."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for almost 2 years now and have had no complaints yet. I wanted to finally leave a review because my last visit was excellent!!! My boyfriend and I went in for our usual Tuesday night wing special (wings are on special 4 nights a week, amazing!!). Our server was friendly and was showing us the new drink menu that was brought to Coopers, we never knew there were so many options and different kinds of drinks available! I guess now we do :) anyway, our wings were excellent as always and the service was quick. I would recommend this place for anyone who loves wings but there are many other items on the menu that are hidden gems. We tried the breadsticks as an appetizer, also amazing and soo cheesey! Other menu favorites of ours include the Irish nachos, sheppards pie, Philly cheese steak sandwich.... Many more! But you have to see for yourself. Keep up the good work Coopers :)

Ps. The Blue Hawaiian cocktail is a must try ;)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Coopers enough times to give a true review.

Interior is run down, could use a renovation. 
Food service is very slow. 
No refills on pop. 
There was one time I didn't finish 2 of my wings and the waitress charged me for not finishing them.

Should be a 1 star, but gave a 2 because their wings do taste bomb!"}
{"text":"**HEALTH HAZARD** Please read through many reviews here. Bunch of people including myself have gotten sick after eating here. I ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich and it got my stomach messed up for a good 30-40hrs."}
{"text":"Recently there have been some significant increases in alot of the prices. Some by as much as 20%  Still great wings but that's about it. You still don't get to listen to sports while you're watching it. Have your wings and one beer and go home to watch and listen to the Jay's game."}
{"text":"If this place had atmosphere it would definitely be a 5. I don't think there is any other pub where you can completely stuff yourself for around $10... Sun - Wed (cheap wings) 

If it's busy expect slow service,  usually understaffed.  Sit close to the bar at the back so that you have more access the server. If your on the upstairs section you can wait forever if you need something in addition to the original order."}
{"text":"It ain't pretty but it gets the job done. Food is OK, service varies, and they have decent specials"}
{"text":"I heard about Coopers' cheap wings and finally made it to try it out. Right off the bat, they deserve credit for having wing nights (65 cents each) 4 nights of the week - Mon-Wed and Sunday, and when ordering a drink (can be non-alcoholic).

The place is an older bar, probably dating back to the 80's when I'm sure the area looked a whole lot different. There is something about to be said about it having a genuine atmosphere - albeit a bit dive-y. 

The wings are medium-sized, and the 'hot' is not really all that spicy. There's nothing about them that make them stand out, but they're still wings at the end of the day and still enjoyable. They do offer several flavours to choose from. They charge for dip and don't throw in veggies.

A tall pint of Blue Moon was $6.50. Not a bad price and the pour was right.

Bottom line: good place to go for, for fairly solid and decent priced wings 4 nights of the week."}
{"text":"This place is super dinghy inside.  The waitresses have never changed since the first time I went here, which is about over fifteen years ago.  I love the wings here, but the price of the wings have steadily increased and the wings itself has gotten smaller.  I used to frequent this place often because the wings were bomb and cheap, but now I don't think it's worth it.  I still love their style of wings though, they are natural, are non-breaded and not steroid induced wings."}
{"text":"I have had beers here several times. I have always had a pleasant experience. Waitresses are polite and good looking. And that's important for me.

It's a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Coopers has been around for decades. I've been a customer for almost 12 years. They are known for their large television screens...... not the food. 

If you are here for wings, take a hike - you only get a deal if you purchase a drink with (at 3.50 per cup). Not to mention the wing's belong to baby chickens. It's pub food, there isn't much to expect much here

However, If you are looking for a place to watch a FIGHT or a FINALS game. This IS the place to BE!

Seating area is big. If ya didn't find a seat - no problem, just stand like the rest of us.

If you are coming with a group, carpooling would be a great idea whether a Sunday to Saturday you will have a find very hard time getting a parking space. 

Service is 3/5 stars
Food is 2/5 stars
Price is 2/5 stars

The place could use a remodel because it is very outdated. Many of chairs are falling apart."}
{"text":"I go here when i'm in Mississauga. They have cheap wing days during the week. The wings aren't the best, but worth the price."}
{"text":"Bad wings, bad quesadilla, beer was fine when it eventually arrived waitress was slow, bartender poured the beer right away and it sat there for 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday for lunch. I have been here once or twice for drinks but this was the first time to eat. As it was Friday and fish and chips was one of the specials I decided to have that. When it arrived, as hungry as I was, I thought this doesn't look that good. I couldn't really say what it was that didn't look good but it didn't. When I cut into the fish the grease pooled on the surface. The fries were ok but not great. The service was slow but not too bad even though the place was not busy by any means. I felt gross all afternoon. I would maybe go there again for a drink but never again to eat."}
{"text":"A friend organized a get together for a bunch of us and we went out to his favourite place for \"wings\".  I was kinda sold when he said wing night was something like 30 cents for a wing (perfect!), what could go wrong right?

Well it turns out... a lot.  The wings were not really that great.  When it comes to wings, you can screw them up in one of two ways... the sauce and overcooking them.  Cooper's Pub has managed to do both (that's a 100% failure rate).  I found the sauce abysmal, sure they have a bunch of different sauces, but they don't really stand out at all or taste amazingly different.  It was pretty much honey tasting sauce, and \"hot\" sauce.  Speaking of which, \"hot\" is a relative term I guess, because their \"hot\" sauce is weaker than Frank's Red Hot sauce.  For all of you who actually do like hot sauce you'll know what I mean; Frank's is maybe a \"medium\" hot sauce.  The worst thing I think you can do to a wing is overcook it as well.  I really don't like eating jerky wings, maybe that's how they get you to buy more beer.

I didn't really find anything wrong with the beer, it's pretty much standard.  However it was kinda interesting when one of us ordered a sprite and got a coke.  Maybe next time they'll give me beer when I order a water... It's a miracle!!"}
{"text":"I went here with some family friends the other day. It's a nice relaxed atmosphere that was likely quiet due to the fact that it was a Monday night with no big sports game on (that I could tell). The highlight of my experience was the chicken and Cheese bake pie which was something I had never heard of before. it was delicious and will have me craving it in the future. The portions were fairly sizable for the prices and although the pie took a couple of bites to become accustomed to the spicing by the end I was craving more. 

The delicious pie was paired with a Caesar salad that had such buttery, melt-in-your-mouth croutons, it made up for the fact that the salad was drenched in Caesar dressing. The lost star was related to my friend having a gluton intolerance and after spending 5 minutes discussing with the waitress what she could eat off the menu and the waitress assuring her it was 'gluton free' everything had bread on or in it. Thankfully, this friend did not have an allergy but people who do have allergies should beware.

Regardless of that, we were all impressed and will be happy to return in the future."}
{"text":"Not the best food you can find in a typical pub, but nice place with great music and good priced drinks!"}
{"text":"Once or twice a year when we finally decide to bite the bullet and have wings, we go to Coopers Pub as their wings are the BEST!  Love, love, love this place!  The wings are really inexpensive on game night and Sundays; they have a variety to choose from and they are always fresh, fully cooked and not breaded like some other wing places.  I recall the french onion soup being really good too.  Service is friendly and they have a good selection of beer on tap - would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was with a bunch of friends and picked this place over Jack Astors and boy was that a mistake, I've never had worse food EVER. The waitresses are very push and force you to buy beer or any other alcoholic drink which doesn't necessarily float my boat.
Asides from that there's nothing really about this place that can redeem itself. I would only go to this place as an absolute last resort."}
{"text":"Their food.... terrible. Their service... terrible... Their cleanliness... terrible... we came here expecting nothing much since it's a pub. It's beer and futbol. But come on! It took us about 20mins to get drinks. 10mins to get menus. We had to continuously ask for refills and it took about 40mins to get our food which was just appetizers (The food was cold). This is when I decided not to tip. Which usually I tip very well. Also the table was sticky and the lady got an attitude when asked if we could get it cleaned."}
{"text":"Great for a quick beer and wings...it could use a little make over or clean up have been going for almost 17 yrs."}
{"text":"For me, I base my pubs almost entirely on atmosphere; Cooper's is very lacking in this department.  I've been there a few times, only because it's so close to where I live.  There is a lot of seating, which is great - only problem is most of the seats are usually empty; I guess it's ok if the purpose of you going there is to play musical chairs with a very large group.

I haven't had much to eat there other than the wings, which were pretty standard for a pub.  They do have a big projector screen that they pull out for big sporting events, which is cool and something that I look for.  But even then, I still find the place to be relatively empty; this could also be due in part to the snobby staff.

My suggestion is head to a nearby Jack Astor's or Boston Pizza instead - they're close by, the prices are about the same, and the atmosphere is much better."}
{"text":"Went there for wing night.  The wings were of decent size and comes in a variety of flavors.  I almost all the flavors with favorites being the spicy honey garlic and the curry.  This place is better than before as I have been there a long time ago but have not had a good experience.  Service was as expected and had a pleasant casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend for game 3 of the NBA finals with my friends. We usually go to Wacky Wings but decided to try a new bar...and we loved it! The atmosphere was great and fit us so well. It wasn't as loud and as bright as Wacky. We preferred the darker, more mellow atmosphere as we were able to discuss the game, hear each other and still cheer with the rest of the customers when something exciting happened. 

The food was also awesome, and the prices even better. We ordered wings, only to be told that they were 55 cents a wing that day (Sunday) with a beverage. How awesome is that! We had wings all night as we watched LeBron James put on a special performance. 

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I felt the waitresses were a little lacking. Don't get me wrong, the service was great as we got our food on time, drinks refilled and all that, but I just wish they smiled more and were a little more friendly. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but they didn't look too happy which was a little disappointing for us. 

Despite that, we had an amazing time and will definitely be back. Most of us enjoyed our experience more than Wacky Wings."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years..
Love the food.. Drinks... Staff could be friendlier... Other than that.. Love this place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice because my friend like to take advantage of the cheap wings night. And I've had bad experiences both times. First of all, the wings are just average so it's really only worth it to go on Wednesday. What I ha ted about this place was the service. Well, the lack thereof. Nobody seats you. We waited at a table for god knows how long and did not get any service. I had to go up to a server ans ask. And I have to say, the server in our section was terrible. Not attentive at all. She was too busy talking to a group of guys to provide any service. I had to go up to some servers (who were chit chatting) at the register to ask for my bill, which they rudely ignored me at first. If you see a customer who clearly requires something, you drop what you are doing and serve them. And then leisurely told my server. So she comes to my table after who knows how long and gets out plates and whatever. I assume she was told to bring me my bill, but nope! she goes back to talking to that group of guys. I go up to her and tell her I want my bill, so she gets it and finally brings it to me and we go up to the register. I pay and she hands me the receipt and tells me to sign and leave her a copy and she promptly walks away back to her fanboys. Suffice to say, I didn't tip her.

Never going to this place again. Awful."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I was sort of forced to eat here. Having been here once before, I was very hesitant. It was my boyfriend's birthday and he has some sort of strange attachment to this place.

We were the first customers in on a Wednesday afternoon, but the bar quickly had another 6 tables join as there was a soccer game happening. Right off the bat, the single server looked overwhelmed. Rightfully so. But there was also a tinge of aggression in her serving style.

My boyfriend ordered the wings, I got the Irish nachos. The wings looked okay, he didn't seem to complain at all. My Irish nachos were very dry and underwhelmed in terms of adornments. What did come on top was a scant sprinkle of cheese, dried up green onions, flaccid lettuce and unpleasant looking tomatoes. On the side, small cups of salsa and sour cream. I was not pleased with my choice.

I suggested I might hit the washroom before we left and my boyfriend straight up told me not to bother and just wait until we got home. I didn't probe any further, but I can only imagine what he did not want me to experience.

The latter part of the day was spent suffering from stomach issues. Seriously."}
{"text":"Came to Coopers to watch the Rapters game on a friday night. When the game is playing, you can get a pitcher and pound of wings for $26. Thats amazing!!!!!!!! They have a variety of wing flavours. 
I really liked how they had so many tv screens and a huge projector screen for the game! 
The atmosphere is kind of old and dingy but they have lots of tables and friendly staff. 
They also have a variety of food options from apps, salads, burgers and steaks. They also have daily dinner specials."}
{"text":"Lol this place is something else...First off, let me start by saying this place is dingy AF!! They could seriously use a renovation! It's super dark, (not in a romantic way) dusty, and it has this weird musty odour the moment you walk in.  The carpets are old, stained, and just plain dirty.  The decor is super outdated. The chairs and tables need changing. The washroom...oh god the washroom needs cleaning, scrubbing, sanitizing, deodorizing, anything that'll make this place comfortable for customers to use!! The fact that there was a used tampon BESIDE the sink is just plain nasty!

The food is like 3 day old microwaved leftovers.  The ribs were way too overcooked and super dry and chewy and to make up for the dryness they lather it with bbq sauce hoping the customers won't notice.  Potato skins were a joke.  It was black...from being overcooked.  Again, they serve it with sour cream to compensate for the skins being black and burnt.  

Waitresses were nice BUT they do lack enthusiasm, and look like they don't want to be there.  I mean who could blame them.

I was here on Friday and the fact that I could smell marijuana near the men's washroom is just a complete joke x5000.  I could also smell it from the older couple sitting beside us who seem to be a regular at the restaurant as they would conversate with the people at the bar and the waitresses.  They would also walk in and out multiple times for a \"smoke\".

Oh yeah did I mention my stomach hurt from eating here? Yeah definitely a clean and delicious place to dine in....LOL"}
{"text":"i come here cause its close to home and i walk after having a few too many pints. on hockey nights they offer a pretty sweet deal at .39/wing. an abundance of different flavours, i usually dont wonder off other than occasionally geting the jerk flavour. it's a pretty relax pub atomsphere and hockey nights bring in big crowds. service could be better and so can the kitchen. Its a nice spot wish they put more effort into the food."}
{"text":"I used to come for lunch with my siblings. They're big fans of chicken wings & they used to be amazing here. However, there was a change in chefs or something because apparently they stopped being so good.
I thoroughly enjoy the all day breakfast. I really love breakfast, and thus I have it whenever I go, unless it's dinner, then I get a burger. Everything Ive eaten there has been amazing. I've tried one of the sandwiches but it wasn't that memorable. 
Service is always really happy, but I've never been there at night so I'm not sure how rowdy it gets."}
{"text":"Coopers has been our Mississauga hangout place #6 or something like that.... on the list are also West 50, Starbucks...

It's one of my least preferred place though. It's a dark sports bar with wings/beer specials on Leafs games. My group is not the hockey bunch, so we avoid here on game nights.

On other nights when we do visit, it would usually be a late night time 9pm, 10pm... 11pm. Those would be the \"umm what are you doing to pass the time tonight? lets chill somewhere. [insert options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,..... if these are rejected then] okay, Coopers?\"

Coopers is very quiet on non-game nights.

There are your typical bar food, the typical bar drinks. The typical bar setting. Your server is typically pleasant. I haven't had terrible service here yet (that's probably what's keeping us here!)

Wings, some of my friends LOVE them. Others, like me, have had better. For this price? Oh yeah, you'd have had better too.

Here's what I'd recommend for anyone coming for the \"yeeeahhh fineeee, lets just chill here\" night:
- Irish Nachos $9.99 - large plate to share of potato slices with cheese, jalapeno, tomato and green onion. And salsa of course. And sour cream if you like that too.
- Coopers Signature Spinach Dip $9.29 - you can't go wrong with spinach dip and chips! 
- Jalapeno Poppers $7.99 - It's been a while since my last order of this. I remember there were 5???? 


Service here is great! Thank you for being wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went there for the Super Bowl ! Their Super Bowl special menu was great! Everything was priced very good. Nothing overpriced.
