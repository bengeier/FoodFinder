{"text":"What a fabulous find in Vegas!!!!!.  Great service... great prices.. delicious food.  We spent 2 wonderful afternoons in the Container Shops.  All staff went above and beyond to help us make wonderful memories.   We came with our friend who is very ill.  I highly recommend when in Vegas take time to see this wonderful area.  Say hello to Sarah, she makes everyone feel special.  Thank you Sarah and your staff.  Your the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my new favorite brunch spots!!   The food and the service was was great!! The monkey bread was to die for!!!    I had breakfast steak tacos they delish and season well the only thing I would add would have been a Verde salsa   My friend had the terrace. Although I can't have the shellfish I tasted the corn, avacado, cilantro chimichchurri and it was lite and refreshing"}
{"text":"Wir waren im Mai hier essen. Wir hatten einen Groupon-Gutschein \"Two Brunch Entrees and Two Well Drinks for Two People\" für 25$ gekauft. Der Laden ist etwas klein und akustisch eine Katastrophe. Es ist sehr laut (wir waren vormittags dort), obwohl gar nicht viel Platz für viele Leute ist. Das ist aber auch schon der einzige Kritikpunkt. Wir hatten 2 x den Perch Burger + Bier und wir waren sehr zufrieden. Der Burger war sehr gut, die Pommes hingegen waren nicht wirklich toll, eher weich und kein Genuss. Uns ging es eh nur um den Burger und der war top und genug zum satt werden. Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und hat sich regelmäßig versichert, dass wir alles haben, was wir brauchen.  Das Essen war den (Groupon-)Preis auf jeden Fall wert und das Bier war ja auch schon inklusive. So blieb für uns vor Ort dann nur noch das Trinkgeld. Der Groupon-Gutschein wurde ohne Diskussion angenommen und verrechnet. Mit Groupon-Gutschein würden wir wiederkommen. Ohne eher nicht, weil es uns zu laut war."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with the staff here. The food came out quickly. Definitely checked in and got the free 6 oz. The server was very personable. I couldn't ask for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"The reviews brought us  down to container park and Perch. Brunch menu looked good and it wasn't too crowded. We noticed the tables all said reserved and finally found the hostess stand which we had walked past because it was not manned. We stood there for over 10 minutes as several people walked by and said \"we'll be right with you\". There were two other couples standing there as well when finally someone came up and said oh I'm sorry we're closing & in an hour & can't seat you now. If this is what we could've expected for the level of service and food I would not even attempt to go back."}
{"text":"Love it ... Very nice and chill spot .... Love the freshness of the food ....container park is nice spot to hang out as well ..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place it's such an adorable spot and it's so modern. The food was so tasty! I got the eggs biscuits and gravy I believe. I also used to drink special they have on here.. what I wasn't a big fan of is the service. I know places like this amazing customer service isn't required, but sometimes you just have to be nice. I asked the server what people usually get when they use the yelp coupon. & he replied back with 'ha, idk you're the one drinking it.' Like ok, come on dude... I asked bc this was my first time. Overall though, I had a good time with the people I went with. I would like go to again!"}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is delicious ! The staff is super friendly. Definitely a \"go to\" healthy super tastey menu. The crab cakes are some of the best I've had! Randy our server recommended the salmon and man was she spot on!"}
{"text":"The food was great I had the shrimp spicy pasta with a Star mojito. I gave this place a two star because the service sucked. We got seated it took about 15/20mins just to get waters and our drink orders to be take by whom I think is the manager the waiter Brendan came twice, once just to drop off the food, and to drop off the check. He didn't even ask if we wanted another cocktail which is very disappointing since they were great. It's not always about the food that keeps people coming back it's the experience.."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. Everything we tried on the menu was delicious, including the cocktails.  If we're in the area again, we'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. I haven't been disappointed with the food yet. The spicy shrimp pasta made with sriracha, tomatoes, and herbs is delicious. The burger with fried green tomatoes and provolone is juicy and tender. The flatbreads are classic and simple.   Their location overlooking the Container Park is prime real estate with the outdoor patio perfect for people watching. I hear they have happy hour as well.   The only reason I took a star off is because the food takes a long time to prepare. Perhaps they have a small kitchen, but even then the wait time shouldn't be as long as it is every visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service it started as soon as walked in. I got a to go order which they said would take 10 to 15 minutes. It ended up being around 40 minutes. Food was cold when we got it. I asked for a free mimosa they said couldnt do it. I should have went to dennys. Better food for the price compared to this place."}
{"text":"This place is hands down AMAZING! Great food, great service, AWESOME Bloody Marys! They take their food service seriously! The Terrace is undoubtedly one of THE BEST things I've EVER eaten! Only downside is that because it's a container place it's a bit noisy, but worth overlooking that for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats and the food came hot and delicious. The power green salad is super fresh and my veggie burger, served with perfectly prepared French fries, had a ton of flavor and really satisfied my craving for a hearty vegetarian lunch. I will definitely check this place out again."}
{"text":"best place to eat in container park! salmon, beef carpaccio, and the calamari are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Lovely location.  Fun atmosphere.  I had the Quinoa Chicken, which was delicious. I nearly ordered another plate.  The server was very helpful and accommodating to my allergies and very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared."}
{"text":"Attentive servers and wonderful flavors. The Perch is a smaller restaurant with all windows in the dining area for an open cheerful feel. The pizza and salad we tried were a fantastic medley of taste. The chef even came out to ask us what we thought of the newer dessert blueberry lemon creme brulee and it was divine."}
{"text":"This place is nicely PERCHed above the lovely Container Park. First time here and it's a really very pleasant atmosphere.   I got the build-it-yourself Bloody Mary to drink and it was fantastic to be able to control the proportions to your liking. It also felt like you got drinks two for one.   The crab cakes were delicious.   We ordered the Allegra flatbread. The black bean spread and chimichurri sauce were tasty.   The glazed pear cup was amazing! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Perch is a must if you're in the downtown area looking for delicious comfort food! Couldn't decide between just one dish so had to get the chicken & waffles special, hanger steak sandwich and margarita flatbread. The chicken and waffles was my personal favorite, the waffles were fluffy and the chicken had great flavor! Josh was our waiter and he gave us great service and provided his recommendation for the best lunch."}
{"text":"Ate brunch here with a couple of friends. Were pleasantly surprised by the food (I had tacos with guac). Service was great and bloody mary was excellent as well. Cool idea that all the places in the park are in old shipping containers. I would definitely go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"As a local I am always looking for a great place to hang out, eat and drink. The Perch is one of those places, they have great food, nice drink selection, amazing service, great looking staff. Our Bartender Brandon, recommended some new drinks to try for our group on Saturday ... great options and tasted great!  When I go I like to hang out have a few drinks either on the patio or inside at the bar, outside there are a few tables that look over the Container Park's courtyard.   I recommend this place, 5 stars for The Perch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try The Perch based on reviews and its location. The atmosphere was nice, but the service and food were lacking. Our food took forever to come out. Several different parties who arrived and ordered after us received their food before us. When our food did arrive, my husband's chicken (from the chicken and waffles) was frozen in the middle. The drinks were good and so was the coffee, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in here the other day for lunch.  Not that busy for a weekday lunch crowd.  Maybe the 100+ degree weather had something to do with it?    As usual for restaurants, nothing veg here except for a salad.  And why do restauants insist on charging you full price AFTER you've removed all the meat & dairy from a dish?  I don't patronize such places a second time.  I'll stick to Vegenation."}
{"text":"Moderne og kul restaurant. God mat, men litt lang ventetid - likevel verdt et besøk!!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing servers, kind hostess, amazing bottomless mimosas!  My husband had the steak and egg tacos, super tasty.  I had the biscuit and eggs, probably my favorite I've ever had.  If we were local, this would probably be our go to brunch spot.  They definitely don't skimp on the bottomless aspect of drinks either! They made sure our glasses were always full :) great establishment."}
{"text":"What a bomb brunch! My fiancé and I have been wanting it come here for a while and it didn't disappoint. Started out with the the monkey bread which is a must have! Chicken and waffles for me and the egg white omelette for my fiancé both were really really good and oh yeah the bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas were delicious. Hope be back soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. It far exceeded our expectations. The service was friendly and attentive. Recommend it for something different."}
{"text":"If I lived here this would be one of my favorite spots to go, especially since I have a little one who would love the play area in the Container Park. The food was yummy, the drinks were great, and the service was outstanding. I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food is FANTASTIC!!!! I went on a Sunday for brunch and had chicken and waffles.......OMG.... Soooo great!! I'm going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The service was good.   Very loud inside. If  your a drinker then this is the place to go. Portions very small."}
{"text":"I am so unhappy with the way we were treated when we went to brunch for our friend's birthday. We were told that we need to quiet down, so we did. We wanted to sing happy birthday to our friend so we got approval from our waitress and next thing you know, we were told we had to leave. The guy that kicked us out said that we were challenging him, which wasn't true at all. We have been there plenty of times and had a great time, but this time was absolutely horrible. I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in at random while seeing Fremont Street...steak & fries was awesome.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Superfun time! Great ambiance and our server Michael was so accommodating for our vegan food preferences."}
{"text":"Service is atrocious...3rd time was the charm. Never again...the ginger guy is cute but get your staff together"}
{"text":"Is a great place. Nora is a great waitress. I'm sure the other waitresses too. Food and drinks were awesome."}
{"text":"The Perch was really a surprise in everyway. First I didn't see the business at the rear of the park. Now let's talk about the food- Amazing!!. I especially like that it wasn't too much less is better when it's good and has great presentation. The staff was friendly and not over the top in your face. The decor was simple yet very tasteful with contempo feel. Can't wait to bring my out of town friends to this great find. Kudos to everyone at the Perch"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great people working here. Highly recommend.  Their smothered biscuits are to die for. Will come here just for that."}
{"text":"My brother and I went here for a drink and a snack after brunch. We'd heard good things and we're pretty excited. We were tempted by the $15 bottomless brunch drinks, but we're extremely disappointed when they arrived at the table. I was texting a friend and didn't even look up from my phone at the drink that had been placed before commenting \"this smells like it's going to taste bad.\" My brother took the first drink of the Bloody Mary, and scrunched his face up immediately. I started to drink mine and it too was awful. By that point our mom had called and we needed to leave to meet her so we didn't bother complaining, or trying to get the drinks switched. Instead we told them that we needed to leave and would just like to pay for the single priced bloody Mary's. Alone they are $10 each, which is complete insanity. How are you going to charge someone $10 for that garbage? I will say the food looked amazing, but they need to figure out what's up with their mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they first opened and still one of my favorite places in DTLV. Cool vibe, staff rocks, and the chef makes the best tuna tartare in town. Love this place for lunch & a beer!"}
{"text":"The Perch is a cute venue to have brunch with your family, group of friends, or on a date.  I went there on a Saturday morning and it was not too crowded.  Our server was Ona and she took great care of us.  She was so down to earth and made us feel at home.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a fried green tomato and avocado and it was spectacular! Also, their bellinis are made with peach puree instead of peach juice which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"WOW, talk about a great first impression that meets every expectation. Opening now at 9 AM, my wife and I arrived at 9:30 ready for a Bloody Mary, after a typical Friday night Las Vegas binge.  The Perch is located at the very rear of Container Park, so you don't see it at you enter the Park.  Two very friendly security guards greeted us at the entrance, informed us that only one place was open (the retailers open at 11 AM), \"The Perch\" they said and directed to the rear.  The approach is very inviting with a terrace that's starts as a sky walk, leads to the entrance, then continues around the entire bistro.    The staff was wonderfully positive with welcoming warm smiles and present natures.    The ambiance is jazzy with a hyper-modern mix that is bright while intimate ... a pleasing dichotomy.  All that and my palate was totally satisfied."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on the weekend.  Menu has a good variety and service was on point."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!! Me and a friend stopped in for a late dinner while walking around Container Park. I had never been before, but boy am I glad I did! I have found my new contemporary go-to spot to have drinks and food while in CPDT.   The atmosphere was very pretty. The space is tight, but the way they positioned the tables made it feel open and airy. The deco was inviting and comfortable while still being stylish.   The staff was WONDERFUL and genuinely sweet! Loved them all!  The great service was the reason we didn't complain about the few gripes we had about our food. Excellent service!  The food: I had the Angel hair pasta and it was delicious! The only grip I have was that the pasta was slightly dry (possibly from sitting out in open air for too long?). I expected it to be moist or have a little more oil to keep the pasta from sticking together. The flavor was very good, especially with the almonds and currants. It gave it a smokey and sweet flavor that I LOVED! I will be having this dish again! As long as the pasta is not dry ;)  My friend's dish: She ordered the grilled salmon and OMFG!!! IT WAS AMAZING! I was so jealous! The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned! So freaking good!! It was a perfect pairing with the asparagus and brussels spouts on the bottom (and I'm not even a fan of brussels sprouts). It was heavenly!! But of course there was one problem (other than the small portion size): The avocado sauce on top of the salmon was OVERSALTED! I'm talking the make your glands explode type of salty. It was disappointing, but thankfully the dish was still so AMAZING that it wasn't a big deal. She still wolfed it down. She basically CLEANED the bowl!  The portion size was great for the price (except the salmon dish) and we walked away with full bellies. I would definitely come back very soon and recommend to anyone!   **I can't review the drinks because we already had drinks from their sister bar, Oak&Ivy (MY FAVORITE BAR IN CPDT!!). It was already late anyway and we didn't want to drink again. We also didn't get dessert because nothing stood out, but I'll give it a try next time**"}
{"text":"I went to this place on 9/15/15 with my friends. We were a party of 6 and we were seated at a table just below the vent of the a/c on blast. I ordered a mojito which arrived 20 minutes later. Our food never got to our table because an hour after we ordered the food was not ready. the waiter never asked how we were doing (waiting in the cold, HUNGRY..is not fun) The server decided to humiliate us by giving us a cold sandwich that was left over from who knows who as if we were there to beg for food, important to emphasize that there were few customers and many people in the kitchen visible from outside, who knows what they were doing.. obviously not cooking."}
{"text":"Best meal so far on our trip to Vegas. Got off the strip and over to Container Park and ate here. Started with the Tuna Tartare - super good, then shared a massive power greens salad - yum!  One of us has the salmon - better than the salmon had a previous night at some fancy steakhouse at the Mirage. Other had the Perch burger - best burger I've had in a long time. Band playing down below us in the park while we ate. Half the cost of meals on the strip, and better.  Atmosphere is top notch. Great friendly, attentive service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun place to try. They had a different kind of foods. Something different! I had the margarita pizza; was Delish!! Calamari and crab cakes my husband loved.  My husband had a IPA beer, he liked it a lot.  Kids menu price was very reasonable. Service was really attentive and good!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group to celebrate celebrate a 40th birthday. There were ~23 of us from across the nation, who came here for brunch that was reserved several weeks in advance. The prefixed menu options were not available, the fryer broke down. However, the host was not notified until our arrival and there was no adequate substitution provided.  May not be a good idea for large groups."}
{"text":"I've been to the Perch multiple times and have had good experiences, but this past weekend was terrible. We had a group that spent well over $500 and were asked to leave - very conveniently after we had finished paying and all tipped extremely well. The place is small and far from quiet, and after being asked to quiet down once we were ushered out. The staff asking other customers to complain about our group specifically is petty and ridiculous, and we're disappointed to lose one of our go-to brunch spots."}
{"text":"I come to the Perch at least once a week and honestly it gets better each time. The food is high quality and affordable, the drinks are well prepared, but mostly the service is utterly incredible. From chefs to servers to bartenders, every member of the staff goes out of their way to ensure your trip was worth it. If you want a treat, go during the early afternoon shift with Stefan the bartender, Blair the manager, and the server Brandon. I promise you won't regret it. You'll feel like family. Also, customized drinks!"}
{"text":"This place hardly needs another positive review, but like others, I had a very good meal. The only drawback was it super busy and zany when we arrived and the staff didn't pay much attention to us. We finally got their attention and were put on the wait list and I am glad we did. The food was very good. The location is fun and the décor is cute. I give it a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Nice dining in a container park, who knew?  The salmon entree was served with what I would call guacamole that was delicious.  The accompanying Brussels sprouts were also done well...and thank you for asking how I \"done\" I preferred my salmon!  That question is asked so rarely for fish that it threw us all for a loop.    The hanger steak sandwich was also a hit.  Full of flavor with amazing carmelized onions.  Really good fries.   Limited, but interesting and appropriate beer and wine selection.  Service was friendly and attentive.   If the weather permits, sit on the patio."}
{"text":"We just love the selection of food and drinks at the Perch. So much so that we went there twice in our short trip. The service is great and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. We may just plan a trip once again to go here once again."}
{"text":"Yet another amazing experience at the Perch.  I came for the brunch on this Labor day and although they were packed and busy. I was given plenty of attention and the service was excellent.  I had the white egg omelet and OMG, it was DELICIOUS! I'd recommend it.  Nora and Stefan at the bar were so cheerful and bubbly. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Got the Perch burger and lettuce cups for a late lunch on a birthday date. Both were very good and everything went past my expectations. The fried tomato in the burger was my first ever so that was a treat ;) The lettuce cups were very good but the sauce it comes with is pretty spicy! In all my boyfriend and I loved it. Walked out of there with happy faces and bellies."}
{"text":"The best meal I had the entire time on my week long Vegas visit!  Great service, super clean and great food.  All 4 of us loved our appetizers and meals.  Definitely worth the time to come and eat here."}
{"text":"Went to Perch as part of a large group. The organizer of our event had settled on a pre-fixed menu that consisted of: 1. Chicken and Waffle 2. Breakfast sandwich with chorizo or beef 3. Smothered biscuits with Turkey Sausage When we arrived we were told the fryer had broken and that option 1 was no longer available, and option 3 actually contained pork sausage. There were no other options for people who did not eat beef or pork.   The management was unwilling to compromise and offer reasonable alternatives. Additionally, he was condescending and tried to blame the our event organizer for choosing a pre-fixed menu. It is not our event organizers fault that the fryer broke, and it was not their fault that management was inflexible.  I will note that our servers (Shawn and Jessica) were very nice. I cannot speak to the quality of the food (because I did not eat any). However, if you are thinking of having any sort of large group event here... DON'T!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  Great food and Brandon's drinks are like works of art!  I vist the Perch every time I am in Vegas.  Fun place, chill atmosphere and great music."}
{"text":"I really should have walked out when I noticed almost all tables seated still waiting on food.. But decided to give it a shot based on the Yelp recommendation and IG reviews.   Sat and watched multiple servers walk past us for a few minutes- no greeting what so ever. I had my heart set on ordering a salad on the lunch menu I had seen only to find out that they are only serving their brunch menu. Limited to say the least. Egg white skillet only offered 2 choices and of course the protein options were extra. Spent $15 on egg whites. No toast, No potatoes. Hubby ordered the Perch burger which pretty much came with 10 french fries. We both left hungry. To top it off we waited 30 minutes. $45 check came for some egg whites a burger and a bloody mary. Not worth it.  In summary, over priced, slow service and tiny portions."}
{"text":"So good!!! The Bianca Flatbread with steak added.... Oh my yum!!! Amazing! And Brandon Walker is not only perfect eye candy, his service is on point. Legit. Def recommended. Music is perhaps more delicious than the food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Checking out the Container Park and then decided to have a brunch at this place. First, it was a small restaurant but nice decor and setup. There was no host at all so the waiter said we could sit wherever we want. Okay, got it. Next, he poured us some water and then took the extra napkin and utensils from our table. For the next 10 minutes...tik tok tik tok... no one ever came to our table and asked for our order? I kept looking around and found so many employees on a small establishment but yet no one can ever keep up the guests? I could even serve guest by myself only with that small establishment. Soon, an employee passed by and I grabbed him and told him our order and he said.. Sorry, I am not your waiter but what do you want? Well, nobody paid attention to us??? So if he is not the waiter but can he just HALLER???? to anyone? So he took our order and then tik tok tik tok for another 15 mins. our order still not coming and yet the people right after us got already their order before us?? Umm time to stand up and walked away!!!   To the management of The Perch... Please... look around your establishment...It is not hard to keep up with your customer. I can do it with my one eye closed serving guests. Let alone you have at least 6-7 employee that wasn't paying attention. Time To Gather Your People and Re-Trained Them."}
{"text":"Absolutely great spot to eat and drink. Ordered the tuna tartare to start which was excellent. Followed by the chicken and quinoa - which was out of this world!! One of the best chicken dishes I've had. The shrimp salad was also top quality. It's W Worth making the trip downtown for sure!   And top class service to go with it as well.   Overall, faultless."}
{"text":"We're natives and this is one of the best places we've found in the city for brunch. Great drink specials, very reasonable menu prices and excellent service from our bartender Shauna. Try the bacon flight, it'll change your #%^*ing life!!"}
{"text":"So I went on a Friday night around 630p. It just finished raining, maybe that's the reason why it was empty. Sat down right away and ordered drinks that came out a few minutes after. Ordered the grilled salmon. The salmon is cooked at a medium temp with an avocado spread on top (SO SO GOOD!). Salmon is placed over roasted brussel sprouts and asparagus. By far one of the best meals I've had in a while!! Please go try !!"}
{"text":"We wanted to get away from the chaotic Vegas strip so we kept walking down Fremont and ended up here. Out of all the places we've been too since Sunday this has been by far the BEST! I didn't give this place a 5 star only because we didn't get to try the food but the mojito drinks were some of the best I've had.   I'll definitely be back to try the food!! I'm sure it's just as amazing!"}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting The Perch. The service was great and the drinks were fantastic. My husband had the most delicious Bloody Mary, and we've had our share of them at various Vegas locations. I had the Blueberry Mojito and it was also fantastic. They have a cute little lounge-type area outside with couches and tables with small lamps.  The night we were out was a bit cold, but it was perfect for cuddling and people watching. We had a great view of the park and the children's play area. This place is located in the Container Park in Downtown Vegas. Just look for the huge flaming praying mantis out front and go right in. It's free to get in.  You just can't take in or take out alcohol."}
{"text":"Must go to place to eat in Las Vegas.food is great... service is amazing. ... you think you are along the beach Hog Car Tours of las vegas brought me there... awesome selection."}
{"text":"Overpriced beer with lack in service. When you sit outside you get tiny 12 oz cups for $7 for ordinary draft beer. Also, note to the wait staff...just because I'm only ordering drinks on a friday night, there no need to bring me my check early and give me a judgmental look. It makes me feel that you think I'm going to dine and dash."}
{"text":"What an incredible find! The container park is such a cool concept- an oasis, really. The Perch is aptly named as it gives a great view of the park. The food was fresh and fantastic and we loved the DIY blood mary. Service was fantastic as well- thank you Amy for treating so well! We were staying downtown and it was nice to get a bit of a break from the casino scene and a delicious, refreshing salad. We will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Best meal in Vegas. Paid a lot more money for so so food/service. Excellent, fresh, flavorful food and friendliest service of all!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff are friendly. However, the food is a bit overpriced, portions are on the small side, and the wait can be long. It appears people who complain get served food faster even though they come in after you."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant that I discovered on Yelp when searching for Top Restaurants in Downtown Las Vegas. Seating and service was prompt. We elected to dine inside as it was a bit chilly. Inside area is small and a bit noisy. We started with an appetizer of fried calamari, jalapeno and lemon strips. It was a very generous portion. I'm not a calamari fan, but my partner is. He found it to be delicious. I enjoyed the fried jalapeno strips. My partners choice for an entrée was the spicy shrimp pasta. He really enjoyed it! I dined on the turkey burger with jalapeno and onion straws and provolone cheese. Delicious! We will definitely be back.  For wine lovers, they have a limited wine menu."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a week night. Place had a few customers but not super packed, we were greeted and sat promptly. My BF and I each had an entree and a drink (he had the fried chicken sandwich and an IPA and I had the veggie burger and the Perch martini). Food was fast to the table and really good, my only slight gripe was that I felt like the drinks were a tad overpriced. For what we had, the bill was a bit steep at right at $50. But overall the meal and atmosphere (casual quirky retro) were enjoyable"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident.  It's just a few blocks from Freemont Street.  We didn't like the overpriced and gimmicky choices near our hotel, and found found this lovely little spot on the second level in the corner of a nearby container park.   There wasn't any live music outside the night we went, but the comfy couches and heat lamps made dining outdoors in December perfect.  The food was fresh, healthy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, amazing food, great drinks, reasonable prices, loved the outdoor seating...perfect meal!"}
{"text":"This is our second time their and it was very delicious! Service was nice. My daughter had the kids cheese burger (pretty big size) she was full ,I had the spicy sirracha shrimp penn pasta with lil shavings of parmasean mmm yummy i ate the whole thing ,& my husband had the steak& fries(steak butter is pretty tasty). All a must have. Nora was our server she was on top of it .... nice and attentive ,cleared our plates as soon as we were done with them. Definitely coming back to try some more stuff!"}
{"text":"Food delicious...Dante and Crew, great hospitality. An absolute good spot to satisfy that munchie...even better once the Hell heat drops. View from the deck...excellent for people watching. Give this place and the Container Park a go!"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite!  My sisters and I come in for the exceptional food, craft cocktails and the best service in town.  Brandon is our favorite bartender!  He is polite, professional and funny as hell.  He always remembers what we drink and always humors us when we change our minds at the last second.  The carpaccio is my absolute favorite, although I think my twin would say the Fried Chicken Sandwich and our older sister definitely vies for the calamari. They make the Bloody Mary Mix fresh every day and it is the best I have ever had.  Not to mention, they are super kid friendly!  We bring our whole crew (3 adults and 5 kids) for dinner on movie night in the summers and even the kids are totally happy and comfortable.  The big booths outside are the best, provided it isn't too windy.  Great food, yummy drinks (Ask for a bloody beer if you're into it - Blanc and Bloody Mary Mix - to die for), and extraordinary service."}
{"text":"We went to the perch for the first time...amazing! The food was on point and the drinks were bountiful. I especially liked that you could order something you can share/ snack on.  We truly had a great night. Chris the bartender kept us laughing and also answered all the questions we had about mixed drinks. We will definitely be back again. Thank you for the fun experience."}
{"text":"Took a while for them to take our order but besides that everything was great we did the endless mimosas and Bloody Mary they let us switch it up and kept the bottles coming, & the breakfast sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"Just found another great new restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  I had the Chopped salad which was yummy and my friend had the Alegra flatbread which was good too.  Prices are very reasonable.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive. I will definitely go back! Lots of things on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last sat. Cool place, over looking container park. Def disappointed with the monkey bread it was so dry seems like yesterday's bread that got heated up and drench with caramel sauce. So unappetizing, lack of presentation. Our food was ok. I had the shrimps and grits again drench in sauce and my bf had the chicken and waffles chicken was way over cooked also drench in syrup to a point that the waffles are all soggy. Wouldn't come back here unless we are doing the bottomless mimosas where they give u a whole bottle of champagne so they don't keep coming back and bothering u, Only good thing about it beside the view. Otherwise not worth the trip."}
{"text":"We stopped here without ever having heard of the place and were blown away by the quality of the food and the service. We had the tuna tartare served with deliciously delicate taro root chips that I want bags of on hand at all times, and beef carpaccio with a unique addition of creamy potato puree where we practically licked the plate. After the high quality of those dishes we had to try the beef tartare which was prepared beautifully and also delicious. We also tried the spiced nuts which had a perfect balance of sweet and heat that kept you reaching back for more. A neighboring diner was so in love with her crab cakes she insisted that we try those and those were also tasty with a crunchy slaw that added a texture I usually find lacking in a crab cake. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and had the right amount of attentiveness. There was also a fun and interesting beer list offered. I personally can't wait to go back.  Good food is my favorite thing in the world, and you can tell this chef loves what he does."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to get great drinks, good food and entertainment for your kids this is the place. Sabrina was our server and she was awesome! She was very knowledgeable about the menu (she did not write one thing down). If your ever in the downtown area in Las Vegas it's worth it to drop by!"}
{"text":"When we arrived it wasn't busy at all, there were two of us and we opted to sit outside since it was a nice day.  We asked if we could have a bigger table (so we wouldn't feel cramped since the two person table is SMALL) and we were advised we either sit at the bar or a smaller table or basically LEAVE. Nonetheless we sit outside at a two person table (we had to seat ourselves) and as we were sitting down a waitress moved the place settings to set at a table behind us and then proceeds to say \"did they tell you to sit there\", so obviously someone advised us to sit there, after that we had to wait for someone to bring us place settings and then one side was dirty (from prior use) and the waiter just flips it over.  At this point were still like lets give them the benefit of doubt.  We order drinks (beer and a Moscow mule) we asked if they chilled the beer glasses and the waitress go ticked we asked that, furthermore, the drinks come out and the mule is in a plastic cup (gasp) which is rather sacrilegious for a Moscow mule.  We finally ordered our food (calamari and chicken sandwich)  and 30 minutes later after advising the waitress we haven't received our food (and several tables that sat after us and ordered the same thing had received the food 10 min prior) finally the calamari comes out and once again we had to inform the waitress our other entree hasn't come out so nevertheless after 35 min we receive a froze chicken patty that is cold (I mean really what happened to fresh breaded chicken breast), we advised the waitress about the cold chicken and she asked if I would like for her to warm it up in the microwave (GASSSSSSSSP) um no! Ordered another mule and asked for the copper mug (it tastes better in the copper mug) and at this time the bartender comes out to smooth things over and we were advised that the dishwasher was broken that's why it was in a plastic cup.  To make a long story short the best thing was the fry's and after that experience we will never be back however, we are downtown 3-4x a month at Carson's Kitchen and it is the bestest (yes I said BESTEST) their customer service is always on point, the food is always DELICIOUS and the drinks are absolutely SUPERB!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed about The Perch brunch. Not once did the manager come by to ask our group to keep it down when we spent lots of money for a friends birthday. Had a bartender tell us to keep down the noise once when we weren't even loud, came back a second time to ask us to leave. As much as we enjoyed this spot numerous times for brunch we will not be coming back. Think it's a little ridiculous that we got asked to leave based on the amount of money spent/tip that was included."}
{"text":"This is the second time eating here..both times were really great. The food is very tasty and not a bad price at all. We will definitely be back. I had the perch burger and it was really good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Be sure to check out the bottomless drink  specials.  Nice patio to sit outdoors too."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town must come and try everyone is friendly and real helpful food is amazing."}
{"text":"What a fun little treasure we found!  Our dinner plans fell thru so we had to find a new dining spot quickly. As usual, I jump on Yelp and found The Perch. The staff were really friendly and even brought us a beer after talking about flavor see enjoy in a beer. The food was amazing and fresh. Outside is an area to listen to live music, where the kids can run around and play."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Seriously, the beef carpaccio would rival that of any 5 star steak house. The service was really good, our server was especially attentive. They have a great beer selection on tap ( I recommend their local brew that compares to blue moon). The container park was one of the coolest places I have visited while in Vegas. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Our family plus another visited The Perch for Easter brunch. I had never hear of the place, but it was the only place that we could find that could get our large group in that day; so, we decided to give it a try. Located at Downtown Container Park - what a fun location! I would rate this place semi family-friendly - in that they have high chairs available, a few (limited) menu options for kids. Beyond that, the servers tolerated the children in the restaurant but did not seem overly thrilled to have them as guests. There were not any offerings for the kids - activity pages, etc. Which is totally fine, because we always bring our own just in case. The Easter Brunch menu (and not sure if this differs from their weekly brunch menu) is limited. I wasn't particularly hungry so I went with the seasonal fruit plate (can't go wrong there) & bottomless mimosas for $15. Those in our party that did eat were happy with their meals and everyone had leftovers, so the proportions were enough.  We would go back but not without trying other brunches offered throughout the city first."}
{"text":"Well where do I start????? Come in guy has no clue when our table will be ready ..... Waited 40 minutes for a table then had to call to find out where we were on the list then they said we were next...... (But for how long) So we show up order our drinks.... 10 min pass and we get the first drink we ordered ..... Then order food.... By this time drinks completely empty then time passes .... 15 min later I need to take all 3 drink cups inside and ask for a new drink( furious at this point) then our food comes out wrong medium burger well done , breakfast sandwich missing the burger ..... Last but not less had to tell the manager I saw my server 2 times in the past hour and a half and if you server bottomless you should be able to keep up with your customers ...... Get it together perch !!!!!!"}
{"text":"There is a mutual understanding from downtown families that the Container Park is close to the underage, under 21, after 9 pm.  However, this so called eatery using the title \"kitchen\" attracting families with their sign but closes their doors to families with kids at 8pm. More to the insult, the waiter suggested to take our order as take-out to eat it elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  I didn't expect a lot when I walked in, but it was excellent.  All 7 of us enjoyed the various meals we ate."}
{"text":"Visited this place on 1/04/18. Love the decor and how it overlooks container park. I tried the perch burger, calamari, chicken tenders, & tuna tartare. The perch burger was great, calamari was good, I liked the lemon aioli but the calamari pieces were too small for my liking. The tenders were simple/good. I really liked the mango in the tuna tartare but I felt there could have been a little more tuna inside. Also tried their raspberry margarita which was really good but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped in here and got the calamari appetizer on happy hour ($5) which was amazing and a great deal. I had a berry mojito of some sort that was excellent as well. We didn't get a full meal, just drinks and a light snack but it was a cute, small place with a nice atmosphere overlooking the container park. I would definitely say it's worth it to walk around the park and stop in here for some great drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon, my daughter and I were taking a friend to see downtown Vegas before returning back to Shanghai, China. We stopped at the Container Park to grab something to eat.  The Perch was surprisingly good. We had tuna tartar and fried calamari appetizers. I ordered the steak (it was very tender), my daughter ordered the black bean burger, and our friend ordered the chicken quinoa. It was a delicious experience!  Thank you Chef Marlin!!!~~Dr. K."}
{"text":"This place is in a good location, directly left of the stage in the back of the park. So live entertainment, great fries but poor Customer service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Las Vegas! Outdoor seating is nice, even on super hot days, because there are misters! Monkey bread and/or bottomless mimosas are a must!! Servers are super sweet."}
{"text":"Awesome Hamburger! My wife had the Salmon it was very good. (the portion was small though). Another person in our party had the Steak. She really liked it. Shout out to Daniel our server. He was very friendly, prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the location. Container park has so much to offer. The perch burger was great with many fun drinks to choose."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place and I have to say I love the atmosphere. Im giving this place 2 stars because of the service I was given- if it was based only on our server Sabrina I would give 5 stars. Sabrina was excellent- I recommend you ask for her when you're there. The gentlemen behind the bar and the other gentlemen who was a server, treated our party like we were a burden to be there. When I pay for a service I expect good service or at least some courtesy. I did not receive that from those two gentlemen whose names I did not get. I food and drinks took a while to come out but we did not complain- but the horrible service is what tipped the scale. Sabrina deserves 5 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome Experience! Great Live Music on a Saturday Night! The food was excellent and the drinks were made perfectly from Martini to Old Fashioned. Had a GREAT time. Our server Alexis was SPOT ON!! Service with a smile and attentive at every moment. We'll be BACK!! Visiting from Texas and Celebrating a Birthday. Alexis surprised us with a Birthday dessert. Much Thanks to the Perch Staff!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed food! We got the Margarita Pizza, Pasta Primavera, wedge Salad, and chicken strips! They were all great! I got a margarita and it was amazing! The waiter was attentive and friendly. Definitely coming back to the place next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Located in the container park with seating inside and out. It was windy when I was there so decided to sit inside. I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere. Uncomfortable iron chairs to sit at tables & paper plates to eat on. There was a few cushy chairs at a large table but I didn't want to take up a whole table for 2 people. There were employees that weren't working sitting at the bar & they kept bringing people in the kitchen for some reason. It took awhile to get waited on but service did improve.    We only ordered the Bianca flat bread. It was really good but it did not have one hint of white truffle oil that was supposed to be on it. Little disappointed about that.   Overall not a place I would make a point to go back to."}
{"text":"The food was interesting, but I would not return. The service was disappointing, the server reached and his armpit was in my guest's face. The location is so loud it is difficult to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Good food, quality service and a good selection of drinks. Enjoyed our visit all around and that's more than we expected on a blind drop in."}
{"text":"My group came here for a work lunch on a weekday and when we arrived there were several open tables. We were seated immediately and ordered quickly. The server mentioned they were out of broccoli and offered asparagus as a replacement, which we were totally fine with.  After about thirty five minutes, we started to wonder where our food was, especially since some tables seated after us had already received their meals. Our server came by and apologized and said the food was being plated.   We then waited another fifteen minutes to get our food. The steak was overcooked, they ran out of ingredients for several of the dishes, and forgot to add the replacement ingredients.   Overall, it was very poor service and a terrible wait for an average meal."}
{"text":"We came for brunch and Bianca took amazing care of us! Bottomless mimosas/bellinis are a must! We had the monkey bread (get it!), steak and eggs tacos, chicken and waffles, and breakfast hash. Highly recommend this place!  Service was excellent! Thank you Bianca!"}
{"text":"Will be back! Loved the service, food & all you can drink mimosas!! A coworker recommended this place to me & I was really excited to try it out so me & my brothers checked it out this past Saturday & we had chicken & waffles (bomb!) + French toast! We got a nice little buzz off our mimosas & Bloody Mary's but it was so much fun!"}
{"text":"Went here last week and we ordered grilled salmon with salad and seafood pasta. Both were delicious. We ordered dessert with peaches on it and it was soooo good.   But the servings were small although its affordable. Some places would have the same price but bigger portions or servings."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm a huge fan of bloody Mary's and I gotta say...the Bloody Mary here is probably the best I've ever had. They call it a deconstructed Bloody Mary, meaning they bring all the ingredients out to you and you can put whatever you want in it. Also, one of the best burgers I've had too. The perch burger. Try these out"}
{"text":"The service is wonderful and the beer is nice and cold. The ambience is cool and hipster. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets! This is my new favorite place for al fresco dining in Vegas.  The Perch perfectly bridges the gap between high-end \"fine dining\" and \"a casual evening out\". The food is what you'd hope to find at any great restaurant, but the vibe is European café casual.  Outstanding service.  Our server, Dante was awesome. Friendly and having a comprehensive knowledge of the menu; he was able to offer excellent recommendations. Food was served promptly, but service was not rushed.  Outstanding Food.  Our Calamari appetizer was great - with an unusual but delightful dipping sauce. My date had the Salmon - served over brussel sprouts (which he instantly declared to be the best he'd ever had).    I had the Turkey French Dip - just 'cause it sounded interesting. It was better than I had hoped - with a delicious dressing that involved caramelized onions and a little horseradish. It was served with truly killer French fries.  Yeah, I could eat my weight in those.  Outstanding overall experience. A perfect evening at a charming restaurant with a fantastic staff.   One consideration: Be aware of whether or not there is a band on the nearby stage when choosing to sit inside or out. The night we were there, the duo \"Orange Feathers\" was playing. Talented guys, and they kept it to a reasonable level. However, it would be easy for things to get overly loud if you are sitting near the speakers.  Fair Disclosure: I had an earlier experience here that ended in us bailing out due to issues with staffing. On this, my second visit, they more than made up for that earlier snafu.   At any business, things can happen that are truly beyond control. Sudden rushes; staffers bailing, supplies not coming in - it happens. What is important is *how* the establishment handles these unexpected moments.   General Manager, Kristine has my total respect and admiration for her diplomatic and friendly response to my initial concerns. Well done, and Thank You!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"FIRST brunch experience & I LOVED it! The Executive Chef *Marlin Moreland was INCREDIBLE and sort of sexy, his Perch Burger was to die for.. My BARTENDER *Stefan was absolutely AWESOME (I left feeling AMAZING), & *Shawna kept such an POSITIVE attitude.. FABULOUS job 2 The Perch!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Perch is a smaller restaurant located in Downtown Container Park.   You have to climb a flight of stairs where you will see the large sign displaying \"The Perch.\"  They offer tables inside and outside, high top tables, and a small bar.   It's a bit pricy but nothing too much to make your bank account cry.   Also, if you have to use the bathroom you have to make your way downstairs to the public restrooms.   My Friend and I decided to stop by here for a quick bite before we began bar hopping.  Luckily, Yelp offers a check in offer for a free 6 oz.  draft beer. It was exactly what I needed!  So, I got my free draft beer. The 6 oz. glasses are really small but hey it's free.   Before I start on the food, let me just tell you about my awesome server, Rodney. Rodney was perfect. I really enjoyed his attitude and the way he carried himself as a server. He was always there to check on us, he got our drinks quickly, and made sure we had everything we needed.   As my entree, I ordered the Margarita Pizza Flatbread. It was a smaller portion but was the perfect size for me.  It comes with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and basil cut into small triangle pieces. Very delicious.   All in all I had a fabulous time dining here with Rodney as my server and the food was great."}
{"text":"Not very specious so plan ahead if you have a big party ! Tried the French toast , breakfast sandwich and smothered biscuits all very tasty! They had bottomless mimosas which made brunch great ! Staff was very friendly will defiantly go back"}
{"text":"Have gone there twice now and been seated and then forgotten about, no one coming to our table for 20 minutes to take a drink order or food order, completely ignored, left both times after 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Free 4oz. pours of the 'house red blend' or 'house Pinot Grigio'.  FUN for a new yelper to experience a reward or badge... Or maybe I'm just easily excited.    Once entering, up the stairs to the right, the bartenders were super nice and immediately wiped the outdoor, shadier table off for us.  I'm not a sun person, but very much enjoy the outdoors.    The server took awhile like the last time we were here.  She asked if we were eating and was rude.  However, Stephen, the bartender was very nice and took over after that.  He did not know the name of the new bubbly Rose, or that they were out of the Blue Moon, instead brought dad a citrus draft beer, which he did not like.  He ordered a Heineken instead.    Dad had to use the restroom, which is 'downstairs next to the toy store' but is actually downstairs around the corner with a security guard.  I guess we are downtown and rather be safe than sorry.    A couple of things that really stuck out in Jeff C. and my mind about our first time here... slow service, upset customers, nothing spectacular on the menu and a fishy smell.    At the time, I didn't want to Yelp about it because I expected more and would be back soon.  The patio seating, view, relaxing and entertaining outdoor area ... besides the meter maid giving out over four tickets that we couldn't believe watching!  There is also a colorful yellow hallway with local Vegas artwork, overlooking a playground, stage area and people that were on a scavenger hunt.  Fun and great location!    Unfortunately, it was the same experience and scenario overall.  Stephan was great!  Service before him was slow, nothing on the 'Sharable' menu looked great via Yelp reviews, but when that same fish came out at the table next to us, we lost our appetite... once again.    Second time here, someone ordered fish and it stunk up the outdoor patio!  I mean my parents said let's go home and eat trying to be nice."}
{"text":"Thought we would try here as there are so many good reviews, and most of the other places to eat here are small and very busy.  It was very easy to find a table either inside or out, the staff were friendly, although a bit slow, and they did spend most of the time talking to each other next to the bar.  Unfortunately the worst thing here is the the food!, it isn't cheap, and most of the portions are a bit small, but the worst thing is the shear lack of taste, as a party of six we ordered 4 starters and 6 main meals, all of them were bland, no seasoning at all. the fries were just long thin and soggy, 2 portions had salt on them and the others didn't. Very poor experience with clearly no consistency in the kitchen.  Would I recommend or return to eat there? no  but I would go in for a drink or 2."}
{"text":"My mom and I had brunch here this afternoon and I have to say everything was amazing. The staff is so friendly and inviting, loved that! And the food was just what we needed to start our Sunday. We had the bottomless mimosa, you definitely can't go wrong there. Lol we had a watermelon and lime mimosa that was so bomb I couldn't just stop at 1. I don't remember our waitresses name but she was awesome! Thank you to the staff at The Perch for everything, you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a few friends just the other day.  The food was solid, but nothing great.  The prices for everything seemed a bit high for the quality of food we received, but not ridiculous.  Service was OK, and the food was OK.  If some friends want to try it, I'd go again and try something different, but I'll probably be trying one of the other restaurants nearby next time."}
{"text":"Nice terrace as the name implies, but the food is horribly mundane... especially for the price.  Better choices abound in the area."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for four years and finally made it here. Amazing location with availability indoor or out (dogs allowed on the porch, wooh!) Small menu, which I appreciate and it clearly means the chef can create a solid dish.   Donte, our server, was attentive and made a mean mojito- which was perfect for a sunny day.   I had the steak with fries. Cooked perfectly and filled me up. My friend had salmon and cried with how perfectly it was cooked. She's an emotional lady but tears don't lie!   Definitely will recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Stumbled upon it when we first moved here. We are picky.. We expect good service and good food, and these guys exceeded our expectations. The bar tender Stephan is GREAT!!! So friendly and welcoming. If your here in Vegas visiting or local come eat and drink you won't be disappointed:):)"}
{"text":"Fantasy calamari and burgers!  The fries were the best I've ever had.  Perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"It was tasty. Service was great. I had the salmon appetizer and fries. Both were really good."}
{"text":"I ordered the chimichurri chicken sandwich and my friend got the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were very good. I had a wonderful experience, next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas recently, we went to The Perch for a Sunday brunch. Thanks to the guidance of Stephon our 2 person party arrived at the optimum time to enjoy brunch without an extensive wait. Overall we enjoyed our food and ambiance...but Stephon made the experience worthwhile! Well definitely be repeat customers, whenever I visit!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly! We had an amazing brunch on a busy Sunday morning on a long holiday weekend. I recommend coming early just so you can sit at the bar. Fantastic service. Delicious food. Great conversation. What a beautiful setting for a fresh and yummy restaurant! Escape the tourist traps and land here. Thank you The Perch!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this delicious beauty and boy was it great! Everything I ordered from the Shrimp and grits to the chicken and waffles to the brioche banana French toast!! All so amazing and well put together! The chef gets a standing ovation for presentation on top of the taste. My palette is pleased! This place located in a container is awesome! We will definitely make this place a priority with every Las Vegas visit from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Place has a really hip contemporary vibe right as you walk up the stairs into the bar area. Very polite & friendly staff seat you promptly & treat you well. Brunch menu is loaded with special treats like the monkey bread, egg white skillet, brioche French toast is $$$ (batter has cornflakes which add a delicious crunch) & the terrace salad. Plus they have $15/all you can drink Mimosas/Bloody Mary's/ Bellinis, which if you like to drink you can easily take advantage.  The view out the back of the bar is unreal, all these storage containers makeup other stores, bars & restaurants, I'd describe it as a contemporary concrete jungle. It's really intriguing.  Place is electric I highly suggest you check it out"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the location, the view, and the decor/atmosphere. But it stops there, unfortunately.   I had really high hopes for our lunch date at The Perch but we must've come in at the worst time because the service was REALLY lacking. It was almost time for us to get up and find another place to grab some Sunday afternoon brunch when our server finally showed up. We seriously sat there and watched from outside about 3-5 servers grouped around the bar chatting and walking around and resetting the indoor tables (that weren't even being used because it was such a nice day). I've been a server before, cool if you're doing a shift change but don't do it where customers are waiting to be greeted! We can see you & it looks really bad when we're thirsty and hungry, okay?   When we finally did get someone to take our drink and food orders... they weren't extremely knowledgeable about their drink selections. We worked through it and found a beer to try. That was about the only good thing about this lunch, the beer.   We ordered a few small bites: a large chopped salad and shrimp scampi. For the price point we thought it was going to be an actual Shrimp Scampi dish with pasta. Forgive me if I sound a bit country here but where the heck was the food?! We got a few pieces of shrimp in some sauce. The sauce was decent, but that's about it. I could not get over calling the dish shrimp scampi and not having pasta. The chopped salad was just doing too much... too many weird flavors with all the ingredients.   Perhaps the service was a fluke and it bled into the rest of our experience. Maybe one afternoon we'll give this place another shot. Hopefully it'll be better."}
{"text":"After hearing about this spot from a coworker, I finally made my way downtown to see what it was all about. I am def a yelper, so I had figured out what I wanted about two weeks before arriving. We were sat down wherever we wanted, and a server came over for our drink order. We were catching a movie downtown, so we opted for water since we were driving. I was excited to see the menu, but to my surprise a few items are not on the menu any longer. :(   I am never craving a burger but the Oz burger sounded really good, especially the pineapple aspect. It was sweet and savory at the same time.  But I will say the Oz burger is delicious! I was a fan of the fries as well, and the bun looked awesome nicely . My only compliant is there was a few items on the burger that were not listed on the description of the burger. (Asked the server if it had cheese and she said yes, I said no cheese. Burger came out with no cheese but with tomato) I feel like if you're going to list what's in it to make sure you list it all.   But besides that the food was good the service was good everyone was nice and we will be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"The food was good an unique, decent beer selection in a great environment.  The combination makes it a 5 star in satisfaction and chIll level. Even thought a meal I ordered I thought was too salty our waitress Chelsey insisted and took it back to remake even thought I felt bad about it...our waitress even offered to take out beer off our tab as she thought we were not satisfied with everything though we said it was okay. That type of service from our waitress, knowledge of beers and spirits from the bartender, and the professional manner of the cook that remade our food and brought it out personally, which tasted much better made it a great experience.  Take a break from donating to the casinos and come here to remove all the tension and have a great time."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday, a little before noon. Was unplanned though. We initially wanted to go to Eat. because of the Yelp reviews, but they were busy. Saw this place pop up on the search for brunch, but... They only serve brunch on Sundays from what I overheard. LOL. Too late. Once we were seated and looked quizzically at the menu, our server had already introduced himself. Not going to lie, my sister was intrigued by the menu by then too.  It was also cool to have the host recommend Eat. to other patrons that were looking for brunch. Shows how supportive the area was of other establishments, and honest to a certain extent.  Let's see...  I ordered a Bloody Mary, and for appetizers we ordered the Tuna Tartare and Margherita Flatbread. Our server, Rodney, seriously persuaded me to order the Bloody Mary. Hahaha... Not that it takes much to convince me when it comes to drinks. I was sold on the idea of mixing it myself 'cause sometimes bartenders tend to make it too spicy for me. Anyway, we both liked his style which wasn't too pushy to make us order more, and helped us relax in trying a new place. He was pretty much like \"If you guys are still hungry after your appetizers, and just want to hang out here a little longer, then just order more later. No pressure.\"  Oh my gah... The Tuna Tartare... I was lucky to even get a third of that plate! The taro chips were yummy by itself, and the tartare had fresh ingredients that paired nicely with the raw tuna. My sister seriously didn't want to share! The Margherita Flatbread was just as yummy - I always like it when the tomatoes are baked along with the rest of the ingredients, and having the basil be the fresh part of the dish. Coming back to check on us, and joking about how fast I needed a second Bloody, we ordered entrees... Goujons (sweet Thai chili) with fries added (technically an appetizer) for the sister, and I got the Chimichurri Chicken Sandwich.  Rodney gave us a story about the sandwich being too spicy for a past patron as a warning. LOL. Dude... That was not spicy at all. I kept biting into my first half of the sandwich looking for spice! It was still pretty good though. I love the fresh avocado with it. I had more avocado mouse/sauce on the side, but I honestly liked the Aioli sauce my sister got. Liked dipping my fries into that. My sister also enjoyed her chicken with the Thai chili sauce. Sad to say we couldn't finish it all, but we were just being polite and saving leftovers for our dad. LOL. He wasn't too happy that we went on a sibling date without him.  Anyway, food alone, this place gets 4 stars for flavor and variety of dishes. Giving it 5 for the outstanding customer service provided by Rodney.  Noticed that he was the only server on the floor. The impressive thing was that even though he seemed to have to take care of the entire restaurant, the indoors and the patio, he still managed to check up on us several times. If anyone can make my sister smile and relax as a first time patron, I can seriously appreciate that. Seriously... Thanks to him, my sister's mood got a little better, considering she didn't even want to go to Downtown for a meal.  I hope the tip was adequate enough to show my gratitude. If not, I'll be sure to make up for it on our next visit. LOL. So long as the experience is equivalent or exceeds our expectations once again."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd level of container park.  Very cute and bright space.  Menus are wrapped around napkins.   Green flash West coast ipa on tap!   Service is very slow. Do not come if you have hungry kids or are looking for a quick bite.  We ordered a side of French fries and it came with an aioli that tasted strongly of raw garlic.  Steak sandwich was nowhere close to medium rare as ordered- more like medium well to well done. Aioli that came with the sandwich had a strange skin on the top and may have sat around awhile before being served? Fries are thick cut rather than crispy.  Power greens salad had a super salty dressing.   I liked it but it may not be to everyone's taste.  My daughter said the same thing about her chicken pailliard dish.   Overall portions are on the small side but were perfect for our group.  I think there might be a kids menu? New Year's flyer mentioned it,  but we weren't offered it even though we had kids in our group.  Best to ask for it.  We would probably try one of the other eateries in the area before eating here again."}
{"text":"We were actually headed to Eat, and it was a little bit of a wait, so we noticed The Perch and headed over here.  We LOVED it.  Food was amazing, freshly made, and delicious.  The drinks were great, too.  We would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the view!!! Barstaff is friendly and the place is clean. Brandon recommended the 1664 Blanc... It was delicious. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. All you can drink Bloody Marys, Mimosas, and Bellinis. SUPER nice service. Theres really no losing."}
{"text":"Terrible fried chicken.   Staff fantastic. Couldn't be more helpful and friendly. Steak tacos. Awesome. Tea selection terrible. All crazy teas and nothing just normal. Chicken and waffles terrible. Waffle under the dry over cooked meatless rock hard chicken was probably the best waffle I've ever had. So I assumed I had a bad batch of chicken. They made me another batch. Still terrible. Something in the coating they use is just wrong it make it so rock solid it's break teeth. Flavour isn't all that either. Seems like it's been cooked for days then dropped in the dryer again Prior to serving.   I'd struggle to ever go back here again. Even though the tacos we good."}
{"text":"SUCH great food. My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch a few days ago, and totally loved everything we had.  The service was great, quick and friendly. The spot itself is small (as is everything in the container park, nbd), but has nice patio and bar seating. They have a good selection of craft beers, including a few on draft. The bartender was quick to recommend beer choices for both of us based on our taste, and he did a great job; we both loved our choices.   We started off with an order of the fries; they were hand cut and came with garlic aioli- crispy and super yummy! I ordered The Terrace salad- corn, onions, shrimp, avocado- AMAZING. Seriously, one of my new favorite dishes. My boyfriend ordered a steak sandwich, and was equally pleased with his meal.  We will definitely return- great spot!"}
{"text":"Took us 30 min to get our food. No one ever checked on us once and it wasnt even that busy. Waited for the check for a good 15 minutes too.  Food was so so.  I liked the fries.    Update: ive been contacted by the establishment and they are very concerned with what has happened. Its nice to see their concern for their customer service. I would give them another shot if i passed through"}
{"text":"If u want flavor .. This is not the place. The 1 star comes from the presentation it was beautifully plated and just from the looks of it I expected a variety of flavors sweet from the mango, perhaps some lime from the guacamole or the ahi seasoning but bite after bite I was disappointed. The mozzarella was indeed like any other the tomatoes were fresh and the apple vinegar was perfect.. No wow factor.  The service was ok we ordered our starters and by the time we finished them I knew I wasn't interested in main dishes.. So we asked for the check on her third visit to our table .. I wouldn't go back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and amazing food! Definitely stoked that we decided to eat here while watching the game on the big screen. Perfect outside seating as well as indoor seating and close to the restrooms. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, loved the spritzin water on the porch. Only stopped for a drink but enjoyed the park and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place me and my girlfriend had brunch with our pups and they were so nice to us and our boys. It's started to rain and they quickly found is a table inside . We had the 3 shot special from brunch all so good specially the Cinnamon Toast Crunch! Defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cute place, really good food. Had all you can drink Belinis and Bloody Mary's  today. They were fabulous! We loved our waitress!"}
{"text":"Located in Container Park, The Perch is a cool place to eat downtown.  - Crab Cakes, Spicy Aioli - Angel Hair, Anchovy, Almond, Currants - Belle Flatbread - Grilled Chicken, Bacon, Caramelized Onions - Power Greens - Spinach, Kale, Arugula, Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Asparagus, Pears, Sunflower, Pumpkin Seeds, Almonds, Sherry Vinaigrette  The foods were all great. Angel Hair was a bit too salty, but it's refreshing to see something other than tomato cream laden overcooked pasta like most Italian restaurants offer. Crab Cakes came with spicy aioli that had unique unmentioned flavor.  Yep. I like The Perch."}
{"text":"So apparently when we stopped in for brunch, it was their first day to debut their brunch menu.  We loved everything about this place.  I left with two new Facebook friends (the bartenders) :) and the best memories.  We met the manager or assistant while sitting at the bar and couldn't wait to come back for another meal.  Honestly, the food and drinks were so unique, we are planning another trip to Vegas in a few months, just to experience their lunch and dinner menus.  The service was truly one of a kind - so personal and friendly and because their drinks were so delicious, we spent about $100 just on beverages - LOL!  Outstanding place!  We love you, The Perch!!!"}
{"text":"this is an awesome casual restaurant on vegas' old strip (which is being refurbished). it is located in the Container Center-so very cool. great fr families, singles and anyone really. The chef made my custom hot kale salad topped with an over easy egg and then he added sunflower seed, almonds, pumpkin seeds in a sherry vinegarette - too good forgot to take the pic. Also service was excellent too-that's Robin in the pic. The Perch is definitely a must when in the original vegas :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm unable to write a good review for this place. I was very excited to try it out since the whole area is new to me (last time I visited Vegas was about 6 years ago). I do not understand how this place has such great reviews, yet our visit turned out so bad. My husband and I arrived with kids in tow, ordered our drinks and food. The drinks (5 waters and 1 soda) took a while to get there, about 25 minutes. That should have been an indication of the wait time, but we waited patiently. There were about 2 other couples there. By the time we got our food it was over an hour later. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, my husband ordered the Perch Burger. I didn't think that was something that would take so long to make. After waiting for 40 minutes we were finally apologized to and told that it was my syrup that took so long. My syrup??? Did they go drain some trees for maple syrup?? I was so confused but so hungry I didn't even bother to question it. When our food arrived I didn't complain because I was starving. It was disgusting. The chicken was over fried, I got a collar bone and other over fried pieces I couldn't even eat, the waffle was just ok, but I ate it because like I said I was so hungry. My husband offered me some of his burger (which he did not enjoy either--left half of it) because he felt bad, I declined but accepted some of his fries. The fries tasted as though they were fried in old beef fat or something gross. I had to stop eating and drink water. By the time we got back to the car I was feeling sick, sadly I threw up all of the Perch food in my new car....No thanks to you the Perch & employees."}
{"text":"I will say if I am writing a review just based on the food and food alone, I would give this place 4 stars.   The reason for the lower stars is due to incredibly bad service we received. I came here on a Saturday morning (originally on going somewhere close by but there was a wait) we got seated immediately which was nice for a larger party.   When we sat down we ordered drinks they do have all you can drink for 15 dollars (bloody marys, mimosa or belinis) and you can change them around. The bloody marys tasted like tomato juice, no flavor or spice.   We ordered our food within 10 minutes of seating and then about 30 minutes later the server came and told me that the potatoes that I had requested without bell pepper were pre cooked with bell pepper and they can sub it with fries. I had said that was fine. After waiting an additional 30 minutes. (total of 1 hr after ordering) the server came and said it will be a few minutes before our food is ready. I asked if there was something they can provide us due to the long wait. The server stated they can bring us a fruit platter as we have been waiting for such a long time.   We waited another 20 minutes and asked for a manger because at this time we were really upset for the length of time it was taking to get our food. We finally got the manager and he stated was coming out now.... we still had to wait another 20 minutes ( making it 1hr and 40 minutes by the time we ordered and 1 hr and 50 minutes from when we sat down). we notes the time as we had marked in metered parking.  When we addressed the situation with the manager he stated he would provide a 10% discount to the bill. He was arguing with us about the amount of time it took to bring the food out.   The location, the view and food was amazing but the service and management was lacking. On top of everything they charged for the fruit plate they brought us, I had to bring it to their attention to have them take it off. I might come back here on a date or 1 on 1 but large parties beware."}
{"text":"Great little place the food is absolutely more on the healthy side small potions on the food."}
{"text":"Such a rad little spot. The last time I was here my server was semi weeded but had such a good personality we still threw him like 30%. Hangar steak sammich is the bees knees. Happy hour is dope. Good spot if you're dt & you wanna grab good food while on a date with bae or your home girl."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and everything was perfect! Customer service was great. We really appreciated the manager checking on us, this is always a plus! The food was amazing and we would definitely go back again and recommend this place to all of our family and friends. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is literally amazing, which is surprising considering it's just a small little place inside a storage container. The drinks are a little on the pricey side. Although it's small I've never had to wait for a table, I've never seen this place super busy. They also have outside seating that overlooks the inside of the container park. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is the service I got one time when I went in the morning right when they opened, they seemed annoyed that I walked in 1 minute before their technical open time, and made me go back outside for literally 60 seconds before I could come back in... even though the door was unlocked and they were just standing and talking. Other than that, I love this place and their food!"}
{"text":"Went back a second time and would not return.   They sat us outside after we let them know we wanted the available table inside.  It was very hot.  She would not keep water coming.  It was slow and not and we were burning in the sun. They had the long table inside reserved and yet the large party never came. This was not the same table that they give to someone else after I told the staff we wanted inside and not outside.   I also was not impressed with the food.  No return for me."}
{"text":"Took some guests from out of town here last week and it was delightful. We sat outside on the deck and overlooked all the fun in container park. Food was fabulous, service was outstanding. Highly recommend The Perch."}
{"text":"Nice Place in the downtown container park. Food was much better than you expect from a park restaurant. Anyone visiting, and wants to get off the strip, this is the place to go for peace and quiet. (Unless there's kids at the park)"}
{"text":"The Perch is an interesting place: cute brunch spot by day, hip bar/restaurant by night. I've only tried the latter, but I was very pleased :)  Situated in the corner of Container Park, overlooking the main stage area, the Perch is aptly named. The interior decor is bright and charming, and in the morning/daytime it takes advantage of the ample ambient light streaming in through the big windows. Location wise, it's fantastic. It feels secluded, and it definitely doesn't feel like Vegas. The mornings are nice and quiet in this area.  I tried the cornflake French toast, and it was absolutely delectable. French toast is my 2nd favorite food, so I've had it a bunch of times in a large number of places, and this was definitely one of the best. Be sure to check in and take advantage of your free pour!  I'd be curious to come back at night and see what it's like for dinner. Last but not least, the waitstaff was courteous and kind."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting another friend in Vegas and we wanted to check out the Container Park and decided to try The Perch for lunch. We all ordered different meals and each of us were very happy with the quality of our food; the service was also outstanding. I highly recommend The Perch if you are ever on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary! Great menu and service. We tried the fries with garlic aioli and margharita flatbread. Both delicious. We really enjoyed the experience and the Container Park is awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their fries & dip and their flatbread. I live in the opposite side of town but those darn fries are worth the drive!!  Customer service was stop on. They checked back regularly to ensure we were doing good. They also with us making it feel genuine!!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see so many 5 start reviews. We walked into the perch from the street entrance and were greeted by our server who told us we could sit anywhere outside. We grabbed a table and another server running over and seemed very flustered. We didn't have any menus and she immediately started asking us about drinks. We were still settling into our seats so we both just said waters to start. She's like okay so nothing else? I then asked for a menu. Then the first server who greeted us came out with table settings and one glass of water... For two people?  We ordered a bunch of stuff to share and had to repeat several times what we wanted bc the server didn't seem to be familiar with the menu.   Then a manager came over and asked if we had a reservation, and yes I had made a reservation on opentable.  I got a Moscow mule and it wasn't every good... I ordered a glass of wine instead . Then the food came. Crab cakes were great.  Everything else needed a tweak. We got the carpaccio which was drenched in truffle oil. There was no balance of flavors. It was awful. And it came with a \"potato purée\" which we didn't understand. But either way it sucked, it needed butter.  We got the \"Salmon Tiradito, Spicy Cucumber & Mango Salsa\" which looked amazing according to these pictures on yelp... Well yeah not so much. It looked like a bright and colorful dish, but it was missing something. We took the cilantro lime sauce from the crab cakes and added it to the dish very lightly, and it made such a difference.   We also ordered the \"Mozzarella & Heirloom Tomatoes Red Onion, Micro Basil\". The first bite was great but that's about it. I really like red onions when they are balanced. There were so many red onions, that it was all I could taste. It was not pleasant.    And we pretty much a quarter to half the dishes before they started to take stuff \"out of our way.\" I let the server know no was still working on the salmon. We ask for the check. I still have a glass of wine and salmon I'm eating when the server comes back with our bill, as I reach to my purse she puts my small plate on to the salmon dish...WTF?! And takes it away. I was so irritated. Then I'm finishing my wine, and the server decides to take our ice teas and water away.... Are you serious?  We are still sitting there, the place is not busy.... And I'm clearly drinking my wine.   And never at any point were we offered dessert. Since we didn't each much here we ended up at Pinche Tacos, which was good.   Honestly it was horrible. I would never go back and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim.  Had he steak and egg tacos and the chicken chimichuri  sandwich.  Both dishes were spot on delicious.  The peach Bellini is also amazing.    If you do make it in prepare to use your outside voice.  It can be pretty loud in there.  Also if you enjoy water...I suggest you ask for bottle water as the standard table water has a weird taste"}
{"text":"First timer here, decided to take the girlfriend to an unplanned date and it went really well here! With it being kind of windy but weather is nice... I was really craving for mimosas out on a patio so why not try out this place right?? We sat outside as the sun was starting to set... The service was a little slow in the beginning but they got it together after a while. They did let us know they had bad communication and what not but I wasn't bothered by it as my attention was with my date. So we ordered a bottle for making our own mimosas... Which is great cause my girlfriend doesn't like much OJ in her mimosas. So it's bang for your buck to sit and talk and sip on mimosas! We shared a ceviche, chicken quinoa and some fries. Food was really good! Didn't have any complaints there and Then immediately got suckered into an amazing vodka dessert! Overall great date night! Food tastes great! Live music ... Watched the sun set... Enjoyed every minute of it here! Thanks perch!"}
{"text":"They have lots of fantastic meals but my favorite is the grilled salmon. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We've been here before and we enjoyed it but since then they've changed to a non-full service restaurant which completely changed our experience from good to bad! For one, you have to order your food at the front which at first, I was ok with. But then I realized it was a detriment since NO ONE was checking on us. 35 minutes later and no food (bacon and eggs and 2 burgers protein style - all items that shouldn't take this long). After my patience ran thin, I went up to the bartender and asked where our food was. Another 10 minutes and our food FINALLY arrived! The only one thing that salvaged the horrible customer service was the food since it was very good. However, customer service is huge for me and waiting for your food for 45 minutes is unacceptable, with absolutely no one checking on you."}
{"text":"This time I tried the Egg Salad - poached egg over lightly dressed butter lettuce and frisée. It's a great choice for a lighter lunch. I was very hungry so asked them to put a second egg on the salad. Perfect. We had the tuna tartare again which is phenomenal."}
{"text":"The Perch is situated inside Container Park, right next to the open field are at the south end. We visited close to sunset on a hot summer Sunday and snagged the sofas on the balcony, right above the park. A fantastic spot for out of Towner's like us to drink in the funky vibe of Container Park.  The kids ordered the cheese pizza (elongated) and the shell hair pasta with grilled chicken and baby Brussels sprouts. My wife's had the lettuce cups with steak, and I opted for the veggie burger.  Our meal was delicious, as was the house bloody mary. This cafe is a hidden, 5-star gem. If you're looking for a chill taste of Downtown LV, you can't do much better."}
{"text":"Breath of fresh air to get away from The Strip and hangout with the locals. There is life outside the Vegas Strip.   Their Calamari was fantastic and it was half off during happy hour. My chicken waffle was a bit of a let down, but it made up for their excellent service.   Love the ambience with rustic modern decor, and the building was made from containers.  Highly recommend coming here.  Had a blast with my colleague who is a local. Great vibe.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got to The Perch for brunch last week. I've been meaning to check it out, so I was stoked to finally get there.   Container Park is awesome.  The Perch is a fun cool place.   We skipped the bottomless mimosas due to needing to drive back to GV.  I did engage in the  a couple single order of mimosas and enjoyed them very much.     I went with the french toast which was good. It wasn't the best, but it was good and filling. My friend got the breakfast sandwich and it was very tasty.    Definitely need to share this.... I hit up The Perch every other week for lunch... Always get the Terrace Salad with shrimp and it's AWESOME.    The Perch is my favorite lunch venue in DTLV.  Always in and out with 45 minutes!  I would definitely go back and try a few other brunch ideas!  Lunch is a must!"}
{"text":"Best spicy salad ever (The Terrace). At first you can smell the bbq'd shrimp (cooked on charcoal??) and then you notice all the corn and that it also has been grilled. At the bottom of the spicy bowl, which is spicy but not over powering enough to need a milky drink, you find tomato slices to create a base and compliment the cherry tomatoes used primarily in the salad. Also had the new shrimp appetizer which was equally mouthwatering with a creamy dip.   Even the house red which is normally suppose to be even keeled and easy to drink had lots going on. I am glad it did to help with all the tastebuds being kicked in from the salad. Great work and a fun place to hang out for the night."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience!  I found this place at the last minute as I was searching for a place to eat with my family in the area.  First off the location is amazing, the downtown container park is a true gem and should be on every person's lost coming to Vegas. The restaurant itself is really nice with nth indoor and outdoor seating and a very cool and modern design.  WE came hungry so we ordered almost everything in the menu and we're extremely impressed! Some highlights: Tuna tartare: one of the best I've had , melt in your mouth with mango and avocado, highly recommended.  Lettuce cups: steak!! So fresh!! Best I've ever had Chicken sandwich: I barely ever order chicken when I go out but this sounded so good so I went for it. Sooo tasty! Very unique!!  Desserts: we tasted all of them and each of them we're amazing!  Staff and service: impeccable and extremely friendly!   DO YOURSELF AND YOUR APPETITE A FAVOR AND GO CHECK OUT THIS AMAZING SPOT!!"}
{"text":"We chose to go here for brunch after reading the reviews here on yelp, and we're so happy we did.   The food was absolutely amazing.  We had the Terrace salad which is made of corn, tomatoes, chimichurri sauce and topped with perfectly cooked shrimp.  We also had the short rib hash with a mushroom demi glaze...it was delicious.  The atmosphere is cheerful, bright, clean, modern, not overdone.  The service was probably the best part.  Nora, made recommendations and shared a bit about what was happening downtown, and there was another server whose name we didn't get and she was also wonderful.  We will definitely return as we want to try everything on the menu.  Oh..and we're vacationing so the bottomless mimosas we a treat!"}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:  -If you are looking for a nice burger spot, Downtown Terrace inside Container Park is the place to go. -This small restaurant is located on the 2nd floor towards the back corner above the restrooms in the park. -There is indoor and outdoor seating w/ the latter providing you a great view of the stage. -The service was outstanding. -The burgers were very juicy & tasty, better than your average burger.  Overall, this is great place to grab American comfort food."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this spot ages ago, and finally made it in for a Yelp event. Tried a few apps and drinks, then came back for lunch a few days later. The drinks trend on the light and fruity side, and the foods are fresh with several healthy options available. Good spot for brunch or a girls night out.   BEEF CARPACCIO ($14): thin sliced raw beef with parm-reg, balsamic glaze, and arugula. The regular portion is fairly large, fitting for the price. Really enjoyed this app. SPICY SHRIMP PASTA ($16): Shrimp, tomato, arugula, and pasta in a Sriracha cream sauce that wasn't nearly spicy enough, IMO. I rarely eat pasta, but this was a fun mix of lighter ingredients that kept the dish from being too heavy. The sliced grilled bread added some much needed crunch. CHIMICHURRI CHICKEN SANDWICH ($13): Large portion of thin-pounded chicken cutlets on a soft baguette style roll. Cheese received on sandwich did not appear to be queso fresco as stated on menu, and I didn't taste or see the avocado mousse. Chimichurri sauce was thick and chunky but seemed to be missing something in the flavor. Not sure why there were a ton of red pepper flakes on this. HAND CUT FRIES ($6): These were soggy and limp mere minutes after ordering, but they were skin-on with sea salt, so they were more flavorful than expected. The garlic aioli was delicious, couldn't stop dipping! Can't imagine how much better these would be if the fries were actually crispy.  I'm not a huge fan of the Container Park, but I really like this restaurant's upstairs location and glass windows, which make it light and airy. The bird motif throughout is a cute decorative touch, and the bright colors and warm staff are welcoming.   TIP: they have a downstairs gate entrance to get straight inside rather than wandering through the whole CP area! Brunch has bottomless drink options and there's also a weekday HH offered 4-6PM."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted hot chocolate so we went to The Perch to buy some. Miguel the server was so nice and awesome! We didn't eat there but the hot chocolate was on point!!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place overlooking the Container Park! We came in here after drinks at Oak & Ivy. The place is modern and has a clean, fun look. We were happy that they accommodated us with an 8-month old. The staff was so cute with him! My Manhattan was delicious and comparable to the Whiskey bar we had just come from!  The food was great! I had the Perch Burger with a fried green tomato! The slightly sweet tomato went great with the meal. I won't forget the fries and yummy aioli that came with it. My friend tried the beef carpaccio which was different... rare meat with mashed potatoes. It was pleasing and well paired with the cheese, but I am not sure if we would get it again. We also tried the chimichurri sandwich, which borrowed the tangy flavor of its name-sake. We loved the bold flavors!  Everyone here was so nice and accommodating. The food was wonderful! I will be back! (in Terminator voice...)"}
{"text":"I love this place for their fresh, delicious food (tuna tartare, the Terrace salad - shrimp, avocado, grilled corn and cilantro chimichurri, and their chicken quinoa with beurre blanc sauce), great drinks, and view of container park.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  I can't say enough good things.  Check out their Bloody Mary bar on Sundays."}
{"text":"I simply loved everything we ate here. It wasn't much but what we did have , the posted pics, was great. I usually like to try bruschetta anywhere we go and they offer it, but unfortunately 9/10 times it is very disappointing, not this one. This way of making and seasoning the tomatoes was the BEST I have ever tried. And once again, the best places so far have not been food chains and maybe that's the secret. I'm so concentrated in giving my opinion on he bruschetta because it truly was the best I've ever had. The other food was just as great. Deliciousness all around. We dined outside on the terrace and it was awesome. It was a bit chilly but thankfully they thought of everything and they had heaters outside so the temperature was nice. The waitress was nice and the guy that checked up on us was ok, his attitude was a bit on the \"I don't care if you're here\" feel but overall I would recommend this eatery 100%. Really the guy is the only reason I'm giving the place 4 stars. The food is what really matters and it was exquisite!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the last 2 years and love it. Stephan is the reason why we keep coming back. Fantastic service, food and atmosphere. Only recommendation for the perch is to purchase a tv so we can watch Sunday football during brunch. Other than that love this place and the awesome service Stephan and the crew always deliver!"}
{"text":"Steak Tartar was delicious. View and service were awesome as expected. My only concern was that it was very hard to hear in the enclosed dining area, though the music was not loud. I think it was the fact that it room is glass enclosed. I will be going back to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"The picture featured at the top of their menu online is a beautiful arrangement of mussels, shrimp, and calamari sitting on top of a bed of spaghetti... maybe angel hair. In their 'FILLERS' section is a dish called \"Seafood Pasta: Penrod Tomato Sauce.\" No further description. I ordered it as takeout.  I assumed it would be like the picture. No. It was shrimp and various pieces of calamari sitting on top of mushy penne pasta that fell apart when I stabbed it with my fork. It was sitting in a pool of watered down tomato sauce that actually made the seafood taste fishy. Those of you that have eaten good shrimp and calamari know it has that fresh clean taste... this was gross. The entire thing tasted and smelled like salty, somewhat tomato-ish, fish. Like a bad fish stew. I couldn't finish it... and the portion was tiny. I couldn't believe I spent $15 on it.  HUGE disappointment, don't ever get that Seafood Pasta."}
{"text":"Wanted to catch the movie night at the containment park and the restaurant was right next to the screening area! Sat outside, ambience was great with the cute little lamp by the side. Ordered the spicy shrimp pasta and it tasted delicious with the wild rocket. Portion was just right for one as well. Service was great"}
{"text":"I offered to take my best friend to brunch for his birthday. We parked right outside container park. Expecting him to pick either Eat or Vegenation I was shocked when he picked Perch out of nowhere.   I had passed Perch in the past and never thought twice about going there so I was quite pleased with the decision. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted and the hostess seated us. After I sat down I looked around to take in the atmosphere and noticed everyone was dressed rather nicely and was quite attractive. I felt out of place wearing shorts/tank top/flip flops.   Our waiter comes over (Miguel) and takes our drink order and makes menu recommendations. We ordered bottomless mimosas, monkey bread to start, the shrimp and grits, and the perch breakfast sandwich.   The monkey bread was sticky and gooey, everything you could have wanted in a good dessert (we frequently start with dessert). My breakfast sandwich comes out with it looking pretty good, the side of potatoes came out looking like they were straight from a microwave. My friends shrimp and grits had a nice heat going through it but ultimately were tasteless. I do not hold the restaurant accountable because I know from being quite the foodie that grits is a hard dish to make amazing.   Ultimately it was a nice brunch that came out to 80$ after gratuity. I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating but decided on a 3 with the food outweighing the atmosphere. I would eat here again with the realization that I'm paying way too much for what I'm actually consuming.   My tips .......... I feel when the bottomless mimosas are ordered your food order is expedited to get you out quicker cutting out what could be more time for mimosas. Try the delicious monkey bread !!! Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"I live walking distance from here, and I think The Perch may be one of my favorite dining experiences in Downtown Las Vegas outside of Bronze Cafe.  Our party of 2 enjoyed the Tuna Tartare with Taro Chips, the Chicken & Quinoa, and the Salmon with Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus.  Each of the dishes was very enjoyable and just about perfectly prepared.  My only feedback would be that it would be nice to have slightly more seasoning on the Tuna Tartare (perhaps garnish with Maldon Salt) and I would use slightly less butter with the quinoa.  Our bill for three fantastic dishes was only $49 plus tip.  Our server was super friendly, agreed right off the bat with our choices, and even helped us relocate outside in mid-meal when some patio tables opened up because the weather was perfect outside on a Saturday evening around 9pm and inside was a little too chilly for our liking.  Avalon Landing was playing right outside on the Container Park main stage, and everything about our experience was top notch.  I'm sorry I didn't come check this place out months ago, but I will definitely be back often.  I did not like the taste of their filtered tap water though, so I might consider ordering one of their many choices of artisanal bottled waters next time."}
{"text":"We were hanging out at Container Park and this was the most appealing place to me to get alcohol.  The service wasn't too hot for me. I turned 21 over a week ago and they kept staring at my I.D as if it was fake and kept talking amongst themselves for a few minutes. Finally they made my alcoholic drink.  I got the cucumber fizz.  It was okay, not great.  I'm a nice guy, left them a tip despite not feeling it there.  My two friends then went there for drinks and they said the service was horrible, which I fairly agreed with.  One got his drink and the other was waiting way too long for his. Keep in mind that this is a small place and not too busy at 10:00 PM when we went.  So he walked out because it took too long.  We were leaving Container Park and almost at the exit, then we hear someone yelling from a distance. It's was one of the bartenders chasing after us to tell us, INCLUDING ME WHO PAID AND GAVE A TIP TO HIM DESPITE BAD SERVICE, accusing us of not paying for our drinks.  We said we did (which we did), and even offered to walk up with him, but he said its fine.  These guys need to adjust their attitude and quick because that left a very sour taste in me with this place.  This gets a 1.5 rating, NOT a full two.  Update (in response to The Perch's comment):  I appreciate the response.  Very timely.  If I'm in the area again, hopefully soon since I live in Los Angeles area, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"A cute eatery/bar in the Container Park. They have a small but varied menu with something for every palette. They have a few \"bottomless\" drink specials- mimosas and bloodys for $15 during brunch and \"all you can drink\" house wines (can't quite remember the exact days). The indoor space is very small and as a result a bit on the noisy side when it's full but they also have outdoor seating overlooking the playground.   The Chicken and Waffles were wonderful and the monkey bread had a great nostalgic flavor and texture. Some of the other brunch offerings included steak and egg tacos, brioche French toast, short rib hash, berry crepes, salads, the \"Perch burger\" with a fried green tomato and more.   I would definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors alike for an affordable and quick breakfast/brunch in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas, bloodies, and bellinis are delicious!! I had the breakfast sandwich add avocado it was huge! I pictured an egg mcmuffin type thing. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to perch for the first time for my birthday which is the 4th of July and they were super busy. All of us ordered the special or some version of steaks. My meal was undercooked but I didn't want to complain or send it back so I ate two or three bites and boxed my meal up. My husband's meal came out last, after everyone else had been served so his meal was probably rushed. He was very hungry after a 12 miles hike and devoured what was otherwise a delicious meal. Unfortunately, my poor husband got food poisoning and was throwing up all night. I asked my friends the next day if they were feeling on after the meal and my friend told me her steak was under cooked as well and she didn't send it back for the same reason as me- it was a celebration and we are Mid-Westerners from Michigan who are just too nice to send stuff back. It was a big bummer my husband was throwing up all night. I emailed the manager, they asked for my number but never called me."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, mostly for dinner, but this brunch was absolutely horrendous. We waited 30 minutes for a table despite the fact that several tables were open for the entire time. After we sat and placed the orders, the food took over an hour. They tried to act like it was our fault, but assumed responsibility in the end. Though we got our food comped, the experience was legitimately terrible. We will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't enjoy bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and bellinis when you're in vegas. You pay $15 to enjoy all these drinks for two hours. Also don't forget to check in to receive a complimentary glass of wine or beer of your choice. This hipster cafe is located inside Container Park, but beware parking can be hard to find and you have to pay for meters.  I'm a very simple brunch person, I usually like to order omelets or the typical two eggs, bacon, and toast. I didn't see anything I really wanted in their brunch menu, but the children's section I wanted a cheese omelet and their egg and bacon. I asked the server, if I could order from there and he was very lenient and chill about it. (Usually you have to be under 12 for that section!) Even though the food portions look extremely small, it is super filling! I can't wait to try the steak and egg tacos next!"}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere with a view overlooking the Container Park. Waiter was VERY energetic and friendly (lots of comments and voices though).  Ordered calamari to start, but when the entrees showed up 20min later and I asked about my appetizer, waiter stated he thought he put it in, went to check, and came back apologizing that he didn't. No biggie, the rest of the food had come already and the service was good. The manager dropped by to also apologize and offer us a dessert instead - so we got the Creme Brulee. Between the 3 of us we ordered:  1. Perch Burger ($15)-  Med-rare order was cooked to med-well. 2 thin slices of fried green tomato were stiff and tasteless (sad bc I love fried green tomatoes). Bacon slices were some of the best bacon I've had in a while. Fries were good, aioli was fantastic.  2. Carpaccio  ($14) - weird that this was an entree but whatevs. meat was good, mashed potatoes were yellow from the sticks of butter in it, boys love it.  3. Bianca Flatbread ($12) + Prosciutto ($4)- Flatbread was smaller than I expected, but tasted good. prosciutto was super fatty and not great quality, ended up leaving it all on the side. 4. Complimentary creme brulee to make up for the no-show appetizer: So-so   Nothing I'd def order again. Wouldn't rush back here, despite lovely atmosphere. It's popular with my friends though and maybe it was an off day/I ordered wrong."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and yummy drinks & food. Love to visit here while at the Container Park."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Had a burger and it was great. Clean, bright place.  Friendly staff - fast service. Full bar and seats inside and out. Love the Container Park. Great Vegas spot."}
{"text":"Perch is located in the back of Container Park, on the second floor above the toy store. They have a large patio with outdoor seating, as well as seats inside and a small bar.   My friend Jessie and I came to eat here one Sunday morning for brunch. We started with cocktails. I had the peach bellini and Jessie had the Bloody Mary. They do have a bottomless option for around $15 (your choice of bloody/mimosa/bellini), but we didn't want to get too buzzed so we just got single drinks. As soon as her drink came out, I was instantly jealous! The Bloody Mary is deconstructed and it comes with an almost full glass of premium vodka, a cup of tomato juice, and then sides of horseradish/tabasco, lemons and olives. You can make it how you like it. Sooo cool! My bellini was good, but I am totally getting the bloody next time.   So the food. I originally wanted breakfast, but the Perch Burger sounded really good so I went with that. The burger had provolone cheese, bacon, a fried green tomato, and chipotle mayo. It also came with fries and a side of chipotle mayo. The burger was pretty damn good and I am happy I chose that. The fries were perfectly cooked, but could have used some salt. I enjoyed dipping them in the chipotle mayo though. For 2 drinks and 2 meals, the total was $50 not including tip. I did enjoy my meal, but I think $50 is a little too much for brunch."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have found this place without Life is Beautiful.  We had some time to kill and a rumbling in our bellies so we scoured the venue and found Perch in the back of the container park.  It was like finding an Oasis in the desert, literally.  The air conditioning welcomed us and the cocktail menu made us feel right at home.  Sadly I can't remember the name of my drink but I think it was a margarita with jalapeno.  Maybe...there were a lot of cocktails consumed that weekend...it is Vegas. I ordered the Sriracha pasta and my companion had a burger.  The pasta was super tasty (although lacking in the spice the title promised).  The burger was well cooked and very much enjoyed.   I really liked the view from our table.  It sits on the second floor overlooking the park so there was people watching and art gazing galore."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch, 2:30pm. They were serving brunch... Being a brunch lover myself I was excited. I ordered the egg whites with avocado, bell peppers and bacon. My husband ordered the country hash. Service was decent and the staff was friendly. 30 minutes later our breakfast items still haven't come out.   About ready to leave our food comes out. Awesome!! However, my husbands \"hash\" was firstly not a \"hash\" at all. It was basically 20 cents of food that they charge you 9 dollars for. A potato chopped and fried with a poached egg on top. My egg whites was basically a frittata and the \"bacon\" was more like ham. Avocados weren't ripe.   Overall we ate all our food because we were hungry, But I'll never go back there again.  On top of that they close their kitchen for an hour and \"keep the bar open\" bar tender made sure to tell all the parents with their kids looking for a meal that they could order drinks...... Really??"}
{"text":"Nicest staff ever. Each and everyone was happy and cared about customers. Food was good. Had breakfast sandwich, fruit plate, Terrece, monkey bread was absolute best like my mom used to make. But unorganized and very noisy. Lost our reservation - said additional 20 min wait but was over an hour. Slow to set table, forgot to bring napkins, forgot silverware, no salt and pepper - my food was way later than others. Interesting place."}
{"text":"This is unfortunately my first bad review. When we got there, the host was very polite when he sat us and they have a very nice patio area for seating. Those were the only upsides. While the service was very friendly, it was also very slow. It took quite a while to just get our drinks ordered and they brought my drink out ten minutes after my friend got theirs.   I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which sounded delicious on the menu. When it showed up, the chicken was one of those frozen particle chicken patties you find in the frozen food section and the bun was just a cheap burger bun. Definitely NOT worth the $15 price tag. I would've been more satisfied with a fried chicken sandwich from Wendy's because at least they give you a real chicken breast for a third of the price. It was like eating a big chicken nugget.   My friend had the super green salad which she said was good and a spicy tomato bisque which was also decent."}
{"text":"Happened to be in container park and decided to try out this brand new spot. The Perch has a menu outside to check out before going in. The decor is very nice. Service was okay. I had to ask to get a refill on water, that's a big red flag for me...they weren't that busy at the time either...anyways the Salmon app was very good! High quality salmon that melts in your mouth. Steak sandwich was pretty good, and I did like the fries with it. My mother got a (equivalent to Greek) salad and added shrimp...she enjoyed it but we didn't feel it was worth the price. Crime brûlée for dessert was on point!! The manager/owner came by to ask about our experience and feedback which was nice. Since its brand new, I feel if the management is very observant with guests, menu items and prices and are open to changing little things were need be for the better, the restaurant will do very well."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in Container Park.  The OZ burger is incredible, highly recommended.  Mike took care of us and was on top of it.  Will definitely come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we were looking for in vegas. My wife and i eat and drink when we travel. We are in that middle age range and love a good breakfast place. My wife also loves mimosas. I chose this place because it had a decent priced (possibly cheapest price) bottomless mimosa in town. We were told about the container yard by one of our lyft drivers and it was happen stance that the place we wanted to go to was in the container yard.  I am so very glad we chose to eat at this place. The food is excellent and the mimosas were priced right. My wife decided to drink her moneys worth of mimosas which meant 5. To get the bottomless mimosas you have to order you own meal. She ordered the short rib hash and I got the monkey bread. Oh man both were delicious, but that monkey bread was one of the best things i ate on the entire trip!! I dont plan on going to Vegas again soon, but I would definitely consider coming back for this place alone!! Worth the trip and the container yard as a whole was really cool, plus a visit to old town Vegas is always fun!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon for brunch....So glad I dragged my doubtful friends here!! We ordered steak and egg tacos and shared the French Toast with bananad, as recommended by the CHEF MARLON. The food was delicious and the reggae playing in the background was perfect..exactly what I was looking for. Our bartender STEFAN made me the best Damm jalapeño Margarita I ever had!! Nailed it!! Had a quick to it with the right amount of tequila!! I love it when they make us feel at home."}
{"text":"Failed to have Valentine's Day brunch here.  Signs you have to just walk out and not give this establishment your hard earned money:  1. Told it'll be 30min wait and will receive text when table is ready. 2. Never received text after 30min, so walk back to check in person.  3. Host tells us we're next and directs us to sit at an empty table.  4. Sit and wait for 15min while watching staff members walk by us without any acknowledgment.  5. Decided to get up and walk out - GLAD we didn't stay because I saw very small portions when staff walked by to serve the table next to us."}
{"text":"Most people who eat here are obviously tourist and are just excited about being in Las Vegas and want to rave about their trip and experience here, BUT... Here we go with the but. My son lives in the Art district so we all walked over to the park to eat. The people were very upbeat and friendly and the pale ales were very good but we must have caught them during shift change because the food took forever to come out. When it did I was very disappointed in the presentation and the size of the food vs the price. My fries looked like bbq burnt ends and the sandwiches were small. The main reason I'm writing this is my Wife's chicken Caesar salad. It looked very sad, came out in what appeared to  be the plastic lid from  a McDonalds salad. Terrible for a $11 salad. We didn't say too much and I controlled myself, finished and left. Instantly my wife's stomach became bloated and she felt sick. She had to utilize the rest room almost immediately. We went home and she spent the night back and forth in the restroom and having stomach issues.If you eat here don't be as nice as I was if you don't like the looks of your food. Unless you don't mind taking the chance and spending a sleepless night in the restroom."}
{"text":"Came downtown so my son could get a tattoo and decided to stop in fun lunch. Didn't realize that The Perch was still serving brunch.  Was unsure but glad we stayed ! We Ordered Perch burger, steak & egg tacos and the chicken and waffles. Wow! Everything was very good !! Also had unlimited Bloody Mary, which was so worth it. Great food & great service. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on a Saturday evening around 7pm. The restaurant itself looks and feels quite unique and nice being that it's in the Downtown Container Park.   Upon walking in. the two of us were given the choice of sitting at a two-seat table by the door. It was chilly out, so I didn't feel like sitting right by the door. I asked if we could sit at a four-seat table further in away from the door of the restaurant. This, for some reason, prompted a vigorous discussion between the gentleman seating us and another fellow behind the bar. We ended being offered and accepting a high table (for two).   This odd behavior irked me. The table for four I had asked about sitting at ended up being empty for the entirety of our meal. If a table a customer asks to sit at isn't actually reserved for an incoming party, good customer service is to GIVE THEM THAT TABLE.   If not for the misguided attempt to keep a table open for other possible customers, our experience at The Perch would have been very good. Our server was very friendly and the Grilled Salmon and Chicken Quinoa we ordered were quite well-prepared.  The price bracket their food is at requires their service to be on point. But it's not all there. You'll very likely enjoy some tasty food, but be prepared for awkward service, dirty tables and casual lackadaisical employees chatting and pointless hanging about behind the bar."}
{"text":"Love this new place! Since we got siked out from the Wineyard being only open on Fridays which is a bummer, we were looking for a Tuesday night Happy Hour.  Heard about this opening and so glad we went.  Service and food were amazing!  Plus it's so cute! It was a perfect night to dine outside.  And while no happy hour, the prices are very reasonable.  We had 2 flatbreads which were both really good.  One with quail egg, spinach abs cheese, so yummy!  The other was a shrimp, cilantro and bean one, also very delicious.  Fries with garlic aioli was my fav, I will crave these and must go back!  The wine was perfectly chilled as we'll and everyone who greeted and served us was super nice! Definitely going back, will be a regular :)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Amazing service by the staff here from top down Nora was our server! We enjoyed the salmon and the chopped salad don't think you could request anything bad here! They even spoiled my mom and got her an amazing dessert!!! Definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely happy to have spent part of my birthday celebration at The Perch. The management went above and beyond even through a problem was experienced in the kitchen. Ryan, the proprietor, worked with me from start to finish to make it special. Personalized menus adorned the table that was simply a touch of class. Granted, not everyone in my party was happy about the issue the restaurant, but the staff and the management went overboard to make the day special. Without hesitation I would recommend The Perch to anyone! Btw, the monkey bread is OFF THE HOOK!!  k."}
{"text":"What a waste of a meal. Life is too short for this bullshit.  This is one of the *worst* places we've been to in a long time. Obscenely small portions for the price. Everything on the menu is at least twice as expensive as it should be. Expect to stare at a plate of food that seems less than generous - on purpose. You will be irked.  The Steak Frites ($18) is served with a New York Strip - what a terrible, flavorless choice. The fact that they chose to *not* go with the Hanger Steak (which happens to appear in one of their sandwiches) is indicative of how stingy the people running this place are. I don't know anybody that would choose a New York Strip as their 'favorite' cut of beef. Pass.  The Power Greens ($11) salad is a cruel joke. Comes out looking like way less than a half-portion. Like meant-for-hamster-consumption-small. Appears to be less than $1 in ingredients with an 1100% markup. Should be $5.50 at the most.  The Flatbreads ($9-$13) are shamefully small. 4 *tiny* pieces of flatbread = the equivalent of one single slice of Brooklyn pizza. Should be $4.50-6.50 at the most.  Only suckers should eat here. I left The Perch feeling cheated and mad. The 6 of us also waited over 35 minutes for our food to come out. That's a long wait for a business lunch. The server apologized but offered no compensation. What a waste of time. Nobody likes wasting restaurant dollars. What a terrible value.  Currently the most overrated restaurant Yelp listing in Vegas. You've been warned! The actual environment is clean and fresh. Some table seating involves back-less stools which is a bit informal and potentially uncomfortable, but for the most part the interior design was pleasing. But alas, it's like a Four Seasons lobby with a truck-stop Knights Inn lurking in the back. (the Lurch?)  I'm sure there are a few more one or two-star reviews coming their way. It is inevitable."}
{"text":"Food was awesome awesome awesome, highly recommend. Staff is beyond helpful and attentive, you have to check it out. Hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Courtney was the best! Place was filled, but she still made sure we got our bottomless mimosas and Bellinis. Burger was a little dry, but drinks and service were great!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, can I just say this is the BEST food I have had in a long time right off the bat.  Coming to The Container Park for the first time tonight I wanted to try one of the local eateries and expand my pallet. So after walking the length of the park I settled on The Downtown Terrace. Located on level 2 in the back right by the stage.   With indoor and outdoor seating available to enjoy the live music I was already starting to fall in love with the venue. Inside the resteraunt is small, being 2 containers fused together, very cozy but intimate which was perfect for my date night.  Amazing service right from the start. Waters as soon as you're seated without asking for them, quick service by very knowledgeable staff and amazing cuisine that will make you come back again and again!   We ordered the chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The chicken and waffles were freshly made, sweet yet savory, and cooked to perfection.   The country fried steak was made fresh in house and the best plate of that design I have ever had!! From the first bite to the last it was a picture image of what cooking with love is all about.   Couldn't reccomend this place more. A must try for your life period."}
{"text":"Omg Courtney is the shiiiiiiit!! Literally the BEST margarita in TOWN!! I worked at a tequila bar for 3 1/2 years I know a good margarita when I taste one!! If you have not come down you need to ASAP!! Let's not forget how down to earth and friendly Dave is!! Just a totally pleasure dinning here felt like I was at home with friends and family!! The fried calamari is the top legit!! Thank you so much Dave and Courtney I totally had a blast!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is the absolute cutest little breakfast and brunch spot I've seen in a while. It's nestled at the end of Fremont street (aka the \"old Vegas\" apparently), but so worth it to go to! Forget the craziness of the strip, this place is my new favorite!   My best friend and I were meeting a friend for brunch, and after searching for places, we all agreed to come to The Perch, since other Yelpers posted that they had bottomless mimosas (yay!) ***By the way, it's not just bottomless mimosas... They have bottomless Bellini's and Bloody Mary's too. And you can mix and match them... As in, if you order a mimosa and then want a Bellini instead, that's fine***   We arrived around 11am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too crazy busy... yet. Our server, Jessica, was super on point and extremely sweet! She was so helpful, sincere and genuine, it made our experience so much better. We each saw a few things on the menu that caught our attention (other than the bottomless drinks), and we asked Jessica which item she'd recommend and she pointed us in the right direction -- and neither of us were disappointed.   My best friend and I both ordered the Brioche French Toast -- pure deliciousness! And our friend got the Egg White Omelet. And we had drinks for daaaaayyyssss at our table. Jessica came to check on us and I jokingly asked her to bring over a whole bottle of champagne for us -- and she did -- plus the mixers!!! Such amazing service! Needless to say, we were happy campers (or brunchers, whatever).   As we were paying, we noticed we still had some champagne left and again, the jokester that I am, asked Jessica if we could have the rest of the champagne to-go... and to my surprise/shock, she said yes! The only thing is that you can't leave the little complex The Perch is in but you can still walk around and enjoy the scenery, and if you have little ones, there's a play area for them.   Overall this was an amazing experience (thanks, Jessica!!!), and the food was phenomenal!!! Next time I'm back in Vegas, this place is a definite MUST! Oh, and be sure to pay enough for the darn parking if you drive/park your car there, otherwise you end up with a $20 parking ticket. SMH"}
{"text":"Venturing out on a Friday night is a rare occasion for me these days, work usually has me tied up on weekends. However, slow season is upon us and I managed to get the night off with the desire to try something new for dinner.  A few options came up but we decided on The Perch and boy I'm glad we did! We went without reservations and ended up sitting at the bar (best thing that could have happened!). Our service at the bar was above and beyond extraordinary and everything we ordered turned out to be little fork-fulls of happiness!   The black bean burger with avocado and garlic aoli was hands down the best veggie burger I've had the pleasure of trying and the spicy creamy tomato soup was a taste-buds fantasy.  All in all, we plan to be repeat offenders and who needs a stinkin table in that cute little place when the best service in Vegas is at their bar?!"}
{"text":"We had a nice late lunch at The Perch. We had the Chopped Salad and the Margherita flatbread. We were the only ones there until a wedding-photo shoot group arrived for a break while taking their photos. Added some excitement.  Interestingly, the hit was my iced tea."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Food can be good but some items on the menu should be avoided, seafood pasta a bit of a mess as is the beef tartare.  Chopped salad, calamari appetizer and crab cakes on the other hand - all quite good.  If you're in Container Park with visitors Perch is a solid stop.  Service a bit overeager and intrusive if you're inside and 'where's that darn server' if you're outside."}
{"text":"Oh my Gourd, super delicious! Came here for Halloween Brunch, and had some super tasty Bloody Marys and the chicken sandwich and the perch burger! Phenomenal!!! 10/10 will be back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic salads and bruschetta. Pena berry margarita on point. Fairly small seating area inside. Outside is fine after dark. I'm definitely not used to the heat here, though, so choose according to your acclimation. My dinner partner said both the bacon and shrimp was great (we got them on the side for our salads). Definitely would go again next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"First visit and will totally come back. Ordered the shrimp and grits and they actually came as \"grit balls\" and I was a little suspect but what a nice blend of crispy and soft texture. Shrimp was very fresh.  Husband had the Perch burger medium rare  (protein style) I asked him to describe it \"delicious AF\" The executive chef Marlon came out several times to ask about our dining experience which was nice.  Only giving it 4 stars because it took 30 min to get our main dish but keep in mind we came at peak time on a Sunday (12:30) But noticed the entire staff pitched in to help keep the ship afloat!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Great customer service and even better food!! From the time I stepped in the place I felt the love! if you are in Vegas this place is a must come to! if I could give more stars I would!! Thank you Perch Team you guys are awesome!!! Nora, thank you for your kind and exceptional service!! you definitely made my day!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Went for brunch and ordered French toast.  Took forever for our orders to show up.  Other tables who were seated after us got threat food first and finished eating already and our food were still nowhere in sight.  It's not like French toast is a complicated meal to prep."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere and our waitress Bianca was the best.. She kept the mimosas flowing and was super friendly and very attentive.. And the food was amazing.. Love this place."}
{"text":"Build my own Bloody Mary was a delight--I like it hot!! My burger was gr8. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'll try to make this as short as I can, but unfortunately my experience here wasn't so great. Yesterday night me and my friend went up to the bar and ordered 2 drinks, my friend had a mixed drink and I had an Iced tea (been sober for 2 years) one of the bartenders looks at me with a face of disgust like if by me ordering an ice tea makes me somehow less. I get my drink right away. My friend waited around 20 min and he was mad at the fact that they hadn't brought it to him, I kindly asked the bartender for the bill, he sarcastically told me to please wait since he was busy. Another bartender saw this and i guess felt bad and helped me out, he was really nice and this was the kind of service I expected from a beautiful place like this. We then left and as we where almost exiting the park the 1st bartender yells at us as he is running to catch up w us and tells us that we didn't pay, at this point I am vivid mad, so my friend kindly lets him know that we paid already. He then just leaves without even apologizing for the little scene he did.   Honestly I'm not one to complain but this guy ruined the night and the beautiful vibe in the place, I would like to give this place another try, only because there ARE workers there that know what good customer service is and the place is almost magical looking."}
{"text":"The Perch is located in the awesome Container Park in good ol' old Las Vegas. Finding parking was not easy and you do have to pay the meter. The food was delicious and very beautifully plated. The employees were very kind and attentive. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp and get your free beer or glass of wine.   The poke appetizer is a must have. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas visiting and made a trip to Container Park (which by the way is a great place for the kids), then headed over to The Perch for dinner. Ordered the special, Spicy Seafood Pasta and it was absolutely delicious. Extremely fresh ingredients and super attentive and friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back next time I come to town."}
{"text":"Went with my parents and bf. The menu had lots of variety so its perfect for people with varying tastes like our bunch. The place was so adorable and the staff was very friendly. It is located in a cool area called The Container Park. As for the food: the fries are delicious! The steak and margarita flatbread were ok. The calamari was extremely better than at the Oyster Bar ( and almost half the price too). My parents got the bleu cheese burger and seafood pasta specials and both loved them. The prices are affordable and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant prepares the best french fries. They are hand cut and deliciously seasoned. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. The vibes here are great and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place five stars. Our waiter was attentive and likable. The taste of food (flat bread and chimichurri sandwich) was great but...if you're going to serve someone a chicken sandwich that is raw in the middle, and then take 20 minutes to fix it, TAKE THE CHARGE OFF THE BILL. I shouldn't have to ask, this should just be standard protocol. Do the right thing next time Perch :("}
{"text":"Had a lot about this place so decided to give it a try. I would give 5 stars for the ambience and service but the food was just about average. If you are dining during regular hours and ordering a cocktail then I surely don't want to pay$ 10-$11 to have my cocktail in a plastic glass. I absolutely did not pay the full price for the drink for that. We ordered their lettuce cups and were disappointed .. the chicken was dry and smelled. We ordered their perch burger and vegetarian burger. The perch burger was ok .. the fried heirloom tomato in it was not a good idea. The vegetarian burger patty was over cooked and I think paying $ 15 for a vegetarian burger is a rip off. I can get 10 times better burger at better places at half the price . They are pay too overpriced otherwise."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Went for brunch with the family, best decision in our trip was to get away from the Strip to eat. Everyone happy with the food, generous portions, and $15 for bottomless mimosas was a great deal. Service was the highlight: thanks Shauna! Def coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick dinner tonight and enjoyed the veggie black bean burger with lettuce instead of a bun and a side of fries based on the great recommendation of my server...it was seriously delicious.  The Perch has great inside and outside space and the dining room is light, airy and fun...they play great music too!  Everything on the menu sounded delicious and I would love to try some cocktails and brunch next time."}
{"text":"Read about this place, and decided to check it out on a date night with my husband.  Great place in Container Park downtown. We sat at the bar because the only table available had too much traffic walking by it. The bar had comfortable seating. Our bartender & server Brandon greeted us and took our drink order while we looked over the menu.. He made a handcrafted margarita which was fantastic. I can't wait to go back to have another one..  We asked for suggestions and took him up on a few. We split the tuna tartar. Delicious! The menu said it was served with taro chips, however we got tortilla chips which were fine. Fortunately they were not salty, so they did not overpower the tuna. For entrees we got the Beef Carpaccio and Spicy Shrimp Pasta. The Carpaccio was served traditional with shaved parmesan and topped with Arugula and balsamic vinegar, perfect! The pasta dish was served with nice sized shrimp, pasta and a spicy cream sauce that was plate licking good. The dish has heat, but it was the kind that made you keep going back for more and more.  Only downside is that it would have been nice to eat on their patio, however there was a live band playing inside the park and the music was so loud, you would have not been able to hear yourself talk. Fortunately inside the music was not an issue at all. Looking forward to going back and hopefully have Brandon as our server. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"In good company. This place is a centerpiece of the Container Park which is located in Downtown LV. Offers a varied selection of delectable foods and a drink menu that is pleasantly original. It might become a place to meet friends or just sit back out on the patio and enjoy the sights. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I have to say I am sooo impressed! The service was amazing! Stefan was our waiter and he was nice and just thought of everything we needed ahead of time!  I got the fried chicken burger but asked them to replace the fried chicken with a burger patty and I have to say this was the best burger I have ever had!   Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best dining experience we have had in months.  What we asked for, we received with a smile from our host and the drinks!  WOW!  Cheer Marlin, and our server Macey!  Excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and had an amazing tuna tartar (fresh, yummy, mixed with avocado) followed by a delicious salad.   The service was friendly and prompt. Everything we fresh and the location great. I'll happily return."}
{"text":"they now have brunch with bottomless mimosas  I usually come in early and snag a seat before it gets super crowded and yes it gets CROWDED still the same great friendly staff and still the same great food if you havnt been here yet you need to come this is my go to place I've been coming here for YEARSSSSS    Still coming here a couple years later !!!!!!!! Still some Of the same people some are new but still just as happy great service love they added some new drinks          Loved it   My waitress was super friendly and upbeat  I ordered a Moscow mule supper yummy  the bartender asked me if I wanted a citrus vodka since it would bring out w better citrus taste I must say he hit it right on the head it had to be probally one of the best I have EVER HAD?   I got the salmon super moist not dry and gross the veggies underneath just as great I would totally come back  highly recommend it"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative 10 stars I totally would for making a visitor from out of town feel so unwelcome. This place employs impertinent sorry excuse for humans. Unless you meet their arrogant, contemptuous group they will disregard you as a human and raise their nose in a disdainful manor. Saddly this place looked promising for any one of god's children. NOT HERE. I ended up just walking about a block away to an amazing, welcoming place called PARK ON FREMONT that is worth every red cent we spent on drinks and food between my brother and I. They literally made us feel as if we were regulars there. Professional, humble, welcoming, nose down, not thinking they were better then anyone and most of all down to earth keeping the customers their main priority not segregating those that don't meet a certain type. Dumb A's still exist as I learned today. STEER CLEAR FROM THE PERCH. HEAD DOWN TO WHERE THE PEOPLE MATTER ANYWHERE ELSE BUT AT THE PERCH"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night because my husband needed good seafood and I wanted something lighter. He said \"the salmon is sublime\"! I had the hanger steak sandwich-- WOW. The grilled onions and garlic, on the perfect French baguette, combined with perfectly cooked steak, made this possibly the yummiest sandwich I have ever eaten. Had to take half of it home, the portion was so big."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim. We were in the neighborhood decided to check out container park and sin e it was so hot, decided on this place for their abundant indoor seating. We ordered off the menu we were given, chimichurri chicken sandwich for me, salmon for the hubby and kids Pizza for our princess.  Afterwards we found out it was happy hour do added a $5 calamari to our order. EVERYTHING was delicious! The calamari was a big portion and was perfect as was all our other food. I ordered a caparinha drink and they did not hold back on the alcohol! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with a huge group. They were very accommodating and everybody loved their meal. Can recommend the tuna tartar, salmon, and perch burger. House white wine was not good at all, but didn't detract from the experience."}
{"text":"Great location, great food and ice cold libations! No complaints from this guy! Well, other than the restroom is not located within"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a spring afternoon. One of the best casual brunches I have been too in Las Vegas ( this being said by a local). The chicken and waffles, the chicken and spinach crepes and country hash were amazing. It's. It brunch without endless mimosas! Which btw as long as everyone in your party has opted into the $15 endless mimosa,Bloody Mary and Bellini option you can have whole champagne and orange juice bottles sent to the table so you don't have to wait for a refill! We got there a little after 11 and the wait was an hour. But you can start your endless mimosas while you wait for your table. For as busy at it was, service was good and the food 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Sucks to give 3 stars but that's mainly for the food as a review. When it comes to the atmosphere and staff that alone deserves no stars. No one seemed happy to assist in taking orders or bothered cleaning any of the tables leaving us only a table with syrup and juice on it. I've been here before and had an awesome time, but I don't think there will be a third. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I have been to the Perch a few times now and we will keep coming back.  It is a small place in container park and has nice small plates and some good drinks.  We love the shrimp pasta and the tuna tartar.  It's a nice place to take friends or family from out of town."}
{"text":"Another restaurant posting 11pm close but the kitchen closes @ 10pm. Obviously ran by mammalukes. wasted our time with these clowns arriving slightly after 10 to be denied... thanks the perch for wasting my time.."}
{"text":"Downtown Terrace deserves all 5 of my stars. Found this place on Instagram prior to visiting Las Vegas and read the reviews here on Yelp to confirm the deliciousness and that's exactly what it was. Came with a group of 8 people on a Friday afternoon for brunch. I had never been this far down on Freemont, so from the bus stop it was a few blocks down, but not far enough to complain. It was nice to see things down this direction. When we got to the restaurant there was no outside seating, which would have been nice because it was a beautiful day, but they sat us right away inside. One person ordered the bacon flight, which we passed around for everyone to taste. One had some sort of horseradish/mustard sauce on it and I was a little concerned, and it ended up being my favorite of the trio. I ordered the short rib hash for my meal and it was more than enough food. The only improvement I would have added would have been a little heat. They did provide hot sauces, but I'm not a fan of Tabasco or Cholula...but this is merely a complaint. Everything was great. Oh and let's not forget the bottomless mimosas, bellinis, or bloody marys for only $15! I would definitely return if I was in town. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"While there seemed to be a lot of staff on hand, the service was slower than it probably needed to be. Expect to wait to place your order, and expect small portions of food and drinks. With that said, the food is good."}
{"text":"Wow  loved The Perch. My wife and I like to try new restaurants and last week we tried The Perch and were delighted, the food was just amazing, would recommend the burger too...tuna tartar was delicious as well.  Living  in Vegas you come to expect good service and great food choices, we were not disappointed here.  Next time we go downtown we will for sure eat here again !!!"}
{"text":"We had various appetizers and The Perch Burger.  It was all excellent.  The sauces are not traditional.  They were delicious."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. A colleague and I went there on Friday for lunch. We told the server we were dining on limited time. Our calamari came out in a timely fashion, however it took 30+ minutes to receive our entrees which we had to ask to go because we didn't have time to eat them there.  Adding insult to injury I had undercooked fries in my container. We didn't expect to pay $15 each for a salad and chicken sandwich to eat out of a plastic container...... Sad....."}
{"text":"My first time in this place and I have to say I like it the staff is really nice . Love the drinks and the food was awesome. Our waiter was really nice and actually took his time to explain the menu to us . I will continue to go to this place and I would recommend it to everybody ."}
{"text":"The Perch; give it some time and they will get things right, I feel, because they really seem to care about their business.   Let's get to the grub, in order of appearance:  Crab cakes...nearly all filler, and not all that flavorful to make up for the lack of crab. I would suggest passing on this unless they change the recipe to include more crab (not krab, please!).  Salmon entree was pretty good and cooked to the temperature requested; a good portion for the price paid, but what really made this dish stand out are the Brussel sprouts...ask for those with any other entree; they're that good.  Chicken entree was thin and not all that flavorful but a decent portion. This entree came with a salad that had a fantastic vinaigrette (I believe) but the leaves were too roughage-like for me and somewhat bitter.   Creme brulee was done nicely and what you'd expect; it's hard to screw up custard with caramelized sugar.   The highlight of the meal was the tiramisu. This was fantastic and not over-done in the rum department as most places do. I will go back for this alone, with maybe a cordial to wash it down since they have a full bar as well.   Ambiance: If it's busy, as it was on my visit, it's far too loud in this small space due to a lack of acoustical panels or other noise dampening decor.  Yes, I understand I'm sitting in a 'storage container', but several things can be done to make the space not so harsh. That annoys me while dining out more than bad service. Please look into taming down the space considerably.   Service: Excellent from both the server and the manager who checked on the table twice. From the minute I walked in I felt like all staff truly cared about the patrons. They were happy to be there; that makes me happy to be there too.   Overall it's worth a stop by if you're in the area since the dining options (that I would recommend at least) are somewhat limited on East Fremont. Make suggestions if you do go; I feel this establishment may actually listen."}
{"text":"Anybody who knows me, knows I LOVE the container park! It is not a secret. They always have cool stuff going on, great local business, and just generally really cool. One of my favorite places to bring guests, or just to go watch an outdoor movie in the Summer!  SO, when I heard there was a new place to eat, up above the toy store, with a view of the entire park, I got excited. The Perch did not disappoint!  Everything on the table was AWESOME! Sandwiches were delicious, hamburger looked incredible, french fries with an assortment of sauces...YUM!  The entire group loved it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is kinda a late post but would like to have everyone know not to come here for any holidays or if you think it might be busy. My fiancé and I came on Valentine's Day for brunch and seems like they don't know how to manage when it's busy. We were actually patient about the whole situation. When we checked in with the host they said it was about 45 min to and hr wait which we understood since it was Valentine's Day. They put our name and number to contact us when it's our turn. An hr passed and we went to check on the status and they said they tables are not ready yet. We decided to wait near the restaurant we saw a few tables that had no one sitting there and they didn't seat anyone there for a while. They saw us waiting and show no sense of urgency at all which ruin the whole experience where I didn't leave any tip. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"The \"go to\" spot to escape the summer heat while in Container Park.   I've come here a handful of times and it's slowly becoming my main haunt when in this neck of the woods. The food is fresh, the cocktails are delicious and the view isn't to shabby either. Because this is basically an insulated box, the A/C stays in and keeps this place feeling cool and comfortable.  My last visit had me sitting at the bar and enjoying a beer during a business meeting, we started with the fried calamari to share and the I chose, \"The Egg\" for lunch. The fried calamari is a great starter, your basic calamari with a light breading, but the sauce is what makes it pop, order extra because this stuff goes fast.   \"The Egg\" is a hearty salad that will fill any empty feeling you might get from reading the word \"salad\" on the menu. A poached egg, butter lettuce, frisee lettuce, bacon, croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette. This is a great lunch option that won't leave you feeling heavy and tired, the butter lettuce is different and something that you don't see on most salads. Plus who doesn't like a poached egg and bacon on a salad!   PRO TIP: Happy Hour is the best way to break your Perch cherry. Two-dollars off cocktails and five-dollar beer and wine offered."}
{"text":"We came here on a summer afternoon at the Container Park. There were only a couple other people in the place, so it felt pretty empty even though the place itself was relatively small. It had a nice vibrant atmosphere with the natural lights and clean minimal style. The service was just okay, but I wouldn't look too much into it. Outlets were also available, so we even saw a guy with his laptop out at the bar.   The food was a bit overpriced in my opinion, but delicious. I got the salmon on top of a bed of asparagus and brussel sprouts which I loved. They asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked which I've never heard of before. The veggies were cooked perfectly. We also got the bianca flatbread to start. It was a perfect appetizer for two or even a small meal for someone who isn't that hungry. My boyfriend got the chopped salad with added grilled shrimp on top. There were only a couple pieces of shrimp that shouldn't really warrant a $6 up charge. The salad itself was very good. The dill dressing was the best he's ever had and the apples and mangos were perfect additions. If he didn't order the overpriced shrimp, he said he would consider it the best quality salad, considering the price was only $10.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone with a couple of dollars to spend while downtown at the Container Park. It fills you up nicely without leaving you too full to where you can't explore the adventures downtown."}
{"text":"We didn't try the food, but enjoyed the atmosphere on Sunday evening when we explored the container park after dinner. There was hardly anyone in that area - I think it'd be a lot more fun when more people were around - but the space itself was cool and the bartender at Perch was friendly and made great drinks. We sat out on their patio area and played Heads Up and enjoyed the cooler weather since the sun had finally gone down."}
{"text":"Great bar and service! I went with a girlfriend to catch up and our bartender Nora was a doll! She was friendly and was not obnoxiously hovering like most bartenders do. She made an excellent cocktail and definitely made the place feel inviting. Adorable decor and the view of the container park is pretty sweet too!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for the best brunch/bloody mary for a while now.  Was visiting my daughter in Vegas and she suggested this place.    BEST BRUNCH EVER.    The place has a really cool vibe; great music, staff is totally chill, decor is great.  Had a bloody mary to start and it was DELICIOUS.  Not from a mix, perfect ratio of vodka and was just tasty.  You must must must order the short rib hash with demi glace.  It was so good all I did was sit at the table, eat and nod my head the entire time.  My daughter ordered the breakfast tacos and the meat was perfect.  A great sweet addition?  The monkey bread.    Had to try a belini too.   YUM.    Trust me...you need to go here.  Ask for Q as your server - he was awesome."}
{"text":"Celebrated a graduation of a friends here during brunch and bottomless mimosas. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the steak and egg tacos were. It is a small location and very busy, but the wait staff still did their best to accommodate everyone and their needs. I would recommend this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food was great. Our server was very attentive and the over all vibe of the restaurant was very comfortable. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here. Food is delicious. Outdoor patio overlooking Container Park is so cute, and such a nice atmosphere.   My sister and I ate here - shared a salad and the chicken and waffles - SO good. Service was super friendly, and they also made great cocktails. Will visit time and time again on my next trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Onno Leigh is an amazing server very sweet and attentive. Stefan the bartender is very knowledgable when it comes to pairing alcohol and food. All in all the manager will come to speak wth you and see what she can add to the service! This is such a gem in container park!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Awesome food, great service perfect location in the container park.  Get there!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time visiting the Terrace, so clearly I like it. This time around I was a bit disappointed. Everyone was really nice per usual; however some of the recent changes have 'cheapened' the atmosphere a bit. It's now necessary to order and pay at the counter. They also use paper plates and disposable cups. I honestly won't be back for brunch. It seems like another tourist trap at this point, and as a local I can't deal."}
{"text":"The Perch is a little restaurant located in Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas. It's on the second level of the park in the southwest corner of the park. It's accessible either by stairs or elevator. I visited the Perch for the first time during the evening on the weekend with a party of three.  Atmosphere: Hip, bright, and new! Being merely seated in the Perch, either outside or inside, is a great experience, in my personal opinion. The combination of the bright lights from the evening outdoors and the colorful backdrop of the pink-and-yellow-lit bar display created a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. I think it was very clever that the napkin \"holder\" also doubled as a fold-out menu, so the Perch gets bonus points for creativity.  Service: Stellar! The waiter we had this evening was very nice to us. One of my patrons wanted to retake a picture that the waiter had taken of us and our waiter kindly did so.  Food: Great!  The margherita pizza was light yet delicious. A friend of mine had the chipotle burger and it looked pretty appetizing from where I was sitting. It all was served within a reasonable time of ordering the food.  Overall: Come visit! This is a very cool, up-to-date place that has a great environment and staff. Worth a visit for the experience on the second floor of Container Park."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try this place out for a late lunch since we have seen many great reviews and everyone has been raving about it! My friends are dog-parents (if you're a pet owner, you'd understand) so I called the restaurant to make sure it was pet friendly. I called the number directly from yelp and spoke to a woman named Courtney. I asked if he restaurant was pet friendly and if we can sit on the porch and she said yes it was, dogs were allowed. So my friends and I made the trek down (1 hour drive), only to be told that DOGS were not allowed. The restaurant staff said it was service animals only and had to leave.   The woman should have been more specific and said service dogs only. Staff need to be more informative to their customers.  But thanks to 7th and Carson right across the street, they were more and willing to accommodate us and their food was very delicious! I will be  UPDATED REVIEW 4/1/18  I was contacted privately by David who sincerely apologized and invited me back to the restaurant.  I dined in with my sister and nephew on 3/31 and got top notch hospitality. Brandon and the staff were very friendly and recommended a lot of great items!   It was a perfect day! Warm weather, clear skies, live music and our Moscow mules were AMAZING!!! (FYI-get the Jameson, raspberry and rosemary mule!)   And I can't forget about the food! We ordered the Calamari, the Bianca flatbread, The Oz, and the juiciest turkey burger I have ever had!    We wanted to try more but we were so filled!   We will definitely be back again and for Brunch!   Thank you Brandon and David for a wonderful and filling dinner!"}
{"text":"Downtown Terrace ( A.K.A) The Perch is a small restaurant tucked away in the back of the Container Park in downtown Las Vegas. The menu is small but has more then enough to satisfy a variety of tastes. I went in for brunch and had the chicken and waffles which were fantastic and opted for the bottomless mimosas which were 15$. The service was great from start to finish and made for an enjoyable experience. This spot has indoor bar and outdoor seating, it is perfect for a get away from the craziness of the City!"}
{"text":"I've heard of The Perch before but never stopped in, their new 15$ bottomless Mimosa's did the trick.  We went on Saturday and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table because it was packed. I had the 3 egg white omelette with bacon and steak and it was better than I expected. The three flight breakfast shots are a must, try the whiskey scramble shot."}

{"text":"Friendly service and fresh amazing food make this gem stand out ... and the trendy container park is a welcome respite from the frenzied kitsch of Fremont Street and the Strip."}
{"text":"Perch was suggested to me by a local and it was AMAZING. The food was reasonably priced and the flavors were better than anything you could get on the strip. We ordered the Short Rib Hash, which was a unique take on a typical hash that is perfect for winter. I normally put hot sauce on everything but the seasoning was so perfect it didn't need a thing. The Chicken Spinach Crepes were also bomb, with a killer chipotle cream sauce. We spoke to Chef Marlin who was super genuine and appreciative while serving up some of the best food I've ever had in Vegas. Perch didn't stop there, as my friend was eyeing up our muscly waiter. Had we not been so full, she probably would have gone in for the kill, but I guess we'll just have to come back."}
{"text":"While in Vegas on an anniversary trip, my husband and I came upon The Perch after walking Freemont a few times.  We decided to sit out on the deck where we could see the big screen that was playing music videos.  The wait staff was great!  My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the steak and fries.  The salmon had some sort of green sauce on it...I think some sort of aioli and the steak had a garlic butter sauce and vinegrette on top. Both were so good.,especially the salmon! The margaritas came in a small glass, but they were not over priced and were delicious! I love this place...wish they had one in National Harbor, MD!!!! We will see The Perch on next year's vacation!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing. We had the spicy shrimp pasta and it was to die for! Hanger steak sandwich was incredible. Dill buttermilk spicy salad dressing was the best I've ever had. To top it off, the service was impeccable. Not too often you see genuine service anymore."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for brunch. The staff was really friendly and I loved our waitress, total sweet heart. I had my picky niece w/ me and of course she wanted pancakes but they did not serve any only French toast. So she had French fries and bacon lol. I decided to try their crab cake Benedict and gosh do I regret it. They flavor was just not good at all. Everything was over powered by this lemon or sour taste. The crab tasted really bad and there was no good flavors combining this whole dish. The boyfriend had their burger and he said it was really good. I also order my first Bloody Mary and gross! Hahaha never again but I don't blame them maybe I'm just not into that particular drink. Place is super cute and hopefully next time I come back what ever else I order turns out really tasty, so I can update this review and be able to give them an extra star or two"}
{"text":"This review is purely based on experience seeing as I haven't had the pleasure of trying their food just yet.  After dinner downtown, my bestie and I decided we wanted just one more drink before we headed home.  We had heard good things from friends about Perch and went for it!    Without even trying their food, I already fell in love with this place.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartender was SO friendly and made our whole experience wonderful!  I decided to go out on a limb and try their Caiparinha.  Now, it is hard to impress me when making one of these because I've spent some time in Brazil and know exactly how one of these should taste Brazilian style.  Well, I was not disappointed!  The drink was pretty authentic and impressive.    I can't wait to go back and try their food, especially their brunch!  Great spot downtown in Container Park!  Can't wait to update this review when I go back!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Really friendly staff and delicious food. Drinks were overpriced though."}
{"text":"My first meal in Vegas and it was perfect! Brandon took great care of us and my salad with salmon was perfectly prepared, tasty and just the right size. After dinner, Mel prepared a great hot toddy that took the chill off of a desert night. Would love to come back again to try more cocktails and dishes."}
{"text":"In the container park with lots to see and do. Kids playing below but somehow it's not too noisy. Bottomless drinks for $16 is a no brainer if you plan to have more than 1. I got the chicken and waffle sliders, they come with raspberry jam and whipped cream SO GOOD. Boyfriend and dad got burgers and they were amazing!! I was pleased, but 5 starts because I wasn't blown away or overly impressed.  I'll be going back next month with a cousin."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 stopped here for brunch and we had a great time! The service was great, they were able to find a spot for us inside away from the heat. Our waitress was amazing, wish I could remember her name but I think it was Breana. They have bottomless mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch for only $15 . Our waitress kept the drinks flowing. I had an omelette and some monkey bread and it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome view. We could not get into for dinner but we took full advantage of the bar. Want to go for dinner sometime"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I sat at the bar and not in the dining area. The service here I have heard is the worst known to man. I decided to sit at the bar because no one else was there and the bartender took good care of me. She made my most favorite drink that was not on the menu and did it perfectly. I had the salmon and it was not overcooked and it had just the right amount of seasoning."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food and the brunch is where it's at! Sit at the bar and ask for Josh. As far as food order the breakfast sandwich with bacon or chorizo. I've been to many brunches in Vegas and this by far has exceeded my expectations. The food is great! And the mimosas are definitely bottomless. Despite the unruly crowd of people who left a comment about being 86'ed.. The atmosphere was good. Don't believe the liars and come try this super cute super yummy place!"}
{"text":"Superb food, excellent service, nice ambiance. Would definitely return. Great quality for the price compared to many other restaurants I visited while in Vegas"}
{"text":"(4) ~ very good overall brunch  MENU: ** Monkey Bread = (4.5) Very Good!   ** Steak & Egg Tacos = (4) very good, especially when you add hot sauce ** Water(tap) = (4) very good * Bacon Flight = (3.75) Good * Orange Juice = (3.5) good * Coffee = (3.5) good"}
{"text":"We tried this place out and I was pretty disappointed.  After getting seated, we waited 15 minutes before being able to place our order.  Then, after our order was placed, we waited 50 minutes for our food.  It would have been more tolerable if our waitress had kept us updated.  It wasn't even busy either.  I had three little kids ancy and restless for their food, made it a little painful.  That alone is why I'm not giving this place more than two stars.  Then, some of our food was burned.  The setting was nice, service was poor.  Won't be taking my business there again."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday brunch because I saw a photo of their smothered egg biscuits and knew I needed that in my life.  It's inside container park so naturally it's a cute place, very bright inside. The staff was very friendly and it was a pleasant atmosphere. I ordered a couple mimosas and the egg biscuit plate. It was an extremely heavy dish so I was only able to eat about 1/3 of it before calling it quits. It was good but I don't know if I'd get it again, I'm a fan of poached eggs more than scrambled so eating scrambled eggs was an adjustment. I think if I want biscuits and gravy I'll stick to the real thing and not a breakfast version.  If I find myself downtown on a Sunday morning I'd definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"The business used to be called 'The Perch' and there's clearly been more than a change other than the name. It's all very unorganized now.   For starters there are no servers, only bartenders, and what seems to be food runners.   As soon as we arrived we waited about 5-10 minutes before an employee acknowledged our party, and then seated us once they found an open area (since they do get busy for brunch.) Once we were sat down we reviewed the menu, and waited about 10 minutes before stopping the gentlemen that seated us, and he mentioned there were no servers - we must order with the bartender, and then the food will be delivered to us. It was a party of 8, and we all got unlimited mimosas so it was a bit annoying that we had to get up, and request another drink every single time. Especially since it's busy, and the bar gets full quickly. Therefore, you have to wait till a bartender becomes available.   This now seems like a fast food place, but with a bar, better food, and good customer service."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are always looking for somewhere to relax and we find ourselves drawn to this spot! Service is always great and the food is is really good!!!!"}
{"text":"So we wanted to check out the Container Park in downtown Vegas and found this place via Yelp (what else). Located above the park, it has both inside and outside seating. Since it was windy and chilly that day, we opted for inside. However, we look at the menu and it was the Saturday/Sunday brunch menu, but it was Friday! Our server told us that they just recently made that switch. So we just ordered coffee to warm up and decide if we were saying or going. We stayed and I'm glad we did.  I got the chicken sandwich. It came on a really tasty, toasted roll and had pesto and other yummy stuff. Lisa got the salad and had steak with it instead of the shrimp that came with it. It was fantastic.  The place delivered and worth a visit."}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for 16 years prior to moving home to So Cal, so when I do visit I make sure to avoid the strip and strip pricing for food. I tried The Perch for brunch and it was amazing. I love the container park and the pods (so cute) the weather was perfect so we sat outside. I love their mimosa service! I will be back next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food a reasonable prices. Tuna tostada appetizer was insane, and turkey burger was the best turkey burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"After cooking so many meals at home lately my partner and I decided to grab a nice dinner out. We forgot to make reservations, so many places were full on a Saturday so we decided to check container park and see how that was.  I've been to the perch before but my partner hadn't so we decided to go for it. Host stand is tricky to find. I noticed many guests have that problem. Maybe a sign saying wait here at the top of the stairs so people will feel acknowledged. We waited a couple of minutes while a gentleman with glasses bussed a table for us so we didn't have to wait longer so I appreciated that.  After we sat down I checked in on yelp and got a free glass of wine and my partner got a sampling of an amazing beer he loved. Our server Alexis was a peach. She was so sweet and took great care of us.  We started with the Arugula flat bread with prosciutto. I'm not one for arugula because I find it too bitter but thisssssssss was amazing. From the sauce to the meat, so delicious. The appetizer almost out did the entree.  I decided to try the seafood pasta special. It was spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce and salmon, calamari and shrimp. I told Alexis I was allergic to tomatoes and wanted the dish so she made a great recommendation, get the Sriracha cream sauce instead. Man am I glad she told me to do that. My partner loved it so much I could tell he wanted my dish.   I'm from Boston so seafood for me is always iffy out here mainly because I'm seafood spoiled. The shrimp in the dish was NOT good. Very chewy and didn't appreciate the taste. Other than that it was the only negative to the night.   Eating out on the perch was great we had great views, service, vegas weather and live music. What else could you ask for? Would I come back? Oh yes!! Thank you Alexis and the perch staff."}
{"text":"Had a reunion here for brunch. Food was so yummy. Bottomless drinks made my life. Our server Alexis was the best! She kept out table lubricated with bottles of champagne and was so nice when we split the bill 8 ways...I hate us too! When we come back we will ask for Alexis every time!! Then go on the slides!!!"}
{"text":"Well that was a surprise! Wandered around the edges of Fremont looking for dinner on Monday when everything seems closed (local joints). Was going to get a strange combo of red wine with chicken & waffles. The waiter was kind enough to describe the sweetness & portioning of the chicken & waffle. He also suggested the salmon.  Salmon was outstanding. Served on a bed of deep fried then pan roasted Brussel sprouts with beans. Salmon done perfectly at a medium with a crispy skin. Just fantastic, would definitely return if in these parts.  Their house white is a very palatable Pinot Grigio, yelp check in got me a nice free top up too!  Meanwhile a high school strings group screeches away in the background, occasionally hitting the right notes."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem. My date and I could not believe how incredible our experience was last night. The food was tremendous, the service was fast, friendly, knowledgeable and fun. The ambience is unlike anything in Las Vegas. We had salmon, shrimp lettuce wraps, and the best burger we have both ever experienced with a fried green tomato on it. We cannot wait to go back. Container park is simply amazing. Best \"date\" place in Clark County."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on yelp. It's a fun but low key atmosphere ideal for brunch and day drinking. They are not stingy with the bottomless drinks and the food is incredible. We got the steak and egg tacos, chopped salad, and burger with monkey bread to share. Get the monkey bread. It is worth it! Staff is friendly and attentive. Located in container park it's a fun view and vibe. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Cute place for a date or with friends. Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Music good too"}
{"text":"Wish we had stopped at the drinks and apps! Orange Crush was yummy & Moscow Mule wasn't bad. Potstickers & Lettuce Cups--delish! Service was great! And then...entrees came out. Terrace Salad: decent, but they ran out of chimichura sauce & didn't replace it with anything, so ended up being very bland. Can't say much about steak with Brussels sprouts & asparagus, but the veggies were pretty good. Spicy pasta, eh. No complaints, but not going to write home about it. The big problem was the chicken quinoa. Took a bite, and my tongue immediately shriveled up like a slug sprinkled with salt. Thought it might just be me, so had 2 other in party try, and they agreed. Called the waiter over, told him the problem, said I'd just take a salad instead. 20 minutes later, after the rest of the table was finished, they brought the salad out. And it was wonderful! But my waiter didn't bring it out & didn't come to check on us ever. I had to ask 2 other people for the check, and when it came, I had to ask them again to put the drinks on a separate bill from the food-which the original waiter had assured us was no problem. So, great starter place, but recommend going elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"This place had great atmosphere, food was really good and had a decent food diversity. The service was a little less attentive as I expected. I probably would have had another drink or two if they had paid attention to my glass."}
{"text":"So wonderful!  The service was great, and the atmosphere was hip and casual. We came on what I believe was their opening night. So, the rain storm was crazy, but we were determined. Lucky for us,  there was mucho seating.   We split the salmon mango salsa. The fish melted in my mouth.  I had the seafood pasta. So flavorful and filling. If you are a fan of red sauce, and mussels, and being really full, this is the dish for you! My friend got the tuna nicoise salad.  She ate every last bite. Very clean, fresh, and flavorful.   We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They change their menu and recipe too dang much. Ordered the chimichanga and it came completely dried out. Don't understand how/why I would eat something so dry. Don't waste your time going because what you liked will be gone"}
{"text":"Good for sightseeing and ambiance wise. Good food but not extraordinary. Great for girl-brunching coz really all we need are unlimited mimosas."}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks in the Container Park.  Took my folks here for lunch.  We sat on the terrace overlooking the park - a very nice setting.  We were all drawn to the Chicken and Waffle which was fantastic."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super trendy and it has a great ambience the Moscow Mule was very tasty and the truffle oil flatbread pizza with prosciutto was yummy"}
{"text":"This place was so cute. Me and my friends stopped in for a good brunch and they did not disappoint! The chicken was crispy and the waffles were fluffy. They also use the most amazing beer cheese sauce to coat their shrimp and grits. Our server was polite, quick, & gave great recommendations. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Salmon w brussel sprouts - DEEEEELICIOUS!!!   Service was SUUUPERB!!!!  Kirby was fantastic and a service professional.  Overall FANTASTIC... And it has a VIEW."}
{"text":"I think the Perch may have the best fries I've ever had.  I loved, \"The Egg\" salad as well.  Our server, Amy was great too.  I love the whole concept of the Container Park and I'm so glad we chose to dine at The Perch.  I'd definitely return next time I'm in Vegas and I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Local Vegas person here. Ate here back in mid July. It was simply delicious, I had the steak frites. I went with my family of 10 and we have my little 5 year old cousins with us.   We were seated outside but since it was later in the day it cooled down a bit. I would definitely come back here once I'm back downtown! The person who seated us and the owner were super friendly. The waiter did take awhile for our drinks and to bring us our condiments we asked for. Other than that this place was great!"}
{"text":"I reserved a table for 10 and we had an excellent setup for all of us inside the building. If it wasn't a chance for rain that day, we would have sat out on the patio. The entire place is lovely. So making a reservation, we expected to not have issues with service. The place was maybe 25% full, most of it us! Some of our orders ended up taking forever and a couple of us got theirs after some already ate and one order was never placed so she sat there almost 2 hours waiting for nothing.  We had to ask for refills and for our drinks and then they didn't split out our checks (after they asked us if we wanted it split.) We were annoyed and even though all of us loved the food, we said we weren't coming back due to the poor service.  (We chose this place because we were meeting up for BikeFest which was happening that weekend, so it was not a place we would have normally went to and our first visit.) The manager came to apologize a few times, tried to work out the missed food dish and apologized. All I could say was I was very disappointed especially since we made sure to make a reservation so they would be ready.  The manager ended up comping our entire table!! We never expected that kind of reaction for poor service and were shocked. This says alot about a company!! We were very impressed with everything, especially the manager's sincerity. Poor service can be fixed with training, but a place with this kind of integrity and responsiveness is refreshing! Great food, fabulous location, beautiful and chill vibe. Loved the place!!!! We will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here.  We order the calamari, perch burger, chopped salad and chicken tenders.  Everything was fresh and amazing.  Even the fries were fresh.  Gonna check out brunch next.  Nora is the bomb."}
{"text":"The venue is pretty cool. It has so much natural light and the colors really make you feel alive. The restroom is downstairs which is pretty close to the restaurant.  Came in here for bottomless brunch - which is mimosa, Bellini, and Bloody Mary. It was $15 on top of the food you choose. The food I got was about $12. They were really great in serving us. They give you a glass of your choosing at first and then they just ended up giving us bottles instead.  I got the steak and egg tacos. It was okay with all the ingredients together. The steak by itself was so good. Everything else was just okay. It's not something I would get again or would recommend.   I tried the French toast. That was really good! I definitely would recommend their French toast.   The service here was great. They were really nice. They were attentive and were so quick for the amount of people that were there.   I would recommend this place and come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had a pretty nice time. Loved the steak & egg tacos once I added hot sauce and the bite I had of the perch burger was pretty tasty. Definitely opt for the bottomless mimosas as it's a good deal if you plan on having atleast two (it's brunch, so you obviously should have multiple). The place was packed so the service was slow and we felt like they wanted to rush us out. I hope the service will be a little more attentive next time as their regular menu looked really good so would love to check this place out again."}
{"text":"The worst meal I've had in vegas in 3 years.    1.french fries were so greasy they were illuminated by sun 2. 11 dollar salad we are in 7 bites maybe 1/10th of an apple and 3 cucumber slices 5 mm thick.  3.  11 dollar wine you can buy a bottle for 11 dollars.   Super dry savignon blanc.  Though not their fault 4.  Chicken sandwich bread was fried in old gross oil.   Barely any cheese. 5. The salad came out 10 minutes before my husbands chicken.    I left starving.   Never again."}
{"text":"I came to The Perch for a bachelorette brunch with a large group. It's located in a unique container park off the strip. The size of the restaurant is not very large and it can get pretty loud, especially with our boisterous group! The space itself is adorable with tons of natural light. Reservations for a large group was easy to make and our waitress was wonderful! She was on top of it with all of the drinks and had a great personality to boot. Everyone enjoyed their food and I didn't hear any complaints. I ordered the Smothered Egg Biscuits and it was tasty, but nothing special. I wish I ordered it with over medium eggs, but the dish comes to you automatically with scrambled (boo). Also, the cheese was not melted on top and the majority of my biscuit was hard (again, boo). However, the ambiance and service will more than made up for my mediocre dish.  Tip: There  is no taxi line for Container Park, so use Uber/Lyft to get back to the strip."}
{"text":"I really wish i could say more good things about perch but unfortunately I can't. I had such high hopes for this places based on reviews but was disappointed on multiple levels. First the host seemed like it was his first day bc he only wanted to offer me bar seating. However I was wearing a dress and meeting a girlfriend so that was not an option. Ultimately he spoke to another employee who told him to split up some of the other tables and seat us.   Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down.   Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it.   Overall, the ambiance of the location is cute and very fresh. I think if i came back it would be for appetizers and drink perhaps. Wish i could say more good things but thats all folks!"}
{"text":"It's tough keeping up with the new restaurants opening in Downtown Las Vegas, but I felt like I had to give this place a try after hearing friends and colleagues rave about it.   Tomato Bisque: It must've been over 105 degrees outside during my visit, but this bowl of soup sounded too good to pass up. It's rich and flavorful, and it packs a bit of heat, but not enough to break a sweat.   The Terrace: Love corn? This is your jam. I wasn't expecting a whole bowl of grilled corn! The salad was topped with grilled shrimp, tomatoes, chimichurri, and avocado slices. I would've preferred more avocado. Otherwise, this was tasty.    Lemon Cheesecake:  This has to be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. It's a no-bake cake that had a refreshing lemon flavor. The graham cracker crust was solid. From what I've been told, the chef likes to mix things up when it comes to desserts, so daily offerings are always changing. However, I'd probably order this again and again if it were available.   I may have to return to try their burgers and sandwiches, but it'll be difficult not to order the tomato bisque and lemon cheesecake."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, It was wonderful. The service was on point, the food and dessert was good.The second, they fell off. They took awhile to come over to give a menu, to give water, to take the order, the food took long and it wasn't even busy. It was time for the check and the server was slow about that too. I was hoping this place was going to be consistent with their service and food but obviously not."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is in container park and if you've never been, you are missing out! Container park is a nice little getaway from the rest of harsh Las Vegas.  Secondly because of its location this means the place is tiny but that by no means takes away from the ambience!!! We came here with no reservations so we had to wait just under an hour for a table for four!  Once we sat down they put a bottle on the table. I mean what is brunch without bottomless mimosas ?  $15 per person which is more than affordable! The service was a little bit on the slower side because they are so busy but still very attentive in that none of our orders were mixed up.   The food was amazing. I had the chicken and waffles, friend had the shrimp and grits, wife had the French toast so everything was up to par. We had a great time and the executive Chef took care of us.  This place is a must go for Vegas locals and I will be sure to return!!! Thank you all for the amazing experience."}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago and had the most amazing lunch. My parents and I split the tuna tartar, tomato bisque and the chicken burger (forget the actual name) but meant to write this review while I was there and forgot. Simply the most fresh ingredients and sooo much flavor. I would defiantly go back again when I am visiting Las Vegas. Not to mention.. the cute atmosphere and it overlooking the park area.. very fun!"}
{"text":"Had a good time after hanging out at First Friday. Drinks were excellent and husband said the Calamari was great too."}
{"text":"My family & I went here for brunch today. Service was great along with atmosphere! I love patio seating. Mimosas were delish & pricing for everything was very reasonable. Very small but cute restaurant. Food was good, nothing outstanding. I'll be back if in the area."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place isn't jamb PACKED, but let me tell you, it is worth the trip down there!  First off, it's in the Container Park! Come one! That place is AWESOME! Don't let the fire breathing preying mantis scare you either! Secondly, their Happy Hour deals are A-MAZ-ING!!! 2 for 1, SERIOUSLY!! We did some SERIOUS HH damage! Thirdly, their food is SO damn good! Their burger was DEELISH! A friend wanted to order their Power Greens salad, assuming the veggies were cooked and when the Server explained that it was a chilled salad, my friend decided against it. Well, when our food came out, the chef had prepared a plate of cooked power greens on the house! AWESOMESAUCE!  Finally, the service. From the moment we walked in to the final waving of good-bye, they were ON POINT! We laughed. We joked. We smiled. We were happy the ENTIRE time, both times!  It's a great little spot! Do not pass it up.  2 not so happy moments. A couple of things came out a little extra salty and the way they prepare their michelada isn't one of my faves."}
{"text":"Going on a Container Park date with your guy or lady friend? Doesn't have to be a \"date.\" I know some of you are into more fluid, polyamorous relationships.  You could just be out with some one attractive and you go out to eat, and maybe afterward something more happens, or maybe not.    It doesn't matter what you're in to.  Just eat here already.  It's 4 star good."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!  Made for a wonderful date night night. We had the salmon and the chimmichuri chicken sandwich and the scampi appetizer. Yummy sauces, nice service and not too busy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. Everything was tasty and fresh. We had a flat bread appetizer (amazing), the veggie burger, and the salmon, all were really great. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. This is a great place for dinner with healthy options and a nice selection of wines and cocktails. The flourless chocolate cake was to die for! I loved the outdoor seating and being able to watch music videos on the big screen. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I wish I could place the photo for reference here but I did add the photo to the collection. I was excited to try The Perch for the first time last night. I ordered their $20 Egg Salad with steak and ask for it to go. My destination was right in the park so this wasn't due to travel time but when I opened up my salad, I was extremely disappointed. The bread crostini were so hard I couldn't even eat them, literally could not even bite into it. The poached egg was still half raw and yolkless, couldn't eat it that either. The steak was really rare and looked like it had been squeezed together. The salad itself was seriously maybe 6 bites worth that included some bacon pieces, possibly less than 2oz of steak. This was not a refined $20 salad I was expecting, it was a $4 dollar salad at best. I will not be trying there food again because the lack of passion for the food clearly shows. Restaurants should be proud of the food they are putting out, even if it is to go."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Container park, the restaurant is perched on the second floor. We went there for brunch today, beautiful day to sit outside. We waited for 30 mins for a table as there was a wait.  The place was modern and airy. The menu was skillets and biscuits for bunch and  flatbreads, salad, steak and salmon for dinner. We ordered two cocktails and  the drinks came in 25mins and then the food a few minutes later.   The chicken and waffles was super crunchy and delish.   The service was bad. The waitress was unattentive. We were baking outside for 25mins and had to go in and get water. Throughout brunch we had to ask for more water, and napkins twice. I would have given one star ratings but the food was good so decided on three star ratings.  Recommend trying out this place and hope you get a better server!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at The Perch on 8/7, a pretty busy Friday night. We sat outside and we were seated promptly.    They took quite a while to take our order, but it was busy, so that's understandable.Once we placed our order, it took kind of a while to get the food out.  Like a long while.  It is too bad that the service was so slow. Our server was great and kept checking on us, so I think the problem was with the kitchen.  It would have been nice if they had offered us bread or something.   I would have given them four stars, because my salad, The Terrace, was freaking delicious, but they made a couple of mistakes in addition to the SLOW service. It was a great salad with fresh roasted corn, heirloom tomatoes, a slightly spicy chimichurri dressing, and four shrimp. Maybe in a $15 salad they could have gone with 5-6 shrimp.  It was still more than I could finish though, so no big deal.   Mistake #1 - The brought out my dinner about 10 minutes before my friend's dinner. That was weird and awkward. We just sat and looked at it. Good thing it was a salad, so I didn't have to worry about it getting cold.   Mistake #2 - My salad was supposed to have avocado, and it didn't.  If it is on the menu but not on the plate, they should explain when you order that they are out of whatever it is.   I would go back, but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients prepared to order (read that: it takes time). Gluten free menu available. Family spot has kids play area outside. Variety of adult beverages. Good use of a retired shipping container like other stores and restaurants in this complex just east of the Fremont Street canopy. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Walking around container park and our group was hungry! We actually left eureka because we knew the food here was good so it was an easy decision. Well let me tell you. Almost a year since the first review and this place has completely changed for the worse. The energy was so DEAD that two of our group left to go eat elsewhere. We stayed. Service was fast from the bar so no complaints there and the menu has stayed the same. Husband got the turkey burger again but he said it was just mediocre this time. Looking at the brunch specifics and I'm pretty sure this is the only place in town that has a 2 hour bottomless time limit. Plus there's a menu on the back wall about creating your own margarita. And people are given the option of gin, vodka, etc? I'm sure that's a disaster for the bar tender especially when the drink comes out and it tastes horrible because the majority public wouldn't know how to make a margarita if their lives depended on it. (Hint: margaritas are generally made with tequila) was happy to see this place stay since the turnover in there is ridiculous but now I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and appears to be very trendy. On a weekend trip to Vegas, I was craving brunch and wanted to check out the Downtown Container Park. We stumbled on The Perch by accident and since it had a lot of good reviews we decided to check it out. Fortunately for me, there was a Check-In Special where you get a free 4oz. of beer with your first check in and I opted for the Victory beer which was a super delicious wheat ale. The brunch menu was not too vast, and I ended up eyeballing The Terrace, which is described as a dish with corn, chimichurri, shrimp, and I think tomatoes. For some reason I expected greens or something underneath it but the bulk of the dish was corn and chimichurri, which isn't the end of the world by any means.   The plate smelled delicious when it came out, and it initially tasted delicious, but after four or five bites the garlic and onion flavors were so overwhelming that I had already begun to apologize to my boyfriend because I knew I was going to reek of garlic for the days to come. If you don't have a problem with a huge amount of raw garlic in your brunch meal, then by all means opt for The Terrace. If you want to continue smelling delightlfully ambiguous then do yourself a favor and get the french toast which is really really freaking good. I got to take a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and I almost stole his dish away from him..."}
{"text":"Of Container Park's many spots to lounge, eat and drink, I prefer Perch for it's location above it all. Surprise, surprise, it's perched above the park on the second level, with comfy patio furniture to hang, drink, sunbathe and watch the action down below. Like an outdoor living room, Perch is low key and welcoming.   I can't comment on food, but they made a solid French 75 for me during Life Is Beautiful. Sipping an icy beverage under their yellow umbrellas was the perfect pause. Service was quick & friendly, and the ambiance is uber chill.   If al fresco drinks & relaxing is what you need, Perch is the place."}
{"text":"Ran into this place by accident and man the drinks are so good, very welcoming too! I highly recommend this place if you're tired of the fancy pantsy strip!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Downtown Terrace a second try. On Saturday 5/26/18 Took my friend and when we got there we sat down inside this time. (It was too hot outside)  We wanted the bottomless mimosas for $16 They advised us we have to get 1 entree each for the bottomless mimosas.  We decided on it and were ready to order when the waiter tells us they are all out of entrees and we have to order 2 appetizers each for the mimosas.  By this point I think to myself. Do I really wanna eat 2 appetizers that means between my friend and I we would have to order 4 appetizers.  They told us to return at 4pm and they could probably make an entree for us.  We decided to leave and not come back.  Since we had already payed parking we ended up walking container park for a while and went to a bar next door."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on the patio tonight. The hostess was great and the food was amazing, but what made it all an even better experience was our waiter Mike. He was a great waiter. As if we were in a movie or something. He offered us solutions to our dinner questions and he was genuine. He was never pushy either. Thanks Mike for making our first visit here very welcoming. Since we live here we well send everyone here and tell them to ask for Mike!"}
{"text":"This place was new and exciting in Container Park. The food was quite good except for the soggy bun on the burger. Nothing I hate more than wet bread."}
{"text":"A little treasure we found while wandering. Excellent food great drinks and wine. Everything well thought out. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great place and great service! The food was awesome too! I'm going back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY MY BEST FRIEND FOUND THIS PLACE. Amazing and thoughtful service - from the entire staff. This trip to Vegas we had come across so many rude servers at so many well-known establishments. It was so refreshing to come to a restaurant that was all-around such a great experience.  Drinks are delicious - our server doubled as the bartender - Stefan is the best!  FOOD? AMAZING. You can tell the chef and the kitchen staff are meticulous and particular about the taste and presentation -- neither disappointing. I went with the grilled salmon that came with brussels sprouts and asparagus, topped with a homemade avocado mousse. The kitchen even asked how I'd like my salmon cooked! Truly appreciate that. My bestie went with the chimichurri chicken sandwich - she devoured the whole thing!  We have found our new go-to spot everytime we come out to Vegas :)  Thanks so much for a great final meal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"For some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I decided to brave the heat and take a stroll downtown on a Wednesday afternoon - which I do not recommend, by the way. I could feel my shoes melting on the pavement... Anyway, we're locals with one mutual day off, so we do what we can to make the most of it, living downtown and such. Yadda yadda yadda. Many people have talked about the Perch so we strategized our route to where we could pop in & cool off before checking out the shops in Container Park.  Upon arrival, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. After being seated and served ice water immediately, we were given a moment to chill out and browse the menu. I was a little disappointed with the options. For some reason, I was expecting there to be a bit more variety. Honestly, the brunch menu was a lot more appealing - but it's only available on Saturday & Sunday mornings. Booooo...  I ended up ordering the fried chicken sandwich and the boy got Thai chili chicken tenders with fries. Both were very tasty! You could taste just about every ingredient in the sandwich, which was great. I was nervous because, in my opinion, fried chicken tends to take over & dominate the flavor in other dishes I've had - this was not the case for the Perch. Well done! However, one weird critique I have is with the size of the plate that the sandwich was served on... The sandwich is fairly large and with it being served atop a heap of fries, I had a hard time not making a mess because the plate was so small. Other than that, the Perch gets an A in the food/flavor aspect.  NOTE: This place does not serve Ranch, only chipotle buttermilk dressing. Had to knock off a star for that one, because boy, those chicken tenders & fries would've been out of this world with some plain ol' Ranch to dip 'em in..."}
{"text":"We have been here for dinner and brunch and the food is amazing. The salmon I ordered was perfectly cooked and the steak almost melted in your mouth, the only other place with steak that good was brio! At brunch they have all you can drink mimosas!"}
{"text":"WoW! I was impressed. This place is clean and the staff is friendly as well as knowledgeable. I had a Thi chicken salad in a wrap, hummas, French fries and a beer! Woot, Woot! They do have a happy hour here. Inside and outside seating. Friendly staff and great food! Get in here!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Bottomless Mimosas, Bloody Marys & Bellinis, a good variety of food. The service is ABOVE AVERAGE and the food is DELICIOUS!! The people who work here are fun, friendly and attentive. Wish I would've found this place sooner. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went in for brunch. We were told about 5-10 minute wait, because he needed time for the kitchen to catch up. Ok, you don't tell customers that, but ok. 24 minutes later I check in and the hostess/manager was a total douche. Tries to give me a big lecture on how the iPad doesn't dictate wait times blah blah. Your customer service sucks. You should be a role model not everything that was wrong about The Perch. Because you were the only thing that was WRONG. We would have left of not for our groupon voucher.  I told the waiter, the manager was a total asshole and we probably wouldn't be back. Waiter was aghast at my candid remarks. Just keeping it real.   Our waiter was great, but forgot to get his name. White kid who rides a board. He was awesome. Very attentive and perky. Hoping he makes more money that el douche. This waiter was great.  Food and drinks were also great. Food wise, one of my best brunches in Vegas. Strongly suggest the Moscow Mule or Margarita. We had shrimp and corn salad and a steak and egg sandwich... Perfection.  We will be back, but I'm hoping to see a different attitude with the hostess/gm.  Would have given a 5...  But couldn't due to afore mentioned issue."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite spot! Had the fried calamari 5/5...steak frites, cooked perfectly 5/5...friendly and attentive staff. It's been hours since we left and I wish I could go back and order the exact same thing...and this time take a bite of my husbands perch burger."}
{"text":"I usually visit the Perch on Friday date night and Sunday morning for brunch! I absolutely love the Perch and NORA; the best bartender I've ever had! I whole heartedly enjoy their lettuce cups and Moscow mules  The perch is an awesome place to take anyone at anytime"}
{"text":"I had a rough experience immediately after eating here.. not because the food or service was bad, but because the servers are super generous with the Bottomless Mimosas/Bellineis/BloodyMarys. haha  FOOD: We came here for brunch and started right off with the Mimosas, Bellinis, and Bloody Mary's. The bartender and our server were very quick at refilling for us.. bottomless indeed! The Perch Burger was okay.. flavor was good, very simple, juicy patty, but could have used a fried egg in it. The Steak & Egg Tacos were delicious.. the avocado mouse gave it an interesting flavor.   AMBIANCE: A fun, lively vibe during brunch. It's located in a cool spot at Container Park that matches the overall atmosphere of the area.  SERVICE: Awesome staff! Everyone was welcoming and friendly. We didn't have a reservation and came in during a busy time.. the manager tried really hard to get us in as quickly as possible. Awesome!  TIPS: Definitely include the bottomless drinks but be careful, you might end up running straight into the casino afterwards and winning money without knowing it! haha :)"}
{"text":"Was initially concerned that this restaurant would be a bit too hipster-veggie for me upon seeing their scant menu. Turns out they're quite carnivore friendly and focus on doing a few things very well.  Had the hanger steak frites, with garlic aeoli. Turns out the garlic aeoli goes better on the STEAK than the frites (fries), truly enhancing the flavor. Once I figured this out, I was good to go and had a delicious time. The fries are lightly salted, crisp, and tasty.   The service is great. I love how brightly lit the space is with clean lines and the pink-lit shelves behind the bar. So glad there's another restaurant outside of barbecue and Mexican at the Container Park. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I love veggie burgers.  I have tried too many to count.  I have never had a veggie burger as good as the one at the Perch!  Yummy!  So good - and the fries were fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Stopped on for a quick drink... nice concept , very clean and great drinks for good prices '... also located in the interesting container park. Recommend to everyone going  to be down in that area"}
{"text":"So far, not a great start. Checked in. Gave them name and phone#. After 45 minutes, went back to find they marked us as no show. Not good. Pissed, more like it.  Okay, we are finally sitting at a table outside. The waiter was fantastic. We went for Sunday brunch and we started with the bacon flight and monkey bread. Fantastic! My wife had the Smothered Egg Biscuits and I had the Brioche French Toast. Incredible!! We also had some strange, devious and incredibly sneaky flight of shots that tasted like different breakfast tastes. I cannot find it on the web site. It is a shame because that was incredible. I was really ticked after waiting, then losing our spot but the food and the wait staff more than made up for it. It was such a treat. KUDOS for taking a potentially shit show and turn it into an incredible, experience."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the amount of 5 star reviews for this restaurant.  Neither the food nor atmosphere justify the prices  Items ordered Perch Burger and Hanger Steak Sandwich to share.  Hanger Steak Sandwich with frites, $16: 1/5. Meat was flavorless and chewy, fries (sorry frites) were undercooked, baguette was tough and chewy.  Aioli just tasted like yellow mayo.    Perch Burger with frites, $15: 3.5/5.  thick cut bacon, breaded fried green tomato, provolone, Chipotle mayo.  The burger meat itself was bland, but the toppings were all very good.  Fries were also undercooked.  Service: 2/5. And that's being generous."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It may be a little walk from Fremont Experience but worth it! I would recommend the Perch Burger! If you visit Vegas make this place one of your stops. The restaurant and the park are great!"}
{"text":"So happy that we ended up finding this place after searching for an open restaurant on a Wednesday night! Located in Container Park, on the second floor, Downtown Terrace was a good place to stop away from the business of Fremont Street. We were seated and served right away. I ordered ceviche as my main meal which came with a bunch of fresh chips and shrimp, jalapeño, tomato and onion. The dish was very reasonably priced, fresh and tasty. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, overlooking the stage in the park; I imagine it must be a fun place when there are performers.  Although I didn't partake, the restaurant had bottomless red and white wine for $16 dollars (definitely worth it if you plan on having more than 2 glasses).  Would definitely return to try the tuna tartare or beef carpaccio."}
{"text":"Excellent food using fresh ingredients and fun location in Container Park! Went with 3 girlfriends for dinner, and everybody's dish was amazing. Staff was friendly and gave excellent food and drink recommendations. We will definitely go back on our next trip."}
{"text":"The container park is an awesome place to visit in general. Family friendly and just cool. Lots of nice stores and a great feel. The Perch is up on top and you look out on it all. The service was good and the food was good too. A great breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My boyfriend and I were sitting at our table for 30 minutes before anyone even came to take our order and it wasn't even very busy. We ended up just leaving. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I was here last night. It was around 9:30pm and there was an event going on so I think it was a little busier than usual. First impressions, it was a nice \"hip\" place with the menus folded into napkin holders. It was super clean, modern designed. We were seated immediately and given ice water without having to ask. Great customer service, we had a great server. I forgot his name but he was always checking on us and making sure we were eating well. We ended up getting the Perch burger, which was amaaaazing. I loved it. I couldn't even finish it all so I took the rest home. Overall a great night. I recommend to a younger crowd since it was a little noisy."}
{"text":"Please YOU MUST GO HERE! The food was out of this world. We had the Salmon Our server was Kirby! Who was absolutely great. Kirby pointed us in the right direction in terms or ordering food. We had the salmon taratlis (sp?), the Bianca flat bread, and I cannot recall the salad name, and the mozzarella tomato app. Favorite was def the flatbread and the mozzarella. Both had impeccable flavor. My boyfriend did comment that the mozzarella was some of the freshest/best he has ever had.(he is a full blooded Italian from Port Chester NY)  Drinks were okay and I felt Iike they were smaller we had a Moscow mule and Royal Fir. But other then that it was great! Thank you Kirby for such great service! We will def be back"}
{"text":"First of all this place is AMAZING. The service from right when we walked through the door was so welcoming. RODNEY is the BEST server I've ever had downtown. We are here for brunch and the food is absolutely perfect and $15 Bellini, mimosas, and bloody marys. Plus you can inner change. Al around 5 starts for this place!"}
{"text":"Going to The Perch was by far the highlight of visiting the Container Park. The restaurant is popular destination, a little smaller, but has both indoor and outdoor seating. I went for brunch before the rest of the shopping opened. I enjoyed an omelette and bottomless mimosas at the bar seating. The bartender/ server was great and I would recommend a visit if you are in the area. It's about a 5-10 min walk from Fremont Experience. However, I was a little disappointed with the rest of the park."}
{"text":"This place has savory food, great presentation and drinks to go along with it. Good spot to visit on a weekend, I would probably uber there..Service is friendly and attentive but it is a busy spot, definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting the perch. This time it was the night before Valentine and the bartender was the the server and waiter as well. I wish I could remember his name as he was fantastic! We had a couple of beers and I had the chicken chimichurri which was to die for! We sat outside on the patio and they even turned in the heaters for us! We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and the service and food was impeccable! My partner I believe had the fried chicken sandwich which I had a bite of and it was yummmy! The couches outside might need a little of TLC abut that was my only negative. This spot is also great when they have performance in the stage in the park because it's patio is on the second floor overlooking the stage! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Great place . Went to Vegas and I was looking for a place and I'm happy I found this one . Food is unbelievable and Chef Marlin was very attentive . He even came to the table to check on me , that was amazing . I will continue coming to this place every time I'm in Vegas . Dante was my guy and he was spectacular with the service . Viva this Place . The best staff in Vegas ."}
{"text":"The chimichurri chicken sandwich is delicious and the bottomless wine Sun-Thurs is a steal. Great service and a really cute dining room, you have no idea you're in a shipping container!"}
{"text":"Stopped at The Perch Sunday evening for a drink and a little bite to nibble on. Our waiter was awesome. The food was great. They were out of a few things but that was to expected as they had just opened on Friday and we were told they had been busier than expected. We had one little concern and it was addressed by the manager Sarah who made it a point to come around to the tables and talk to everyone. We had such an enjoyable evening that we will definitely be stopping by there quite often."}
{"text":"Had the Bianca flatbread, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. Our server was also super nice and very knowledgeable. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok! Service was  terrible. She came over 3 times to get out order within 5 minutes of seating us we were sitting at a small high top and she didn't remove our plates until she picked up our paid check. Just let them piled in the middle of three table The server had a high pitched whiny voice that was like a pencil thru my eardrums!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place!!  Visited on my first time in downtown Vegas, and I will be back for sure!  The food is delicious and so reasonable!  You can get food and drinks that are truly amazing for less than half the price of what you would pay on the strip.  And the staff is wonderful.  So friendly and they make the experience so much fun!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had a deconstructed Blood Mary. Really good. When come in speak to Rodney and Nora at the Perch. They will hook you up. I like his place because it cozy and friendly.  Drinks are good. I learned some new ways to make a blood Mary."}
{"text":"Great find! Ambiance, food, service. Live music over dinner with wine and awesome fresh flavors. We are locals, this a cool spot and a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot and the service was the best i received while in Vegas. I went for Sunday brunch and my server was very attentive right away i was seated no wait! and given drinks which was great since it was 115 outside. The food was delicious and the portions were just right definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a little cafeteria-like; but it's in the container park downtown, so it's a vibe.  Our service was very friendly.  The tuna tartare did not taste fresh; that is my only complaint.  I had the spicy shrimp pasta which was wonderful, creamy and delicious with a very spicy kick.  The steak they placed down at the table next to us looked and smelled even more amazing.  I'll have that is I go back.  All in all great place, it's now called The Perch. What I loved most is that they happily served us even though we came in right before they closed; which is an asshole move you should never make unless you ask in a way that ensures the restaurant knows it is absolutely fine to refuse you service and tell you to take a hike! :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place after searching high and low for a bloody mary breakfast/brunch place. It was recommended by the restaurant across the street that did not have a liquor license. I would have definitely given this place 4-5 stars if the service wasn't so slow and they didn't run out of things. Someone in our party got a bottomless bloody mary for $15, had one and they ran out. After making a deal out of it, they took it off the bill. All that said, their mary and food were amazing. It's a foodie place that takes extra care to incorporate lots of flavor into everything. Entrees seemed more ala carte though, and portions are small. Might not be the best place for someone with a  big appetite. The atmosphere is open and airy. It was fun watching people build things out of the oversized legos downstairs."}
{"text":"Porch burger was good. Omelet was ok and they forgot to add cheese. Monkey bread was good. Yelp beer deal was nice. Hispanic Server was very sweet and attentive besides missing the cheese. Guy host/server had a hard time understanding the world. Not sure how he survives. I would come back but wouldn't make a special trip just for the food."}
{"text":"Good off the strip spot for brunch without the wait.  Well, still a wait, but pretty short and our group went down for a cocktail at Oak and Ivy they gave us a discount for.    My Beef hash was the best dish, chicken and Waffles had good chicken, but the waffle was a little soft and there was nothing to go with it like a veggie or fruit to be seen.  But $15 bottomless mimosas/bloody mary's is the proper way to start a vegas saturday."}
{"text":"Had the Perch burger with fried green tomato and chipotle mayo. So yummy! We also had the Terrace Salad with Roasted corn, cilantro, onions and heirloom tomatoes. Service was a little slow but it was worth the wait.  Located in The Container Park has lots of things to keep the kids occupied and also the adults."}
{"text":"Ordered beef tartare, hangar sandwich, angel hair, and juice. They were a bit slow in serving the angel hair. Wasn't a huge deal. Turns out they took it off our bill, took the drink off our bill, and gave us a complimentary belle flatbread and a complimenary torte cake. The food was pretty great too, for that matter."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here to have some lunch. The tuna tartare was delicious. We also had to chop salad which was just OK. The lettuce that they used was only OK quality. The vegetables could have had more variety. However the thick bacon was a bit much but good flavor, and the fruits that they used were delicious. We also had the hanger sandwich ordered medium, but was served well done. The dip that it came with made the sandwich much more savory.  If all The items on the menu were as good as the tuna tartare, it would have been five stars."}
{"text":"I came here tonight and I was pretty disappointed with the food and service.  I saw 4 stars on Yelp for this joint and was looking forward to a great meal, but unfortunately Perch did not deliver.  I came here with some friends and both of my friends had steak with salad and steak with fries. I had the poached egg bib salad with chicken.   I told the waitress to take off 2 things from the salad and I knew very well that there was no mention of any onions on the menu.  Well to my surprise when I got my salad there where onions on it. Unfortunately I can not eat onions, because I am allergic.  This ordeal would have been avoided if the menus were up to date.   In a nutshell I asked the waitress if she could have the salad remade and she did, but having to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get my food was not fun.  In all honesty it would have been great if at least half of my salad would have been taken off my bill.   This was a pretty obvious slip up for a place that supposedly offers 4 star food and service.   And another bad move on behalf of the staff is when I asked about the Riesling I was told that it was sweet when it was actually dry. In all honesty how can you not know your wines?  This was not what I expected from Perch and at this point if I come back it'll be a while.  There are a few important details that Perch has to work on before I could truly consider them a true 4 star joint.  For now based on the slow service, inaccuracy of their menu and high priced mediocre food I give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars...I was with a group of locals having a fun time.  My group was 86'd...I know when you read that you're thinking we earned it but that's not the case. We went for brunch and mimosas to celebrate my sister's birthday. The place is small and busy so it's far from quiet but apparently singing happy birthday is just too much to handle and we were asked to leave. We will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone. We spent hundreds of dollars at this place and they were serving bottomless mimosas. You can't expect quiet with that especially when a single group is the majority of your customers. There was no crude or explicit material and we were only kicked out after all our tabs had been paid. Convenient timing. One male and two females at the bar disapproved of a large group of friends having fun...it's a shame they didn't join us and decided to complain instead.     I would highly recommend going to Whist at The District for brunch, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Charming and great service. Favorable menu items that can be shared \"family style\".  I'm still talking about the roasted brussels sprouts.  I will definitely be a reoccurring patron. I will point out that the Seafood Pasta is very spicy."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday brunch yesterday and I enjoyed this place very much. The ambiance was great from the great natural lighting to the cute rustic decor. The bartender was also our server and he was great and friendly and so attentive. I definitely would recommend the steak sandwich that I ordered and they offered me an extra chipotle sauce that I loved for my spicy fix!"}
{"text":"Went with large group last week for a birthday and they were very accommodating. The service was prompt , the space is very cute and the prices quite reasonable. This is certainly a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I will definitely be back.   The cocktails were creative and generally pretty good and the beer and wine list had a nice selection for sure.   The food was sort of a mixed bag unfortunately but it was their first week so I'm definitely willing to cut them some slack. Hopefully my thoughts below will be somewhat constructive.   Small Plates: The Salmon Tiradito was great as were the Tuna Tartare and Beef Tartare. For the price I'd say the beef tartare is some of the best I've had in Vegas.   The crabcakes on the other hand were pretty wretched. It was hard to identify more than a shred of crab meat in them. It seemed they were composed almost entirely of a filler of some sort and they had the consistency of an undercooked biscuit. The seasonal pickles were similarly hard to enjoy as they were so salty they were basically inedible. They were clearly home-made so I'm hoping it was just a bad batch that no one in the kitchen actually tried this particular jar. It would be better to pull them from them menu for a week while a new batch was made than serve something this salty. The Beet Carpaccio was decent but the acidity of the lemon juice was a bit overpowering and it could have used something to balance it out.   Flat Breads:  The Belle was superb and the kitchen had taken the time to properly caramelize the onions which was very much appreciated and not often done. The Lucia was also very nice with a flavorful sausage on top and I'm not typically a big sausage fan. The Cecilia however was a bit of a miss for me. The seared tuna just didn't play well with the acidity of the capers, olives and tomato sauce.   Large Plates: The Hanger Steak Sandwich was a damn good sandwich. Cooked to temperature and smothered with their wonderful caramelized onions with a dollop of aioli. The grilled Salmon wasn't quite so hot. The fish itself was moist but the brussel sprouts a bit soggy and the flavors of the salsa didn't quite work with the fish or the vegetables.   All in all an enjoyable evening but I think they would be well served to scale down their menu. Right now there are just too many dishes that aren't working."}
{"text":"Would have eaten here but we sat for ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us and the when we ask for a waiter I heard him say he wot ajar care of the table that was just sat so find someone for us!!"}
{"text":"Josh was the man! The employees here are so friendly and all of their recommendations are perfect. The food was great, the atmosphere was classy, overall it was a dream. We had the Big Blue van beer , which was infused with blueberry, but very subtlety. As for the food, we went for the burger and the chopped salad. They have bottomless mimosas for $15, which is a steal!!   Will def return! Great food and drink and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"For the last several years I have Religiously come to the Downtown Terrace at the container park almost 2 to 4 times per month for its brunch. I sent hundreds of people there as a Referral. The \"Monkey Bread\" best on earth, the hash, chicken and waffles etc. were fantastic. Never understood why they never had brunch throughout the week to maximize there best food.      Well today one of my favorite places has change forever and for the worse.  instead of trying to renegotiate a better lease to cut costs and open for better hours or add a food truck to maximize profits. The owners stupidly have become a cost cutting disappointment, portions cut, food on paper and plastic and almost no staff. What a total shame best food in town killed by bad money management, followed by even more stupid decisions to try and fix it.  Hopefully the chef and recipes will pop up somewhere else."}
{"text":"After a fun evening of soaking in a bit of Vegas history at the Neon Museum, my friend and I decided we wanted to grab dinner at a nearby restaurant, so we headed towards container park and agreed to try Downtown Terrace. I had previously been to this location when it was named The Perch and I absolutely loved the food so I figured why not try it again. My only concern was that if they changed their name then they possibly changed owners, which therefore meant the food might've changed as well. Rest assured, that is certainly not the case. While they have a new name, they still have the same owners, same great service, and the same fantastic food that'll keep you coming back.  My friend and I decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks before our meal. Brandon was our bartender and I must say he was the just the absolute best. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The exceptional service he provided was simply above and beyond any bartender I've seen before. He checked on us often, brought us our food promptly, and made sure we were satisfied the entire evening. One thing that I noticed is if you're sitting at a bar and you order an alcoholic beverage as well as a water, most bartenders will only focus on getting you your next drink, even when your water goes empty. However, Brandon always made sure that my water was refilled which I truly appreciate. He seemed to understand that while I like to enjoy my drinks, I also like to pace myself with water to prevent a future hangover. Truly appreciate that attention to detail.  As for our meal, every item we ordered was delicious! We started off with the calamari and the ceviche as our appetizers. The calamari came with a jalapeño lemon sauce that was so good and the ceviche was very refreshing with just the perfect amount of lime juice. Definitely something I'd order again in the future. For our entrees, I tried the spicy shrimp penne pasta. Loved the flavor of this dish as the sauce was savory with just the perfect hint of spice. My friend had a turkey burger which was flavored so perfectly that he scarfed down every last bite of it. While we were tempted to order dessert, our tummy's were so pleasantly stuffed that we decided to pass on it this time, but made a mental note that next time we're in container park, we will gladly stop into Downtown Terrace again for another delicious meal with a sweet dessert at the end."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was blown away with the amount of fresh food. Top quality service and great environment. I feel like I should be paying more for the food I got. You can tell the food is fresh and not just produce that's been frozen for a month and thrown on a plate! I will be coming here every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sitting on terrace right now listening to live music! We are enjoying the tuna tartare! OMG delicious! Sharing a bottle of  Came for the Terrace salad! Husband ordered the grilled salmon over asparagus and brussel sprouts  Truly amazing! Everything was fresh and delicious! Service was outstanding!  Sitting outside and having amazing live music certainly is a plus"}
{"text":"I had the black and blue Burger, date of the perch Burger. both were good and tasty. Tried the chocolate torte after, but it tasted like a big brownie. Nothing remarkable about the bar except it's seating can get Limited. After eating, I found out they had a Yelp check-in bonus so be sure to do that before you order. They just started military discount, so I certainly will be back for happy hour for lunch to try another Burger."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Was seated and then forgot about.  No one came to take our orders or even offer water for over 20mins. Got up and left. How disappointing because it looked like a cool place. I wouldn't suggest people to come here."}
{"text":"Has mozzerla n tomatoes. Anf the tuna tartar starters wrre delicious. ..i the had the crab Louis salad, and was very happy l!!!  The beer magic hay heffenwiesen...excellent pairing for the vinagrettes in the starter and the salad"}
{"text":"Brunch spot located inside the container park in downtown Las Vegas.  We came on a Saturday afternoon. The first thing I noticed was how small the restaurant was then how noisy it was. The building is literally a container so the noise level was insane. I could barely hear my boyfriend who was sitting right next to me. I will say they had some rowdy brunchers in the restaurant but once they left the noise level was much more tolerable.  We did not have a reservation and waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Bottomless mimosas are available for $15 with a two hour limit. What I do like is they bring you a bottle a champagne and a carafe of orange juice to your table. You pour your own mimosas and they bring you more when you are done.  For my meal I had the chicken and waffles. It was the first time I had chicken with the bone served for this dish. The chicken was absolutely delicious.  The views from the restaurant were nice and the waitstaff were very friendly."}
{"text":"The terrace is a must to try. One of the best shrimp dishes I've had in a long time. Very fresh and super delicious. You will be craving for more!"}
{"text":"Our first time here at The Perch and their customer service and food is great!! I ordered the Perch burger and it was really delicious. The ambiance is really nice, they have indoor/outdoor seating. Great location as well"}
{"text":"So sad, the food used to be excellent. The menu has changed. No more seafood selections. Paper plates, plastic cups. I am spending this kind of money you can afford to give me a glass. Never brought me my beer or refilled my water. Don't tell me you were busy, there was only one other group of three people there. Such a sudden downturn for what was a gem."}
{"text":"The food might be okay, but we didn't get to the food because the service is non-existent.  Showed up at 11am on a Sunday morning, we were told our table would be ready in 30m and we'd get a text. 45m goes by, no text, we check back in person and was seated, but then waited at the table for 15m without being acknowledged by a waiter. Not exactly the casual experience expected of a container park restaurant.  We just ran out of patience for this, they're too busy for us, and our lives are too short for them. Oh well."}
{"text":"I had my 30th birthday party at the Perch today and it couldn't have been better. From the location, to the food, to the service, everything was so much more than I had ever hoped for. Bianca and Ryan were very accommodating and helpful! This will forever be one of my best birthday celebrations! A BIG thanks to the entire staff at the Perch for making this day even more special!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  We got there and after seating for 15 minutes without anyone coming to place our orders, we saw the (only) waitress available at the place, chatting with some people in another table as if there's no tomorrow.  We stood up and left."}
{"text":"I started coming to the Perch more frequently. They're always consistent. The Tuna Tartare, Chicken and Waffles, and Steak and Fries are the best! I also ordered a Bloody Mary with was one of the best I've had. Their service is awesome, and their employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"What a cute little place inside Container Park!  I went to The Perch with a few of my girlfriends from out of town to grab a drink and appetizers before dinner. We took a seat at the bar; I got the garlic aioli fries and a Bloody Mary.   The garlic aioli fries came out freshly fried; hot, crunchy, and very flavorful. Lots of garlic which I can't complain as I'm a huge fan of any food involved with heavy garlic. Delish!  The Bloody Mary was neat because you get to build your own. They give you a cup poured of any vodka you prefer, a decanter of tomato juice, a side of horseradish, hot sauce, and olives. What a fun and original concept to create a Bloody Mary to your liking at a restaurant... you don't get to do that every day!  Our bartender was very attentive to our needs, however, he didn't smile. It bothered me a little. I don't expect bartenders to be cheesing constantly, but try to look like you're enjoying your time working even a tiny bit...  Anyway, I give The Perch a 4/5. Will come back here next time I visit Container Park."}
{"text":"This place is expensive and overrated.  Where do people get off with 5 stars?  The container park theme is awful.  Looks llke downtown LA.  Complete with a screaming crazy street person out in front.  The grounds look dirty and cheap.    Prices were outrageous for what you got.  Will never go back there again.  Had some crab louie salad.  So they cut an avocado in 2, slop a brown looking ball of god knows what into the pit area, and set it on top of some butter leaf lettuce.  Easily the worst I have ever seen in this type of fare.  My little friend got who knows what, but even she was put off by the food.  It looked bad from my side of the table.    Maybe this is the best you can do downtown, but I can get excellent, and tasty, dinner entrees at places like the Venetian for about the same money.  Better ambiance too.  I don't give a crap if it is supposed to be a cool hipster dive.  It was an awful experience and the food was downright repulsive."}
{"text":"On our way to Reno, Raven and I decided to grab some food because the 7 hour drive ahead of us was going to require some energy to hold us till we arrive.   We traversed through out container park find long an adequate location. Hidden in rear by the stage, where live entertainment was kicking off and a family friendly atmosphere was surrounding us, on the second floor was a little place called Downtown Terrace. We came into the air conditioning to escape the heat since there was plenty of room. We sat by the window.   Raven ordered the Bruschetta and I the Steak and fries, rare with an Old Fashioned. The Bruschetta was refreshing and compliant-free. The steak, however, was the show stealer! Cooked to a perfect rare, it was so good! It was paired with these olive oil covered crispy fries. I would recommend this place 100%. The atmosphere was laid back and the music soothing and amendable to conversation."}
{"text":"Marlin and Brandon rock. Great food and excellent drink. Thank you so much for the great food, beverage, and hospitality. Would recommend highly."}
{"text":"My son ordered the steak tacos and I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon & chipotle mayo with a side of monkey bread to share. So good!  He gave the tacos a 9 out of 10 (only because he felt they were too small :D).  The breakfast sandwich was very good and filling.  Was served with roasted potatoes with onions & red bell peppers. Very filling.  Waitress was a doll and full of good tips."}
{"text":"Terrible service and very forgetful staff food took forever also didn't split the bills correctly after explaining twice we were sat outside and they rarely checked up on us"}
{"text":"Omg. Where do I start...the food was amazing. The drinks all u can drink mimosas..yummy.  Strong enough but not to where you can't enjoy it. And the services....amazing. Very impress on their customer services.  Everyone takes care of the tables. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. I was less than impress with the place. We were asked several times if we wanted something else besides water to drink. The brunch menu was limited. We had to settle on ordering dishes that weren't too interested because we didn't want to walk out.   We ordered the chorizo egg whites scramble  and the biscuits & gravy. The chorizo egg whites was greasy and bland. The chorizo tasted like regular sausage. The biscuit and gravy was extremely heavy. I was unable to finish the plate."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a fan of Downtown Las Vegas. I love the eclectic atmosphere and diversity.  The perch gives you all of it, lunch with good location, good view, and good drinks! The Egg Salad was really great, it isn't egg salad it is a salad with a poached egg on top. Butter lettuce, thick cut bacon, with a vinaigrette dressing. Yeah, very good. I also had the Fried Chicken Sandwich. Ingredients are fresh and tasty. Well prepared and you can tell they care about each dish... that's important to me. That the chef cares about what they put in front of you, even if it takes a couple of extra minutes of preparation.  The soups looked amazing and seemed extremely popular, maybe because it was a cooler December day. I will definitely try one next time."}
{"text":"Experience: Loved! A group of friends met to try this spot out. There were 8 of us ladies, and we sat outside for dinner.   Facility:  this restaurant is located in Container Park, so it's definitely small. It's in the back, close the stage, above the toy store. We sat outside on the patio, because it was an amazing night.  For those of you who get cold easily, they have heaters outside to keep the chill off.   Service: our waiter was Daniel, and he was awesome. He was patient, attentive and added a splash of humor without going over the top. The only part that I didn't like is when he brought the checks out when he thought we were done. This tends to signal the end of the night for some people, and they left after they paid. Just would have preferred him to wait until we asked for the check. Other than that...he was great!  Food:  I ordered the Brainless Raspberries beer on tap, which was pretty good. Not a fan of any sweet drinks, and this just had a hint of raspberries, not an overpowering taste of it.  A friend and I split a burger and flatbread, so we could taste both. So glad we did, because both were delicious!   Mine was the Burger and fries with Chipotle aioli. The burger was so good.  It had a fried green tomato on top too!  The aioli was perfect to dip the fries in with just the right amount of spicy.  Flatbread Bianca was really tasty. It had white cheeses with arugula and prosciutto on top. Crust was perfect too! A few ladies ordered the Salmon and roasted veggies, and it looked so good. I will get that next time.    Overall: Great service...great atmosphere...great food!  Definitely will be back. So far my favorite restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"Before this became the Downtown Terrace it was The Perch, while the food is still good the atmosphere has completely changed for the worse. It seems management went into full cost cutting mode and eliminated everything it could from the overhead. No more servers, bussers, hosts or even plates!   If you get bottomless anything you have to fight your way back through the line just to get a refill and with a two hour limit on the bottomless you may only get a couple of glasses before time is up.   Service is obviously non-existent and due to this the line for ordering can become extremely slow.   Bottom line: This place used to be great but then they decided to cut corners, the food is still decent but for the price there are plenty of better brunch options downtown. My advice to management: Don't be so cheap..."}
{"text":"Omg!!  A new favorite place!   When my friend and I arrived,  we were told there would be about a 20 minute wait...  The reason?  They had a large party and the kitchen was backed up....  I absolutely love this.   So much better to know I'm waiting for a table and will have great service,  than to order and wait a long time for your food..   And when we did sit down?  Great service and no long waits for food!!   I love honesty!!   So,  first the staff...  Amazing,  attentive, and super friendly.   Very personable.   It was like friends were waiting on you.   And the food?  Wow..  That's all I can say.   I had the salmon, and I've had plenty of good salmon in my life,  but this was amazing!  My friend had the steak and fries and devoured it,  it was that good.   Then,  dessert...   So my friend got the cheesecake and I got the creme brulee..  Even if I can't spell it,  lol,  I definitely ate it!  So good.   The cheesecake was frozen...  Now,  here's the cool part.   Before we could say anything,  our waiter came up and said he found out the cheesecake was frozen, and apologized.   And..  He offered to replace it with something else for free, AND give a to go container for the cheesecake!  We declined the additional dessert, and another person came to make sure we didn't want to take that offer.   Talk about service!!   Food was great,  but the staff made the entire experience amazing.   They were very impressive.   Before leaving they told me they do brunch on the weekends..  You will definitely see me there!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We kept things simple. My friend Ms. S and I visited for brunch around 11:30a on Black Friday and were seated immediately. We asked the waiter what the most popular dishes were and ordered two to share.   Chicken and Waffle - This was some of the crunchiest chicken I have ever encountered, which I appreciate. It had decent flavor and was very juicy. The dish comes already covered in maple syrup (although I asked for extra in advance) and dusted with powdered sugar. I love the taste to sweet chicken!!   Steak & Egg Tacos - these are certainly tiny considering the price. But they were delicious! The salsa really carried the flavor and the steak was tender and not overly chewy.   This place really did have awesome, friendly service. I'm sure we'll return soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I just can't say I love it.  The food is generally pretty good. I like that they have veg options so I don't have to majorly modify anything just to order. Today I had the power greens salad. It was really good. The dressing was really salty, but I like salty so I loved it. My meat eating friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. I had some of her fries and they were so-so...tasted like run of the mill, from a bag, previously frozen fries.  We got the free wine when we checked in. It was ok...not great but also not awful.  So here's my issue w this place...the staff is just rude. Last time I was there we came at night and missed the \"wait to be seated\" sign. We sat ourselves on the balcony. The waiter came over, told us the table wasn't clean/ready, and then told us they saved that particular table because of the view. Basically we weren't good enough to sit there. We left.   This time the bartender offered us a high top or the bar and then basically told us we couldn't have a table because they were saved for parties of 3 or more. Our party of 2 sat at the bar. Later we saw 2 guys get seated at a 4 top table. Whoopsie  Overall this place has a lot of potential and the food is decent, but the staff has a tendency to act like snobs for no particular reason."}
{"text":"I recently came here on that late night snack mode with a couple girl friends. This place is pretty small so I recommend coming here off of peak hours. The view however is amazing. You can catch the nightly entertainment at container park or just spectate the side show that is downtown Las Vegas.   Food wise I only tried the ahi poke, but I must say it was quite delicious. The other food my friends got looked pretty good too. Ah and can't forget the drinks! I had the green tea martini. It seemed like a cool concept, but it ended up tasting more like sour pucker than green tea. I did enjoy the free glass of wine for my yelp check in though!   Overall a fun trendy spot to check out. I'd love to go back again to sample more of the main dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  My friends and I came here yesterday to celebrate our friends 21st birthday.   On Sunday, they have brunch with bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's and bellinis. I personally had the bottomless bloody Mary's and the shortrib country hash with a side of bacon.   The bloody Mary's are nice and spicy, and were definitely not lacking in alcohol. Our server was really friendly. He has on French fry socks and for some reason was holding onto a few children's books. He was very entertaining and made sure we were well taken care of.  The shortrib hash was really good. It has sautéed mushrooms, peppers, the short rib and nice crispy potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon and it was thick and crispy. Which to me makes perfect bacon.  However. My absolute favorite thing here is the monkey bread. By far the best monkey bread I have ever had and everyone should order it. You would definitely not regret it.   There is a lot of parking near this location, but it is all paid parking, so be aware that it will cost $3-6 depending on how long you eat and want to shop around   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We come here often for drinks and snacks! Fries are great. Love the bruschetta. Had the burger before- great! LOVE the hefeweizen they have on tap. Not sure of the name but I get it every time. Always have had excellent service. Friendly servers and great location at the container park!"}
{"text":"Creative food in a fun retro atmosphere. Went here with my parents for a late lunch while checking out Container Park. We had the beet carpaccio, the grilled corn and shrimp salad (I think it might've been called the \"Terrace\"), the steak sandwich, and the french fries. The sandwich was delicious, as was the salad. The carpaccio beets were great quality, but served raw, which I didn't love - would've been better if they had been allowed to marinate in the vinaigrette for a little while. Great idea, though, something I would potentially make and serve. The fries were great quality and perfectly cooked. They seemed to be cooked in some kind of animal fat, likely pork. I prefer vegetable oil for fries, but my dining companions seemed to enjoy them very much. My dad had a salad called \"The egg\", which came with a poached egg and thick-cut bacon. He seemed to enjoy it. I stole a few pieces of bacon, which was tasty.  All in all, tasty food, warm and respectful service, and fun setting. I recommend The Perch!"}
{"text":"When we arrived just before noon, we asked to sit at a 4-top outside on the patio and were told by the GM that they preferred to hold that table for a larger group as we only had two in our party.  This was a bit off-putting but we didn't argue and sat inside.  It took quite a long time for the waiter to take our order and another 40 minutes to get our food.  In that time, the patio table we had originally requested remained empty.  When we inquired into our food, the waiter told us they had a small kitchen and two large tables sat down at the same time we did.  Owner of The Perch - a problem on your part shouldn't constitute a problem on your patrons and a kitchen that can't accommodate a half full restaurant is a problem.  When we were ready to pay our bill, we finally had to go up to the counter and find the waiter as, even though we had our credit cards clearly sitting on the table showing our readiness to pay, he kept walking by.  I will say, one good point was my food, the steak and egg tacos, were quite good and the waiter did give us a 25% discount for the slow kitchen service and GM refusing to sit us where we requested."}
{"text":"wow the food was amazing! I ordered the egg sandwich with steak added on it and it was great. it came with home made fries that were perfectly fried and tasty.  the hostess at eat. across the street from here was super rude to us so we came here"}
{"text":"The Perch is definitely a breath of fresh air for Vegas.  There really aren't a lot of bottomless brunches in Las Vegas unless you do a nasty hotel buffet. Perch is located in Container Park near downtown.  The décor is simple and the restaurant has a great view.  Make sure to make a reservation on the weekends because the place gets packed. I went with a group of ten people and everyone loved their food.  I had the chicken chimichurri sandwich and it was delicious!  Just enough sauce and spice.  The French fries were seasoned to perfection and crispy. Hubby got the chicken n waffles...the waffle was to die for!  Now for the best part- $15 bottomless bloody marys, bellinis and mimosas!  The bloody mary was spicy and not too filling.  The bellinis, made with peach juice, champagne and peach schnapps were a nice change from just the basic mimosa.  I can't remember our server's name, I wrote it down in my notes on the Yelp app, but somehow lost it (she had short blonde hair).  She was amazing!  She kept the bottle of champagne flowing and even split our checks at the end.  Can't wait to go back here on our next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"On Sunday March 5th, 2017 I brought my family in to The Downtown Terrace after a friend of mine referred it as a great place to have brunch with my family.   It was the WORST EXPERIENCE that I subjected my family too.   There was a female bartender with purple hair and tattoos on her face that kept using profanity across the Resturant and yelling at that poor innocent blonde girl with the tattoos on her arms. I felt really bad for her that she has to be subjected to such a work environment. I watched it go on for awhile as she kept getting bullied. I don't know if that's her manager or what, But a person should NEVER be treated like that.   We didn't mind the long wait to be seated, since the place was super packed and it's expected anywhere on a Sunday. But after we ordered our food, it seemed like a decade before we got our food and it wasn't hot and felt like it had been sitting out for awhile. The next day I went to go talk to the General Manager and explain what happened. Before I knew it, he started threatening me to beat me up cause he said he was from the streets and that's how he handles things. I can't believe that company would hire such a person that acts like that to paying customers and to be put in that position to deal with the public.   Let's just say that I will never be visiting that place again and will tell everyone I know and all social media that is attached to that place how horrible of a place it is.  I feel really bad for Mr. Hsieh for having such people represent him like that and for Downtown Project."}
{"text":"Incredible location. Outstanding service from our bartender Stefan. Good food and bottomless Bloody Mary's? Oh, we'll be back and certainly recommending to friends that visit downtown.   Had to take away one star because the Bloody Mary mix left much to be desired. To be fair, my wife and I have spent a lot of time in the capital city of bloodys (Wisconsin) and have very high standards for our favorite hangover cure."}
{"text":"Everyone is so hospitable here. Love this joint!  Every little place inside container park has its own unique perks.   The perch is a really cute date spot if you're looking for something cute & fun! They have a bar and all their food looks super tasty. Make sure to make reservations on weekends because they get busy! I recommend sitting outside because it's right by the stage where they have mini concerts :-)  When we first walked in, we were super confused on what to do. After a minute, someone greeted us & asked if we had reservations. We didn't, but they accommodated us quickly and found us a table inside. I wanted to sit outside, but we didn't have reservations so I didn't want to be complicated. They walked us to a table & we sat there waiting for menus. Little did we know, they were folded around the napkins! lol  Anyway, everything was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the Chimi Chicken Sandwich and I ordered the Hangar Steak Sandwich. We also had an order of fries on the side (not knowing my sandwich came with fries.) The chicken sandwich comes with quac and chips which definitely beats chipotle's dumb overpriced guac. Dumb guac!!!!!! Both sandwiches were very flavorful, but I felt that the fries needed more seasoning. We had to add a bunch of salt & pepper onto ours.  4 stars because the food took reaaaaaally long to come out, but everything was worth the wait.  Total came out to $34.59 -- Not too shabby!   Love it here, will come back to try their cocktails :-)"}
{"text":"The food was good. I really enjoyed the fact that management and staff are very down to earth and are checking to see how their customers are doing. It's a very nice spot located in the container park. Nice place for brunch! I recommend the perch burger!"}
{"text":"Strolled in at 1 p.m. for brunch on a Saturday. Asked for a 4 top outside. No problem, they said. Take a seat at the bar and grab a drink while we flip the table, they said. Ordered a round - a bloody mary and three beers. Will be just a second, they said. Ten minutes pass and it's just effing chaotic inside. Servers are bringing plates out from every orifice of the tiny cube, the bartender hasn't been able to pass us even three beers, the executive chef is bussing tables... nearly 30 minutes pass and we finally get the table. Be right with you, they said. But, they never were. More than 10 minutes passed and we didn't have waters, menus or any attention. We got up and left. We were having communication problems, they said.  You think?"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant--welcome to the neighborhood!! Lots of farm fresh options, hangar steak was delicious. Will definitely be back to explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Wandered in (after a meeting, somewhat hungover) after wanting to try this place for a couple of weeks now. It definitely did the trick in curing my Monday Blues! The bartender was incredibly patient with my indecisiveness and let me take my time while maintaining good conversation with me and the other two patrons present. I'm a sucker for good customer service, which I get the most of in DTLV. Ordered a light draft, the Margherita flatbread & a SmartWater. Delicious food, although there was slightly too much sauce on the flatbread. The atmosphere more than made up for that very minor flaw. And the beer (can't remember the name, but it's light with \"1776\" in the title) was a hit as well. I can't wait to come back. They're doing pretty much everything right!"}
{"text":"Review based on a recent Sunday brunch visit.   Located in the far right corner of Container Park, The Perch sits on the 2nd floor overlooking the park & some of Downtown. It is a well lit, quaint little place to have a casual meal. We were sat right away at a community style table. My party consisted of the three of us, myself included.  The special going on was bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, & bellinis for a decent price.   What we ordered: -  chicken & waffles -  steak & egg tacos -  chorizo plate  I had the chicken and waffles. I was a bit put off by the amount of syrup they had poured on the waffle.. had I known that they do that- I would have asked to have the syrup separate because I am not a huge fan of having a lot of syrup on my waffle .. the fried chicken was crispy & somewhat flavorful. It just felt a bit lacking. It was just ok. There was a lot of chicken pieces though and the waffle was also prettty big. I probably wouldn't order this dish again though.  My friend told me the tortillas on her steak and egg tacos were straight up cold. And cracking - which means they weren't even warmed up or cooked properly.. she asked our waiter to rectify the situation & he kindly gave her a new plate. She also thought the dish could have been better.  As for the chorizo plate, it seemed to be a winner. A hefty portion and very filling.  The prices aren't too bad. Though personally, I would go somewhere else for brunch. The perch seems like a good place for lunch or dinner .. hoping to come back to try out those dishes.  Our waiter was very polite and kind, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"On my first (so far) visit to the container park, I took a change and brought my out of town guests to the Perch for a late afternoon Sunday dinner.  The service was excellent, the setting on a balmy afternoon into evening (with doors open) was very relaxed and comfortable, and the food was excellent.   I will be back and will encourage my local and visiting friends to do the same! Three of us shared the olive tampanade and fresh mozzarella starters...simple and delicious.   I had the salmon served over brussel sprouts and asparagus...perfectly cooked to my requested 'done' temperature, very fresh, and very tasty...although the sauce... which I had had on the side...has a kick to it!   My guests enjoyed their entrees, not a scrap left on the plates...again a testimony to perfect portion sizes.    The two deserts we 'shared' were scrumptious...the poached pears in a ricotta 'pudding' tasted amazing, but I snarfed down the hazelnut flourless chocolate torte with fresh whipped cream...  I am looking forward to the next time I get over to that side of town!  Go.  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were so good I'm going to tell everyone about them. The crunch on the chicken is perfect. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe here! I love how you can eat and go play in the yard. The food is good, the mimosas were flowing and the employees were so helpful. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ordered the chimchurri chicken sandwich and told our waiter we'd be sharing it, friend ordered steak for himself.  Waited about 40 minutes for us to get our food and we weren't really sure why.  We were quite disappointed with the wait but once we did get our food we saw our waiter had split our sandwich and gave us both full orders of fries - SO nice of him, we were very appreciative.  It was VERY delicious, fries were very good too. I almost wrote my review right then because I was very impressed that 1) he split our food without asking and 2) the food was phenomenal.   But then, we waited another 30 minutes to get our check. There were two bartenders not helping the seated tables at all while 4 tables sat empty and a mess with dirty dishes begging to be bussed. I felt bad for our waiter as we stared at these bartenders dancing and wiping wet empty glasses behind the bar while only 2 people sat at the bar themselves. I stared at one of them, hoping he'd realize our plates were empty and we were obviously waiting for our check. He didn't seem to notice or bother.   I really don't blame our waiter; he seemed to be the only one really helping those not at the bar. Just kinda disappointed and hope this place gets things on track because aside from my grievances, it's prime location with delicious chicken.   Also, bartenders, you won't ever help the company you work for nor yourselves with the mentality of \"that's not my job so I'll wait for someone else to do it\"."}
{"text":"Had amazing brunch! Very accommodating staff! Really cool environment, with great decor! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Looooooove going to the Container Park in downtown, and this little cozy restaurant/lounge is located within the park. Stopped by for some food around 9pm and there wasn't many people around. We ordered fries with garlic aioli, beef tartare, power green salad, terrace salad, mushroom flatbread and salmon tiradito (omg that's a lot of food even for four people haha)! Food was very good, I love loved the terrace salad as well as the power green salad. There was nothing special about the fries even though the garlic aioli was amazing! Personally I'm not a huge fan for raw food so I didn't enjoy the beef tartare or the salmon tiradito, but my friends loved them! Service here was decent, it took a little bit before our waiter showed up at the beginning but after that, everyone was very attentive. They constantly came by to check on how everything's going and filled our water. Oh! Did I mention that there was a live band playing downstairs as well? So there was a nice view, good music and delicious food. Definitely will be back soon and try some of other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The cutest restaurant at the container park! Went there for lunch and the food was amazing. I went with the burger, but honestly everything on their menu looked yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been about 5 times now I don't know why I've never written a review. The food and the ambiance are wonderful! Especially this time of year out on the deck with a cocktail!  I had the carpaccio, hanger steak sandwich, the terrace salad oh and the monkey bread on the weekends. I've had other things to and everything is so so so good. Try the carpaccio you will love it and the hanger steak sandwich is so yum!!!! The container park is a cool area. Great way to spend an afternoon and grab some amazing food!"}
{"text":"We came during a fairly busy time on a Saturday evening, and we still received fast and very courteous service from Brandon at the bar, where we also ordered our food.  The shrimp shared plates are amazing, can't wait to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Service was a tad slow but thats ok. The burger more than made up for it. This place is cool, nice views and great food. I would definitely check it out when on Fremont Street"}
{"text":"Just went here a few hours ago and my overall impression was that the food was worth the wait. Seemed pretty busy when I went and servers seemed pretty preoccupied with working in general. Although when I needed stuff they were on it.   Once we got our food it made up for the 30 min wait after ordering. Perch Burger is BOMB! Def check this place out as well as Container Park as a whole."}
{"text":"Great food...... very chill environment and very friendly bar staff!  Would highly recommend it to people looking for something casual and intimate"}
{"text":"First, upon first check in you get either a FREE 4 oz wine or 6oz beer. VERY COOL!  Fantastic service from the start. Stefan was rad, professional and friendly. Met Ryan who is the general manager and he was awesome as well. My friend and I enjoyed the meals we had. I got the egg sandwich with steak. It was really good. Comes with seasoned potatoes. I would say they need to cut the steak differently since its in a sandwich but it was cooked PERFECTLY. My friend had the French toast and she loved it. Great experience and we will be returning...they also have a $15 all you can drink mimosas...YES!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very chick, modern little place downtown LV .... Love the open space and the food is absolutely good!!!! Don't miss out on the pasta with currants, anchovy almond dish, it's really good"}
{"text":"Wandered in here looking for some vegetables (Vegas food seems to be lacking!) and were not disappointed.  Ordered their lardon salad (forget the actual name) and couldn't have been happier - beautiful greens, with thick cut bacon, a poached egg and a champagne vinaigrette - added the chicken (dry) which was unnecessary. Portion was not over the top, but satisfying. We also ordered another salad with corn, avocado, and shrimp which was equally delicious. The chicken lettuce wraps were good, but would have been better if the chicken wasn't so dry."}
{"text":"We heard container park was a fun place to visit. As locals for over 20 years it was refreshing to see the improvements to downtown   We were pleasantly surprised to find The Perch restaurant too.  It looked pretty busy and the menu items were interesting so we gave it a try. Everything was really good and enjoyed our meal.  The most impressive things was how the manager was so observant and accommodating.... The wait staff was really busy and it was refreshing to see how in tune the manager was in making sure everyone was taken care of and actually waited on tables to assure a good experience. We will definitely be back at The Perch next time we visit downtown."}
{"text":"Okay first....being a local in Vegas makes this a valid review lol. I don't always rely on these reviews regarding food because everyone's pallet is different and there's always that one person who has to find something wrong -_- ALSO THERE WAS A PARTY OF 8-10 PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS THAT WERE ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY WERE SOOOOO LOUD WHICH PRETTY MUCH RUINED OTHER CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE AND  EVERYONE COMPLAINED BECAUSE OF THEM. -_- despite THOSE people the review must go on :-)  After being to pretty much every brunch in Vegas now my wife and I will start writing reviews. The food is fresh and freakin delicious. Bottomless mimosas for $15? Perfect and it lasts until 3pm. Service is important to us so the hostess as well as our server were so cool! The ambiance is super dope. although we would love to eat outside, the heat would burn every hair on our heads off but I'm sure in the fall or spring this place would be great for an outdoor brunch!   Meals:   Breakfast sandwich with chorizo is FIRE (Fire=really good) Steak and egg tacos bomb (bomb=good but not FIRE) Breakfast sandwich with bacon is FIRE (see definition above)   Hostess - Tyler....great guy from Youngstown Ohio Server/bartender- Josh....great guy and he was our camera man! (He knows the angle matters)"}
{"text":"I came in on a Thursday, so perhaps it was the B team working that night.  Ordered a steak, mid-rare, and it came out medium well.  When I mentioned something the server was very helpful and upon first glance at the steak agreed it was way over done.  The replacement arrived, only this time the steak was black and blue (raw).  The server again saw the steak and agreed and struck it from my bill.  If it weren't for the server this would definitely be a 1 or 2 star review.  Wish I could remember his name."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was awful. Will never return. Was largely ignored by wait staff. Times were absurd, place was barely packed and the staff just stood around chatting. I'd rather eat at a McDonald's and get diabetes"}
{"text":"Very nice, light and open. Went earlier in the day so service was quick. Not too pricey for being in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to this place two weeks ago in Vegas after a crazy night of partying with friends who were still sleeping in. I needed food and this place is a must for brunch! Very modern inside with the interior and exterior. Since this place is in the container park I had no clue what the history was behind the place and asked the manager who have me brief history. He was very helpful and you could ask him anything about the restaurant and Vegas in general. Haha   I forgot the name of the plate I ordered but every thing on the plate melts in your mouth. Very fresh, organic, and quality of the food is excellent. Not disappointed. I forgot to mention the bar they had inside is unique. The Bloody Mary was pretty strong and had a good kick to somewhat ease the hangover.  Overall I had a good experience with the food and service. Come try out The Perch with the unique menu items, drinks, sunny weather, and good music they have to offer!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.   It is located in the container park in the back right on the second floor. We sat outside so we were able to people watch which is always entertaining. They have water spritzers to keep the area cool in the summer.   I felt the food was a tad over priced. We ordered two flatbreads and a couple other things. It tasted good but nothing amazing that I would go back for.   The drinks were the part that I enjoyed. I had a glass of wine but I did see some cocktails I would like to try in the future.  My uncle ordered a bloody mary and it was served as a build your own bloody mary station. It had the alcohol, tomato juice and different toppings separated so you could make it as you see fit. I thought it was really awesome and would try that if I came back.   I feel like if I was to come here again I would just come for drinks and eat dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was lunch time and I wanted to take my co workers out for a lunch to award them for all their hard work and dedication. I picked Perch based off reviews etc. I talked it up the whole way there, telling them it was going to be a great experience.....well thanks a lot \"The Perch\" you made me look like an idiot to my coworkers. First the food took FOREVER to arrive....55 minutes. You would have thought the waitress would have brought free appetizers or something, but nope. We  had to sit there awkwardly for 55 minutes trying to think of things to discuss, the best discussion we had was concerning odd placed piercings etc... The place had 3 waiters for like 10 tables, but yet couldn't keep our drinks full. Food was ok, not worth $20 a person and an hour wait. The rest of the day my coworkers were not efficient at their jobs as they didn't get satisfied during lunch.... all they could talk about was the long wait at the Perch, and how MTO and Public Us were so much better. Needless to say they won't ever trust my judgement of picking a lunch spot again."}
{"text":"We came here and it took 40 minutes from the time we ordered our food to when we decided we didn't want it anymore due to the long wait. Two different tables walked in after us and got their food before we did. We ordered a Bruschetta appetizer and a steak sandwich medium rare. Very unorganized and short staffed. Michael the bartender was very rude. Not only did it take asking 2 different people and 20 mins to get one 4 oz beer but they brought plates and silverware after we ate our app. After we told Michael to forget the order and just bring our bill for the bruschetta and drinks he rudely remarked \"it was because we ordered an appetizer that it took so long for our food?\" Lol then took his sweet time getting our bill and ended up having to go inside to pay. Over all BAD experience and would not ever recommend this too place to anyone!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the staff and service are five stars!!!! The bad reviews about the group being 86d was brought upon themselves. The atmosphere is amazing and the food for brunch is a force to be reckoned with. I highly recommend the smothered biscuits, and get the bottomless drinks. Just disregard the bad reviews they came from people who can't handle themselves after a few drinks"}
{"text":"Can You Hear Me Now?  Met with my good girlfriend here this afternoon for a little brunch and girl talk. Thank goodness for outdoor seating because indoors is \"extremely\" loud. I found it kind of odd that the server even shared her frustration about how loud it was inside while seating us outdoors.   We Ordered: Monkey Bread $6 (DELISH nice gooey & sweet) Fruit Plate $8 (Satisfying portion size of seasonal fruit) Egg White Omelette $10   **Shrimp & Grits $15 I appreciate the chefs creativity with the panko grit balls however they were terrible and left a gritty residue in my mouth. I found it odd the shrimps weren't sautéed either. The shrimp cocktail on top of salad was not satisfying and I'm pretty disappointed by this dish.  Bottle of Aqua Panna  **(1) Cup of Coffee the Sugar never made it to the table!   We requested Cholula hot sauce to spruce up the shrimp & grits and the server showed up with Tabasco at the end of the meal. DEFINITELY A SERVICE FAILURE.   I was completely okay with paid parking until walking back to my vehicle from a dissatisfying lunch.  Not likely to return although the Calamari looks epic from the shared YELP photos."}
{"text":"So, we happened across the Downtown Terrace trying to escape the madness of the strip on a Saturday morning.  What a fabulous find!  We were treated to some very interesting brunch choices.  We had their spin on shrimp and grits, a corn salad with shrimp and chimichurri, and a shortrib hash.  We also split an order of their monkey bread between four of us.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and well prepared.  We will be back on our next trip into Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great light bite with friendly service. It's definitely worth checking out.. It is in a place called, Container Park. Cool concept park with a tree house that turns into an adult play area. Next to the Fremont Experience. Downtown LV."}
{"text":"Cruising the Container Park and decided we could use a beverage.  So we climbed the stairs to check out The Perch.  When we checked out the menu, we decided to have a late lunch - which was really pretty fabulous:  Fried Green Tomatoes done with light corn meal and a tasty side sauce - we ordered a double, because...  well, because we were so excited to have them!  Tuna Tartar with mango and avocado was as lovely as it was tasty, served with a side of crisp crackers.  And hand cut Fries, plenty to share.  Sis had a hard iced tea and proclaimed it perfect - I had a soft lemonade and was happy, too.  We enjoyed our impromptu lunch on the deck, overlooking the rest of the park.  Inside there were also tables and air conditioning and a beautiful full bar.  Service was quick and super nice - definitely check out The Perch!"}
{"text":"Saw an enticing pic of their chicken and waffles that made me want to check this place out. We had their bacon flight, perch burger, shrimp and grits and a side of scrambled eggs. All the food was good AF!! Cool idea on the bacon flights and to take it to another level, I would do a bigger thicker slice of bacon. For 6 bucks, I could have made that at home (still delicious though). I had te burger protein style and it was perfectly cooked (medium rare). Great flavor with the chipotle mayo which is freshly made and the fried green tomato is a great addition. It seemed like they were understaffed today and that didn't slow them down one bit. having the chefs come out to serve and bus tables was a testament to how cohesive they all are as a team. I definitely plan to come back and have more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"My husband came down to grab a drink and we decided to grab a quick lil bite before my daughter's choir concert at LVA and can I just say what great food and amazing service we got. My husband could not stop talking about how amazing Brandon, the bartender was on his knowledge of beer and just really friendly!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our casual dinner here, overlooking live music at Container Park. Great service, great food, great beer."}
{"text":"Two friends and I dined at The Perch on November 20th, mid-afternoon. Although this wasn't my first experience at the The Perch, it will likely be my last.  Upon entering the restaurant, the staff seemed reluctant to sit us outside. It was twice suggested that we just dine at the bar. If outdoor seating was unavailable, then sure - but we were eventually sat at a booth outside.   Wait staff was inconsistent and confused. Being a pescatarian, I ordered the shrimp salad and a side of fries. I was delivered a cobb salad with bacon. Not realizing our second waiter had put the order in incorrectly, I took a few bites.   I would've told either of the random assortment of waiters \"tending\" to us, of the mistake and requested a replacement, but there wasn't follow up until it was time for us to pay the bill. I actually had to ask that he remove the item from our receipt...like I would've paid for a salad, with meat, that I couldn't eat?!   This place is cute, but not cute enough. Food on previous visits has been decent. Try Vegenation, Simply Pure, Glutton, or Therapy for quality downtown dining."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour so all the \"sharing\" portions were 2 for 1 as well as their cocktails. Our server Abra was an absolute professional.  She knew in detail each of the appetizers we inquired about.  Her service was exceptional.  Being in the service industry for over 20 years, it is something I always recognize and appreciate.  Kudos to the chef as well.... the food was not only delicious but the presentation was phenomenal.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The staff was really nice and kept conversation going when refilling our drinks. I got the chicken sandwich which was amazing!! :) and it comes with their hand cut fries. Overall it was great the only downfall was how long we had to wait for our food. Will be back though"}
{"text":"The food is honestly 4 stars, which is very good in my book.  The 5th star however, is for the service.    On one occasion when we dined here, I asked if their OJ was fresh squeezed and I was told it is not.  This is a very common instance in which I say no thanks and life goes on.    Halfway through the meal, she brings me a tall glass of OJ.  They were a bit slow as it was the middle of the day, so they made some fresh squeezed for me.  Way above and beyond, especially since service was top notch otherwise as well.  Great burgers.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour for food! I went to this place first when it was called the perch and I was so sad when I saw the place was now downtown terrace until I realized that the menu was the same and only the name changed (phew!). There's a ton of appetizers that are half off or super cheap on happy hour! I absolutely love the tuna tartar. I would come back for that alone! Also the Bianco flatbread was so amazing! Those two dishes are crave-worthy and are both on the happy hour! Other than those I've tried the calamari, lettuce cups, and chicken sandwich. All delicious!   This is one of those kinds of places where you can't go wrong, food wise. Service was also great but I've only been when it's slow so I'm sure going to brunch is a little more hectic there."}
{"text":"The location is nice, in the container park, but it was difficult to find with no clear signage. The food was OK. A very basic selection of burgers and salads. I was disappointed when my order came out with cold fries, but they did redo them for me. I was out with a group and the service was very very slow, so maybe this is not the best place for a group of friends. They use angus beef in their burgers so that was tasty. Overall it was a new place to try, but I probably wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"The perch was super cute! Located inside container park towards the back. Came around 9pm and it was pretty packed on a Friday! We got the most perfect seat on the balcony outside.   The service was great! I forgot our servers name but he did an amazing job. He filled our waters and honored our Yelp check ins.  The food was delicious. The salmon&asparagus was cooked to perfection, my chicken fingers & fries were bomb, and the tuna tartar was perfect! Our drinks however were disgusting... We ordered the green tea martinis which was literally watered down lemon lime juice with rubbing alcohol in it. Their beers on tap however are amazing, and their wine!   The prices were standard hipster food... Very reasonable. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit but it won't be my last!  I had been seeing the Facebook ads for sometime.  A friend went and loved the food.  Our waiter was Miguel and he was absolutely the bombdiggity!  Very attentive and super personable!  I want to go back just because he took such good care of us.  The food was delish!  I had the chicken and waffle with the creme brulee and the endless bellini's.  Great for brunch and kid-friendly!"}
{"text":"In the first 10 days they've been open, we've been here for both lunch and dinner. It's been difficult to convince my husband to come to dinner in the Container Park in the past, but I don't think I'll have that problem any more!  I'd suggest sitting outside. It's cooled down enough that it's fine as long as you have an umbrella, and you'll get the background music of the stage without the clamor of other diners that one of the other reviews mentioned. Just don't sit at the couches unless you're planning to only have appetizers/desserts and drinks. The tables are too short for entrees.  Food: The potato puree that came with my husband's beef carpaccio was so good that he, literally, created a wall of drinking glasses to prevent me from taking bites of it. His chicken paillard was good, but not great. I've had salads both times, the Onassis the first time (great big slab of feta!) and the Perch the second time. The Perch was good, but I liked the Onassis better.   Service: We've had incredibly attentive service both times, and making reservations with Yelp's service is really easy. When we went for lunch on Saturday, we met friends, and my Perch salad came out after their entrees, so our waitress comped my gin fizz. It wasn't a significant delay, but it was long enough to order and receive the drink, so it was very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever! Can't beat exceptional service paired with bottomless drinks. The Surf & Turf Chimichanga was HUGE and on point. Their twist on chicken and waffles made them easily the best I've ever had. Monkey bread... Bloody Mary's... This girl was in brunch heaven!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Easy access to get in from the side street than from the main entrance if you're at least 21"}
{"text":"I was very pleased by this place. I went for brunch with two others... omg the bottomless mimosas!!! The server ( whom was awesome and a cutie by the way) brings out an entire bottle of champagne at a time along with a bottle of OJ. Bottomless indeed!! The food was heavenly. I ordered chicken and waffles which may have been my favorite ever. The tastes combined still sits on my taste buds and I'm in fear that I won't venture off to try anything else because I'm so addicted to that one dish. I had some of what someone else in my party had ordered and I can't even remember what it was. I will be returning for more brunch dates and I would love to see what it looks like at night.  Highly recommended if you haven't been!!"}
{"text":"Excellant food and service. Trendy and a level of service thats amazing. Thanks Mike. High above the container park giving a birds eye view.  Oh yes, try the cheesecake. Its to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The bartender Brandon Walker was very friendly. He was able to accommodate every guest during a busy time of night. He suggested the spicy shrimp pasta and it was delicious. We will definitely come back because of Brandon!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful setting in the Las Vegas Downtown Container Park. Had the chicken and waffles, excellent! Service was great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Have to get the bottom less Mimosas and Bellinis. Marlin is a great chef and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"We found The Perch by accident and can't wait to go back. Perfect size portions for sharing. Loved the crab cake and shrimp flat bread. The build your own Bloody Mary was both brilliant and delicious. It's refreshing to have a new place to frequent."}
{"text":"Went to Perch during Family Movie Night. They were very accommodating of our large group including a couple of small children. We eventually moved outside to see the movie. Couldn't miss the Truffle Shuffle of Goonies, come on that's classic.  Onto the food...who am I kidding. I drank a bunch of Moscow Mules that were fantastic with impressively fresh mint. I twisted my friends arms to drink them with me. Then we split up some gorgeous tomatoes and mozzarella and a wonderful tuna tostada that was brilliantly highlighted with a spicy mayo of sorts to keep my tuna from sliding away.  Perch takes al fresco dining to another level. At night dining comfortably with friends among a relaxed atmosphere such as Perch is refreshing."}
{"text":"By now, I can consider myself a regular at Perch. Always have a pleasant experience. My favorite menu item is the Veggie Burger, but really everything is good and the staff is always very accommodating."}
{"text":"Had the best Mother's Day lunch here! Second time coming here and it was really nice. The first time it was much more packed and I don't think the customer service was as great,...but on a slow day I had 0 complaints I will MOST defiantly be back! Loved the food, loved the drinks, and everything was unique but clean and flavorful.... I really felt like some love went into our food which is why I am giving 5 stars to The Perch!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot off Fremont. The bloody Mary's were fantastic and they were good enough to add a beer chaser for us 'Sconnie girls. The breakfast tacos did not disappoint! It was a little tricky to find, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Had the tuna tartare and steak lettuce wraps. Loved the lettuce wraps. Come between 3-6 for happy hour, bogo cocktails and shareable plates!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the food was really great. The service warrants a 1.5. I had the chimichurri chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The service was seriously lacking though. We were told there was a 45 minute wait. The exact same tables were available when we came back 40 minutes later, plus a few others, and yet we still had to wait for the table right next to the door to be cleaned off. We ordered quickly but it was easily 30 minutes if not more to get our food. The service was friendly but unacceptably slow."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED the options on this menu! Everything was fresh and delicious. The tuna tartar is spectacular as well as the chimichurri chicken sandwich and the shrimp scampi!"}
{"text":"Checked our container park and had a great time.  Stopped at the Perch for some drinks. Shauna was super cool and took care of us.  If your in the area then you must check out the Perch.  Great views and great food too"}
{"text":"After reading so many reviews of spots downtown this was my top choice and we were looking forward to trying The Terrace.  Monday nite just before 9 pm we enter to a server at the door saying they are only serving drinks, their kitchen is closed.  I responded that on line and on Yelp it listed their hours until 10 pm.  She responded that it is their slow season so they have been closing the kitchen early.  I understand the reason,  but change your hours on Yelp, etc to reflect this if during the slow season you want to close early.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I had Sunday brunch at The Perch. The restaurant is presumably so named because it is perched on the second story overlooking Container Park. Befitting its location though, the entire restaurant seemed like more of an idea than a thing of substance.  The restaurant has communal seating of the type one might expect at a southern German beer garden. Unlike the sturdy tables at the beer garden, ours had a mossy ditch running down the center which caused another patron to upset her mimosa right onto my friend's lap.  We started off sharing some monkey bread, which was the best monkey bread I ever had - moist, saucy & delicious. The menu is rather limited and the prices won't set you back much. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Because they had no eggs Benedict, I had to break my streak of reviewing the eggs Benedict everywhere I go, and I ordered a burger instead. The vegan in our party tried to order a fruit plate, just to find out they were \"out of fruit plates,\" and Mark tried to order the steak & eggs, only to find out that the steak could only be cooked well done.  I suspect that the fiasco that was my burger was the product of poor quality ingredients, sloppiness & probably some witless ideas. The burger comes with maple bacon, something that aspires to Emmentaler cheese, and a fried green tomato that hadn't a single hoot left to give. It was supposed to come with chipotle mayonnaise, but was in fact served in a state of undress, so I used my friend's garlic aioli instead. The garlic aioli and maple bacon disagreed with each other, but I'd be willing to bet that combining the maple bacon with chipotle mayonnaise would not be much better a plan. The burger wasn't seasoned properly, if at all, and the fried green tomato tasted like the flavorless fried cornmeal mush that is so popular in Appalachia. The fries were decent, as was the service.  Overall, I have to conclude that The Perch is not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I can here for brunch with a few friends last weekend. You really can't beat $15 all you can drink mimosas and bellinis. The food was great, I ordered a perch burger with fried green tomatoes. It was to die for. The only downside was the slow service, but seeing how busy they were at the time it was understandable. I'll definitely be returning for brunch again soon!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday with my friend. Now I'm back again. Grilled salmon was delicious. It's came with Brussels sprouts and Asparagus. These vegetables are supper delicious and salmon was big cut.  Totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is amazing and some great healthy choices...Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable..Great experience and look forward to checking out a Brunch very soon!"}
{"text":"Downtown Terrace is formally know as The Perch.  Nothing has changed here except for the restaurant name.  Downtown Terrace is located at the back half on the second floor of the Container Park Downtown.  I absolutely love this place for my boozy brunches on the weekend.  This establishment is very casual and relaxed.  When you order the bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's (as I usually do) the waiters continue to have your glass on full.  I mean really, who doesn't enjoy bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and bellinis when you're in vegas. You pay $15 to enjoy all these drinks for two hours.   During my dinning experience here, I always order the Monkey break as a table appetizer, and then the chicken and waffles as my meal.  However, during this visit I opted for the Brisket and Potatoes.  The monkey bread is to die for, between the cinnamon sugar flavoring and the melted butter, one could never go wrong with this appetizer.  Next, the chicken in waffles are great.  The chicken is cooked almost to perfection and the waffle is the size of a belgium waffle, that is light and fluffy.  In regards to the Brisket and Potatoes, it contained a nice layer of sauce and nicely cooked potatoes.  The food was not rich nor salty at all.  I give this place a two thumbs up!  Also don't forget to check in to receive a complimentary glass of wine or beer of your choice."}
{"text":"I had then chopped salad with chicken, which was really unique. The dill in the dressing was a nice touch. The staff was all very attentive and accommodating. Use the Yelp check in to get a free drink!"}
{"text":"Located upstairs, in the back corner of the Container Park, The Perch really makes the most of what they've got. The dining room is open, bright, and very comfortable, with the bar being the main star of the space. My partner and I were greeted quickly when we walked in. The gentleman gave us the choice of two awkward tables in the dining room (well, one was in the entryway of the restaurant, and the other was an awkward high top in the middle of the dining room), so we opted to go outside. Not sure if they were understaffed, or if we caught the tail-end of a massive dinner rush, but every open table was dirty, and most not even pre-bussed. It took him about 5 minutes to clean our table (we were, however, greeted by every employee while we waited), and I must admit, it was worth it. The evening was beautiful last night, and the singer on the main stage of the Container Park was very talented, which really help compliment the evening for us, since we were celebrating a new job that I just landed.  Our server, Alexis, was very friendly and accommodating. She was obviously busy, but she made it a point to come chat it up with us on a few occasions. It turns out that my partner and I know her sister's boyfriend - Vegas is really a small town, when you get down to it.  How often do you have organic, pleasant conversations with your server, and figure things out like that? My partner has a tomato allergy, so she was able to come up with substitution ideas on the fly, and they were spot-on! We started with the Bianca Flatbread, and added the prosciutto, of course. I love it when they print the up charge on the menu so there isn't a question of what you're getting yourself into. The Flatbread was delicious, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious.  I used my Yelp Check-In and got a small glass of the 1664 Blanc. I've had 1664 before, but never the Blanc. I was living for this beer! I really enjoyed the peach notes, and how smooth it was. I had to get a pint.  I had the Hanger Steak Sandwich for my main course. It was cooked to a perfect medium, like I asked, and the caramelized onions were on point. The mayo was a bit overpowering, and the bread a little too tough, but it was still very enjoyable. The fries were great. My partner gave the fries a 6 out of 10, but I say they were more of an 8. Lol They were crispy on the edges, but still soft inside. The seasoning and truffle oil really set them off.   This was a great first impression, and can't wait to try them out again. I had my eyes on the Chicken and Waffles..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. We came on a Sunday during brunch. On mother's day. So yeah, it was very busy but they were able to seat us right away. I suggest making a reservation if you're coming for brunch. Unlimited mimosas and Bellinis is a good deal for $15 and the mimosas I had were pretty tasty. I had the biscuits eggs and gravy. Delicious! Our server Ona, was quick and friendly. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time venturing to Downtown Terrace and it was well worth it!   There were five of us that went for brunch and we decided to take advantage of family dining and all you can drink. What a brilliant idea! Thankfully, with all you can drink....you can switch it up! Want a Bloody Mary...here you go! Want to try the Mimosa next....enjoy!   We decided on the Mimosas in the end....so our wonderful server Mike (he's super tall, you can't miss him) brought us a Champagne Bottle and a carafe of juice! Thank you Mike for knowing your audience!   The food was delicious! The group was a mix of meat and non meat eaters; and they had no problems tending to our needs. We shared the grits, monkey bread, fruit plate, hash browns, short ribs hash, and berry crepes....I stuck to the vegetarian friendly items...and I loved them! Everything was expertly crafted with flavour, visual appeal, and over all perfection. I would not have changed a single thing about this brunch!   I plan to make this a regular spot for my ladies brunches and Mike must be our server every time!! He even took a photo of all of us (making sure to get a few, in different angles...so we would be happy with our options!)   I highly recommend Downtown Terrace for your dining needs (and the outdoor seating is the best!)"}
{"text":"This place is over the top perfection. Sexy staff, mouth watering food, clean and bright, and just a real genuine 5 stars! The chicken and waffles are to die for! The mimosas and bloodymary's are strong! Fantastic brunch spot, and it's cool if you have to wait a bit for a table, they just text you on your cell phone. You can check out other little spots in the container park!  I feel the need to add this part to my review:  They are a fairly new spot, and were giving out a tiny quick questionnaires with your bill. I quickly filled it out and handed it in. When I returned from my vacation a day later I had an email directly from the manager. Mind you, it was not a boring generated email, like an actual answer to my suggestions. WOW! Now whats better than that, I ask......oh yeah...... their chicken and waffles lol"}
{"text":"Located inside Container Park on the second floor near the stage area. They only have a few tables inside and outside, and a bar.  Your menu is the napkin holder. Although the menu seems small (only a few selections) - everything looked interesting. There was only one server the times I've been here but service has always been good.  Crab Cake: Lots of crab meat. The sauce is spicy. 4/5  Fries with Garlic Aioli: Amazingly crunchy. They must double fry their potatoes. The aioli had a strong garlic flavor which I love. I can finish the entire plate all by myself. 4.5/5  Salmon: Comes with Brussels sprouts, asparagus and topped with guacamole. The Brussels sprouts were tender and I like them a bit crunchy. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 3/5  The Terrace: Shrimp with Chimichurri, grilled corn, avocado, and tomato. Refreshing and light. I love the flavor combo. 4/5  Try their flatbreads! Their portions are perfect which means if you're into super sized meals, you might want to get lots of food...that is if you're willing to pay $8-15 per plate."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place and frequent it with my friends, it was our favorite brunch spot but I'm sad to say we won't be going ever again. They no longer serve the food on actual plates or use actual silverware, they've switched those out for paper plates & plastic knife & fork packages. You now order at the kiosk located at the bar which I was directed to by the amazingly rude server. Forgot his name but he was tall, black, bald & rude to SEVERAL people who dined there while I sat with my party. The other two female servers working that day were so sweet & tried to make up for his lack of home training. I appreciated them. Long story short, I hope they change back to how it was but if not, go there with food truck expectations. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy crap. Their salads = incredible. And their location is awesome at night because of the live bands! Check them out... Because they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner last night before heading to the FSE to see a Joan Jett concert.  I've tried to eat here before but the first time I showed up for a (late) lunch with a few family members, they were having a private event so it was a no go. We're locals so I knew I'd give it another shot since I really like the vibe of container park and knew I'd be back.  When we arrived, a very polite young lady promptly approached us and greeted us. We asked to sit on the patio and she let us pick our table. \"Reserved just for us\" she said....lol She left and then came back with menus,place mats and utensils and let us know someone would be with us shortly. There seemed to be a little confusion as to who our server would be so we sat waiting for a LITTLE bit longer than I think \"usual\". Once they figured out who, our server was Daniel, (cool mustache dude!) he was friendly and helpful to all our questions.  We started with an appetizer of fried calamari. It had bits of lightly breaded and fried jalapeños and lemon slices served with aioli. It was very tasty. The fried lemon slices were a delicious touch!  Next, our entrees:  I had the grilled salmon on a bed of roasted cut asparagus and Brussels sprouts topped with salsa cruda (it was actually an avocado mash) the vegetables were roasted to absolute perfection! Its the ONLY way to eat Brussels in my opinion.     My husband had the Hanger Steak and carmelized onion sandwich which he said was excellent. At the end of our meal, there was an awkward snafu with our check getting mixed up with another guest but Daniel  apologized sincerely and provided us with an itemized printout of our check which just so happened to be the exact dollar amount of another couple who had just dined there. He was totally honest and up front about it, which we appreciated. Not a huge issue, as long as its the correct amount.  Certainly not worth ruining an over all great dining experience or losing a star.  The GM Ryan, also approached us and asked about our food and service. He provided a short survey which I filled out. They did a fine job. I look forward to going back with friends and family sometime. Perhaps a weekend brunch sometime or \"lunch with the girls\".  The portions were big and it was cooked perfectly the way we like it. Kudos to the chefs ! The food prices were VERY fair and the quality of the food was great which will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food, with huge portions that are taste treats.  Wonderful attentive service, a sensational find."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's like an escape from the rest of vegas! You walk in and it's just like a relaxed, diner style environment. Lots of food options and super cheap bottomless mimosas!  I got the chicken and waffles, and they had to use chicken tenders instead of regular chicken and I must say it was amazing. I can't wait to go back to vegas just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The service is like they're forced to be there, but they weren't overly rude. love the atmosphere of Container Park."}
{"text":"a WONDERFUL BRUNCH DOWNTOWN!!! I love the staff here! The food is wonder. Courtney behind the bar and Marlon in the kitchen! I love this place! Thank you for a great time! :)"}
{"text":"Perch burger sooooo good, also the ceviche was on point, great friendly staff and food"}
{"text":"I don't give many if any 1-star reviews, but... Can't comment on the food, as we were left standing at the entrance while 8 tables sat uncleared while staff performed non-food related activities.   Despite assurances someone would \"be right with you\", our party of three walked out after 10 minutes of continued standing at the host stand.   None of the dirty tables had been cleared in that time, and no new food left the kitchen.   Hopefully just a bad day, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back here. Even though slammed and service was meh, the servers and managers were extraordinarily apologetic and friendly   Steak Sammich: perfectly cooked MR steak, w an amazing garlic-aoli sauce, and crusty french bread... Ask for a side of sliced tomatoes w it, and it'll come seasoned and spectacular with this dish   Burger: again, perfectly cooked and extraordinarily tasty  Chicken Quinoa: once again, perfectly cooked, tender and tasty...   French fries: crispy and soft  Lemon Drop: perfectly made, w a good after taste"}
{"text":"I ordered the blueberry mint mojito and it was delicious! For dinner I ordered the Salmon/Brussel Sprout and Asparagus dish. The Brussels sprouts were delicious but the salmon was flavorless and bland. I tried to like it. I sprinkled more salt, asked for balsamic vinegar, even tried it with the creamy Sriracha. The sauce was yummy on its own but the salmon still tasted bland. Probably the worst salmon I've ever ordered at a restaurant and I'm Pescatarian (only eat seafood). I am disappointed with the food but the service was great."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great environment and fabulous staff! The place to be in the LV! Nora is the best ask for her!!!"}
{"text":"Came in  for brunch around 1p. Steak tacos and Chimichurri chicken sandwich. Our waiter Rodney was amazing,helpful and friendly really made the whole experience great . Our experience has enticed us to return. The steak tacos were spot on . Avacado mouse was different and interesting. Heater s are available puts ode and seating on the patio was nice even in december. ."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. They had a limited menu, especially for vegetarians. The food was ok. The atmosphere is cute and the drinks were pretty good. We haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch and sat outside on this beautiful spring Las Vegas day. Was a little worried when host said it would be 40 minutes but was closer to 10 minutes. Q was our server and took good care of us. Checked in so we could get the free wine - it was close to noon - and had a very tasty omelette - requested yolks since menu said egg white omelette. Added bacon, asparagus, and Swiss cheese. My husband had his with steak and he said it was quite good. Sure looked good! Will go back. The omelettes didn't come with potatoes or toast but I'm a low carb eater and was still full without finishing the entire omelette."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and has fantastic reimaginings of common dishes, but the service is poor. I would come here more often if it wasn't so slow! ):"}
{"text":"changed my review from the amazing customer service i received from the manager. the food is great almost every time and they have great drinks with a great view and space. i had a negative experience in regards to service there that the manager, ryan, took care of very professionally and promptly. thank you!"}
{"text":"Get the chicken tender appetizer with all of their sauces! Their homemade buffalo sauce is some of the best I've had. Great ambience, prices are reasonable, staff is friendly, and their salads are very clean tasting. Just don't get their food to go, it's definitely not as good."}
{"text":"I went to The Perch on Easter Sunday with a group of friends after one of them found out about it in a Thrillist article. I'm really glad we discovered the place because everything about it was incredible. The food, location, and service were all on point.   Located on the second floor of Container Park, we had a great view of the lawn below where all of the families were watching their kids play with the blocks.  We asked our awesome server, Nora, what she recommended on the menu and she told us about the Breakfast Steak Tacos, Bananas Foster French Toast, and Smothered Egg Biscuits. We ordered one of each and did not regret that decision. The latter of which was my order and I devoured it in record time. It was almost too good! The homemade gravy was out of this universe. We all sampled each other's dishes and we couldn't get over how delicious everything was.  For dessert, we ordered the Monkey Bread. Again, phenomenal. Nora even put a candle in it because we told her that it was our friend's birthday, so we also sang \"Happy Birthday\" to him.  For drinks, we paid $15 for bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Marys. Definitely well worth it.  I definitely recommend The Perch to brunch fans looking for a relaxing, casual environment with incredible service. I'll definitely be coming back here when I find myself in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here for brunch! The place is quaint, but it is always a great time. You can never go wrong with the chicken and waffles. Also, the monkey bread is delicious, goes great with bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is bad to mediocre. Calamari, shrimp and grits (which the grits are fried balls which is not a good presentation for this dish), country hash. Also it is extremely loud in this restaurant! I work downtown but I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Dropped by on Saturday morning mid afternoon, waitress was really nice, great service the food not so much i ordered the chicken and waffle it took a bit of time from when i ordered to actually get my food and when i did the chicken was semi-cooked as the inside of part of the chicken was completely frozen."}
{"text":"So clean!  Great service!  The food is spot on Every Time!  Favorite is the beef tartare which seems totally scary because it's raw meat and a raw quill egg but it's freaking amazing unreal and I also like that Bianca flatbread and the Allegra flatbread the Allegra sounds totally weird like refried black beans shrimp who would think to put that all together on a pizza but it's on unbelievable you got to go in there you got to see it it's so fun it's so yummy it's so unique and it's so awesome and Chef Sonia is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Positives 1st! The weather was gorgeous and they had outside seating and opened the umbrella for us to have some shade at our table. Also, they have a \"check in\" offer for a free glass of wine or beer!  Now the negative.. They advertise Brunch Fri, Sat & Sun 9-3 on Yelp, however we could not order brunch for some BS reason. A special event earlier in the day prevented them from offering their brunch menu, we arrived at approx 11:30 AM..  The server was kind and courteous but was more preoccupied with a meeting with her boss as opposed to tending to her table. Could've spent our hard earned $38 at plenty of other places.   Food was ok, temp of steak was a little under medium but was edible. Fries w/steak had no salt. Egg white omelete was also not seasoned nor were we offered salt & pepper.."}
{"text":"This is such a cute location on the second floor of container park right by the stage. It was very chilly so we sat inside on Friday night after thanksgiving. They only take reservation for 8 or more so I had made one for 8 people earlier that morning. Our group ended up being only 7. There were only 4 people in the restaurant when we arrived at 7:50 and we told them we would wait at the bar for the rest of our party to make sure we didn't take up more room than necessary. They didn't love this idea but I thought this was better than taking up too much room. The restaurant is quite small.   We ordered some drinks at the bar which took a little bit to prepare even though there were 3 bartenders and only 4 people in the restaurant. We sat down at our table and ordered some additional drinks and our food within 10 minutes of sitting.   The restaurant did start to pick up and most of the tables became full. 30 minutes later and 2 of us still didn't have our drinks. We asked for them again and he apologized and brought them right away. The food took a long time as well. Close to an hour to get our food and it came out in shifts. 2 people got their meal then 4-5 minutes later another 2 people got their meal and so forth....it seemed a little strange that not everyone was served within just a minute or 2 of each other. I understand a person only has 2 hands but having worked in restaurants when there is a table of 7 you ask another server to help take out the plates.   Overall, the drinks were good, location great, but subpar service. I've heard wonderful things about their brunch so hopefully I can have a better experience with their service then!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to taste something new so we came here. I have to say so far the best food I had ever tasted and drinks !!! Highly recommend the calamari they even fried the sliced lemons !! that was a surprise. Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here today, wife's food took 30 mins ( for chicken goujons!!!!!) mine still hasn't arrived after another 15 mins so we called for check , lady with tattoos on right arm should be thought restaurant skills, manager owner? With Irish tattoo on chest should learn how to manage Shocking and drove me to a negative review when I would normally just say nothing"}
{"text":"Excellent burger in the LV container park and worth checking out! We wondered into the container park looking for lunch and beers and found this lil gem! It is upstairs and has a nice patio with umbrellas overlooking the container park. We were greeted with friendly service and were offered some tasters of beer. We tried the Perch burger.. you wont be disappointed. Very tasty and fresh. We also shared the Goujons chicken strips.. I saw them an thought they were just average chicken strips.. but I was wrong.. they were great! Panko crusted and tasty along with the homemade BBQ sauce! One of the best I've had! Burger on! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food here was great. Everything we had was amazing. The salmon plate was some of the best Salomon I've ever had. The sauce and veggies were great. The special was a turkey burger with jalapeños and peppers. It was very flavorful"}
{"text":"Steak sandwich medium rare is delicious. The garlic aioli was just right not too much garlic not too oily or thick either. Perfect for fries or to dip your sandwich in .   Amazing service !! Sat at the bar and the bartenders took amazing care of my friend and I. It helped that the bartender happened to be eye candy with his scruff, nose piercing, tatts , great smile and even better personality .   Perfect place to unwind after a long day."}
{"text":"Stefan was the best bartender! He recommend the best food and drinks! He even serenade us with some songs! Very personal and friendly! As a local I appreciate his hospitality!!! He made our day!"}
{"text":"We had the spicy shrimp pasta and the pasta Primavera with shrimp.  It was phenomenal.  Cannot have been better. Nora and Brandon are the best."}
{"text":"Food was great (veggie burger-quality ingredients) but server was not as attentive and the appetizer came 30 min into meal. Wasn't a busy night either ... so great food maybe need a retry for service."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 dined here this past weekend evening (May 2017) and, well, it was OK.  The menu is very limited, so all 4 of us had a simple steak and fries. I was happy that my rare steak did indeed come out rare (a lot of restaurants don't seem to take you seriously that you want your steak rare, so they give it to you medium rare). While it was a perfect done-ness, it was filled with so much gristle that I probably wasted a good portion of the steak spitting it out on the side of the plate. The seasoned butter was a yummy addition, and the fries were a generous portion and done just right. I was simply disappointed in the quality of the steak, especially for the price, and the fact that, while I am in no terms what you would call a picky eater, the steak and fries was the only thing on the menu that looked appealing to me.  The ambiance was terrific - we sat outside in a nice cool night breeze, and our service was friendly and helpful.  Just need to work on the menu . . ."}
{"text":"This place has a margarita with my maiden name in it. So of course I had to have my bachelorette party there last year.   The staff was amazing and accommodating. The food was as always delicious. The drinks were perfect and everyone was happy.   Just discovered they do bottomless brunch drinks so see you this weekend"}
{"text":"Nora is a total charm. Shauna was the bomb. Thanks for a great experience. We will return. Love love love love."}
{"text":"Finishing up brunch here before Punk Rock Bowling and we're so relieved to FINALLY have great service. Rodney was our amazing server. He was super friendly, attentive, funny, accommodating, and understanding. We had bottomless mimosas and bellinis and yummy tacos and chicken sandwich. My friend's omelette was overcooked, and she hesitated to say anything because she didn't want to be a jerk, but he noticed that she wasn't eating and he took care of it. After a weekend of rude front desk clerks, this place was such a relief. Thanks Rodney!"}
{"text":"Ordered through ubereats. I had the salmon with brussel sprouts and asparagus, the salmon was topped with some type of sauce I didn't really care for. The vegetables were really good especially the brussel sprouts, the salmon was seasoned very well. I also ordered pizza for the kids, they said it was good but the edges were a little too hard for them to bite.  I had a side salad but for 4.00 the portion was entirely too small. Overall everything was decent and I would definately order from them again but next time I think I will visit the resturant and eat there instead."}
{"text":"Not only am I complete devotee, I have turned all of my friends onto this gem of a restaurant. I MUST eat here every time I'm in town! Service is great and friendly even when they're super busy. Now...what to eat... Fantastic chicken and waffles. French toast that will change your life. Yummy homemade hash. I could go on and on. I love that they have an all you drink option. I mean, it's Vegas, after all!   P.S. don't forget to check out the giant metal Mantis at the entrance of the container park!"}
{"text":"You know the feeling you have when you pitch a dinner place to a group of co workers and it just falls apart? The feeling of a dozen daggers in your back and dozen sets of eyes silently drilling fiery holes through your pathetic self?   Yup, that's me. F Pigalle was closed on Monday, so I pitched The Perch, thinking it would be a great time.   I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, confirmed morning of, all was going well.   Our evening unraveled just about immediately. Our table was ready (yay) with zero wait, right on time. But then time came to figure out who will be taking care of us and when that person would make appearance.  Guess what 14 people that got out of a day full of meetings want to do right away? Ding ding ding. I won't go into boring details, but it was 55 minutes from the time we sat down until every member of our party had a drink. No joke. Almost an hour. By that time first served were, yep, done with their drinks. We couldn't even kick off an evening with a toast. I get handcrafted cocktails, but was it possible to staff more than one bartender considering there was a three weeks advance notice?...  The drink fiasco that dragged out for an hour put such a damper on everyone's mood, I'm not even sure anyone paid much attention to food. I tried calimari and will say it was delicious, my veggie burger was tasty, but fries were super lame. They were so inconsistent plate to plate, you couldn't really tell what they should taste like. Mine were golden brown, over fried and dry, the appetizer ones were thick and soggy. So bizarre.  I will say, I dreaded food coming out as dragged out as the drinks, but it was actually very well timed and coordinated.  Anyway, I think The Perch might well be suited for smaller parties, but I would consider other options for larger ones."}
{"text":"Fantastic location \"perched\" atop the downtown container park.  Food, service and ambiance are all excellent.  Loved the shrimp pasta with Sriracha and cream sauce.  The cheesecake was incredible too.  Highly recommend if you are looking for something memorable off of the strip."}
{"text":"Just to put things into perspective..got here at 11:30am and just got our food at 1:40am. Not even that good..server forgot to put items in so we are currently waiting on 1 more dish..never experienced something like this? Throughly disappointed"}
{"text":"Basically the food is ok, drinks ok, service.... umm what service?!? The staff seemed more interested in each other than helping customers. So here's the break down:  Pros: - the ambiance and outdoor seating - the perch burger - the cucumber cocktail  Cons: - these service was horrible. Waited 10 minutes to be seated on a non busy night mostly because the host person was too busy chatting it up with his friends. Whom by the way arrived after we were already waiting.  - another 20 minutes before anyone came over to get drink orders/ bring water.  - our orders were taken by one of the bartenders that took it upon herself to come from around the bar to help us. We never actually got a waiter. - after she dropped our food off (about 30 minutes after we ordered) she disappeared.  - after she disappeared literally NO ONE came to check on our table. We had to walk in and ask the bartender for our check.  Needless to say, we won't come back."}
{"text":"If you do not want to wait in line for brunch at EAT, which can be a very long time, I would suggest this place BY FAR! This place is truly is a nice hidden gem in the back of container park a level up. I would recommend using the street level access on the corner! For brunch get a mimosa and the breakfast skillet that you can customize!"}
{"text":"Great place, really kind staff. I ordered steak and it was good. It is nice to have a seat on the balcony and watch down the container park. Very entertaining. The only downside is menu. Not a lot of options."}
{"text":"My wife and I had friends in town and we wanted to show off container park. The Perch was a great place to have a couple drinks; good drafts and tasty signature cocktails. All of the food was amazing. We had the fresh bruchetta, shrimp civiche tacos and fried calamari for appetizers. The steak and fries, seafood pasta, Perch burger and the turkey burger for entrees.  The staff was also very helpful and courteous.  This is the now a go to spot for dinner when we have guests."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here. The bartender is very welcoming and friendly. I love the food and the drinks are strong just how I like them. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I love coming here and miss this place so much now that I'm not in la anymore. Been here for dinner and just casually for drinks. Food here is good. I highly recommend making a reservation. If not be prepared to wait for awhile. Come before 10pm for drinks and you might be lucky to not have to get in line. If not, be prepared to wait downstairs first then take the elevator up to the bar.   There's an amazing view of la! This is the perfect spot to take out of towners. This was my go to spot in dtla!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best place to get a quality meal in Container Park. Yes its also very pricey (not any more than bin702, but obviously more than tacos or bbq), but the presentation and satisfaction makes it worth it. Drink are amazing and service is on point. Glad this place is open now!"}
{"text":"Adorable spot at the  Downtown  Container Park.  The inside is bright and fresh, lots of windows and light. Restaurant and patio looks out at the grassy area where the entertainment area of the park is.   Had lunch here with a party of 4. I had a delicious jalapeño strawberry cocktail with mint salt rim and the tuna tartare as my meal. It was nice and light, good for the price. My boyfriend had the Terrace salad which is shrimp, corn, avocado and cilantro chimichurri. The server recommended it over greens. It was tasty but expensive. $18 for the salad. They charged $3 for the kale they put it over.   Bartender seemed like he made the cocktails with love, handcrafted each one to perfection. Our server was nice and attentive but seemed unfamiliar with the menu at times.   Overall fun experience because of the decor and company. Food is slightly overpriced but I would return. Especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"Best Bottomless Mimosa's!! The food was impeccable we ordered the Terrace and chicken and waffles, couldn't have asked for a better meal. Thank you so much to Mike for our fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"Great food an really cool atmosphere . Started with flatbread an soup! Had the salmon cooked just perfect with delicious avocado topping. Little confusing where to go when you walk in an service little confusing as to who our waiter was. But believe the chef took our order an his recommendations were on point ."}
{"text":"The best surprise of our trip in Las Vegas.   Bottomless Bloody Mary's plus our server Shawn was delightful and efficient.  Received a discount as a Veteran. I was wearing my military urban grunge jacket.  Owner asked if I was a Veteran.   He gave me the discount after I showed proof.  We ate chicken and waffles.  Most crunchy chicken we have ever eaten.  Place is really nice and clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch yesterday with our friends and we had an awesome time! I had an egg white omelet with everything and shrimp! And my husband had the chicken sandwich with the spicy tomato soup. They were all fantastic! I had some fresh squeezed watermelon juice that tasted like I had a straw straight from a watermelon :)  We shared a fruit bowl and our friends had the steak sandwich, also AMAZING! We will definitely be back! The vibe of the restaurant is cool it has an awesome loft feeling to it, and the service staff was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We were lucky to happen upon The Perch during our brief sojourn in Las Vegas.  Michael, our waiter, was amazing, especially when, on the second night that we dined there, he not only remembered us, but also our drinks preferences.  I had seafood on both occasions, first the pasta, and then the salmon; the calamari and mussels in the pasta sauce were perfectly prepared -- much, much better than what I had had on the Pacific Coast just a few months ago.  The salmon was incredible.  And the tiramisu is a must."}
{"text":"Wow does not even begin to express this place.. food is AMazing the service is flawless lets just say that yelp needs to add more stars to rate this place  Will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for awhile now and I wish I had come sooner!   I came for a Sunday brunch and if you love your brunch with mimosas like me, this is your spot!  We got an entire bottle, they wanted to bring another one (it's bottomless) but we had to be somewhat productive this Sunday.    Food: Order the monkey bread, it's a MUST.  It will melt in your mouth.  I ordered the breakfast tacos, which were small but with the mimosas and monkey bread you should be fine.    Service: Great, our waitress was attentive, friendly, and made our brunch delightful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Container Park you should check it out. Very friendly staff. My wife tried one of their signature drinks (Pena Berry Margarita) and it was to salty for her so they made her another drink without a fuss. That's always a plus in my book. Normally she gets her Margarita's without salt. Started with the Fried Calamari, very good. The Jalapeno's were browned which cut down on the heat and the Lemon Aioli was a nice dipping sauce. Bianca Flat bread, this is good enough to be your entree if you looking for something a little lighter than burgers or pasta. Spicy Shrimp Pasta just the right amount of heat, balanced. The Perch Burger. I'm not a guy that likes tomato on my burger but the fried green tomato was a nice touch.  I'd definitely get this again. I always like a good burger with my beer."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas, bloodys, and bellinis (you can mix and match), $15, fri-sun, 9-3pm.   If you want a little sweet but don't want to waste it on your entree, the monkey bread satisfies that craving and is easy to share!   Very glad I stopped here. No complaints"}
{"text":"Went to The Perch yesterday for their brunch. It was fantastic, Michael was our waiter and he was great. I had the chicken and waffles and my wife had chicken chimichurri, both dish were amazing. It was a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy a great day and great food. I will be back. Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"Perch is a great option for lunch or dinner in downtown Las Vegas.  It's located in the Container Park, which is a fun area.  Perch is on the second level, with indoor & outdoor seating.    What I liked most about Perch:  1. Customer service - far & away Perch offered the best customer service I experienced during my stay in downtown Las Vegas.  The staff was very friendly, informative, & accommodating.  2. Diversity of menu - there were several options, making this a great place to go with people with different tastebuds!  The only suggestion I have for improvement is the wait time.  When I arrived, late on a weekday evening, the place was maybe 20% full & most people seemed to have already received their food.  I ordered a very simple salad to take out & it took at least 30 minutes to come out.  I was a bit surprised given the circumstances.  I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great solo dining option or place to go with friends to grab lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch!! Such a great deal on bottomless mimosas. My favorite spot to sit is at the bar because the bartenders are so friendly and fun. It's always a good time here. The food is not mind blowing but it's good! Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots. Get their Early to avoid long waits!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service. Location is super cool. Outside patio is a great place to sit and enjoy the container park."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic lunch. The service was great and attentive, and we all loved the food.  Try the Bianca flatbread, chopped salad (which is very unique and amazing) and the chimmichurri chicken. Even the tortilla chips are made fresh each morning.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!!"}
{"text":"I came all the way from san Diego to come to this place !!! Lobr shauna . She is awesome. So is her awesome team!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little expensive but the food is A-MA-ZING! And you get the added bonus of being able to go to container park. The place is small so to get a table make sure that you go a little before the peak eating hours so that you can secure your place.  It does get noisey when there are a lot of patrons but a neat trendy place to eat for sure.  I am going to try the brunch menu the next time around."}
{"text":"The burger with an egg is so good. Fries are perfectly cooked and the unlimited mimosa's will def make a great time!"}
{"text":"I had read about this place on fb newsfeed..also researched on yelp...pics of food looked great..that lured me in...looked forward to dining here..the host was friendly good sign..i came in on a sunday not knowing it was brunch only menu..it doesnt say that specifically on their website..was lookin forward to lunch menu items but stayed anyways.. i got a seat at bar which i asked for so i didnt hav to wait..the waitress seemed like she didnt want to b there but luckily the bartender was friendly but unfortunately he was busy with orders so i waited patiently...there was another person behind the bar so i asked if i could giv her my order but she said someone will b right here to take it..she was obviously busy washing n wiping glasses so sorry for interrupting..sooo aftr awhile i got my food order in...finally got bartender's attention to order my drink..i asked him what he recommends, what is the signature drink here..he recommended the pena berry margarita..sweet but very strong it was ok... i had ordered the terrace which is grilled shrimp, corn, avocado n tomatoes with a cilantro chimichurri sauce..it was delicious..food was great ..service not so much"}
{"text":"Awesome place in Container park !! Excellent food - had steak and egg tacos bottomless mimosas ! Hubby had off the hook fried chicken and waffles !  Super staff and service !"}
{"text":"Bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimosas for $15. Great food and service. I went for brunch and there was a wait to be seated, about 40 mins. But worth the wait, fun atmosphere. I will return."}
{"text":"First time visit for this location, I had no idea that this place was located in Container Park. It's actually in a good location, 2nd level over viewing the little grassy area. You can definitely grab your food to go and hang out downtstairs with kids or if the day permits it enjoy your food out and about. I definitely used the outdoor seats while I waited for my goodies. I like that they had infused water ready for anyone to grab. With the summer approaching that is a definite plus. I also noticed that they had a very extensive drink selection and the knowledge to recommend and prepare a delicious drink or pour you a nice glass of beer. Let's move onto the food I didn't really order as much as I would like. Good thing I came with my friend, and we were able to order two items to try. The first thing that caught our eye was the waffle and chicken. It's not your typical chicken and waffle they actually amped it up with fruits!  I wasn't too sure if it would work and boy was I wrong! They paired very well and definitely had a burst of flavor, I loved the strawberries and apples with the caramel sauce and raspberry drizzle.  My meal was so good, and it was definitely enough to share since we ordered the edamame, it was so seasoned and good perfectly. I definitely couldn't stop. Hence my poor attempts of finishing my meal. This place has definitely got some good dishes and the staff is super friendly. I simply have no complaints."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, waitress Chelsy was beyond lovely and caring. The best! Will definitely come back any day :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday and it was by far the best breakfast I've eaten in a long time. If you have not enjoyed brunch here I highly encourage you try.   This is an excellent place for dinner, lunch, brunch, or just late night drinks. The Container Park is a great place to chill out for all ages. The Perch has incredible food, friendly staff and excellent bartenders.   Our server was super nice and very attentive. The gentleman who manages The Perch greeted us outside as we sat in the sun waiting for the place to open. 100% hands on to ensure we were happy.   We sat outside, enjoyed the great weather and relaxed on the couch. I had bottomless Bloody Mary's, which are the best in town. I'm a Bloody Mary snob and I've tried them all over the world. The Perch is #1 hands down.   I ordered the monkey bread to start which was outstanding. Even my super picky wife enjoyed it. For the main course I ordered the Brioche French toast. Amazing. The bread had a crispness to it like it was coated in corn flakes. The bananas were warm and perfectly cooked. The toast was decadent, with plenty of caramel sauce. I ordered bacon to balance the sweetness, and honestly it should be included with the meal to balance it out. Bacon was super crisp.   I'm so excited about this place and so invested in their success that I've told every friend and coworker about it. In the middle of brunch my wife turned to me and said, this is our place now. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was here couple days ago and it was OK. The food was actually a little disappointing, not bad per se, but not what I had envisioned when looking at the whole package.  Restaurant itself seems to be more on the upscale side and modernish. Everything is impeccably clean and nothing out of place. The bar seems to be stocked fairly well, and the music they play is inspiring, albeit a little loud for me personally. The menu was refreshing, clean (no clutter), and evoked thoughts of grandeur.  Food though was a different story.   Ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and took the bacon off to feed my cats. The bacon was very brown, crispy, wrinkled, and stiff. Looked very tasty and not greasy (cat enjoyed immensely). The Burger itself seemed to be dry and tasteless and very well cooked, like all the moisture was cooked out. Might be fine for some but I prefer mine a little less dry.  Might come back next time am in area, not overly sure."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Good service, moderate prices, and great food. Tried the steak and egg tacos, monkey bread (a must if you have a sweet tooth) with a bloody mary."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jem at the container park. The food is crafted with the utmost of care. This time we had tuna tartar, chimimachure chicken and the chopped salad. The calimari with fried jalepenos and lemons should not be missed. The rotating craft beers are awesome. Staff is caring and attentive.  Current selections include Big Dogs Red Hydrant Ale, Speakeasy Butcher Town Black Ale, Laguniats I PA and Kronenburg 1664. Stephan and Chris are the best as are all off the staff. Chef puts out amazing food. Love  this place!"}
{"text":"Lucia flatbread and the beef tartare were awesome, desserts were great too.  Great place for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"We popped in Tuesday night for what was supposed to be a quick drink and bite to eat...however, the server gods didn't seem to be in our favor. It took forever to get our food, just as long to get refills on our water, and an eternity to get our check (only after requesting for it more than once). I can't even recall who our server was, as he never introduced himself and never returned after taking our order. Our water, alcoholic beverages, food, and check were all brought to us by different employees. I'm not sure if that's the system they choose to operate on, but I will say it definitely wasn't efficient. For such a small establishment, things should have run much smoother. Regardless of whether or not they had a table of 10 seated, who seemed to be taking up everyone's attention. Oh, and as for the food...it was just alright. The calamari was tasty, but saturated in grease, as if the oil it was fried in wasn't hot enough. The terrace salad, while tasty, was lacking everywhere else...with 4 small shrimp, a handful of corn, a few spoons of avocado, and a couple split tomatoes, $15, I think not. And, my daughter's chicken tenders were practically burnt! All in all, with the service lagging and the food being nothing special, I don't see us returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Lately my husband has been into this brunch kick and we've tried quite a few places for brunch. This place is in container park in downtown hidden in the corner on the second floor. When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and were told we had to wait for 15-30 minutes for a table. It worked out for us because there was a cool toy store right below that we played around in and in no time we were texted to come back up. When we got back up to the restaurant the hostess did not address us first, but addressed the couple behind us and seated them. This kind of set me off because we were literally standing in front of her and had been told to come back up. After seating them the hostess finally asked us how many was in our party and we told her 3 but also told her we were here prior and received a text to let us know to come back up. We were seated and got the usual all you can drink specials that many brunch spots have. My husband got the mimosa and I chose to get the Bellini which was super sweet for me. My husband got the steak and eggs tacos which he really enjoyed and I got the shrimp and grits which I enjoyed. I have never personally had the shrimp and grits before so I have nothing to compare it to but thought the sauce on it paired really well with the salad. Overall the food was good ,but the first experience with the hostess made me not feel very welcome."}
