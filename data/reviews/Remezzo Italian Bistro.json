{"text":"sunday night dinner, and not a busy restaurant at all.  not a problem at all!  it was my first time visiting this restaurant, and while waiting for my friend, i was welcomed to sit at the bar while i waited.  wasn't a fan of their rail gin, but was very happy to see something on the shelf that i liked.  gin and tonic it is!

bah, forget the play by play.  it's a 3-3.5 star for me.

i haven't been to italy, i haven't searched out \"proper\" italian restaurants in toronto, but as one other poster wrote (can i quote?  or will this post be removed because of plagiarism?)...   well CHERYL C. wrote \"...If you want poorly done Italian-ish food in a very 1988 atmosphere, go.\"  i LOVE that she wrote that.  i couldn't have described it better!  except that i didn't mind the food at all.  perhaps it's not a \"real\" italian bistro, or perhaps the guys in the kitchen don't have that much hair on their arms, but the food was decent i thought.  i don't think it's right to compare it to the restaurants downtown in little italy.  i mean, this IS scarborough, right?

but i'll tell you why this get's a bit of a higher rating than some people have given it.  service!  they were friendly!  they were professional!  and really, the prices were pretty decent and food wasn't THAT bad.  would i expect better food when i get my butt to italy?  of course!  and that is why we're in canada!  it's a sample, not a mirror image.  hell, you can't even go to mcdonalds here in toronto, thinking it tastes the same in south america or asia!  it will be different.  don't believe me?  then get off the computer, and go buy yourself a plane ticket and taste for yourself!

i will go back to remezzo.  i won't be running to go back, but i'll go back."}
{"text":"Having eaten there many times, for me, dining at Remezzo is like visiting an old friend.  There are no surprises but it's an enjoyable experience, which you hope to repeat soon.  

The restaurant is deceptively large with a slightly dated decor.  Service is usually  prompt and courteous.  They have a large menu of very reasonable priced entrees.  Everything you would expect at an Italian restaurant including pasta, pizza, steaks and seafood.  I have never eaten anything at Remezzo that I would call a disappointment.  

Standouts on the menu include their French Onion Soup, Linguine De Mare (shrimp, scallops & clams in red sauce), Veal Picatta, Veal Scallopine and their famous Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Angel hair pasta surf and turf was great. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Force to rate it with one star because no option for zero star.... Ordered three main course, only the lasagna has taste of Italian, the rest just Chinese food .... Better just go to Chinese restaurant to eat... The veal dish just like stir fried beef with vegetables in Chinese soy sauce ... Angel hair surf & turf same as singapore stir fried noodles.... Never again"}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past 20+ years. My daughter loves the spaghetti with mushrooms. She orders that every single time. The shrimp and scallops are amazing. Very fresh and delicious. It consistently has excellent food! - Wayne"}
{"text":"Food was great, and so was the service. Definitely would recommend this spot and will be coming back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Whenever we have family functions/get togethers, we come to this restaurant. It's quiet, the food is good and most importantly it's affordable!

The decor could use an update, but it's not something that would deter us from continuing to visit 

Pasta's are yummy!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for dinner tonight and my wife found their website as we were nearby. We decided to try it, called for a reservation and were advised to come in. When I saw it was in a strip mall at Warden & Sheppard I didn't know what to expect.

We ordered the Escargot and Arancini (Italian rice balls) as an appetizer and my wife ordered the Veal Scallopini as a main and I order the pasta special of Rigatoni with tenderloin, mushrooms, spinach and sauteed onions in a demi glace sauce. 

The apps were very good, my wife enjoyed her Veal and I loved the Rigatoni. We had a couple of glasses of wine and found everything reasonably priced and tasty. 

Our waitress was knowledgeable, very nice and very attentive. 

Our meals with apps, pre dinner drinks and wine with dinner was just over $100.

We very much enjoyed it and will definitely return here again"}
{"text":"First time here! Working in the city and was looking for a good place to eat 
Looked around wasn't our first choice but the other place was closed down 
So we turned around and came here 

Presentation was good! Got a seat super fast ! As soon as we sat down we a waitress was their in a second! Our drinks came fast we got wine and ceasears 
The ceasears were good but too much ice in the glass 

For an entree we got crab cakes 
And they were super good and hot!  Got them with in 10 mins of ordering! 

For dinner I got linguini Louisiana witch was super good again it can super fast and was steaming hot had to let it cool down a bit 
Only down fall was my shrimp tails were still  on if I didn't notice I would have been eating them!

All and all I say this place is a good pick 
I would eat their again and recommend it to friends and family  

Super fast super friendly  and good dinner"}
{"text":"Pizza and pasta are pretty good, do yourself a favour and stay away from the garden salad, basically iceberg lettuce with a carrot on top."}
{"text":"A family run restaurant in Scarborough, located at Warden and Sheppard, Remezzos is a favourite among the locals. Their food is consistently great, their prices are good, and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. This is the place we go to celebrate anything. A large part of the clientele are regulars - which speaks volumes for the place.


 Initially opened by their father, the place is now run by two brothers who take the well-being of their customers very personally. At least one of them is always on hand. The staff are friendly and attentive. Reservations are recommended on any holiday, weekend, or during the Christmas season. Don't bother trying to get in on Valentines day or New years without one. If you live or are in the vicinity and are looking for a good place to eat then definitely try it. Much better than the chain restaurants nearby!


 Our personal favourites are the butternut squash ravioli, angel hair surf and turf, linguine Louisiana and linguine de mar."}
{"text":"I've come here 3 time so far and I don't know why I didn't sooner since it is so close to where I live and I come to the supermarket beside Remezzo weekly. I still remember back when the place used to be a Swiss Chalet and that was so long ago. Anyways, I would definitely recommend this place for dinner. They always have changing specials which are great to have and food sure is tasty. The fact that they've stayed in business for so long is a sure sign that they're doing something right.

One word of caution though. If you come here, make sure you park farther away where people are less likely to park, especially during lunch hours. The restaurant is right next to a Chinese supermarket so the parking lot is full of irresponsible drivers and can be frustrating. I've had one time where I came back from grocery shopping to find my side mirror knocked right off and another when I watched a driver rear end a car. This driver quickly drove off and wouldn't stop while someone was running over towards them! Sadly, it is Chinese people like these that give us a bad reputation."}
{"text":"We recently visited Remezzo's for my father's birthday, making a reservation for 7pm. We arrived 5 minutes early, and were told to take a seat and wait. The restaurant was fairly busy, and we were glad we were prudent enough to make a reservation. After about 20 minutes or so, we asked the host what the situation was, and he told us that they were preparing a table. At 7:45, with still no table ready, we decided to take our business elsewhere.

It is understandable that a restaurant may need some time to prepare a table, especially during a dinner rush. But if you accept our reservation, I think it is fair to expect seating within a reasonable time.

That was not the first time we've visited Remezzos, but it will almost certainly be the last."}
{"text":"Found it very generic cooking. I wouldn't go there for authentic Italian. Good neighborhood restaurant if you want something safe and delicious but don't expect it to blow your mind"}
{"text":"Excellent local grub right by my parents' doorstep. I really love the ambience, lovely staff & the food. Every time I visit my parents from Hamilton, I have a hankering for this place."}
{"text":"Really tasty, fresh Italian food. This is probably one of the only Italian restaurants in Scarborough, so I go here all the time with my grandfather who lives nearby. The service is really good - and the food comes out very fast. I always get the penne arrabiata or tortellini - both are delicious. Tomato sauce isn't too spicy. The soups are also always tasty if you're getting an appetizer - I recommend the minestrone. Most of my family members always get the veal with a side of spaghetti. I'm a vegetarian so it's not my style, but it's very popular. - it's also massive."}
{"text":"Remezzo gets a mixed review from me. The first time we went for dinner, the food was hot and tasty. The pasta tasted homemade, but very delicious. I have to give the tiramisu a shoutout because it was extremely well done! 

Unfortunately, my 2nd go at remezzo was not as memorable as my first trip. We went this time for lunch, i got the ravioli and it was medicore at best. It wasn't hot and the dish only tasted salty, not much flavour to it at all. However my first impressions were good so i might give this place a 3rd go!"}
{"text":"The pasta dishes here are delicious. The service was good even though there was a party of 10 ahead of us. The restaurant wasn't very busy at 3:30 pm. The only thing that I found strange was we were charged $4 for a small bowl of ice cream. Other than that, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been more disappointed in a restaurant, I had made reservations on Tuesday for Friday evening at 7pm. They had only taken my first name and no other information, I asked if she was sure she didn't need a last name and she assured me that a table was reserved under my first name. We arrived well before our reserved time of 7 pm. The place was busy and we were glad we had made a reservation far in advance. After pushing our way through the mob like crowd at the reception area we finally made it to the bar area. Though it may have been the hosts first night but they shouldn't put trainees to handle customers on a busy Friday dinner rush. We stood there for 15 minutes trying to flag down this host to let him know we had arrived for our reserved time. He refused to make eye contact or even speak with guests, he walked past us 11 times before I had to physically intercept him just to get a word in. He finally accepted to check his poorly scribbled list on a crumpled up paper for our name. He briefly looked at the sheet said he didn't see it and walked away, he literally said nothing else just walked away not a sorry for the inconvenience absolutely nothing. on his next pass I got in his way again and explained the situation that we had reservations from Tueday and again all he said was I have nothing and tried to walk away but another lady caught him before he could scurry away, before I could leave the area he had a crowd of at least 10 guests around him; he had left all these people standing there with no kind of reception. Whilst walking away I observed the way he interacted with the patrons and it was completely unprofessional. One lady asked how long the wait was and his quick snobby reply was\" an hour, NEXT\", she actually had to say wait hold on I'd like to reserve a table. I understand the restaurant was busy but as a host your job to welcome patrons to the restaurant, assess their situation and either seat them or provide information to when a table is available; not rudely turn them away when they're willing to wait. Needless to say I will not return to this establishment and would not advise anyone to go if they value customer service. We turned to Fratelli Village Pizzeria on old Kingston road, over the phone we were told a 45 minute wait with no reservations. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by the wonderfully friendly host, and sat at a table promptly within a few minutes. My first time here and  I would highly recommend checking them out, a comfortable Italian atmosphere at fratellis with fantastic food and excellent caring staff; even when it's a full house!"}
{"text":"A very decent place with good food, affordable prices and great customer service. 

We ordered the penne arriabata and the manacotti. The penne was cooked well with a rich spicy sauce, as requested. The manacotti was a bit watery once you dug down into it and perhaps could have been a larger serving, mind you I went in for lunch w/o a breakfast. 

The customer service was attentive, polite and helpful - exactly how we wanted it. 

Certainly would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and the food is pretty good! The prices are fair and the food is attractive. Like all places, we get bread and butter to start. We ordered
-escargot
- butternut squash ravioli, 
-linguine de mare 

The escargot wasn't amazing but the sauce was. The flavor of the sauce didn't make it into the escargot very well but the butter and garlic sauce tastes great!

The pastas were also very good. The linguine de mare came with a good portion of seasfood including shrimp, squid and mussels. There maybe more but my boyfriend was the one who ordered that dish so I only got to taste it. The seafood flavour was very prominent and taskted really good.

The butternut squash was very creamy and with a small tinge of sweetness with the squash inside it tasted really good. This dish was made with a good amount of vegetables like red peppers, green peppers and onions.

I'll definitely find the change to come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food for fair prices. My team and I came here after some paintball battles down the street at Defcon Paintball and it was the perfect ending to the night. I ordered the brushetta with cheese as an appetizer (which everyone loved) and the butternut squash ravioli which was the hands down best one I've ever had.

My friends all tried different dishes which they all loved as well."}
{"text":"Took my family to this restaurant for the first time last night.  To my surprise all three kids found something they wanted to order and they all liked the food. I had the pizza and it was delicious and reasonably priced. Service was a little slow but it was busy. Now I know where to go for a nice family dinner when i don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Great place to Eat! We enjoy the Calamari and the Chicken Parm! My 3 year old daughter loves Pasta and they make it just the way she asks! I prefer going a weeknight."}
{"text":"This is a really great Italian restaurant with good sea food pasta. Lots of great vegetarian options, and the place is HUGE, staff is friendly. I don't think the pasta is hand made but it's still pretty good and the price is reasonable"}
{"text":"I am Italian. I cook Italian. I have even been paid to cook. I was chef once too. I have been here 3 times the food is pretty lousy and i do have high standards. The only thing that had flavor was the bruschetta. 

Don't wast your time."}
{"text":"I've been going to Remezzo's for as long as I can remember. It's a neighborhood staple for some good family-run Italian restaurant food. The restaurant has been around for decades and still has people coming back so they must be doing something right.

First off, it is an older establishment so you won't find fancy, modern decor here. It is a large restaurant with lots of cozy and comfortable seating. Good for large and small groups. The staff is always friendly and many have been working there for years.

I can't speak much for their drinks as I usually stick to a pop but they do have a full service bar here. As for the food, I've always enjoyed everything I've eaten here. The portions are generally large when it comes to the pasta. I've had quite a few instances where I've gone home with lunch for the next day. By the way, the their pasta the next day is so good! 

My family usually starts off with ceasar salad to share (house made dressing - delicious!) and garlic bread with cheese. Some days I will opt-in for a french onion soup (my fave!). My go-to dishes are usually the spaghetti with mushrooms/the works and Chicken Parmesan. Both are great in their own regard, their spaghetti meat sauce is a little on the saltier side but I still enjoy it, especially with mushrooms. I've tried a few of their other dishes as well and I have never been disappointed. When we're feeling extra special, we'll also order the tiramisu which I must say is pretty good.

If you're feeling like some Homestyle Italian food for a decent price, I would definitely recommend this place. Not the best Italian you'll ever eat but perfect for a good meal. I'm actually going back tonight!"}
{"text":"Went with some friends, the mussels didn't taste fresh but the sauce was pretty good. The coconut shrimp tasted like it was store bought, nothing special. French onion soup was okay. My husband said the bolognese sauce was too tangy and veal was just okay. My fettuccine in white wine sauce was bland, would give it 3 stars at best. It had tiger shrimp which was small and crab which wasn't anything special. 

Place looked outdated but at least appeared clean. The host wasn't very friendly, waitress was alright but took a long time to come back as we had to flag her down to get bill and waited about 5-10 min to try and flag her down. 

Doubt we would come back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Super beautiful atmosphere with great services. Their pastas are really delicious and their pizza as well. Prices are fair and comes with a large portion that would totally fill you up."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the \"special of the day\" dishes and it did not disappoint.  The fish with the tartar sauce had a nice flavour served with vegetables and rice."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday evening and it was quite busy, but that doesn't mean it's okay to get poor service. I mean REALLY POOR SERVICE (that actually encourages me to write my first review). In terms of food, the quality was okay, portion was not big (we ordered 6 main dishes for 5 people). In terms of service, it really was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was the last person in my group to arrive, the waitress didn't seem to care about my existence, I asked for the menu and she forgot about it until I asked again when my friends finished ordering. She simply threw the menu of the table which she basically threw everything on the table. She also said my friend's set dinner wouldn't include the soup and salad, which is actually stated on their menu blackboard. What's the point of 'set dinner' if it's just a main dish?! She had no service at all, very rude, and had no expression until we asked her for the bill! Suddenly, she was smiling when she brought the credit card terminal to us. We did give her 15% tips, now I kinda regretted it because she deserved no tips to be honest. After we pay the bill, I asked for a box because I had quite a lot of leftovers. We just sat there and waited for like 25 minutes, she still didn't bring me the box. When I asked her again, she brought me a box without a bag (I saw her giving box and bag to other customers). This restaurant was not THAT bad, my advice is to avoid the lady with red hair."}
{"text":"Food was delicious at a very reasonable price. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The waiting staff was nice and checked on us regularly and the place was pretty packed to the brim on a regular non holiday Saturday evening. Goes to show why this restaurant has opened such a long time and business still booming. 

Great food at such a low price. What a deal!"}
{"text":"Seafood Chowder was almost as thin as broth and had an oil slick on the surface. Did not eat.
Booth for two had dirty walls: dried up pasta sauce splatters....I checked the booth behind us....same situation. 
Garlic bread was toast..just shatters to dust in your mouth.
Caesar salad was good, but small.
Butter nut ravioli was lame. Sauce was tasty but Ravioli was probably frozen. Spinach, mushrooms, and peppers were ok. Caramalized onions were good...raw onions not so good. 3 free Linguini noodles in ravioli dish was mysterious. Skewer of shrimp showed up de skewered already..I like to see the skewer. Skewer was 3 mediocre shrimp.
Tiramisu was large and 89% whipped cream and cocoa powder."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed. But the place still felt spacious although the restaurant was almost fully occupied. The ambience was surprisingly cozy and the food was very well done. Service was pleasant in the beginning but it got a lil slower when we were going to get desserts. Overall I love the dining experience here!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, I've tried many different dishes and they're all good. 
The service is decent.
Price wise, it's average maybe even a little more than average for some people. 
The place itself is not the best, it's spacious but not the most aesthetically pleasing. 
Overall, I come here all the time for the food and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I first came across this hidden gem years ago for a friends birthday dinner and whether I come here with a large party or with a few friends, service is always commendable. Aside from the service, I have tried many different dishes from the menu and I have never been disappointed. 

They offer a wide selection of pastas and appetizers and for very reasonable prices. I like that they are typically open a little later than most restaurants. I have been coming here sporadically over a number of years and know that I can always count on Remezzo for a delicious, authentic Italian dinner and good service."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my boyfriend not too long ago and we were very disappointed in the service, but the food was alright..it didn't give the both of us a wow factor. 

First off, we ordered 2 main courses and some appetizers to start. It took almost half an hour for our food to arrive, I was patiently waiting and I did not complain. But when my boyfriend wanted to order a nestea to drink, we tried to call over a server 3 times and clearly she saw us but totally ignored us while she walked off. I found that completely rude, if you aren't willing to serve our table at least tell us that someone will be right with us. I work in a restaurant industry myself for a few years now so I didn't expect this kind of service from employees, having to experience Remezzo I was totally thrown off. 

The food overall was okay, the pasta tasted like something you can just make at home..nothing special. Wouldn't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Felt like Italian Food one night and decided to look on Yelp and found this place. The reviews and pictures taken looked very appealing.

However, upon arrival my girlfriend and I were waiting in the lobby for a good 10 minutes without anyone serving us. No hostess to be seen, all servers ignored our existence, and the restaurant was not even half filled. 

Decided to walk out, since they clearly did not want my business."}
{"text":"I'd say this is an OK place...ideally I'd give it 3.5 since it wasn't as bad as a 3. I had the bruscetta which was real good. The goat cheese on there deserved a special mention, soft, delicate and creamy. Then I took the lasagna and that's where it lost points. It was with meat sauce and that's what needs to change in the recipe, it needs to have cut meat balls since there is hardly any meat you taste. 

I have heard good things about the place so may try again. But would order bruscetta and something else off the menu"}
{"text":"I have always a soft corner for the Italian food and heard good reviews always about this restaurant. I went there with lots of expectations but disappointed with the service. Ordered wheat spaghetti which was really good. Our waitress and waiter were rather frazzled forgetting waters, along with missing utensils, napkins and forgetting to bring out dishes, refilling bread etc. They put pepper on the spaghetti w/o even asking. Later I observed they are focusing mostly on a group of people rather than individuals or couples. Would recommend the owners to look carefully in that sector."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch with friends in as many weeks and loved it both times. 

Location - For us, It's conveniently located on the intersection of Warden and Sheppard. It is the closest good Italian restaurant to our place.

Food - I tried Angel-Hair Ali a Olio (10.99$) and Filet of Sole(12.95$), both were very good. My friends tried Manicoti (11.99$), Tortilleni (10.99$) and Veal Sandwich (9.99$) they liked their dishes too.
Tortilleni deserves a special mention as it was simply mind-blowing.
The sauce in the pasta seemed fresh and made from scratch and not out-of-the-can.

Service - was prompt and very courteous.

Decor - The restaurant is huge. It can probably seat over 150 patrons at a time. The two afternoons we were there, the restaurant was almost full. It seemed like most of them were regular clients. This restaurant is not in the touristy part of the Toronto, so I'm guessing all/most were locals. It definitely takes great food and great service to bring in regular clientele to your restaurant over and over again.

I'm a fan and I think I'm going to be a regular here. Plan to bring the wife here soon. 
Would recommend you to be here to believe me."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My friend suggested it and I've passed by it but never visited. I tried the shrimp, crab pasta (can't remember the name) but it was delicious!! The service was prompt and timely - food came out very quickly! Our server was very friendly, described her favourite items. 

I will go again! The place is very busy - great sign!"}
{"text":"Great local Italian restaurant with great food and amazing price. I live and used to work around this area so I come here pretty often. 

Food is always amazing. I always get their baked escargot, fried calamari (ask for tzatziki sauce) and pasta of some sort (usually cream based). Food is constantly consistent and meals come with complimentary bread and butter. Their alcohol is also decently priced (around $4-5 for a pint of domestic).

Service is always great. They never hesitate when I ask for more bread, butter or sauce. Decor is kind of dated though. 

I would definitely return for foods!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a party of 2. I ordered the fettuccine a la napoletana. Frankly, I could have had heated up cream and poured it on my pasta at home instead of coming out and paying $15 for it. The mussels appetizer is tasty but nothing special. Service is so so."}
{"text":"visited : Friday March 09, 2018

My wife and were in the mood for Italian, and Remezzo happened to be close by when I picked her up from work.

The service was very good so I left an ample tip to our server, which I don't usually do at Chinese restos.

Now, I would like to offer a warning for those that manage gout to be careful when dining at this resto.  There are potentially many items on the menu that may trigger a gout flare up.  Lots of dishes contain spinach and beef.  There were some chicken options as well, but not paired with pasta.

We were so hungry on our arrival, I had completely forgotten to take pictures of our appetizers.  We did order veggie spring rolls with came with plum sauce + wasabi mixed dipping sauce along with escargot, the appetizers alone almost ran us $20 CAD.  Oh they did provide complimentary bread basket which was served warm.

As for our main dishes, my wife ordered the Cannelloni and I had the Spaghetti Bolognese.  We shared the 2 dishes.  Both dishes were tasty, except the Cannelloni was a bit too salty for our palates, along with containing spinach.  I do wish there was more anti-gout friendly options.  I didn't finish all the sauce that came with my Spaghetti Bolognese due to the meat sauce being beef based and there was a lot of ground beef left on the plate.  Our main dishes also came close to another $20 CAD.  Total bill hit us for $47 roughly.

Since there were so many dishes that could potentially trigger gout..follow up repeat visits may restrict us only to the appetizer portion of the menu, since that menu had the items that would likely not trigger a gout flare-up within the next few hours.

The calamari seems overpriced @ $11.00 CAD in my opinion, at least for an appetizer (and I do really like calamari).  Would definitely go back for the escargot again."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews I think I will pass. These places need to realize that word of mouth goes a long way."}
{"text":"We decided to come here when Red Lobster was too busy one night. We were pleasantly surprised by the quaint restaurant. We weren't expecting to enjoy it as much as we did! We ordered a Caesar salad to share and 2 mains. The portion was good, but the dishes were a bit bland - we had to add a ton of salt and black pepper to season. Service was mediocre. Would recommend checking it out. Will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner. My girlfriend had 3 bites of her chicken something pasta and now is vommiting. Mussles are a nice app but even my veil parm didn't taste right. Not Italian. Not friendly. Not coming back
.."}
{"text":"I work close to Remezzo and they do have daily lunch specials with reasonable pricing. 

No complaints! 

This seems to be our local favourites cause my customers been giving me rave reviews. You can tell, you walk in there are a bunch of seniors who probably been there since they opened. 

I was quite surprised with renovation as the plaza looks rundown. 

Overall, it's a great Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place has the best onion soup that I've ever had. For sure order the calamari. My grandchildren love it. For a good Italian restaurant this is the one to pick. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place, whether you're in the mood for a meal, a snack, or just for a coffee (regular, espresso, latte) or a glass of wine. I have been going there for over 25 years, and in all that time, their food has never been less than perfectly cooked, except once when it only very well prepared. :)

In all these years I have seen different wait staff working there, and they have always made me feel as if I am a favourite relative come to visit, regardless of how busy they may be (and they're always working hard).

The owners are also very hard working, but always very pleasant and welcoming, treating every guest as a V.I.P. This of course, along with the ambiance, makes one enjoy the entire experience, and want to return frequently. I consider it to be fine dining, but extremely reasonably priced.

While they have excellent Italian fare, if you're in the mood for steak, try the filet mignon. They're also famous for their tiramisu."}
{"text":"In town for a trip to celebrate my daughters birthday and we came here for supper.  Very affordable but no specific kids menu. Good food for the cost. 60$ covered 2 adults and 1 child. I would probably come here again if in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to give it a try contrary to some bad reviews. I should have listened to the reviews or better yet should have known when I got there and saw carpet on the floor. After all Gordon Ramsey does say it's not higenic to have carpet on the floor in a restaurant. This is how it starts: Our waitress was beyond rude, when we were deciding on what to order she was rushing us and rolled her eyes, instead of saying \"I'll give you a minute and come back\" like a waitress should.  When our food came my husbands plate of shrimp and rice had no more than 4 shrimps????? and the rice was swimming in lemon. I've never seen  rice like that or should I say lemon rice pudding what it seemed like!!  Gross!  
My food was lukewarm the titzki sauce was not fresh. Needless to say we left hungry and went to eat somewhere else.  I wouldn't even rate it 1 star actually. So yeah I would NEVER go back let alone recommend  it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years and have seen it evolve from a white chair covered white gloved high end BISTRO to a classic nicely renovated and expanded restaurant with great Italian food and reasonable prices. We went a few months ago and they had changed the menu so drastically that I questioned what their plan was. Menu items included mains that were absolutely not Italian. The menu was all over the place culturally. The meal we were served was sub par and we decided that would probably be our last time there. Sadly this was the place my partner and I also had our first date. This weekend my partner and I decided to give it another try as we were celebrating an anniversary and late Valentines combined. We were so relieved to see all the strange menu items were gone and they'd gone back to traditional Italian. Service was OK.  I ordered wine and was not given the option to upsize to a 9 Oz so the waitress had to take my glass back and replace with a 9. The beer he ordered was a 20 Oz but it came in a 16oz stein, the waitress stated the glass was just deceiving.  We ordered the Luisiana and the DiMare linguini. Not sure how it happened but the DiMare came totally overcooked while the other pasta plate was fine. Despite this we will try again as the prices reflect the level of service and food quality. Two apps two mains, beer and wine plus 2 cappuccino's around $80. I'll just add that if you plan on trying this restaurant you may want to let them know you'd like your pasta al dente if that's how you like it and maybe ask them to show you the difference between one of they're 16 Oz beer steins compared to a 20."}
{"text":"My family always comes here for special occasions and we love the dishes and atmosphere. Very cozy and good for family dining. We have tried different pasta entrées and have had no complaints. Appetizer of mussels are plentiful and portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Their food is really yummy. Some great pastas and sauces. Good place with a lot of vegetarian options. The venue itself is also very pretty and trendy. Perfect place to come for date night. 

However, their service sucks. We had to awkwardly walk and wait around to get seated and even after that, no one bothered to ask if we were ready to order or not. It was about 30 minutes later for them to come. We felt we were the only ones in the restaurant getting treated like that. 

Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"What a beautiful Italian style restaurant*** Very classy place, and the prices are very reasonable; great lighting, music, ambience and atmosphere; absolutely \"bellisimo fantastico\" lol"}
{"text":"My wife and made our first visit to Remezzo. We were pleasantly surprised by how large and clean and comfortable the establishment was. The menu had an excellent variety of Italian dishes. We were pleased with the friendly and professional staff. When our meal was served it looked appealing and tasted fantastic. The best thing about the dinning experience was the price. The restaurant is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It was very good. Went there to have something different then Asian cuisine. Food service was pretty Standart but nothing really to complain about. I'd go again!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Spaghetti Bolognese dishes I have had.  The Caesar salad is second to none.  The meat lovers pizza, awesome.  The Chicken parmesan is also great.  These are some of the things I get on a regular basis.  I've been eating at this restaurant for the past 10 years.  Yes, the decor could use some updating, but why mess with a good thing."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Meat lover pizza was way too salty and so was onion soup. Tiramisu was ok."}
{"text":"Love the place.. Only 15 minutes from where I live. I'm so glade that there's an Italian restaurant outside Toronto (downtown) that actually serves delicious food at a decent price.

Calamari and pastas and incredible. Will visit over n over again ;)

Very large place, quite busy at times"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere average Italian cuisine . Services is mediocre waiters were very nice although it is frustrating when I went with a large group I called twice to confirm a reservation and arrived on time buy they did it not have seats available and then we're avoiding coming near me for about 15 minutes"}
{"text":"I love this place! I came here yesterday night for my 20th birthday with my parents and my friend (my brother was in Waterloo, so she replaced him for the night hahaha). My parents chose this place in Scarborough because it was in the area I was born 20 years ago & they used to go there. Also, I love Italian food! Anyway, the host and the wait staff was so cordial, kind & professional. They answered our questions accordingly greeted us with a smile, and checked in regularly. The food came in a timely manner and everything was on point: from aesthetics/plating to the dish itself. My taste buds were satisfied. :) I got the linguine di mare for $14.99 and was quite satisfied with the portion - just right. I would definitely recommend this place - it's spacious and accommodates for big groups with main floor tables & side booths for smaller groups or for pairs. The interior has a rustic yet classy, with a cozy feel to it, like a neighborhood or family favourite. The prices are quite reasonable for an Italian bistro - entrees range from $11-30 & they have a good drink menu of red wines, white wines, cocktails & beers."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Remezzo, since before it became Remezzo.  For the past 23 years, that I've been eating there,  the excellent well priced food and the warm hospitality of the staff have given me countless great meals and memorable experiences.  

I have never found a Caesar salad to rival the one the make."}
{"text":"Back at Remezzo again! Was impressed with my first visit so decided to come back for more pasta, heehee.

This time, I got the Fettucini Alla Napoletana; a fettuccine dish with tiger shrimp, crab meat and scallions tossed in a white wine cream sauce. The tiger shrimp again was sweet, which I really liked even from the other pasta dish that I tried. I wonder how Remezzo does it! The crab meat was all bunched up and I broke it up so I can have a little bit of crab meat in every bite.

I was waiting for others to get their food and didn't touch mine until the other dishes came along, which might have affected my overall rating on the dish. It got cold and the fettuccine ended up becoming clumpy together, so I don't want to judge this dish based on that. I'll give it another chance next time. But for now, I liked the Linguini Di Mare better.

This time, my friend got the Chicken Florentine which had grilled chicken, sauteed spinach, and sundried tomatoes tossed in a parmesan cream sauce with fettuccine pasta.

I like this dish slightly more than mine. The chicken was chewy and I like the addition of sundried tomatoes as it added a more distinctive taste to the dish. I couldn't really taste a differentiation in the white wine cream sauce in my dish and the parmesan cream sauce in this dish.

This time, however, our bread came slightly cold but still edible. Our waitress this time was really hospitable and lovely. She definitely knew what she was doing and attended our group well.

Still another yummy dinner at Remezzo. They have yet to disappoint so far and I'm still loving the value of food here!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weeknight (tuesday).  Not busy at all,  atmosphere was homey,  staff was nice and courteous.  Service was fast,  did not have to wait long for food.  Food was just ok.  The linguini Louisiana and the chicken marsala was good.  Chicken Fontaine was bland,  and manicotti was really salty.  Good experience, might try again."}
{"text":"Finally came here after much oohing and aahing one day. The outside can be very deceiving- it's a lot bigger on the inside! I was actually quite surprised.

The service was good, our waitress was friendly and was quick when we needed things. However, she wasn't the greatest with suggestions. I asked her thoughts between two dishes and instead she just told me she'll give me a few minutes and walked off.

We ordered the garlic bread to start and that was not good at all. It was burnt and just not a good garlic bread in my opinion. The pasta came shortly after and it was alright. I ordered the chicken florentine pasta and it was meh. It was bland most of the time and the other times the Alfredo sauce was just to much for my taste. However, my husband's special of the day was not bad but still more on the bland side. 

It was a good experience and nice place but my hunt for a mind blowing Italian food place is still a go!"}
{"text":"Bistro is not really the atmosphere.    The restaurant needs updating, the environment is more like a cafeteria.     If they updated with simple white table cloths & nicer flatware that would be an improvement.   Roasted chicken Romano was excellent, Manicotti also good.   Penne Vodka was not vodka sauce at all.   We were looking for a memorable night out & it's just not here.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Wifey was randomly searching for a new place to eat and decided to check out this Italian place.

Wifey had Linguini di Mare but asked for garlic cream sauce instead of basil sauce and request was graciously accommodated. Hubby had classic veal parmigiana. Food was very homey and comforting. Will definitely come back to try their other pasta dishes.

Side note: place looks worn out and outdated inside and out but give the place a chance. Also, spacious and can be baby friendly."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for over 20 years, The food is incredible! and the prices are fantastic as well, The owners are great guys, they are brothers and you usually will always find John behind the bar with a smile and ready to give you great service! I have moved far away and I still travel back there every chance I get. I even have my kids hooked so that says a lot!!!! Keep Up the great work and trust me it is so worth the visit!!!"}
{"text":"Had the escargot for appetizer and pizza as the main.  Both were well prepared and delicious.  The restaurant had a nice cozy feel.

Similar to another review, the bread came after the main course was brought over.  It also took some time before anyone came to take our orders.  I can't blame the server as the reason could be due to below - I'm sure she was doing her best.

It was a Saturday evening when we came and the place is UNDERSTAFFED.  There was a huge line throughout the evening yet empty tables existed throughout the restaurant (they weren't reserved as we noticed people being seated there slowly)"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but my experience here this time was awful. The waitress got our order wrong and when we brought it to her attention, she decided to argue with us saying that we were wrong. Would never recommend this place or come back here."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend and the food definitely didn't disappoint. I ordered the shrimp Alfredo which was so flavourful and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Also got the mussels for my appetizer (which I normally don't do) and really enjoyed that as well--the sauce it came in was so tasty and perfect for dipping bread. To drink I got a mojito which was also very tasty.

The decor at this restaurant is really outdated and the crowd is more of an older one. The service was average--our waitress did take quite a while to come take our orders but other than that, everything went well.

Overall, I enjoyed my time here but it's not near where I live so I probably won't be back unless I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I love their French Onion Soup.
I have never had to wait to be seated, never had a wrong order.

I had the veal parmigiana, which is a 10/10

Remezzo has the best pasta in Scarborough."}
{"text":"For Scarborough, this place has good food. I'm not going to compare it to NY Italian food, but it's above average for what I expected. The waitress was friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable for an Italian restaurant. I got linguine with shrimp, scallops, and clam. 

The clam was actually that chopped clam from the can (I could tell), I thought it was going to be the fresh clam from the shell, but it wasn't bad. A little heavy on the scallions. Marinara sauce was good, shrimp was good, scallops were good. Could've maybe thrown a few more shrimp and scallops in there, but the portion size was satisfying. The linguine (texture-wise) was a bit different than what I'm used to..it wasn't mushy though at least, which was good. 

Bread was ok, the olive oil was actually very good. Deep green and robust flavor. Their appetizers are pretty good actually, we got mussels in a red sauce which was very good and the fried calamari was tender and crisp without being over or under-done. Cozy atmosphere. I would come back at some point. Staff (particularly the owner I assumed I spoke with) was very friendly and hospitable"}
{"text":"Had a Chicken parmigiana with spaghetti bolognese. Big portions and verrrry yummy! I usually go to East Side Mario's but I think this might become my new go-to for italian food. Decor is pretty and cozy. Light was a bit dark but next time I'll just ask for a brighter spot."}
{"text":"Even with a reservation waited 20 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night.  Food was slow to arrive and warm at best.  The food was fresh but the wait staff (who later admitted) was concentrating on one table with a party. Still food should not be just sitting on the kitchen counter.  Coconut shrimp were dry and sauce was bland.  Risotto was clumpy.  
Crowd in here was 75% aged 65 and up.  Could be a problem in a few years.
Would not go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice in the last 2 weeks. I wish I had noticed it before.  If you are looking for authentic Italian food at a very decent price, this is your destination. My first visit I had the butternut squash ravioli; it was delightful, the cream sauce was a welcome surprise. My second visit I kept it classic with a simple order of lasagne. Much respect is given when a restaurant can make such a simple dish so delicious. As an appetizer my boyfriend and I had escargot.  They were buttery and perfectly cooked. The waitresses are friendly. And the place is huge inside,  very cozy vibe. I'm a fan. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know how long this establishment has been here...bit one things for sure a hell of a long time since I was a kid.
Walking into this restaurant you get the sense that it's been a neighborhood favorite, and although it hasn't kept up with the decor trends of the 21st century it's still kept clean, classy and cozy. Their prices are extremely. ..extremely reasonable and their portions are worth it.

For the apps we tried their Bacon scallops! the presentation was as good as it tasted.  The bacon was was too crispy, scallops were tender and the garlic lemon herbed gravy covering this platter was icing on the cake! 4.5/5

The mains! due to the cold weather, I couldn't help  but order any dish that had spicy italian sausage, so I opted for THE LOUISIANA dish which reminded me of a Jumbulaya-southern dish with an italian twist! marinara sauce was not too acidic, giant shrimps, delish italian sausage, al-dente linguine, portions, presentation and taste satisfied my tummy! 

Overall Remezzo is your your go-to for classic italian food if you're ever in the area (Warden/ Sheppard Ave E)"}
{"text":"Mother of Goddd!!! I loveeeeee their Tiramisu. It melts in your mouth. Then you want to order another one. Then you go home thinking why u didnt. Hahaah. I would donate a kidney to take that recipe."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years, they kept their food standard well, Tiramisu is the must try dessert it just melt in your mouth and not overly sweet, overall a great family restaurant and great pasta!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed but it's not a surprise. I had their chicken parmesan twice and it's always good. We also tried their ravioli mushroom that was on special and that was to die for. They're my new favourite ita restaurant. Not to mention the price, everything is decent and not too pricey."}
{"text":"Honestly can say the food was great and the service was extremely. For the very reason that we ordered and got our food an appetizers within 5 minutes tops and it was warm and good is the reason why I'm giving it 5 stars. Peace of advice if your wondering what to get i can honestly say that the chicken parmesan is by far amazing. The chicken was amazingly flavourful and was not dry at all like some places make it. All in all would say a great jem for italian food in scarborough."}
{"text":"This has recently become one of my go-to joints based primarily on proximity. However, for years it has been a family favourite. 

I have personally tried a couple of their pasta dishes as well as a salad or two. Service is warm, friendly and prompt.

Decor allows for a relaxed atmosphere with evenly spaced out tables and booths spread out among a couple of levels. This arrangement also allows for a quiet dining experience.

Both their chicken penne and butternut squash ravioli have been excellent with a plentiful amount of fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked pasta. The meat has always been moist and juicy. Their beet and goat cheese salad was also delicious.

For dessert, they may have 10-15 options but their is only one dessert you should try as I've never seen anywhere else and that is their super caramel crunch which is divine. 

For Scarborough, it is one of the best places to dine when craving Sit down Italian in a family friendly restaurant.

Strong 4 star dining establishment!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Food was decent and affordable, but was not the 4 star experience I was seeking. Sorry."}
{"text":"Wow, we haven't been here in about 15 years.  It's like time has stopped once you step through the doors and I like it.  I swear the dishes taste the same.

Bruschetta - good
Fettucini Alla Napoletana - a dash of salt and all good
Linguini Di Mare - good
Beet and Goat Cheese Salad - really good
Cheesecake - good

So glad that it's still there."}
{"text":"I went with my date yesterday to Remezzo for dinner. I usually passed by this place whenever I was heading to the highway, but never ended up there. We ordered a French Onion Soup, Bacon & Scallops, Linguine di Mare, and Linguine Louisiana. The portions were pretty big, and it was fairly good. It wasn't truly authentic, but the service was great. Also serves a nice ambiance for dates."}
{"text":"The price is great, service typically stellar and overall a favourite of mine. Try the butternut squash and manicotti if you're a cheese lover."}
{"text":"Great place in the neighborhood! Pastas and pizza are great! Excellent service! If you want a last minute date and have a good meal then check out this place!"}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a year, as it is close to my office and a favorite for events. I love that they offer gluten free pasta, as I am intolerant to gluten and it is always a treat to be able to enjoy pasta. I am also vegetarian and they are always greay about taking the meaty or chicken out of pasta or salads. 

Casprese and Greek salads are always tasty, as are the specials. I avoid the soups due to possible flour as a thickener, but my companions always like them. The fish is great too.

I don't eat bread but my companions say the comelementary bread and butter is great. Hot bread!

Busy at lunch, but after 1pm, better. Service is better at less busy times, but never awful and always friendly."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's a nice comfortable homey neighbourhood Italian restaurant. With good food. And lots of veggie options.
As a vegetarian family, we hate going to places where we have to pick 1-2 entrees and that's it. Here each of us had a different entree and they were all excellent. I had the butternut squash ravioli, my son had manicotti and my wife a Veggie oglio angel hair pasta. All really good served quickly. And reasonably priced at 11-15 dollars an entree. Service is friendly. What's not to like."}
{"text":"Great food. Great value. We've been eating at Remezzo's for years and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend the Chicken Marsala."}
{"text":"1 star - I'm not coming back here.  

What does one do when you're in Scarborough and have a craving for pasta?  Well, I've tried going to Fratellis and waiting for 30 min for a table for 2 but at my age, your patience for such nonsense runs out very quickly.  Why you can't make a reservation at a restaurant for 2 and show up for your meal in peace is beyond me.  So I turned to Yelp.  4 stars based on 69 reviews?  Can't be bad, right?  Wrong.  Again. 

I should have known from reading their online menu that Remezzo would not be what I thought when I saw various non-Italian items like spring rolls, chicken quesadilla under their appetizer section, chicken kabobs and ribs under their main.   

I made a reservation via Bookenda and we were off to this packed plaza for what was supposed to be a pasta experience \"akin to Terroni\" as written by one reviewer.  I'm sorry to say, if you've ever been to Terroni (any of the locations), you would not be writing such blasphemy.  

Attention to detail was lacking in a big way from the moment we arrived.  The vast dining room was pretty full for a Saturday night and even with a reservation, they had to \"create\" a table (right next to the entrance) for us.  Once seated, it took forever to place an order and no plates were provided for the bread basket (stale cold kind served with round packets of butter) or shared appetizers until we asked for it.  

When our server brought out a bottle of red wine when we ordered a white and looked at us completely doe-eyed, the disappointment kept building.  The bottle we had ordered wasn't even available, the server said.  \"It hasn't been available for a while.\"  Well, then why don't you reprint a new wine list?  Surely with so many patrons paying good money for their food, they can afford a small print job?

The coconut shrimp (ordered based on Yelp recommendations, Yikes!) was straight out of M&M meat shops' freezer, Caprese was a saddest excuse that didn't live up to its name with pale slices of tomatoes (aren't tomotoes in season now??) and maybe 3-4 pieces of grilled mushroom (the menu says portobello but the pieces were so small that we couldn't identify it to be such) in the mixed green salad tossed in Balsamic vinaigrette.  

The butternut squash ravioli had a distinctively burnt taste which I couldn't tell which ingredient was imparting and I'm positive that the raviolis were filled with pumpkin and not butternut squash.  The cream sauce it was bathed in was bland and lacking.  Nothing in this dish complimented each other.  Another disappointing Yelp recommendation.  

Pasta di mare was the better dish out of the two mains.  Although using fresh pasta was commendable, over-cooking it was not.  The tomato sauce it was served with was way too busy flavour-wise and I just wanted a simple sauce.  

We didn't want to bother staying around for dessert so we paid the bill promptly and left.  

Next time I have a craving for pasta, I'll drive the extra miles to find a proper pasta, not what they serve up at Remezzo."}
{"text":"Most recent visit made me take away 1 star. It was for my sisters birthday and this was during the winter ice storm which knocked out power in many areas of Toronto. The traffic lights were out at Remezzo's intersection but I prayed they had electricity which they did. Started off with crab cakes and lobster bisque soup. The lobster bisque (soup of the day) was more like a tomato soup and not a sliver of lobster to be found. Also had a tortellini pasta and a cannoli pasta which were good but didn't compare to the Linguini Di Mare. Still had a great dining experience as usual overall."}
{"text":"Remezzo never failed to keep their consistency when it comes to food and service. We come here often and I've tried a few pasta dishes. They were all great. So far I had the Angel hair surf & turf, (love the coconut curry sauce) Angel hair Agli Olio ( this is my new favourite) , lasagna. One thing I love about them is that they never cheap out on the meat. There's always balance between the meat / seafood and the pasta. 
They also have \"the best\" cesar salad. It's perfect for starter. 
Their bruschetta is also a good option for a starter. It's always fresh off the oven with fresh tomatoes. 
The prices are very good for the quality of their food. Service is always great. 

This is my Italian Restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"It was very busy this particular Friday night but the guy who came to greet me at the door asked how many in my party and I said 4. I was the first to arrive so was alone. Many people came in after and were seated before me. When I questioned it, he said he thought I was with those ladies, and pointed to a group at the bar, that I was no where near. When I was finally sitting at a table (that rocked as it was uneven and the booth felt like I was going to bounce into the ceiling) I waited 15 mins before flagging someone down to get me water. Our waitress was crusty! She wasn't pleasant, didn't even introduce herself and seemed like she didn't want to be there. 
Friends arrive, we order apps, description of how many of an item would be helpful on the menu. 4 of us and only 2 crabcakes. Great. Split it is. Some app. Our waitress went home and another took over - thank God. She was at least nice
Meals came, friends salmon was overcooked, another's fries way too salty and my manicotti was flavorless - needed some serious salt. The best thing about going to Remezzo was the company I held, which would've been the same wherever we went. 
Won't go back"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and at the right temperature. Great variety to chose from. Attentive service, comfortable surroundings, reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone looking for a casual, cozy place to eat."}
{"text":"Place seems clean until I ate a plastic wrapper in my deep fried calamari. The waitress just took it away without any offering or asked if I was okay. First and last time at this establishment."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food, we ordered the chicken parmagiana and butter squash stuffed ravioli. Great tasting Italian food."}
{"text":"Would actually give 3.5. Came on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 3. The restaurant was quite empty at 12:30, but once 1 ish the whole restaurant was packed and a bit too loud.  We ordered one appetizer, 2 pastas, one pizza and a slice of cake.

Appetizer was the escargot. The cheese was $1 extra. Enjoyed the butter and garlic flavour but a bit bland. 

Angel hair surf and turf, and chicken soemthing. The surf and turf was flavourful but a bit too sweet. The chicken dish was a bit lacking in flavour but both was okay

Meat lovers pizza was a tad too salty but then again it's all meat. Also it was a bit too oily, however it came out hot and the cheese was stretchy 

For dessert we got the chocolate truffle cake. It was good nothing too special."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was very busy, but was seated and served quickly. Meal came with warm bread to start and we ordered the chicken parm and butternut squash ravioli. Good food and reasonable prices! Will definitely come back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times in the past several years and they have been quite consistent with their food and menu. Most recently, I have had their pizza and veal parmigianna. I'm not a fan of their pizza, but their veal parmigianna was flavourful and not overly breaded. They also let me choose my pasta instead of automatically giving me spaghetti on the side. They often have daily or weekly specials written on a board in front of the restaurant.

I usually come here with my coworkers for lunch as it is the closest Italian restaurant around. However, each time I come, I never expect to have a \"quick lunch.\" The service is quite slow when it comes to bringing out the food. The restaurant is huge and it gets busy during the lunch hour, and it appears that they are often short on wait staff. Tables are usually not cleared immediately after customers leave so I often see empty uncleared tables when I walk in. Regardless, the staff is very friendly and they usually apologize for any delays.

I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner, particularly if I am not in a hurry."}
{"text":"We had my mothers 65th birthday party dinner here and I have to say it was really good. Usually in my family there is at least one person who does not like there meal. Not here, everybody was happy with there meals and all hot different things. The staff were really nice and made our dinning experience that much better. Bravo and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"My dining experience wasn't that great tonight because the restaurant was so busy to the point that we waited more than 20 mins just to get our drinks. I can understand cocktails take time but beer... come on... 20mins+ just to get a beer is not okay.

The bread was served until we asked. And main course took more than 60mins to come after ordered.


Mussels is really good. Fresh, perfectly cooked and balanced flavour. I would definitely recommend that.

But main course, meh.
Prime ribs are dry, sauce tastes good thou.
8oz steak perfectly cooked (medium rare).
Shrimp and scallops taste alright, but it looks like home cooking and are small.
Overall the food is fine but to me it is a bit over priced with what i got."}
{"text":"Appetizer:
1. Mussels - steamed P.E.I. mussels in a spicy tomato broth ($9.99)

Pastas:
1. Butternut Squash Ravioli - fresh pasta tossed with caramelized onions, spinach, mushrooms, and roasted peppers in a roasted garlic cream sauce ($13.99)

2. Penne Siciliano - hot Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, and onions in a light tomato cream sauce ($11.99)

Dessert:
1. Tiramisu - there famous house speciality ($5.99)

Overall:
The meals were good and flavourful. The prices were reasonable. 

Service:
The service however was not the greatest. As we finished our dessert, the waiter quickly got us the bill (we didn't even ask for the bill yet) and she had the machine ready and asked us how are we paying today. The restaurant wasn't closing yet either so I didn't know what rush was she in (our waiter). Overall, I felt that she was really rude about it. If she was finishing her shift and wanted us to pay. She should of least let us know rather than dropping the bill on us."}
{"text":"Pros:
Well done pasta
Prices are fair

Cons:
Could use some options for kids

Remezzo is your old school Italian restaurant nestled in what's basically a Chinese plaza now.    I've driven by this place multiple times and have always wanted to try.  

Walking in, this place is much bigger inside than what the outside looks.  There are plenty of seats here.  They can pretty much accommodate any size party here.  We came on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately.

Remezzo's menu features pretty much what you would expect from an Italian restaurant.  Pastas, pizzas, some steak and ribs and desserts adorn the menu.  They have a good assortment to choose from as well.  I was a little surprised to see that for a family restaurant that's been around as long as it has, Remezzo doesn't have a kids meal of any sort. Regardless, we ordered the Chicken Florentine and a Spaghetti with the works (mushrooms and meatballs).  A pizza was also ordered to share with the family. 

The food comes out pretty quickly after you order.  I'm usually super skeptical when pasta dishes come out quickly.  It makes me think the pasta has been pre-cooked.  I'm not a fan of pre-cooked pasta because I love pasta al dente.  The pasta did not taste pre cooked which was a relief for me. The chicken florentine was pretty good.  I think it could of used more sauce but my wife seemed to enjoy it.  The spaghetti was pretty good as well.  The sauce near the end was a little on the salty side.  They do not cheap out on the toppings on their pizza here.  It was loaded with toppings that were falling off with every bite because there were so much.

Overall, I really liked Remezzo.  It's nice to know that you can still get a good plate of pasta for around $10-$15.  I've seen places start charging around $20 for pasta and quite can't get myself to pay that much for pasta.  Remezzo has a nice homey feel with great service.  I will definitely be back to try some other things."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant so many times in the past and never had the opportunity to try it. I finally was around the area and decided to come here for dinner.

I got the Fettuccini Alla Napoletana (tiger shrimp, crabmeat and scallions tossed in white wine cream sauce) and the Meat Lovers pizza.

The pasta was incredibly delicious. There were generous amounts of shrimp and crab meat, the pasta was not overdone like most restaurants and the sauce was very creamy.

The pizza was very mediocre. It was done well but it was nothing special.

I would skip the pizza and try their pastas instead."}
{"text":"In the last twenty years, the demographics of the Agincourt area has shifted to become heavily dominated by Asian businesses.  Remezzo is one of the few Western-style restaurants that have survived and proves good reason for doing so.  

My mom has been coming here for the last decade and swears by the pasta but I've only been here for the sweets; I was won over by the tiramisu on my first visit and have brought friends back for late-night chats over dessert.  I'd be interested in coming back here to sample the pastas. Unfortunately, there are only two or three vegetarian options here.

A good quiet place to have a heart-to-heart on a weeknight."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because for what it is, I thought it was excellent. Its not a fancy 5 star dining restaurant. Its more of a casual, not too expensive place to get Italian food. I grew up in Scarborough and always used to see this place, but never been. Went there for the first time on a Sunday night. I had the spaghetti w meatballs but changed the pasta to angel hair. Tasted excellent. My date had the baked pasta and it was also excellent. Definitely coming back here again. Also large inside w plenty of seats."}
{"text":"Classy joint with an authentic Italian feel. The food is great and they even have their own house wines."}
{"text":"Pretty snazzy digs with reasonable prices.
That's a plus in my books.
We were looking for a good place to grab a pizza and this place turned out to be a good one. At around $10 each you can't beat that.
We grabbed 4 kings and went home with 1 1/2
Had some salads for appetizers and a couple of us had the lobster bisque.
Service was good the overall experience was nice

The bill was minimal.
Gonna be hitting this place again real soon"}
{"text":"We had been here a while back and decided to come again. It is a very nice restaurant with a cosy atmosphere (not too bright and not too dark). I ordered the angel hair surf and turf and my wife had the salmon.  The food came quickly and it was delicious.  We also decided to have tiramisu for desert and I was surprised by the size of it (bigger than I expected). It was creamy and delicious. The server was friendly and helpful throughout the whole meal. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"Ullhhhh! I went there for lunch, ordered veggie Tortellini , All I could taste was salt. Me and my hubby tried 3-4 pieces and then I called the server and told her that its too salty I am unable to eat it. She said its almost gone(where as I could see everything in the dish) so we just paid the bill and left hungry ."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food is really good and the service was fast. Nothing special to go here from another side of the city but if you are in the area it's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It kind of feels like the Mandarin. Only it's Italian and not all you can eat. It felt like how an American would have envisioned an Italian restaurant in the 50s - a bit gaudy, inauthentic and dated. 

The prices are very reasonable and the menu is very extensive. Mind you, all I ordered was a salad. I could be a little biased because Italian food isn't really my thing - I find it very heavy. The vegetarian/ vegan options here were very limited but everyone I was with said the food was great!

It was very busy and very noisy in here - lots of large families celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, you name it.

Not my cup of tea but based on the sheer volume of people in this place, my opinion is not widely shared. Clearly they're doing something right!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a mediocre experience. Parking was rather tricky in the tiny parking lot although we were seated upon arrival.

Our waitress was rather frazzled forgetting waters, along with missing utensils, napkins and forgetting to bring out dishes, refilling bread etc.

The veal parmesan? was mediocre. It had plenty of cheese and the veal was a tad chewy... The side of steamed vegetables were okay.

Finished off with the tiramisu which was also lackluster and it had sugar crystals in it..."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little restaurant serving very delicious and homey Italian staple dishes. I came here a few years ago on a Valentine's day with my then-boyfriend/now-husband. I can't remember what I had on that day but I remember having a wonderful experience. It's not a fancy restaurant by any means. The wallpapers are retro and lights are old-fashioned, but it doesn't feel tacky and actually gives a feel of comfort when I'm inside. The clientele there I noticed tends to be older people (I wonder if it's because it is very close to a senior home), but sitting among all these old couples makes both me and my husband feel humbled by their lasting love (we think). My husband would joke that one day we will become just like them, old \"Agnes and Harold\" sitting and enjoying a nice meal here decades from now.

Thus it is no surprise that we decided to come here again recently for our fifth anniversary. Nothing has changed in the decor, as expected. But the service is still excellent. 

I had the escargot to start, sautéed in white wine, garlic-butter and herbs. This is the only dish of the night that I wish was better. On hindsight I should have ordered it with melted mozzarella cheese  (for an extra dollar), as I didn't enjoy the acidity of dish otherwise.

For my main I got the Veal Scallopine - sauteed with Marsala wine and accented with mushrooms and red peppers, with spaghetti Bolognese. Oh my god this blew me away. The veal was done so tender, and the sauce was so delicious, I was literally mopping up the plate trying to get all of the sauce. 

My husband ordered their New England Crab Cakes to start, and let's just say, him and I both enjoyed this, hehe. I took one bite of it and I ended up taking more bites. It was perfectly crunchy without being harsh on the palate, and the crab meat was well seasoned and tender inside. 

He also had the Manicotti as his main - Fresh pasta stuffed with seasoned ricotta and spinach and baked in a basil tomato sauce with mozzarella cheese. I didn't steal too many bites from him as I was so absorbed in my Veal Scallopine, but my husband seemed to have enjoyed this dish very much as well. Despite it being a vegetarian dish, it was super hearty and filling. 

This place is also ideal for family dinners. Seating is spacious and the staff here is very friendly. I have had no problems with waiting for water  refills, ordering, and waiting for the check. If you want to experience a nice down-to-earth Italian diner, come here!"}
{"text":"1.5 stars. I've been here a few times and while the food is always good, service is a hit or miss. The younger waitresses were usually friendly or at least bearable, however the older waitress (I think her name is Helen) has a nasty attitude and is vile to us during our visits. During my first visit I thought she was just in a bad mood. But after my second, third, and forth time there, I've concluded that she's just rude and maybe a bit racist (I've seen her being super friendly with the Caucasian customers - we are Asian). This restaurant should really do something about it, as I've seen in the previous reviews that other people have similar experience as me. My parents always give a generous tip here and we are always courteous, so I don't get what's her deal.

I've always ordered their pastas and they are great. Portions are big and it's always flavourful. My favourite pasta is the butternut squash ravioli. My mom's is the lasagna and my dad's is the linguine Louisiana. All are pretty tasty.

We always order their bruschetta as a starter each time and we all love it.

Their desserts are great too. My favourite is the caramel crunch.

Price is good."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years & we came back for my mother in law's birthday with a large group of 15. Despite our large numbers service was great. I had the salmon with veggies & rice. Very delicious. The salmon just melted in my mouth. Hubby & I shared dessert & that was delicious too! This place is amazing in every way. The decor, the service, cleanliness & quality of food. It's funny because it's in a plaza at the corner of Warden & Sheppard. Not the nicest looking of places but Remezzo is first class."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tuscan Sandwich (but due to a misunderstanding, I was given the Tuscany Salad instead) while my friend ordered the Grilled Veal Sandwich.

The portions were good and filled us up, but the food was average tasting. Personally, I don't think it's worth the price. This salad was $12!!"}
{"text":"I've lived next to Remezzo for 15 years. Last week I decided to venture in and dine for the first time. I was blown away by the extremely friendly customer service by every waiter/waitress I've had the pleasure of speaking to. The food was excellent, especially the Spaghetti Works and the Lasagna. Havent tried the bar but looks to be very classy. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone having a craving for Italian food. I'm just kicking myself for my trying Remezzos earlier"}
{"text":"The service was good!  the decoration is interesting.  pasta and salad were good. Overall, this is a nice Italian restaurant. Four stars!!!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
I have walked, bussed, and driven by this restaurant for more than a decade now and I finally took the time to check it out! I ordered the veal parm and the portion size was big! Veal was tender enough and the spaghetti was a little overcooked, but wasn't a big deal for me. Would be nice if it came with some vegetables. 

Ambiance: 4 stars
The interior was WAY nicer than what I was expecting. Very grand with its dark wooden decor and plushy both seats. Nice place for a cozy date.

Service: 4 stars
Very friendly waitress. Good knowledge of menu and daily specials. Got everything we needed. Wish she had the brought the bread before our meals were  served but once again, no big deal. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Damn, what a shame.. I really had high expectations for this place. Saw all the good reviews on here and was convinced it was amazing! I'm going to give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was because its a Friday. We got 2 pizzas a lasagna, a fettuccini, and bacon wrapped scallops. Scallops were extremely oily and came in a escargot plate for some reason, confused us a little.. Pizza and pasta took longer than usual and when it finally came, pizza was okay, lasagna was too salty and the fettuccini was under cooked... Unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"Solid place for Italian food. The food isn't fancy but its decent and it's pretty cheap to boot. The calamari we got was kinda soggy...  But our manicotti and angel hair pasta didn't disappoint. The tiramisu is tasty though it doesn't look very impressive. This place could use a bit of a facelift... The decor is pretty dated."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying what a fabulous place this used to be, the food and service were once top notch!!

My 1st visit here in 3yrs, and it was a ghost town!
The place smells like an old hockey bag, is very dingy and the bench seating has zero cushioning left in the cushions. 

We were seated promptly which was nice, and the server seemed friendly but could perhaps improve  her \"customer service skills\".

Our Cokes were FLAT, and when we asked if they had another fountain or canned pop received a flat NO - then she walked away. No offer to bring something else..no appology... Nothing.

We added mushrooms to the sauce, but without advising us the server decided to add double mushrooms...which was a surprise on our bill. Would have been nice to clarify if that's what we wanted instead of just adding it!

The Tuscany salad was delicious and fresh, sadly the 2 orders of Chicken parm with Spagetti bolognais was not so terrific. The sauce was extremely oily and bland, while the chicken had no seasoning either. 

Dinner - $70
Upset stomache - $0
Dissappointment over the poor food/service - Priceless!

Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been back numerous time since my review more than 4 years ago.

My work always host our annual dinner here on the Saturday over Father's Day weekend. Even with our group of over 15 with a full restaurant, our food has always been good and service excellent.

Grilled Veal Chop, New York Striploin, Filet Mignon under $30 all cooked perfectly medium rare. 

Coconut Shrimp and Calamari still my favourite appetitizers.

And of course dessert.

Sour Apple Martini at $7? after all these years definitely a deal."}
{"text":"The food here at Remezzo's is good.  It is standard Italian fare.  I was in Scarborough on business when I went to Remezzo's for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a confused hot-mess. It's torn between fine Italian dining and American fast food. Chicken quesadillas, coconut shrimp, pizza and pastas. Everything tasted mediocre at best - under seasoned or seriously overcooked. I hate that I'm going to admit this, but the best thing on the menu was the coconut shrimp. Interior is about 25 years old...and that's being modest. Would not go back out of my own volition."}
{"text":"Good Service, but all the pasta dishes that we ordered were so bland and had no flavour. It was very disappointing! We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and carefully prepared. Service was great. My server, Rebecca, is awesome"}
{"text":"Came here with a friends for a birthday party. The setting and atmosphere hwre is not bad. A little out dated and not Noreen but very homey. The service however for a group of 14 was ok. I had problem with my sever and my order, the others were fine, she constant Ly cut me off and tried to move on when I was putting in my order. She apparently did not write down I wanted a Caesar salad( however, I won't blame her cuz there was too much food any how) I got a virigin piña colada and classic spaghetti and meatballs with mushroom ( my friend who comes her often said it would make all the difference..) however, when the food came I was upset. Therer were 3 meat balls mediums ones, no biggie I don't mind, until I fork one and take a bite... It was cold... Like frozen cold... Barely warmed through (thinking maybe microwaved???) So I quickly use my fork to mash the meatballs into the sauce. I then try the pasta... It was so hard... I'm used to softer pasta. However, the pasta was hard and very chewy. So all in all the dish wasn't great, the sauce was bland but at least it was warm,had to but alot of chesse on top for flavour. That that point the dish was really not worth $15 I mean I can buy $1 pasta and sauce from the supermarket next door and make it better at home. However, I was there with friends and tow of them ordered the seafood pasta, and one had more sauce they the other, the two dishes looked and tasted completely different even though it was the same order. This place has a chef that completely disregards quality and portion control. Maybe I wad this one time, and maybe it's the timing of our meal ( we ate a late lunch.) Maybe their lunch chef was really bad compared to the dinner. I dunno but how can you mess up classic spaghetti and meatballs....."}
