{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere welcoming,and Jessica our waitress was great! Will definitely go again . It's a place we will be pleased to bring friends to."}
{"text":"Ok...don't listen to the 1-star wackos. I've been here 5-10 times and have been satisfied with my experience every time. I frequent a lot of restaurants and bars and being in east Mesa I feel it's difficult to find a gem. Our service has been average or above on every visit, the food has been good or above on very visit and I feel the customer service (especially as of late, we've had Brittany the last 3 times) has been excellent. Last visit we wanted a sampler of appetizers which wasn't on the menu and the manager arranged for that to happen. Lo and behold on the very next visit there's a sampler dish that allows you to choose certain items of your liking. I honestly think east Mesa options are limited for places to eat but The Hub is one I've always been satisfied with. Special ordered margaritas are around $5, they taste great and aren't weak, I don't think anything is overpriced. They always seem to have some event going on, karaoke, cage fighting (tonight) and among others, I don't participate or watch but some may enjoy. I really hope they are around for good as the establishment can't seem to keep a tenant. In short...give it a shot! Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"THANK YOU for having a huge awesome gluten free menu and for doing a good job of preventing cross contamination.  You guys rock.  And the lemon ginger rice-chicken bowl rocks too!  :) :) :)"}
{"text":"The greatest sports bar dining experience I have ever had. Starting with Austin, our server, who was attentive and knowledgeable. A Guiness, waters and a tasting flight was served within minutes. We ordered what the server suggested (daily special: marinated steak tacos) plus appetizers (fried pickles/jalapeno onion straws) and were pleasantly surprised.  Tacos at a burger joint was a risky/bold choice that paid off. Don't expect tacos from south of the border. Do expect a thick slab of bbq beef marinated and cooked to perfection. Before our food arrived, a manager brought us some complimentary corn bread because he had heard it was our first time to the place.  From start to finish we were taken care of and left very happy customers who will return again to next weeks happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great food and we got GREAT SERVICE from the Oklahoma kid. Welcome to Arizona, we are lucky you moved to this great state.Keep your great attitude!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite wings place. I have never had wings like this. Arizona smoked... they were like fall off the bone ribs, yummy"}
{"text":"First let me say this probably my favorite place, BUT, tonight I had the worse experience I have had. I got there about 7:30 and set on the patio. Ordered a drink, short, no fruit, lime or lemon! When I got it, ice was melting and had a lime, hell, no big thing! I ordered a cup of soap, received a bowl, when server came by I told him and he said \"oh sorry, you want me to change it for a cup\", I had already eaten some of it! Oh, no adjustment to the bill! Then I ordered Big Hub (hamburger), with garlic hub chips! Took unusually long time, finally he brought my order. When I got home, I had fries instead of Hub chips! I know no big problem and that's right it won't stop me from returning but what if it been somebody's first visit?"}
{"text":"After have eating here a few a times and always leaving completely satisfied. I decided this would be my place to throw a 50th bday gathering. With approx 55 guests this Was that the BEST decision I made. Robert and his staff accommodated all our needs and made the day extra special. Food was great, our wait staff was excellent, over all the party was awesome!! (Some of our guest came from Tucson and Surprise area and say they wish they a Hub close to them).  I highly recommend the Hub!"}
{"text":"We were a party of six and was informed of a 15-20 minute wait. This was more than acceptable to us at 7pm on a Friday evening.  Our server, Katee, was quick and personable in a packed restaurant. We fully appreciated her vibrant personality from her friendly welcome, courteous service to her refreshing blue hair! 5 stars for service, food was average (3)."}
{"text":"Food was good, wings were great, service was AMAZING! We had a graduation party there last weekend and reserved the conference room. It was set up well and ready for us when we got there. We had a wide assortment of apps and entrees. Portions were very large and food was good. The wings however, especially the smoked jefe were some of the best I've ever had. But what was most impressive was our awesome server Roger. This guy was seriously one of, if not THE, best servers I've ever had. He was very attentive to our needs and extremely friendly. My in-laws have already been back once since and we plan on frequenting this place after our last visit. Great work Hub team!"}
{"text":"The smoked wings are amazing! We also got the pepperoni pizza and the house salad, and both were good. On Sunday's they have $2 bloody Mary's, which makes for a great night of football."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out this place BUT I was VERY disappointed.... Went  on a Friday night with the family, the place was busy in the bar part of the restaurant.  Had to wait awhile before we were acknowledge and the girl server when asked about the beer selections did not know what they had at the bar.... We ordered the honey hot wings extra crispy which was the best thing of the meal.  It came with a side of ranch and two celery stalks. (see Picture) LOL .. I got a cheeseburger w/ bacon ( see Picture) and my son got  a hamburger w/ bacon. The burgers were bland and it came with SALTY fries.  My boyfriend got the pastrami.  Pastrami is salted when cured and added salt makes it very Salty.  It came to our table very SALTY.  Tried the cheese pizza from the kids menu for my 4 year old and it was bland and looked messy.  The cook added to much salt to our meal in the fries and sandwich.  The burgers had no flavor and  I will NOT be going back... Its not worth the price and irritation of a BAD meal.  The whiskey sour he had was also very weak for the price. Although the restaurant was clean and it look very nice in its renovated state that's the only reason it got a star."}
{"text":"I love this place! By far my favorite restaurant. Their gluten free menu is amazing and there are so many options."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The service is always great and the menu is fantastic. Tons of gluten free options. I've tried almost everything and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Emily is the best, the rest of the staff also, but if you want a perfect experience, ask for Emily."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Service was great and they have a large, yummy gluten free menu. They even give a special treat to first time guests and kids."}
{"text":"By far the best wait staff, food, and attention to detail I have ever experienced at a pub.  My family and friends ALWAYS want to come back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The business is going downhill in the past six months. I believe that their prices are too high for the quality of food they're putting out nowadays. seriously bar food trying to be a restaurant is one thing but charging 2 to $5 more than it should be is another. The atmosphere is good if you just want to watch TV and drinking beer. Other than that it's a hit or miss on the food which is overpriced."}
{"text":"Place is nice looking and cozy lits if tvs but service was bad. Was there on a Saturday night about 10:30pm and felt like more employees than customers. Ordered a Cpt. Morgans and coke seemed like it was watered down coke. Had to wait about 15 minutes before waiter even came by to say he would be back. Hopefully the waiter and staff was just having a bad night as no one was friendly till we left and then it was just the security guy."}
{"text":"We just moved to east Mesa and looking for a non chain restaurant. This place is great! Tons of tvs! The wings are always awesome! The green chili cheesesteak....yum!!! Great fries! I like that the treat the kiddos to the treasure chest for good behavior at the end of the meal! Service is good and pour great adult beverages!!! We have been there 4 times and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food & Drinks. I had the 10 dollar grilled cheese and omg so good! My Husband & I loved this place & for sure will come again."}
{"text":"Good food, good vibes, and good place! We brought our 3 year old and she got a key to the treasure if she was \"good\" throughout the meal. Of course she was and she was happy she got to take a gift home. She already asked to come back. Lol  The only thing I recommend is that if you have a kid is to request a booth or a regular table or they might try and seat you at a bar height table which was too high for 3 year old. Other than that everything was all good! :)"}
{"text":"For a neighborhood bar and restaurant, they sure have a great menu. I looove the fish tacos plate followed by the tasty burgers. I also was recently introduced to an eye opening plate of fresh clams in a bowl of buttered sauce that was cooked to perfection. The staff is always on its game and attentive. The price is good and again the food for a bar it great."}
{"text":"Myself and a few of my Wisconsinite friends were craving a fish fry . We realize it's not a popular thing in AZ but we looked anyways . We found the hub was having a fried fish special so we stopped in . Our waitress Casey was very friendly and polite . We told her it was our first time in and out of nowhere a staff member stopped by to give us a complimentary piece of delicious cornbread.  We all ordered the fish, it came with two sides and really good garlic cheese bread . The fish was make perfectly ! The portions where really big and I was very pleased ! I winter in AZ and I will be coming back for the food and to catch a game. Thanks   Ps. very kid friendly ! they have a treasure chest full of toys for the kids to pick from ."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food, attentive service - thanks Jake:) and walls covered with TVs...new great spot for game day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from MN and a local from Mesa recommended we try The Hub. YUM! Everything we ordered had incredible flavor! We had the caprese salad, wings and the club sandwich on a pretzel bun! I promise you will NEVER have a club sandwich like it. The service was great and the chef even came out to ask how our meal was. Loved the bar area and they have like 50 flat screen TVs. They added a unique touch with \"the treasure chest\" for kids. Get to The Hub.. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here tonight to watch the fights and of course grab a bite. Ordered the southwest steak torta. It took awhile to wait for it but never complained. The manager came out and apologized for the 30 min delay and offered us free drinks. Thought that was pretty nice. The meal had good flavor but was too chewy. Again we didn't complain and the manager came out to see how our meal was. So we told him the truth, he explained very professionally that his normal chef was on vacation and hired someone that was new to cutting the meat. Makes sense! Anyhow, I would come back in a heartbeat as long as a manager like \"Robert\" is in charge. Good customer service. Very happy customers!!"}
{"text":"They have great bar food! The wings are pretty good, as are the chipotle potato skins, calzones, smoky queso, French dip sandwich... you get the point. Their happy hour and daily drink specials are pretty great."}
{"text":"Great food. Best gluten free menu for Miles!! We come here all the time to enjoy their great gf food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Crazy busy and loud.  The service was great.  We were with a large group and the waitress didn't charge us for our drinks (sodas) because we didn't eat.  Just stopped in to see people we knew.  Some rude people in the parking lot.  Guess they don't like old people. Ha Ha.  But they weren't employees of The Hub.  Left a bad impression non the less."}
{"text":"We have gone to the Hub twice a week for almost 3 months and we are usually 10 or 12 people. We all agree that none of us have ever had a bad meal or bad service. The food is consistently delicious and they serve meals that are not on every menu at all the other restaurants. I would recommend The Hub to anyone. It's a great restaurant all around."}
{"text":"Overpriced for a cheeseburger, salad and coke.$20.00 bucks. We ordered and the food took too long. The funny part was I received my salad with my burger. I couldn't enjoy it. So I paid for it and didn't eat it. The cherry coke tasted like cough syrup. This place sucks. I will never go back again Overpriced, loud, and the place had reserve seating at 10 am so where we wanted to sit was limited choosing. ."}
{"text":"32 for lunch for two. I only has a cup of soup. Horrible cheddar beer soup. The service was great. My bf had wings. Very good. So why 1*? Too spendy. The dog wouldnt eat my leftover soup."}
{"text":"Wings soggy and cold, beer is warm, service is super slow, they overcharge also, not worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the potato skins, and they were enormous and super flavorful. We also had the beer cheese soup and wings- also delicious! They have a HUGE gluten free menu and good GF beers, which is rare and so welcomed for those who are celiac or gluten intolerant."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Hub pretty much since it has opened. I will say the food is amazing. There is not one thing that I have ordered that is not good. The crowd is always comforting, lots of regulars. The one thing that I have noticed is the turnover, but that happens everywhere. Overall, this is hands down the best restaurant in Mesa. I love the new remodel and can't wait to see what happened next as they continue to grow!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Paul was super attentive and friendly! I wanted to leave when the hostesses wouldn't honor my table request, however the service thereafter made up for it. I like that the menu is full of options. The beer samplers are fun and Paul made excellent recommendations. The man with the remote changed the channels as soon as we made a request. Overall a great evening!"}
{"text":"I look forward to my next trip to The Hub.  The beer was good, the food was excellent, and the service was outstanding.  Much thanks to our waitress, Nikki.  You were spot on with the beer choices.  The Chili Philly was covered in cheese and the chili's added just the right amount of kick.  Philly cheesesteaks are my sandwich of choice anywhere.  The roll makes a huge difference in the sandwich and there's was second to none.  I'll go back just for the roll.  (PS. Don't order it unless you like cheese or order it with the cheese on the side.)  The garlic fries were almost too garlicky but I guess garlic fries are supposed to be that way.    I will say it got a little loud for my taste.  Maybe turn the music down one notch."}
{"text":"Very hopping joint! Staff very friendly and inviting. GREAT SERVICE and they were slammed busy. The Cod Fish Fry was amazing! Huge portion of fish that was fried to perfection. Not drowned in fry oil like some places. Kids meals are reasonably priced and very large portions. Gluten Free Kids menu also a win since one of my daughters requires gluten free. The TREASURE CHEST IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience with my family. This was my first visit to The Hub and will surely not be my last."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and drink in the heart of Phoenix! There are gray bars and restaurants all along this street, but the atmosphere in here sets it apart. Totally unique, it reminds me of my home town of Portland. The food is tastes just as great as the restaurant looks, and same with the drinks. I recommend the Mac and cheese! So rich and cheesy, like it was straight from grandmas oven. The service is also good - friendly staff from hostess to waitress to bus boy to manager, everyone prompt and happy to be helping. We will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're a parent that likes to drink and drive, have with small children that you don't supervise at all then this place is for you.  If you want a special date night, want to go to the movies but don't want to pay for a baby sitter, no problem. Pull up and just drop those little monkeys off and take off, the management would never even know.  We left around 10:00 last night and the little freaks were still up screaming, never saw any parents. The bartenders were awesome, the drinks good."}
{"text":"I have had the wings here countless times. The dry rub with a few differing dipping sauces is unreal! I love the smoked wings! Can't say enough good things about the hub."}
{"text":"I'm new to The Hub, and have been there 4-5 times over the past 2 weeks. Great place to hang out, watch sports, or just Chill. Great food and service. Melissa who has always worked the patio whenever I've been in is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Manger CHRIS absolutely rude!! This place use to be great till today! Will not be back! Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"Typical Bar food.  Feels a little pricey but they give large portions so you can have leftovers.  Have a variety of options."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and the food was great. I had the mac and cheese with pulled pork, jalapeños, & bread crumbs. I'll be back."}
{"text":"When the girlfriend says \"I don't know, you pick\" or when you're feeling a consistently awesome experience, come to the HUB. Great service, amazing wings and food, great drink prices too. I would encourage everyone to try something off the Chef's Specials, their head chef knows what he is doing and is happy to accomodate. That being said: I include pictures of my Grilled Cheese Chili Relleno Burger as evidence of the creativity and willingness to cater to the picky palate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sports bar.  The menu is fantastic and there are a couple of items that are amazing!  The smoked wings with the jefe sauce are the best wings I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The Hub mac-n-cheese is super delicious.  This is not your average bar food.  In addition, the service is fast and friendly, plus the atmosphere and drink specials are terrific.  I highly recommend this place, even if you are not a sports fan."}
{"text":"Best food I have ever had at a sports bar. Service was great and huge selection of beers. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, fun atmosphere in a sports bar. Would be a great place for a game with friends."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a review but had such great Service I felt I needed to. Ron was our server, he was awesome with our son and had great food recommendations. Food is always good here but hands down, service was amazing."}
{"text":"The Hub has great food, friendly staff and a clean environment. My favorites are the smoked wings and the Southwest chicken salad with chipotle ranch. They also have a great selection of craft beers. It's a great place to get together with friends and family."}
{"text":"Thanks to a referral.. from Extra-Mile Floor Care I was able to check this place out.  Boy was it good.  They had excellent customer service and the food was so delicious. They are very patient with kids too.  They have rewards for good behaved kids. Good food."}
{"text":"Today was the second time we visited this place, the first time was for my hubby's birthday and we rolled 15 deep, this time there were only 6 in our party and both times we received great service.   The food is not just your typical bar & grill grub, I mean they do have the staples, but they also have a variety of wonderfully delicious unexpected dishes. Perfect example, the Pub Cioppoini, which has mussels, shrimp, sausage, and linguini mixed with a heavenly tomato garlic sauce. It is amazing good! I've also tried the stuff poblano, and that did not disappoint either.   All in all, great service, delicious food, and a welcoming atmosphere. This will be one of our go to places for sure."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place from friends.  Went to check it out. Holy smokes is it good.  Fun place to hang out, awesome food.  Their smoked wings are to die for."}
{"text":"Love this place..... service is always great! Food.... spectacular!!!!  Maggie was our server today. She recomme ded Prescott Brewing Co Liquid Amber. Great choice. It went perfect with The Hubs Korean Steak Bowl.   If you haven't tried this place you need to! Worth the drive from anywhere."}
{"text":"Ordered mac and cheese.  Good flavor, but was only slightly warm.  Seated outside, fartest from bar and sevice was very poor. Took several minutes looking for staff to pay the bill.  Even the bar was unstaffed.  :-("}
{"text":"Awesome smoked wings! Excellent service(in bar)! My 5 and 6 year old love it as well and beg to go there because they get to choose a toy out of a treasure box! It can't get better than that! And KiDs eat free every Monday!!!! They have lots of TVs for sports and show the UFC fights! Misted patio where dogs are welcome! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for ambience, 4 for taste of food and 2 for food portion, so I'll give it a 3 overall. The ambience is a nice open air patio next to a very busy road but we found it enjoyable in spite of that and will likely go back when we are in the mood for that type of setting. Sometimes I just don't want a quiet, dark restaurant. The food tasted good enough (fish tacos, fish and chips, sausage platter) but the portions were so small that we ended up placing a second order of food! This obviously made the bill more expensive. The sausage platter was quite good though so we may go back and just eat something beforehand ."}
{"text":"my daughter loves a visit to the treasure chest! great food, and awesome service!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Everything I've tried on the menu has exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with my brother,  we didn't have much time and this place was perfect for our timing!  We sat at a table at 1:30pm and we were all done at 2pm!  We decide to try this place because they had great revues! And weren't disappointed!  On the menu they have a category 15min or less ready, between 11am and 2:12pm. We ordered two sandwich, they were both really good size and good flavor!( $9.99 ) We will be back soon, we already told our friends about this place. (Lots of tv,  game room and a huge bar )"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped in here after coming back into the Valley from a long hike in the Superstitions. His friend really talked it up, so I did a quick Yelp mobile search for directions while westbound on the 60. My first impression: another sports bar. After looking at all of their flat screens, extensive craft beer menu, and taking my first bite of my blackened chicken tacos: a new favorite post-hike spot in Mesa. Service was great, and it was packed mid-day, so that tells you something."}
{"text":"So, we have started coming to the Hub in a regular basis. The service is awesome,  the food is fantastic, and the beer is always cold! We showed up late on a Saturday night,  and they had no tables available.  After waiting for an hour or so on the patio, the fabulous manager, went into the store room, got an empty keg, and made our own table!  Where else can you go,  and the staff goes to that much trouble to make you happy?  The menu is always evolving, and I have never had anything less than spectacular.  I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff.  This place is brand new and they've already got their stuff together.  I went on a Saturday night.  If they can handle things then, there shouldn't be any problems any time you go.  I highly recommend the Beer Chedder soup, the Cheesy Potato Balls and the Guiness Stroganoff.  All were excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the fish and chips.  Not just your average piece of fish.  Sandwiches are to die for.  Service is fast.  This is a really fun bar and grill. Love all the football fun!!!"}
{"text":"We came into The Hub around 8:10 pm on Sunday, July 5th and sat outside. We had to go in for service. A server finally came out and we ordered our drinks. After 15 min of waiting we still did not have our drinks. I went in to look for our server and did not se him. There was only about 10 people in the bar. After going back outside and waiting a few more minutes we decided to leave. I can understand if you are busy but the place was dead."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Food is fantastic, especially the Arizona Smoked wings. Best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of wings. Service is always good, fun place to watch UFC as well. We had an issue one time with our credit card charged incorrect amount, called the Hub, spoke with the manager and he fixed it in no time. Appreciate their attention to the customer. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here about a week ago and we were pleasantly surprised. The owner heard it was our first time so he brought out a free appetizer to welcome us. He was very nice and seemed to really want to please his guests. They had a great happy hour too. Food was plentiful and tastey. The only criticism I have is that we sat outside the smokers stood right behind us and smoked us out. Like right behind us too, butts were bumping up against me."}
{"text":"The Hub is great. The service, food, and atmosphere are awesome. I've enjoyed going here with my Dad for lunch, my fiancé on a date, and friends for UFC fights. They always take care of our table.  I have really enjoyed going here for amazing burgers on tasty pretzel buns, the Friday night fish fry that's cheap and massive, and beers from all over the state(s). It's a large bar and restaurant so it can be loud but it's because people know it's tasty and fast. I usually have multiple staff stop by the table to make sure I'm not thirsty or hungry. If you want you can go on the patio and eat but it's also a smoking section. When we're there late we have had fun playing golden tee, beer pong, bags, and buck hunter.   This is my first review on Yelp, because I have never felt the need to post. The Hub has been a go-to for me for a while and deserves a stellar review. I strongly recommend going and trying it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit. The food was delicious. I had the FIsh & Chips special and my nephew had a hamburger. They have a large selection of beers to choose from."}
{"text":"We love the hub! We used to drive 30 minutes to eat there but recently moved closer. Wings, burgers, onion rings, everything is delicious and the staff is always friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"We went to The Hub because of a coupon that we got in the mail. It just happened that we went on a Tuesday during happy hour. This building has had 4 restaurants in it that I know of, and all have been bad. This one we really liked! Tuesday was a great day to go as they give $2 off every meal. I had the flat iron steak with vegetables. It was cooked to order and very good. Others in my party had a burger and a BLT. They also said their meal was good. The kids had Sliders and some appetizer plates from the Happy Hour menu and we were quite satisfied with the prices and quality of everything we had. We are looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this more stars and maybe it was because of all the expectation I came here with.  I heard this was such a great place from friends and what I take from that is not much competition in the area.  Was here with many friends and we all thought the food was ok the service was ok and the ambiance again just ok. Had I come here with less than great expectations maybe I would give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Best wings- the smoked hot ones. Amazing. Not too hot, and they fall right off the bone. Drink specials and happy hour all day Sunday is the best for Sunday Funday! Once the weather cools down, the patio is the best place to be..."}
{"text":"First time to the HUB. The new place on Stapley. I brought my son and my mom. Love, Love, Love. We ordered mashed potatoes balls, green chili bread, stuffed green Chili's, quesadilla and some wings, (apps were half price ). My mom had the HUB club . Every thing was fantastic. The GM came over and welcomed us. Service was on point. I'm looking forward to bringing friends and other family members.  Great job HUB"}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL I Love the hubs Smoked wings! Management was very nice, in fixing a food order mix up and made it right. I like that they have daily specials and kids eat free on Monday and that's 2 kids per adult which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch ,  no welcome, bad service, food ok.  Took forever to get our food.  Was about ready to leave.  Hard to understand the long wait, because they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"This place use to be awesome and friendly. It didn't matter if you were a first time customer, a regular, or looked like shit. You were treated the same. But, now its you have to be a regular to be helped or noticed. It sucks. Haha. Don't take my word for it. Try it out and let the people know what you think."}
{"text":"Nooo! Bring back the original edamame!! The new citrus is terrible. The citrus does not compliment this dish at all. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"So I checked out this place on a busy Sunday and I will have to say the food was delious and our server eli was the best u can get. She not only took great care of us for a bar and grill she made us feel great with her chit chat. We will always come here when sports are on because my husband actually believes he is the cowboyys #1 fan. Thanks to the hub we can watch it and yet feel at home while we get waited on. Great job managers its a great place."}
{"text":"Came in after looking for a place on YELP. Ww couldn't have been more satisfied. My son had fish and chips. It was a huge slab of fish deep fried to perfection. My husband had Black and Bleu burger with a loaded potato (real slice of bacon). I had beef stroganoff which was delicious and a tall Liquid Amber. We also had stuffed green chili and fried mozzarella."}
{"text":"Our server Sam was amazing. This was the best experience I've had at the hub since it was mad dogs. Thanks Sam for making it great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They know how to do good food. Drinks and food were satisfying! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food was amazing but our server Angelique was awful.  Took forever to take our order and wasn't attentive at all. Empty drinks stayed that way had to flag her down 3 times. She seemed to spend a lot of time off the floor.  We will be back for the food but hope service is a lot better next time around."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is extremely friendly. The wings were delish! And the pretzel was also really good. Will return!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place needs much better reviews, which is why I am here.  I can't say enough about their food, service, and atmosphere. Let's start with the no brainer: the food. So the menu has a lot of items, but don't be fooled they specialize in everything on it. I've only had one experience where the food was just ok. I've tried a lot of different things on the menu. My favorites are the Korean BBQ beef bowl and the HTC. The Korean BBQ bowl is essentially a gourmet teriyaki steak bowl. The meat is tender, the rice is soft and fluffy, and the sauce is sweet with a little kick of spicy. Ask for it without Sriracha if your sensitive to spicy. The HFC? Just imagine a bed of smashed potatoes drenched in gravy with some shredded cheese and corn topped with fresh crispy chicken tenders on a skewer... Amazing!!! Lastly, if you like a little spontaneity then they also have a weekly menu with new items that change every week and are not on the regular menu.  Let's move on to service. I like sitting at the patio bar because I typically visit on Friday afternoon and like to feel like I'm at home on my own patio having a drink. Josh and Emily have been two people who have shined in their position. I've always felt welcomed by them and they always make it a point to say hi and remember what you like to drink. I never have to really order, just confirm. Speedy service and positive attitudes all around.  The atmosphere is a little different depending on when you visit. I'm a friday afternoon guy, and there are a lot of regulars which I like. When the weather is nice, the patio is the spot to be. I sat at the inside bar once, and didn't care for it much, but it would be great if I had a group of 4 or more. Lots of TVs and I think they even have some games. This might sound weird but even the bathrooms were fantastic.  All in all, I love this place and would go out of my way to drink and dine here. It's not quite a bar, but not quite a restaurant either. It truly is the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Personalized speakers for whatever game you're watching! Awesome! BBQ chicken wings is a solid change up. Good happy hour. Recommended."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had. Also a ton of good beers on tap. Great place for lunch or dinner. Order the everything wings!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight and was really impressed. My folks (snowbirds) go for the pizza night and have raved about it. So I had The Devil burger. Wasn't as warm as I expected, but was still a great burger. Enjoyed it with a pint of my new favorite beer Kilt Lifter...gotta get that to Alberta somehow. Service was very good (Hunter) and very reasonably priced. I will be back before I go north!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of our favorites in the area. Awesome customer service, amazing food with unusal items, great pricing and so many choices of beers. Big outdoor sitting area,  only down side is the smoking!!!"}
{"text":"Great location great atmosphere food was awesome calzone was off the chain. The smoked and traditional wings were so good flavorful. Awesome beer selection ballast point on tap so bomb! Must place to visit about time Mesa got it right!"}
{"text":"I'm here as I type this. It's 10 PM. The staff seems like they just got briefed 10 minutes ago about what their role is. Taylor swift is playing, before that was Miley Cyrus and I think something from Glee before that.  My mother puts better music on when she does her chores. The kitchen is closed... Although the menu says it's open... The waitresses are just regurgitated mad dawgs waitresses with new shirts, so you know your order will be all kinds of wrong no matter how simple. I asked what the specials were and the waitress got a menu, pointed at the happy hour section (circled for her convenience), read it out loud, made a face as though she was confused about what she just read and looked at me for clarification. It's like they didn't even try to fix it. This place is just mad dawgs with a less ghetto coat of paint. How foolish of me to go to a bar and grill and expect food.  I guess I'll get Taco Bell on the way home. P.s. \"Bye, bye, bye\" is playing now. How fitting.  *Update 9/29/2016 So somebody from the hub messaged me and apologized for my bad experience and asked that I come try them again. That alone adds 1 star. I respect that greatly. So I did! I went in again on Thursday and actually walked through the place and it looks a lot different from mad dawgs. More TVs and comfortable seating. Nice! I sat down with my friends and was greeted by a waitress who was very friendly and got my drink order in pronto. My friends told me to order quick because the kitchen closed at 11. Okay, 11 is better than 10 but at least I got to try the food. I got the pretzel and wasn't blown away but it's a pretzel so I wasn't really disappointed. The music was a little better. Some cold play,80s stuff and a bubblegum pop song here or there but at least it was spread out. My beer was good, the pretzel wasn't half bad and it has changed a lot in the last few weeks so all in all I raise my review up. Well done guys I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good was great, customer service was spot on, and environment was family friendly! We will defiantly come back on Thursday's for half off pizzas and happy hour"}
{"text":"Probably the best wings I have had. Highly recommend smoked ones with the honey hot. Everyone at our table was pleased with the food, service, and the atmosphere. We will be making this place one of our regular haunts...no more native new Yorker for our household!"}
{"text":"The smoked wings are amazing! Definitely coming back. Great craft beer and service as well."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough. Has great food, service and atmosphere! Has a wide variety and different type of food and everything we had was great. Tons of TVs and games, great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Had our wedding reception here back in October and received superb service! The managers here are committed to quality customer service. I love both locations but this one wins my heart! The food is always delicious and the environment is very laid back and fun! Great servers, hostesses, and bar tenders! Love the hub on stapley!"}
{"text":"The food leaves much less to be desired. I had chicken nachos and the chicken was burnt. When I asked my server \"this seems to be a little darker than I had planned for\" she stated \"oh that's these at it's supposed to be, it's blackened chicken.\" I didn't want to get into a debate about the stale chips, hardened cheese and burnt chicken so I simply just sent it back. We were still charged for it. I was in my lunch break and honestly didn't have the time or patience to worry about a $10 plate of nachos. My husband and I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"The hub is amazing. Their beer selection has a wide variety and their special menu items are always unique. The wait staff is amazing and always takes great care of you. This spot is much better than ur typical sports pub. They have phenomenal smoked wings that fall off the bone( get the \"everything\" flavor smoked wings)!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  Had the stuffed peppers and they were yummy! Karaoke on Friday nights at 9, but no one wanted to sing!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a new place with a great patio, they apparently need to work through kinks!  Time to get a drink was 15 to 20mins because they had to go inside where \"the bar is backed up\".  Beer was luke warm.  If you want this to be a Sunday football establishment you need to prepare, ice beer night before.  Waitstaff friendly. No one seemed to be in a hurry to help anyone.  I hope things turn around as patio is amazing! Could be a great place."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of their Arizona Smoked Wings....I get it with the Cajun seasoning with some el jefe sauce on the side, add a basket of Cajun seasoned fries and a nice cold beer and I am a happy camper."}
{"text":"Great service, dog friendly patio, and good food; call it 4 1/2 stars!  Thank you, Yelpers,  for helping me find this place. A little blustery on the patio but warm enough so we were happily  able to sit out there  with the dog.  My husband enjoyed a chocolate porter while I sampled some interesting beer in a flight. None stood out but I  enjoyed all three. We began with chips and salsa, queso, and guacamole. Chips were light and thin, cheese was pleasantly sparky, and the guacamole was very nice. My husband ate The Devil burger; he said have the fire department on standby because you just might need them! Very tasty but eye watering.  I had the HBC. It was huge and fabulous! Mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, cheese, and three crispy, moist, flavorful chicken breasts speared on top. I was able to eat just one piece of chicken but i look forward to the rest tomorrow!  Really very good!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service.  Beer is ice cold.  Plenty of televisions for sports.   However, at 9 on a Saturday night while we are watching football, they seem to think this is a Los Angeles club and bring in a DJ.  Nobody wants to dance and the sound is at a 10+.   Beyond lame and a total finish to the night.  If you want to enjoy your meal and game, plan on finishing before 9pm or watching your evening games elsewhere.   Will not return when they think they need a DJ for which the DJ brings on zero additional patrons.  This crappy insistence on a DJ ruined the evening."}
{"text":"great service. good food. fun and causal atmosphere. prices are fair. portions are huge. lots of creative offerings. also! great location with easy and ample parking. not a busy shopping center or mall. no idea how Zipps or Uncle Bears stays in business the places like The Hub around. glad we stopped by. thanks Hub."}
{"text":"What can I say. Poor service as I walked in. Took forever to get my beer Took even longer to get my appetizer Asked for a manager and he never came Last time I come to this place.  Stay thirsty my friends"}
{"text":"More of a run down sports bar than anything. Lots of bikers, interestingly tattooed individuals and thugs. Not somewhere to watch the game with the boys or take a date as advertised. Something out of the show bar rescue, really.   Some staff going the extra mile, some couldn't care less. Two of us were sat at a high top relatively quickly but waiting too long to be addressed by staff. Browsed the menu and wasn't stellar by any means. Made eye contact with a couple waitresses and still no coasters, so we left. Bottom line is a bad first impression and I won't be trying again."}
{"text":"Nothing like sitting on the patio on a nice day and waiting 15 min for nobody to acknowledge your table.   Don't waste your time if your looking to get good service."}
{"text":"I had the Arizona smoked wings. 2lbs half hour half cajun. The hot sauce has a ton of flavor and the wings were super tender and crispy. I loved the Smokey flavor. The cajun sauce was okay. Some cajun seasoning and hour sauce. I will be back and will try insanity sauce."}
{"text":"First time here.  A lot of talk about this place.  When arriving the parking lot was loaded so figured wait time.  Parked went in and promptly seated!  Told waitress first time she explained the beer size.  Had to have the bacon cheese burger.  Couple minutes greeted by floor manager very nice.  Couple minutes later another server came to table with jalapeño corn bread drizzled with honey and topped with butter and two plates saying welcome heard it was first time.  All this during rush hour prime time!  Food was great, service was outstanding!  Found our new hang out.  Just try to fit your mouth around the burger!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Wings Ever! Smoked chicken wings in raspberry chipotle sauce! Emma was our server! Great atmosphere Awesome food! I literally have a Whitney Houston song stuck in my head \"and I will always love u...\" smoked wings!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Table Nazi alert.   Might the biggest run around ever to get a place to sit, middle of the afternoon on a Saturday.    Bring a big bag of patience."}
{"text":"Spent all day Sunday here with a group of 10+ friends. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and exceptional service. Huge upgrade from Mad Dogs. Best part is the number of TV's. You are guaranteed to see whatever game or sporting event you are looking for from wherever you sit. We will definitely be back soon.  P.S. Must try the waffle sandwich."}
{"text":"Get the spicy Chaz calzone. Can't remember the name, Spanish name. Absolutely awesome. Really good."}
{"text":"Great great food!!!!  Wings are excellent as is everything else including service! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently tried out The Hub and we are now fans!!! It was so hard to choose our meals because there are just endless possibilities! All the way from grilled cheese to pizza and burgers... There is no way you wouldn't find something that would satisfy your hunger! We ended up getting a basket of garlic fries and delicious wings with the help of our waitress Andrea. She was so helpful in helping us pick and made so many great suggestions all the way from our drinks to our meals. This girl definitely knows the menu inside out! We also loved the owner who was so kind as to welcome us for our first time there by delivering some cornbread to the table! He also stuck around to introduce himself and made sure we were well taken care of! We are now big fans of The Hub and can't wait to come back to try out the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Good place .love the burgers and pretty decent bloody Mary's on special. Waiters attitude does have its days, oh well its a bar. Overall satisfied."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke of a bar. Walked in on a Sunday for a beer. Half the place was full. Open tables everywhere. Every table had a sign to check In, so I did asking if we could just sit at one of the many open high tops in the bar for a beer. No, there is a wait. Ok fine. Can I sit at the big long BAR table with open seat. No u need to wait. Please take BAR out of ur bar and grill sign."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Lunch menu slightly lowered then the original price. Size and portion is way too large for lunch. They should have 1/2 nachos plate for $6 or like 1/2 sandwich and fries for $7. But, on the other hand if your hungry you won't be disappointed. Just for lunch it's hard to go back to work too stuffed! Lol"}
{"text":"Another hub night. Beautiful weather sitting on their patio. Great food, great music, great place."}
{"text":"It was proven tonight...this is a pure WT bar...white trash. Management proved it, along with the patrons. I'm disgusted. Management approves of regulars who complain about those who come here to spend a good $ on a drink and a fight only to be shut down by those who are paying to be here rather than those who pay to party. What a joke. Concentrate on those who pull in money rather than the white trash who come here expecting a hand out."}
{"text":"On the advice of a coworker we hiked out to east Mesa to give The Hub a try. The  Hub is divided in two, a dining room and a bar but we had arrived a little later, (9pm) on a Saturday night and the dining room was closed and dark. There were only a few tables seated but Saturday nights the bar has a DJ and the volume level in the small room was about an 11!  We both chose to have burgers, I the BBQ Bacon burger and TLL the Mushroom burger. The burgers are half pound patties and cooked to order, unlike many other burger joints that insist on the well done burger! They are all served on their own pretzel bread which is both soft and firm. They have interesting side dishes like sweet potato tater tots. (Which were really quite good.) We were expecting to like the place alot more than we did.  The burgers were not cooked to our order, the pretzel bread is kind of oily which was a bit distracting and the service was lack-lustre, nice but a little lacking.  Basically it was OK, but only OK. If I was out there for some reason and someone wanted to eat there I wouldn't object, but I won't drive 15 miles for mediocre food and service either. OK food, OK service, louder than a live rock concert, I'll pass thanks."}
{"text":"Did not expect the outcome from a grill and bar. However I was overly impressed with the food I ordered and portion size. I got the Baja bowl and it was more than I expected. The chicken was flavorful and plenty of Pico and beans in it. I have nothing bad to say about my food. I know some of my other guest didn't enjoy the burger but it was a good experience. One thing I loved was the kids treasure chest filled with toys. They got to pick one toy when done eating as they left.  I have them 4 stars out of 5 because of my guests meal and some things were pricey.  I was impressed and would go there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic   Great food and great servers.  Pleasant and welcoming to sit on the outdoor patio with our dog.  All staff understands how to approach dogs.  We are from out of town but this definitely a stop every time.  212 degrees concept shows"}
{"text":"10-14-16  I ordered a Calzone & was extremely disappointed in the order. Portion was small & taste was very bland. Don't order the Calzone until they fix the issue. After expressing our concern with the Calzone to the waitress the manager Rob never came over to talk to us."}
{"text":"Lots of options here for everyone. Great menu from smoked wings, burgers on a pretzel bun, must try the HUB Club not your ordinary club, great pizza's, salads, gluten free menu and much more, 85 beers available with 40 on tap, dining area plus bar area, adult and kids game rooms and tons and tons of TV's, inside and out..then you get outside with another bar, huge patio, lots of seating, friendly staff and clean bathrooms....don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Really appreciate the service here. Came in to host an event for 30 and the Hub reserved the entire back room for us. It was the perfect size, monitors and projectors were all set up, sound was secure, and the back doors kept the noise out. The hostess communicated with us ahead of time to deliver the food and drinks at the appropriate time and continually checked in our our group to make sure we were doing fine. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This is one of the great local sports bars/restaurants. I go there almost once a week, smoked wings with raspberry chipotle sauce.  Every time a friend from out of town comes and I tell them everything on the menu is good, but not great. They inevitably choose something that is a local favorite to where they are from, and they walk away impressed.   Staff is always very friendly, not always great, but good and they make mistakes right.   I always thought the place as good, as I live a few blocks away, but when I compare bar/restaurants I compare them to this place, and some might have better beers, another better hamburgers, another better fries, another a  better veggie platter. Other better servers... but I have not been to one ever that will have more than 2 things better and 3 things not as good. Not locally and not in my travels unless I am paying a lot more for live bands and gloss over everything else cause of great music, good food, and lots of drinking. (Thinking the Slippery Noodle Inn in Indy, or The Chieftain in San Francisco) but as a local sports bar, I have not been to a better place."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and TV's everywhere you look. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. Possibly the best restaurant experience I have ever had. My fiance and I loved the food and the service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Lets just say out of our party of 10, 5 of spent the rest of the night on the toilet. Baja chicken tacos were dried out and tasteless.  35 minutes to be seated which i would expect for a party of 10 but our table was waiting to be bused for 10 min and then sat there clean for another 5 before they finally seated us.  Just overall extremely disappointing. The waitress was really nice and helpful. Still tipped her  20+ %.  Not her fault the cooks suck.  Not sure how anyone can rate this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Haven't visited this place since 2015. Today it was so convenient for us to pop in after we got off the lake. We had Korean steak and burgers and margaritas. All excellent AND wait staff very pleasant. Completely different experience. Great job."}
{"text":"Not super crazy about this place. The fries are alright but the Swedish meatballs and French dip were nothing special. The meatballs taste like the Costco ones. The service was very good and the waitress very friendly."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star option, I would rate this a zero! This place is so disgusting and my chicken tenders were so awful and burnt! Fries were ok. For three tenders and barely any fries was 10 bucks when you can go to raising canes and get 6 FRESH juicy delicious tenders and toast and fries and a drink all for 8 bucks!! There tenders where like flattened and very greasy. My grandmas bread was very nasty and she said it was the worst bread she's had in her whole 88 years! I really wish they would cook better more authentic food. I never ate my chicken, instead I got a fresh chicken dinner at raising canes."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place for our family of 6! They take reservations, if we fail to make them they always accommodate us. Yes, we have to wait. But, it has never been an unreasonable time frame for our crew. Servers are awesome! It's totally kid friendly, or not if you sit in the large bar area. They give kids key necklaces that they wear. If they eat their food and behave, they get to pick a toy from the treasure box. The food is awesome and NOT ordinary. I had the Chedder Beer soup, and Arizona style BBQ medium wings. The soup was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Made with 5 cheeses, beer (I believe kiltlifter), bacon, and onions! The wings were good too!"}
{"text":"Thursday night 1/2 price pizza. The Italiano was delicious. Served hot just the right amount of toppings and sauce. The medium was more than enough for two people. Highly recommend. Well worth the slight wait time for a table. Friendly staff and excellent service."}
{"text":"We go regularly to the Hub, never disappointed, just check out the number of customer vehicles parked outside! Friendly servers. Original home cooked dishes. Trivia certain nights, good fun!"}
{"text":"Smoked Wings and Turkey Rachel are the best. Get the Az smoked wings, grilled and then re-dipped in everything sauce! Falls right off the bone!!!"}
{"text":"The Hub had become a regular visiting spot for my wife and I. Aside from the incredible food, the service and staff are outstanding. They always have the best games on and they frequently have specials. We love the Hub and we're definitely fans!"}
{"text":"Great smoked wings. That is all I have had here, but they were awesome. So good I had to go back for more the next day lol...I believe they are discounted during happy hour and also on Wednesdays.."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, smoked wings were great and food was awesome! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food in a comfortable, casual, clean setting. They hold fun events and specials on occasion, so subscribe to their newsletter for updates. Also, check out The Vue... same oweners, I believe. Love both of these places!!! Both have dog-friendly patios, too :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:15 and they asked us what sodas we would like. The waitress brought our sodas. We visited until 12:00 because she never took our order. We left money on the table for our drinks and left. Weird!"}
{"text":"We visit The Hub a couple times a month.  They recently redid their menu and the Hub Board was amazing.  Love their drink specials and their dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"I love The Hub. We go there weekly and lately have been taking our dogs to sit on their dog friendly patio. The servers and managers are always super friendly. My go to items are the Smoked Wings, Kitchen Sink, and Cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Our family went in for dinner and the hostess couldn't give us a wait time. Maybe 30 minutes? She just didn't know. After waiting 20+ minutes I asked for an update and she said again she didn't know. Maybe 20 more minutes? Again, she just didn't know. She walked past us a bunch with no word to us. And she sat table after table of people walking in. Finally a manager came up and said again that they just couldn't give us a time on when we could be sat. With the football game on it was just unknown. So we had no choice but to leave. Kids were crying because they were so hungry and we weren't willing to stay at a place where we definitely felt unwanted by the way so many tables were sat ahead of us. We did have a little larger party but they couldn't set tables aside to start combining for us?? Or the hostesses need to be trained well enough to know there is a football game on and people like to camp so chances are it was going to be an hour wait. If we would have walked in and they said \"hey, with the game on people park for awhile so it can be an hour wait.\" We would have appreciated the honesty and left right away to go somewhere else. Instead we sat there for forever and then were finally told there was no chance of a table for us. We frequent the location on Stapley a lot and always have a good experience. Will not be going back to this Sossaman location."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious potato balls! Along with those we ordered the beef stroganoff and meaty pizza. They were all very good, but we'll be coming back again for the potato balls the next time we drive through Mesa! Oh and we love that this place opens late!"}
{"text":"Have heard great things about The Hub and the raves were right on. Definitely a sports bar, you want to watch it, it's on! Food was great and service was awesome! Callie was right on with all of her recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that would show the Broncos game since we were visiting from Denver. We were greeted enthusiastically and we were accommodated. We were actually giving the loyalty treatment with a cornbread treat as first time visitors. So many games were on. Fun waitstaff. Great place."}
{"text":"Love this place..it's close to home, food is always great, and I highly recommend the Sossarita if you love margaritas like I do!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the amount of TVs with the games available. Everyone in their jersey! Great Football environment! They brought me out a Free cornbread as a first time guest. The waitress was super helpful and personable.  She made great suggestions! The managers wet on the floor the whole time interacting with the customers. Food was awesome...great smoked hot wings!"}
{"text":"Went to the Hub yesterday afternoon for the first time with a buddy. Nice atmoshere, clean, prompt service. Ordered 2 Chicago beef sandwiches. Mistake. Sandwiches were small, overpriced, a layer of cold cheese hid what little beef was on the sandwiches. The beef on both were fatty and tough. Bun was dry. Needless to say neither of us finished the sandwich. I guess that is what I get for ordering an iconic Chicago sandwich in a bar in Mesa. My bad."}
{"text":"It was a reasonable wait on a Wed night for a table, about 15 min and well worth it. We sampled the smoked hot wings (a little too mild for us), green chile stuffed w chorizo (fabulous) and the devil burger. All were excellent along with the fries. The service was spot on, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Always great food with weekly specials! Lots of green chili dishes which are awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to this hub because we live the one in Sossaman. Service was so slow. 1/2 lb. Of wings equal a total of 5 burnt, cold wings. One hour and a half later still no food. Finally got food. It was cold as well. Will not be returning to this Hub"}
{"text":"Love this place. So glad they opened another one. It's way better than the 2 places that existed here prior. Try the smoked wings. Best ever!"}
{"text":"The HUB is amazing! I can't even begin to tell about all the amazing times my family and I have been there...  the service is ALWAYS amazing, the food is so yummy and the beer is cold and the servers actually want to keep them coming!!!   Some of my favorites... chicken nachos... peach ale beer, the devil sandwich with grilled chicken.   The best part about this place is it's super kid friendly or you can sit on the bar side and enjoy a night out.. they have a little game room and a treasure box for the kids to pick a toy out of at the end of your meal. Always my kids favorite!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Their smoked wings are delicious and taste cooked to order. Super friendly staff. I was waiting about 10 mins for my food and had 3 different staff people asked if Ive been helped.  This place is on the way home and is a perfect spot to have a few drinks in this friendly neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here and had the Peanut Butter Burger it was the best!  We will be back for sure. Thank you for the great food and service. ..."}
{"text":"Our favorite date night spot! Owners and Staff are super friendly and professional. Their food never disappoints but my favorite appetizers are their homemade hummus with cucumbers and pita bread, and the kitchen sink. My husband's favorite are their AZ smoked wings. The best wings in town! My favorite refreshing drink is their version of a Moscow mule...the AZ Mule. Friday Night Karaoke is fun, but my only suggestion is to get more song selections."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and had it bookmarked for a while as a place to try.  My wife and I looked over the menu online and decided that it sounded good.  We went with some friends for lunch, around 1:30 or so.  As we walked in the place looked like a nice sports bars.  Several TV's for viewing games, two games rooms with things such as shuffleboard and air hockey, a large selection of beers (both bottle and tap), it was clean, I really hoped to like this place.  Our friends ordered the pretzel basket as an appetizer.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  The pretzels were soft and warm and came with two dipping sauces.  There were five enormous pretzels in the basket!  While we were waiting for the pretzels a man came to our table with a little iron skillet of cornbread.  He said that he was told that this was our first visit and he wanted to give us something compliments of The Hub.  This was a total surprise and very cool.  He stood there and talked to us for a while, made suggestions and welcomed us to the \"family\".  The cornbread was not very good at all, greasy and way overdone, but thanks anyway, it was a very nice gesture.  As I stated, the pretzels were awesome.  Myself and one of our friends had the Arizona Smoked wings, which came highly recommended by the waitress and the manager.  She got hers naked with the sauce on the side, I did not.  She loved her wings, they were nice and crisp and had great flavor.  Mine on the other hand, not so crispy.  The smoke flavor was perfect and the hot sauce tasted like nothing more than Frank's hot sauce.  It was almost like the sauce had been sitting on the wings to long.  The meat was falling off of the bones and they had that over-baked slimy feeling.  I know that when wings have sauce on them they sometimes get soggy but not like mine were.  Our other friend had the pork taquitos.  He said that they were good but would of preferred corn tortillas and not flour.  My wife had the H.F.C.  She said the idea was great, but the execution fell well short.  The mashed potatoes that were in the bottom of the bowl were nothing more than a dry baked potato that had been smashed in the bottom of the bowl.  The gravy was very thin and lacked flavor.  The chicken strips on top were a little burnt, greasy and had no flavor.  Our waitress was ok.  She was attentive but did forget a few things.  The service overall was slow and there were not that many people in there.  It also took a long time to get the food.  I really wished we would have liked this place more."}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Monday for lunch. The wait was long but worth the wait. I tried the Arizona smoked wings with the raspberry chipotle & honey bbq sauce and the $10 grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries. The food & atmosphere were great. We had 6 adults and 3 kids... The bill came out to only $107 and the kids got to go to a treasure chest and pick out a prize."}
{"text":"5 stars indeed! This place was awesome. I don't write a ton of reviews but I absolutely loved this place... Great food, amazing service!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time was a while ago on a Saturday night. Service was TERRIBLE. When I ordered my second drink I never got it, 20 mins later we had to flag down the waitress to get our bills and that second drink was not even ready.  The second time I went here was happy hour on a weekday with my work friends. We got food, I had the fried mashed potatoes and they were great. Service was better and the drinks alright. Okay place to drink locally."}
{"text":"We loved the hub out east and so far so good here.  Only complaint for football Sundays. They don't offer any breakfast options.  If I have to set an alarm for football, I certainly would rather have bacon and eggs then wings at 930AM."}
{"text":"Don't try ramen, noodles are sour and salty; soup is also salty and sour. Make me wonder if the noodles are bad. It doesn't have ramen flavor, very disappointed.  The Only eatable item is the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and will continue to come back. Everything Ive tried so far has been really good. \"The devil burger is hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had!\""}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! We love the one on Sossaman but the service here is so slow. 5 different waitresses really? No body knows which section is theirs."}
{"text":"The Hub has amazing Arizona smoked wings. I like mine with honey bar-b-que. They have a special for them every Wednesday. Their Italian calzone is awesome and it's huge. The servers are friendly and quick. They have TV's lined up along the walls. It's a great place to meet up with friends and catch a game. The outdoor sitting area is huge and has a bar."}
{"text":"If you like great wings then this is the place for you. The servers are fast and friendly. I can't wait to come back for more wings."}
{"text":"I used to love The Hub, but they've really gone down hill. The quality of their food is a shade of what it used to be. I just spent ~$40 on takeout for a mostly incorrect order. I asked for a pizza with light cheese, it has normal to slightly extra cheese. I also ordered a pound of their smoked wings, which can normally be pulled apart by hand they are so tender and most. What I got are their regular wings. I even asked for no queso with our pretzels and they STILL included it. Fortunately it comes on the side. Very, very disappointed and now have an order that I am mostly putting into the garbage can. I won't be going back, not for a long while at least."}
{"text":"We have been to the hub on baseline and sousman several times. We always had great service. We came to this location last week and had good service. Tonight we were celebrating my daughter getting an award at school and she choose the hub. The service was horrible. We sat for about 15 minutes and another server offered to get us drinks. She was great! I wish she was our sever. Alicia came over after we had been there for about 30 minutes saying they needed her in the back,things went down hill fast. She forget a beer I ordered. Our food took 30 minutes from the time it was ordered. We had to hunt her down to pay. She  honestly looked like she was on something. The support staff was very friendly which is why I gave 3 stars and not 1. They need to cut Alicia lose. Her fellow staff was carrying her. We will be back but not in Alicia's section."}
{"text":"Just as everyone has said. Great place for kids and adults. If you order wings you MUST get the smoked ones. They are great! Wait staff was very attentive and we were seated quickly even though we had 19 people in our party."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to love going to the Hub, the staff was great and friendly. Now they are just too big and too busy. Service staff isn't as great as the original/previous staff"}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying I am only giving a 2 star rating due to one manager. No reflection on the food or our server. I did not get his name and that was my fault.  First off we love the one on Sossaman, this one's food is every bit as good as the other one. The portions are huge and very good quality. The server we had was awesome, always there to fill up drinks and check on us as well as lot of fun interacting with the table. There was just one bad manager.  Now the bad part. We went to the Hub on the Thursday night game between the Cardinals and 49ers (10/6). This would be a party of six. 4 of us had a prior commitment so we sent 2 in our party to grab a table. They got there at 4:30, got a table for 6 and proceeded to have drinks. Alcohol drinks, not water, not pop. Since they were early they also had an appetizer. The other 4 of us were to be there by 6-ish. We ran into a delay. Once we were not there by six the one on duty manager started harassing our seated friends.  Telling them that their friends better get there pretty fast or he would take the table. The more past 6 it got the more instant he was that he was going to give away the table. Our friends told him they are on their way and should be here by 6:45. At one point he told our seated friends that \"if they aren't here in 30 minutes I'm will take the table. We have people waiting\". Keep in mind our friends were paying customers. Seated, drinking (the whole time), and eating. He came by again asking about us and our friends said they are pulling in the lot now (which we were of course). He then proceeded to tell them \"they have 30 seconds.\" I was driving, stopped my truck and they (literally) ran in to get the table while I parked.  I feel this absolutely terrible customer service. Where do you get off telling paying customers that you are going to pull their table? We were running late and he knew that. I realize this is a huge game for the Cardinals and their devoted fans, and that our table had open seats. But come on... 2 people were there and seated, drinking alcohol and eating food. The remaining party was coming as fast as they could.   Again our waitress was awesome and the food very good. After that we enjoyed ourselves. This no way reflected on our server and we let her know that.   1 Bad apple can spoil the whole barrell."}
{"text":"This place is also owned by the people who own The Vue at Augusta Ranch. Great food and service. Nice place and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend. The only time I would say not to go here is when they have the UFC fight on. Gets a little rowdy at that point."}
{"text":"Great Service & Amazing Food!! This restaurant has the best smoked wings you will ever have along with great service. Our server was on top of everything and never let our drinks go empty. He held a quick convo with us but didn't intrude on our meal. Not to mention we went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait an hour to be seated. Hands down a great establishment with delicious food and great service....talk about hard to find!! We will frequent this place!!"}
{"text":"The manager James does a stellar job making sure everyone is happy.  Quite a crowded place yet the wait time for food and drink is very short. they definitely have a gold mine at this location"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!  The HFC bowl is my favorite!  And Monica the Server was amazing  too!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"After a few times at The Hub Grill and Bar I have decided it's time to write this review. To be frank I don't have much to say about the place other than this is your typical bar food football watching place.   The food is mediocre at best but again I didn't expect better.   The ambiance is a little dark and divey but hey it's a sports bar. Again not expected to be glamorous.   I ordered the southwest stuffed bread and ended up having to send it back. It was so spicy that it was not edible. The staff should really warn you before ordering this item.   The southwest chicken salad was not bad. The chicken was crispy and well cooked.   We enjoyed the football game and left.   Moving forward this is the place I would come and watch the game, drink some beer and eat some appetizers. I would not however bring my family for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"This place could easily become 5 stars if they had consistent servers. The first time we went everything was fantastic. The green chili cheese bread is amazing. Nachos are huge portions. Great selection of draft and bottled beers, the list goes on forever! The server was amazing, fast, nice, answered all our questions, kept drinks refilled, etc. Second time, not so much. Our food (Couple of appetizers) were dropped off with no plates for us to eat off of, she literally asked if we wanted drink refills, they were both empty and we had just got our food. Had to ask for plate, we had wings and had to ask for more napkins. Hot wings and halfway through we asked for more drinks and she seemed very irritated with it. It just wasn't even remotely the same experience, she clearly didn't want to be there. Food both times was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the monkey bread.  Terrible. Server CT Was awesome.  So friendly and informative.  We would come back because manager was great (James) and CT."}
{"text":"Don't come here and sit on the bar side expecting good service for dining. Waitress tonight has the friendliness and patience of an I'll tempered badger."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The food is okay. I ordered the Turkey Avocado sandwich. The sourdough bread was toasted and slathered in butter. It was so greasy I needed wet wipes to clean my hands. They also forgot to put avocado on my sandwich. I also ordered a side salad as my side. It was tasty. Its was the best paetc of my meal. We also ordered fried zucchini. It was okay. The breading tasted like the breading on mozzarella sticks. I didn't care for that. My husband ordered the Cubano sandwich. It was extremely salty. It was okay but for rge price of dinner we could have had a streak dinner."}
{"text":"First time there. Food was good but was very disappointed that they ran out of Poblano peppers on a Friday night at 6:00.  One of the hostesses was very nice when we arrived and the other hostess that sat us down was very rude. The ladies at the bar were very attentive and very nice! I arrived at the bar and was helped immediately and they were busy! Drink was great!! 5 stars for the bar and 2 for the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Lauren and Anthony are awesome and the food OMG. Get the Cajun smoked wings wet! Also, the pizza is good and the peanut butter burger is my favorite! Life changer:-) They have a corn hole tournament every Wed at 6, so fun."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Worst customer service or waiting for the food to come for an hour?!  I don't understand the service when it wasn't so busy tonight.  The wait time for seating inside or outside was just 15 mins so not bad. Last night's service was one of the worst. I was out with my bf and his friend and got seated quickly (outside) but when my bf's friend chose a seat that my bf didn't like (2 couches with a low table) we wanted to sit at a table instead.  The waitress came 30 mins after we got seated and asked if we have been served. We replied no. She then asked \"What would we like to drink?\" My bf asked if it was ok that we got seated at a table instead. The waitress said \"I can't switch you seats you'll have to ask the front desk for that.\" My bf then asked if we can sit just right next to all these 6 empty tables but she refused on telling him \"I can't do that for you, you'll have to go ask for yourself\" and so he then told her \"Well can you go ask please?\".  I understand that there are certain waiters and waitresses available to serve those seats but what I don't understand is why she would want us to ask while she's the one serving us. It would be nice, after my bf asked to switch the seating-rather then him and her go back and forth, that she'd go in and ask to switch seats.  I think she got pissed off. So she stormed back in and told the front and another waitress came to serve us. She sat us at a table and was served by a waiter but it took about 40 mins till the next one showed up.  We got our drinks and ordered our food but it took about 1 hr to actually get our food. He only came in once to check on how we're doing and if we wanted another drink.  Our waiter didn't even come to check up on us after that. I had to wave for a check and I had to get up and give him the check that we were ready to pay. I'm not about to sit for another 30 mins.  We spent about 2  1/2 hrs at this restaurant. Ayy the food was delish by the way! I just don't understand why it took an hr for it to arrive? How long does it take to make a classic burger (bun, patty, throw some cabbage and tomato, and fries), grilled cheese sandwhich (cheese, bread, tomatos and fries), and a kbbq beef bowl (that felt like it was microwaved on high heat for 2 mins)..  I'll still come back.. for the food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wings ever!! Get the Arizona smoked wings, they fall off the bone. So tender and juicy...better then my home made. Hubby had the potroast french dip, amazing! So flavorful and huge sandwich on a white hoagie roll. It's clean, great staff, games galore, and very spacious with at least 20 TVs. No disappointments here. Think we found our new corner grill! YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning... heading out to watch the Big10 football slate and the Cubs game.  Pull into the Hub at 10:00 AM and they are closed!  They only open that early for the NFL... you are completely out of luck if you are a East Coast and Midwest football fan on Saturday mornings.  Catering only to the guaranteed money as a sports bar (NFL), nominally concerned about the avid sports fan.  In my opinion!  The worst part is the server who greeted me asked the manager if I could sit at the bar and wait until they opened... I was turned away by the manager and told to come back at 11:00 AM."}
{"text":"This is a great place for dinner. Katie was our waitress. She did a fabulous job attending to our needs. I have been coming here for years. This place is great."}
{"text":"Came for the first time on St. Patty's day for the green beer and have been back a few times since because the food is really good! I highly recommend the $10 grilled cheese. It's HUGE! Take it home for lunch the next day! My brother tried the peanut butter burger and said it was great - little too weird for me. Tons of options for anyone in your dining party. They even have gluten free food and beverages! Wish I would have taken a picture of their happy hour and daily specials. I do remember Thursdays they have 1/2 price pizzas, which are tasty! Would highly recommend. It is a little loud though. Also, don't be deceived if the parking lot/outside is packed - it's a big place, you will get a seat! Fried pickles are bomb here too.  Lost a start because children run wild here. I like kids, but there are a TON here that are unsupervised, slamming the shuffle board pieces against the wall (it's already loud enough in here), and bumping into you as they run through the aisles. I wish parents or staff would advise them to stay in their seat as it doesn't make a fun dining experience for others when they run wild."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to write a bad review for this place, I absolutely love the food. But the service is the worst that I have ever had, so bad that I will not be returning to this location and I can speak for myself and several friends of mine. I have been to the stapley location 4 times and 3 out of the 4 I have had the same server. She does not know how to do her job, from taking orders wrong, to forgetting to bring our drinks, to not checking back on us when we need new drinks, to overcharging us on our bill. Any time she is my server I am there for at least 2 hours because she never comes by the table. And I can hear other tables next to me complaining about her as well. 2 of us placed drink orders, 20 minutes later another one of us flagged down a food runner to get him a drink, and he got his drink before we did, a whopping 30 minutes after we ordered them!! I am in shock that this girl is still being employed by this establishment because i have seen her there since this location opened a year ago, and it has not gotten any better. As long as the blonde that used to have blue hair is working here which she is normally on the patio, I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place!! Food is always amazing, portion sizes are great and prices are very reasonable!  Service always wonderful!! A great place to take the family or to catch a game! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great local venue. Food was excellent and great variety of options.   We came in to watch the UofA game and the manager was very kind to turn the TV to our game while the place was packed. This rarely happens when at another sports joint. Kudos to the service. Everyone was friendly and quick to serve.   It got even better when we had a issue with the valet service. They handled it better then our expectations. I will definitely be back with friends and family.   Thank you Chris (manager) and staff for the experience."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok! Wtf thought of the popper burger?! This burger was fire! I was told by a employee way from the restaurant and he broke down the way they made the burger so I gave it a taste! Psh was he right this burger is amazing! It's a jalapeño popper with a fusion twist! Burger as is was well worth every bite!! Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm dropping my original negative review and upgrading to average. Fair is fair; I've had much better service in recent visits. Truth is, I really like this place. Just wish the service was more consistent."}
{"text":"Tried to go tonight for a late dinner after 10PM.  Their hours are deceiving because they're open late only to serve alcohol.  I get that alcohol is where they make the money, but then they should advertise  correctly.   The server who came over to explain their alternate hours was very friendly.  However, with the state of the table which was really dirty and their poor advertising hours, we will definitely not return."}
{"text":"This is the second time the better half and I have visited. Once again, the beer selection was excellent. We had dinner on the patio by the fire. The gourmet burgers were excellent, atmosphere by the fire was wonderfully romantic and the bonus was that Thursday's are craft beer night!"}
{"text":"Had a beer and the Green Chili tacos.  I would have preferred hard shell tacos but instead they give you the small tortillas.  A lot of corn and beans in the taco, not that much meat.  Still, they were tasty.  A small cup of black beans on the side, I would have preferred something else.  Good beer.  The usual array of TV's with sports playing."}
{"text":"We just happened to be in the area and were looking for a place to have a late lunch. Glad we stopped by.  The ambiance was pretty cool. Open garage type, sports bar atmosphere with great background music. The pleasant surprise?  The wings! I completely forgot about these wings. I reviewed a Hub on the east side of Mesa months ago and found them to have the best wings I've ever had in the Phoenix area. We stopped here by chance, ordered wings, and palate  memory kicked in of those wings from the sister store. These are the best wings in Phoenix at both sites."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Came in for the first time and because we mentioned we haven't been here before the manager brought us a warm skillet of corn bread! Totally great service! Only reason it isn't a five is that the corn was not great. Will definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"We've been there twice since they opened. Nice, diverse menu. Cold beers. Smoked wings are amazing. TVs were everywhere, in every sight-line. Holly and Whitney, the two waitresses we've had were great. Very attentive.  Only negative, which isn't fair, because no other sports bar has them either, is that they no longer have the personal speakers for the tables to listen to individual games. The original Hub had them, and they were awesome."}
{"text":"Need to try their Devil Burger. Delicious with a little kick of spice. Great crowd for a weekday. I also recommend their wings! Grilled wings!"}
{"text":"We're back again! Just when you think it can't be better, it is!  Same unbeatable wings and now, the green chili pork mac 'n cheese is over the top.  Do yourself s favor and stop by."}
{"text":"New sports bar - well it's the second location of a bar - popped up on this corner a few months ago. The place is big and most every seat was taken on a recent Friday night after 8pm. Large menu, but some items do appear overpriced, but my portion was pretty big, so that probably makes up for the prices. The blackened chicken tacos were excellent with only one bad chunk of chicken in three giant double-wrapped corn tacos. The meat was loaded on, along with a slice of avocado, cheese and some cabbage as well. It was served with some very salty chips and an average salsa, but the real flavor came from the blackened chicken meat. It was $10.99 for the meal. Plenty of beer on tap, but the Bud Light was only about 5 bucks for a large glass. Tons of TV sets, but this place may end up being too crowded for Sunday football, plus alot of biker types were on hand....never a good sign. Will return for those tacos again."}
{"text":"Good first experience here.  Calzone was delicious.  Hot and crispy fries.  Kid friendly place."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of restaurant openings over the years, but have never seen one pulled off as smooth as this Hub pulled it off. From a great greeting at the front door to a server who actually knew what she was talking about the experience was refreshing. I normally refuse to leave feedback during the first month a place opens because it's always just chaos... but this wasn't. Kudos!  If you haven't been to the original Hub, let this be your first experience to the best wings you will ever have. Smoked Arizona style is my pick. It's almost magical if you are a wing eater. The place was busy as hell and the vibe was great. I'm sure this is my football bar for years to come. Nice job guys!!"}
{"text":"Do you like wings? No! Do you LOVE wings?? This is the place for us! Best 'smoked' chicken flappers I have ever had - hands down. On top of that the staff has been super attentive, the TVs have always been on the good sport channels (unlike some bars where the staff pays no attention and I watch an infomercial as I eat my lunch) and the server and manager make sure I was enjoying my meal without being too 'in my business'   The place has been packed every time I come in and it's okay because they seem to have enough servers on hand to handle it.   I recommend this place if you are in east Mesa and looking for a place to cure your wing craving. My new regular spot. Thx HUB"}
{"text":"The smoked wings are amazing! But the waitresses aren't very friendly at all, actually rude to be honest. I've come here many times and can't remember ever having a friendly waitress. It's starting to get annoying. Probably one of the worst restaurants service wise."}
{"text":"We have passed this place numerous times and kept saying we should try it, but we were always reluctant, now I'm sorry we waited so long.  I thought it had a good atmosphere, pub like without the high noise level.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  They also had a great selection of beers on tap.  This will be our new lunch stop, especially when we're going to Costco, it'll add a positive to an otherwise stressful shopping trip."}
{"text":"Slow service. Saturday nights are pretty insane which I get, but ignoring a table is no way to win over a customer. The food and beer they have are great. The Hub falls short when hiring staff though."}
{"text":"Our first time here as a family of three (husband, wife and toddler). My husband had come one time prior and sat at bar and had a better experience with both food and service. We were not greeted for seating, as indicated by the signs.  After walking past a large group, a busy server told us to sit anywhere. We flagged her down again and had to ask for a high hair. The place was not busy except for a large group that was already eating. The environment was inviting, clean and open and has a huge amount of screens with every opening game of baseball as well as other sports showing.   Kyle was serving us (we saw it on the check, as he never told us his name) and took our drinks pretty quickly. Water for baby, beer for husband and ice tea for me. He forgot my iced tea. We were later never brought or asked if we needed refills on drinks. He also forgot the zucchini appetizer we ordered and never noticed or apologized for it. Our son stuck a crayon in his straw and then dropped it so we asked Kyle for a new one. He never brought one, even after viewing me dip a napkin in water and use the napkin tip to clean the inside of the straw like a weirdo. Ha! After asking him about the kids treasure redemption after we got our check, he said he would take us to it and the. He walked away and forgot. We asked again and he politely brought us to the treasure chest. In general, Kyle was very nice, just inattentive and forgetful. Maybe we caught him on a bad day?  The treasure chest and concept is awesome! There are some substantial toys...not just pencils and a sucker. There were maracas, 20 pack of chalk, coloring books, action figures, play jewelry, etc. and we happened to go on a Monday when kids meals are free.    That brings me to the food. We had smoked wings with honey BBQ and they may have been the best I have ever had. The meat was literally falling off the bone and was meaty, grilled to crisp perfection and the sauce and blue cheese really complimented the smoked flavor. The beer special was great, as were the pub chips(which are more like chip-shaped fries).   The regular fries and chicken strips were limp and lacked flavor. The green chili Philly also lacked flavor the bread was overly toasted and crumbling apart like a crouton. The pot roast French dip was okay. The au jus gravy was too thick, salty and very cold. The meat was tender but also lacked flavor with the same crouton-esque issue that the Philly had. We would come back here only for apps and drinks."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I  were visiting family out here and had some time to kill so came here. The staff was awesome !! The manager (Robert) talked to us for about 15 minutes just shooting the sh*t. Food was great and the atmosphere was laid back as can be. 5 star for the food and 5 star for the staff..awesome experience please open one in so cal !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the most amazing wings in the AZ. It is definitely worth the drive from Scottsdale for them. Would be awesome to open one there, just a thought."}
{"text":"I have slithered into this place a couple times now since it opened. Going from the old bar where unless you only wore a leather vest with no shirt underneath and were a total doucher, to being an actual respectable place, i was stoked. Me and my crew of worthless turds went to the patio and were taken care of. They have a pretty legit happy hour so for a cheap ass like me, i was not upset. After having 3-4 of the most premium bud lights (King Of Beer) in the country, I noticed that there were couches on the side of the patio. This is a plus because I like to be as non active as possible while getting toasty. TVs are everywhere playing sports. Usually i spend my nights sprawled out naked on my tile floor hoping that Antique Roadshow is on the tube but when you want to have an even better night than that (impossible), go to the hub. Good eats there too.....if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"I tried this spot after the movies last weekend. I liked that they had a variety of options on the menu. The appetizer we ordered was pretty good. It was potatoes sliced thin with cheese, sour cream and green onions. I ordered the salmon and quinoa. It smelled a little fishy but overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! Never a disappointment. Their smoked wings are amazing and they always have a great selection of beer on draft.   The staff are always knowledgeable? on the drinks and the food. Always welcoming and professional."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Tons of TVs which can be overwhelming sitting at the bar. Service is okay. Like sitting outside, one of the better patios in the area. Definitely a step up from Madd Dogs. Overall great place to watch sports and get some good grub."}
{"text":"Went for the gluten free menu and was pleased to find there were a lot of options. (burgers, sandwiches, nachos, potato skins, wings, etc)  Had a spicy grilled chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce (don't remember the actual name) and fries. The piece of chicken was HUGE and hung off both sides of the GF bun. Onion and tomato were cut thick and were very fresh. Sauce was delicious. Fries were crispy and very, very long.  I was surprised at the portions and the quality of the ingredients. I also felt the prices were very fair.   All 4 members of my party enjoyed our food and the atmosphere and agreed we'd go back."}
{"text":"The Hub is a super fun place and their Devil Burger with a fried egg added on is.... Delicious!"}
{"text":"I am upset I didn't even get to try the restaurant out but that is because we were forced to wait for a table as others came in requesting the games and fights got sat immedietly.  I even asked for first available. Other guests came in and got sad before us 3 different times!!! That alone was reason to leave, not to mention the rude server who didn't even hold the door open for me or the hostess that didn't even acknowledge me or anyone in my party as we walked in the door."}
{"text":"Just popped in here for the first time since it's been The Hub.  A Friday night during happy hour and this place is buzzing!!  Hubs and I sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by Shane, who asked if it was our first time and got our beer orders.  Shortly thereafter, Dustin brought us some complimentary cornbread to thank us for coming in and also gave us some menu recommendations.  What an unexpected surprise!  Dustin, James and Shane checked in on us several times during our visit and made us feel very welcome and expressed their appreciation for our business.  These three guys made our visit!  Oh yeah...the food...We ordered the smoked chicken wings (upon recommendation) and wow!  They were fall-off-the-bone delicious!  We followed that up with The Italian Pizza, which was also very yummy.  We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! If you like friendly service, awesome food and cold beer then you have found your spot! The Hub has surpassed my expectations! The food is great (highly recommend the AZ smoked wings and the pretzel)! Drinks are cold and generous and their happy hour is seriously unbeatable! Do yourself a favor and check it out! Get the wings!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go to in the east valley! I've been coming here since 2013 and it's been great each time. Their smoked wings are on the top of my list of things to order. You won't be disappointed! The beer is always cold and the staff is always friendly! Great atmosphere to watch college and NFL football!"}
{"text":"Bad start,  15 minutes and I had to find a server to order drinks. Another 5 to get them. Ordered hummus to start with,  absolutely awful,  nothing in the description says curry but you get slapped in the face with curry.  Didn't get silverware until our entrees arrived. Garlic fries are very good, would be nice to see some garlic pieces with them but the flavor is there.  My partner order the Baja chicken tacos with queso fresco added. The avocado portion on the taco is great not skimpy at all,  still waiting on the queso fresco. The flavor is a bit bland nothing seems to be standing out,  the limes were dry and not very juicy, garlic fries added to the tacos made them taste much better.  I ordered the green chile burrito,  portion is huge,  and first bite screams green chile , unfortunately the cheese sauce is broken and curdled, so I get grainy mouth feel.  The flavor is good,  chicken isn't dry but a bit too many black beans. Service needs alot of work,  not many people here on a Sunday and I've seen 4 servers yet no one really seems to have an interest in doing their job, my beer is almost empty and has been since entrees were dropped. Specials were never discussed, wasn't given the option of ordering a large beer because \"they're on happy hour so we give you a small\" well heaven forbid if I wanted just one beer and it to be tall,  because who knows when they're going toy ask if I want another even though 2 servers have walked by 6 times without even asking how we are doing. Overall service sucks,  ask about all ingredients in the food and don't add extra, also don't expect them to actually work for a tip. Now we have to go find our server to pay, oh wait there is our server making sure the table of only women gets good service and more beer."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworkers who recommended the place. One of them recommended the Arizona smoked wings. I love wings, so even though they were a little pricey, I decided to get the pound of wings (10 total), honey hot and raspberry chipotle. He said they were so good that they fall off the bones. I have never had wings that fall off the bone so I thought he was just joking or exaggerating... little did I know it was an understatement. I am not one that will eat all the meat off a wing and there is always some meat left on the ends. These wings literally fell off the bones into my mouth and there was nothing left but bones in the end. As I sit here writing this review, still full and contemplating a siesta, my mouth is literally salivating thinking about them. I am sure there is probably other good food on their menu, but that doesn't matter as I will be getting these every time I visit. My one complaint is that there was not very much honey at all on the honey hots (could hardly even taste the honey) and they could have used some more sauce on them compared to the raspberry chipotle where the sauce was dripping off of them."}
{"text":"Arrived tonight, asked to sit on the patio. Less than half the patio and restaurant was full. Waited 20 minutes with no service and ignored by the bar tender. We were ready to drink but I guess they don't want our money."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend for a late dinner and got there at 11:30pm, only to be informed that their kitchen closes at 11pm, but they're still serving drinks until last call at 1:45am. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Watch out for the giant spike! I ordered the pot roast French dip from the lunch menu it had a large wooden spike hidden in it holding both halves together. Was not visible and my sandwich fell to pieces when I pick up half and the other half came with it. Nice concept but poor execution. The fries were tasty. Also got the turkey avocado sandwich. Very greasy. Again decent concept but not the best execution. It was lunch time and both came out very quick after we ordered. 3.09 for an iced tea and 2.50 for a pint of beer. What? Average bar food. 2.50 pints on Monday is a good deal. Watch out for the spike!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy hanging out here and bringing my family to come here. Tonight Monday, being football Monday, was pretty busy. The server was more attentive to a party of 8 with elderly people sitting there then my son and I. I happen to know the manager and have worked with him in the past so the server was unaware of this relationship I've had. I had ordered mozzarella sticks after my entree and of course they came out before my entree which was fine... but my entree came out with the manager because it was sitting in the window under the heat lamp . The bun on my son's burger was like a rock so he had to replace the bun, my son was hungry so he started to eat his burger. The server did check a couple times but was unaware of the situation because she didn't deliver the food...she would have been more been aware  that the bun was hard as a rock.  The bill came and I had change coming which was $16.25 from a $40 bill, the server took it upon herself to keep the change... what does a quarter mean?  Its not a big deal, but if I ask for change back you give me All the change back! So I gave her a less of a tip because she took it upon herself to keep the quarter. Change means change, don't keep quarter for yourself. You just screwed yourself out of more money because I'm a 20% tipper. I have worked in the industry for 25 plus years and I always give the customer back the coin change regardless of is a simple penny or a complete amount of change. Today's society with kids working behind tables and waiting on people pisses me off of the fax it entitlement does not mean you get to keep my loose change. Return the loose change to the table if then the gas gives you the change as a tip oh well you get the change and the bills but don't keep it just because you don't have a coin on you. Bring a proper bank to work."}
{"text":"I do love this hub! The food is better than my puns. Burgers are incredibly juicy and large, fries are great! Staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago for the first time to have lunch and was very impressed! Great food selection, have an even better happy hour and beer selection is on point! I'll definitely be back! I don't remember my waitresses name but she was awesome."}
{"text":"Second time comming to this place and will be the last. Food takes forever. The pizza we had tonight was like card board. Seriously, you could break the pizza in half. It was horrible. The server took forever to cash us out. I had to go to the hostess to ask her to cash me out. She was rude. No thankyou, no please come again..."}
{"text":"I always have great service, food and overall great time at The Hub. I have been to the one on Sossaman multiple times and the stapley location continues the great times. They have great daily deals and happy hour and the food is always wonderful. I recommend the Green chili burrito....as you can see it is larger than my wifes forearm. Keep up the great work Stapley Hub!!"}
{"text":"The Hub is my Girlfriend and I's favorite Bar/Restaurant. Always amazing service, always amazing food and always cold beer on tap. You can tell the staff likes there job's and really care about offering great service! Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"They were overwhelmed due to the fact it was the NBA FINALS.   Servers were overloaded and friendly,  bartenders were on fire   Food was OFF THE HOOK scrumptious  I saw everyone back each other up. This place is Fantastic !!!"}
{"text":"Very very nice sports bar. It has indoor and outdoor spacious seating areas, lots of tvs for sport watching and nice upbeat atmosphere. I am not a beer drinker but my boy friend says they have a good variety of good draft beer. I ordered guacamole and a pizza with everything on it. The guacamole was good but the plate was too small. The pizza was good just not the best... I am sure other meals offered are good. I was here for a painting class and I had a good time. I will definitely come back to enjoy the bar."}
{"text":"The Hub has excellent food, drinks and service! I have been a regular since they opened their first location several years ago. With a full-service bar, more TVs than you can imagine, and AMAZING customer service, the Hub is the place to be! NOW OFF TO EAT ONE OF THEIR MOUTH WATERING BURGERS AND SOME WINGS! :D"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out even though my husband warned me that all my choices of places stink. I said :\"This place will be great, I promise! Yelp says it will\"! heh- famous last words right? We get there and there is a pretty long wait. Ok we wait. We get sat and order zucchini right away. It comes out hot, but overcooked almost burnt. It's ok. My husband ordered a burger with a salad as his side. I ordered the Rapsberry Turkey melt with a salad also. Finally the food comes and one of my pet peeves is ordering a soup or salad and it comes with the entrée. These did so I was automatically annoyed by this. This is service 101. I shouldn't have to decide whether I should eat my cold salad first so my hot sandwich gets cold, or eat my hot sandwich and let my salad sit there.  Anyway, the sandwich was piled high with turkey, which really isn't a good thing since turkey is dry. Less is more for this one. After scraping off the tomatoes, which I had requested NOT be on it, the flavor wasn't there. Considering it was a \"melt\" I expected nice buttery bread. Nope. Dry. The raspberry chipotle sauce should really be on the side. I was trying to find chicken sandwiches on the menu (which I prefer) but I must be an idiot because I couldn't find any, even under the \"Burgers and Chicken\" list.  We also didn't get the \"free jalapeño corn bread  for first time customers\" like a lot of Yelp reviewers got, but that is no biggie.  The thing is we rarely have nights off together to go out to eat because of work schedules, so when we do we want to make it count and be totally wowed! I certainly was not wowed by The Hub or it's food. I thought it was pricey too. 13.00 bucks for a sandwich and side salad? Eh."}
{"text":"Love this place! This location has rotated through several bars but no one has done it right like The Hub. The food is very good and the menu gets refreshed regularly. Big beer selection and the bartenders are fast and friendly. Clean dining area and restrooms. They even have a treasure chest for kids to open with their \"key\" after they eat their dinner. For us its very close, we are Hub fans for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I sent an email on through the \"contact us\" on their website regarding our experience and I received no response.  I tried to keep the experience within a small circle, however, no response means \"we don't care\" which is exactly what happened when we tried to have dinner at this establishment.    We were looking for a restaurant that we have not tried.  We went to The Hub and requested patio seating.   The hostess informed us the patio was full but they could seat us next to the patio at the open areas but the table would be inside.  We agreed.   We were seated and next thing I knew there was a big dog wondering around at the table next to us on the patio side with three people.   The waiter came up to us and said \"my name is ???\".  About that time, the dog was now 1/2 inside the establishment seeking attention from my husband.    I asked if we could be moved to get away from the dog.  He said \"yes, I can move you to the next table\".  That was not going to solve the problem, the dog had a long enough leash to still bother us and I don't particularly care to have slobber and dog hair around where I am eating.   Don't get me wrong, we love dogs and have large dogs.   We could have stayed home if we wanted their company.    I asked the waiter why we were the ones who have to move, as the dog was still hanging around us.  The waiter shrugged his shoulders and said \"I don't know what you want me to do, I guess I could get a manager\".  Good idea.   We waited over 8 minutes and had to endure the very intoxicated owner of the dog tell us it is a \"pet friendly establishment\" and that he has been there since 11:00 a.m.   It was 5:00 p.m.    Shame on this restaurant!   This poor dog has had to sit in the sun on this patio with no shelter, no food and a little white cup that the dog couldn't drink out of because of its' size. The dog was restricted to the length of the leash.   The owner and friends were extremely intoxicated and had no clue.     As we were getting up to leave.  A couple of employees and the waiter walked over to the dog table.   We were never approached.   We were able to walk out without anyone saying a word.  Keep in mind, we walked through the entire restaurant.  It is very clear this establishment care more about $$$$ they received for the 6 hours of people getting drunk and exposing an animal to inhumane conditions than 2 people just wanting to have a quiet night at a new restaurant.     We can't rate the food, we were not given an opportunity to try it."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Amazing local beers on tap! The portions are huge so be ready for leftovers and to share! 5 stars aren't enough!"}
{"text":"The Hub Grill and Bar had just opened up and my office and I got a voucher to come in and dine with them. We called ahead to set reservations since we were on our lunch break. When we get there we were not on their list and we had 9 people show up. It looked as if there were other parties there as well so we were not seated right away. Next, we are seated and the hostess who was not friendly at all told us our server will be right with us. 10 minutes or so goes by and a server walks by to let us know that our assigned server will be just a few more minutes and asked to take our drink order. We all ordered water and that took another 10 minutes to get to us. Again we were told our server will be right with us and another 10 minutes went by and I had to ask a different server where is our assigned server??? She said,\" let me check on that for you\" and finally someone comes and says she'll be filling in for our assigned server. Did our server not show up to work?? Lastly, our food takes forever to get to us and my food personally tasted disgusting. It was the southwestern pizza, something along those lines. Basically a mexican pizza, the ground beef they put on top was scarce, barely any and the flavor of the cheeses and other toppings was just no good. I will not be going back and neither will any of my co-workers. Thank you very much for the voucher for us to try you guys out, but we were not impressed."}
{"text":"Walked up tonight and the manager said,  \"welcome back\" The hostesses were very friendly and the waitress too. Food came out quick and was delicious. Very comfortable environment. Love this place!!! For sure the nicest staff in town Jennifer and lou"}
{"text":"Great food and EXCELLENT service! I was in the area for a soccer game, and this was down the road. Turned out to be really good! Waiter Ashely was super attentive and friendly. My Turkey Avocado was HUGE. It's a shareable dish. Husbands pretzel burger was equally big, fresh bun and good onion rings. The potato cheese chips were kinda dry and hard but over all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. My mother in laws wing were \"coming out\", but didn't come out for another 15 minutes. It was not removed from our bill, but they brought us a whole other 1 lb of smoked wings, which was not what we wanted. The waitress has too many tables and we never got what we needed when we asked for it cause she was running around trying to help everyone. Overall good food, but could have been better!"}
{"text":"This is the go to spot for me and my best friend! We love the mac and cheese! Green chili pork and pico make it kind of tex mex in the best way! They have a large variety of Mules, which are my favorite cocktail, especially the classic Arizona Mule with a ton of limes. Also try the apple cobbler dessert! Super tasty with a huge scoop of ice cream. The service is kind of slow sometimes, but honestly, the food and drinks make up for it! Wish they had a frequent customer program because I am here all the time!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at the Vue.  Our party of 8 were accommodated in a reasonable time.  Food is pretty good - prices are a little high.  It's a sports bar so it's going to be a little noisy!  Comfortable sitting with TVs outside on the patio also."}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday for lunch with my teenage son. He got a burger and loved it. I had a turkey sandwich and it was good too, but have to say the service was SLOW. They needed a another waitress or two. Might come back again, with the air conditioning it was freezing in there though, so might wait till fall. Really I'd say the verdict is still out."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and grill we've always been satisfied with food and service. You have to try the Arizona Wings there fantastic matter of fact order  anything you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet: Can only give 3 stars when I would rather give 3 and 1/2.   PROS:  - Good Burgers - Some of the apps are decent  - Good drinks - Decent drink PRICES - First-time visitors get a free piece of jalapeno cornbread   CONS:  - Dimly lit if that's not your thing this can bother you  - Service can be spotty  - Cleanliness (first time we went my GF sat down and the chair was still wet  - Can feel a little cramped on a busy night  - Parking can suck (but that's not really their problem, just a heads up)  - Can get very loud   Overall: If I don't have anywhere to go, it would be one of my fall back places to eat."}
{"text":"An excellent experience!  Visiting from Wisconsin, we were looking for a spot to watch some of the bowl games and this place did not disappoint.  The service was fantastic, even bringing out a free appetizer because it was our first time at the restaurant.  I wish I would have gotten our waitresses name because she did a fantastic job.  The food was also excellent.  My BBQ burger was cooked perfectly and was as good as you can ask for.  One of my friends got the ultimate grilled cheese, which was actually two grilled cheese sandwiches.  She had no complaints.  If we ever come back to Arizona, HUB will definitely be one of our stops.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with a great friends of mine. Omg looking at the menu, I was wishing I could eat there daily for weeks to try everything. We finally decided on jalepeno garlic strings and garlic Cajun hub chips. They had such great flavor, yes we like things spicy and shared everything!!! That's the best way with this beautiful menu! Next we shared green chili steak Philly and the classic burger with jalapeno cheese. We cut them in half and share them. This is the most delicious meal I have had in a long time and we ordered some drinks to go along with it and we something strong. We had like a fruity version of a Long Island Iced Tea. It was so flavorful. What a great meal a great time. And then we sat on the patio which was awesome great night out great staff great service. If they had more stars to give I would totally give them!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times and have no complaints. We went the other night for a paint night & upon walking in the door were greeted immediately. We ventured up to the bar to get a cocktail before the painting began. We had service through the event which was prompt and everything came out great! Up at the bar are several TV's which are great for watching football games (bowl season & all). It's not a place that's so amazing you can't imagine going anywhere else but it's a great spot for a cold beer (they have a ton on tap) & some snacks!"}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so i ordered a veggie calzone but unfortunately when the food was brought out i noticed sausage in the calzone they gave me. when the waiter came back my boyfriend mentioned that i couldn't eat it and the one i had ordered only had veggies in it. my review is 5 stars cause the waiter was so nice and so patient about the situation, and so was the manager that brought out my new calzone. i'm a very understanding and patient person myself and i've worked in the service industry for 7 years. so i get it, things happen, i wasn't aggressive or rude or anything. they ended up obviously not charging us for the first calzone and then offered us a free dessert or shot which my boyfriend gladly took up and it was perfect since it's his birthday weekend.  i know they were just following their job description but it's so easy for people to be negative about things like this and they weren't at all."}
{"text":"Came here tonight, only second day open and t was amazing!! They did such a nice job on the place, the staff is upbeat and and friendly and the renovations came out awesome, couldn't drink tonight but can't wait to enjoy all the awesome draft beer, Aaron the manager was great, I met josh and and I'm happy that Kristie is still working there from the last place. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Drink was very good. Margarita pizza was terrible. Flat dry cracker like-crust was terrible. Tried to fix it with marinara sauce but still terrible. Service not good but they were slammed due to the Packers game. I'll have to order something different next time."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just because it's a new location and they are still ironing out the kinks but wow was my experience here horrible.   We were greeted and sat quite quickly, then we sat there for about 15 min before someone came and greeted us and asked us for our drink order. We gave it then about 3 min later someone else came and greeted us and asked for our drink order. We explained how we just gave it, she said okay great and left. Our drinks came and then it was about another 15 min before he came back to get our food order. Eventually the 15 min became 20 and just to the point it be Ame easier to get up and go to the bar ourselves to order our drinks. Defeats the point of having a server but it was easier than getting frustrated and waiting/looking for someone to help us.  We were just there for some drinks and food to catch up with some friends. They raved about the first location and this second location was closer to some of us so we figured let's check it out.   Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great staff. Bartenders are awesome and friendly food is descant for bar food. I've never been bummed out by what was put I front of me. Only gripe is to have them keep children on the family side. The bar area is for the grown ups. Sorry but I do cuss from time to time and if you ask me to watch my language in a bar because of your kid. Well it's going to be embarrassing for you. As I respond with a get f@#*ed comment and explain that it's a bar. So parents after your little league game take do the right thing."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on a Saturday night. Usually bar and grills are so busy you're lucky just to get your order taken, food served and a bill, NOT HERE!  The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. They took the time to welcome us and even gave us a free app of green chili corn bread for it being our first time (which was delicious by the way). The waitress was very good at explaining the menu and reminding us of all their weekly specials if we wanted to come back (which we will). I ordered the $10 grilled cheese and the husband orders the pulled pork sandwich. Both entrees were enormous and enough to feed an army. We had left overs for lunch the next day at a price that honestly could have been doubled for what we got.  I also ordered a grilled cheese to go for my daughter at home, which was prepared in no time.  Overall the staff, food, prices, beer choices and total environment are a total win for us. We will make this our new pit stop on the east side!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here the other day for my birthday dinner. We just moved to Mesa from Southern California, and have been searching high and low for a great wing place. This is that place.  Wings are my absolute favorite food. I could eat them all day, every day. I'm a traditional buffalo wing kind of girl, I want them crispy and spicy, and drowned in ranch dressing, and they gave me just that.  Coleman was our waiter, and not only was he extremely friendly, personable, and helpful, he was super attentive as well. With it being my birthday, we went all out with drinks, apps, and food.  We ordered drinks, and were asked if it was our first time there, and we said yes. I ordered a margarita, there's plenty to choose from. A few minutes later, the manager, Steven, came out with a plate of cornbread for us, on him for it being our first time. It was absolutely delicious!  We started with the exploding potato skins. Holy amazing. They're basically potato nachos. Thin sliced potatoes, lots of cheese, and the thickest, most delicious bacon I've ever had on a restaurant appetizer. My boyfriend and I fought over the last bite. Since it was our first time, I wasn't sure about any of the sauces. I told Coleman what I like, and he helped explain the ones to me he felt picked that category. I ended up ordering the El Jefe, Arizona style, with lots of ranch.  The wings were fantastic. Because I prefer a crispier wing, I'm not sure if I'll get the Arizona style again, but they were still absolutely delicious, fall off the bone tender, and the sauce was so so good. I contemplated scraping the extra off the bottom with a spoon. Seriously, it's that good.   Boyfriend got the grilled cheese. I'm pretty sure I saw him melt when he took the first bite. He was in love with it. I'm pretty sure if it came down to me or that grilled cheese, I would have gone home alone. Seriously, it was that good.  All in all, this place is seriously awesome, and I already can't wait to go back. And the service was just as good as the food.! Thanks for the awesome birthday dinner guys."}
{"text":"We've gone there several times which is more a commentary about bars in East Mesa than how much we like The Hub. To begin with, it's kind of pricey - burger, entree salad and two beers for $47?  I dunno, seems like a lot to me.  Avoid the pizza which was described by my server as 'incredible' but reduced me to a solitary getouttahere.  My general opinion is that it's ok but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Service was spotty, the drinks took forever to come out, appetizers barely arrived before mains, wings were cold and pizza reminded me of Chuck e cheese back in the day. I have heard from friends having better experiences so I will try again just to make sure it wasn't an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions. U have to try the peanut butter burger"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I typically order to-go food here at least once a week.  We love their quality of food and their insanity sauce for their hot wings!  It has a great amount of kick that we all love!  Typically my coworkers always offer to pick up the food, and my visit last week was the first time I came in.  I unfortunately wasn't greeted at the door right away.  I stood in the front for about 5 minutes just waiting for someone to walk down the hallway and see me.  I almost was about to just walk right into the restaurant before someone spotted me.  After mentioning I was picking up a to-go order, I was sent over to the bar.  There I waited another 15 minutes before my food finally came out.  It was about 20 minutes longer than they said the food would be.  I didn't really mind because I wasn't too much in a rush.  But the people taking the phone orders should have a better estimate on the time it will take for the order to be ready, so that myself (and others) can plan out the appropriate time to pick it up."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service.  We had burgers, chicken strips, salad and chips with trio of dips."}
{"text":"First time at The Hub .  So happy to see a gluten free menu.  This place was packed with customers. Service was great and fast. Had heard about their smoked wings and finally got to try them; ::: smoked, hot, grilled, then re-tossed!!! . WOW. really amazing wings. All the food coming out of the kitchen looked ridiculously scrumptious . Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I just ordered 3 lbs. of rasberry chipotle wings. They are not nearly as good as their Sossoman location. There was almost no sauce on the wings. I'll just stick to the Sossoman location . Their wings are amazing."}
{"text":"I get it's Sunday night football but seriously?  Football over the World Series??? Smh. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Great place super kid friendly and the food is good. The kids get to pick toys from a huge treasure chest before they leave . I had the meatloaf and my wife had Swedish meatballs and both were pretty good . We did however not like the mash potatoes and neither of us ate them . Overall food and service far exceeded poorly made mash taters"}
{"text":"I love the food at the Hub and the service is average - however, tonight I waited 48 minutes for my check and another 16 minutes for her to bring my card back.  Literally 4 table and a hand full of people at the inside bar.  My food was dropped Off and no one checked on me again.   So many options around the Hub with yummy food too... the Hub lost a customer tonight"}
{"text":"been here 3 times. always service is lousy, slow as hell, forget you, slow on drinks, clean up. we still occasionally drop in due to the food, it's pretty good. but as a regular foodie, i would not recommend"}
{"text":"My hubby and I absolutely love this place. Great food, amazing and friendly staff and ice cold beer.  Thirsty Thursday. Thursdays are $3.00 craft beer and half price pizza night."}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say!!! OMG what a welcome they gave us! My heart is here now & forever at our fav Sports Bar in the Hood! Thank you Chris & ZackSee ya all soon!!!! May I add they treated us to their welcome pkg with free dessert???? Really very kind & welcoming! Tear....."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often when he's home and off the road. Our absolute FAVORITE server is Ryan. He's very attentive, polite, conversation flows nicely and he goes above and beyond the servers duty. The pretzel basket is yummy - we love the beer cheese and mustard. My boyfriend usually gets the AZ Smoked Wings and I try something different each time. The burgers are giant, messy and delicious. But my absolute favorite is the HFC - mashed potatoes, corn, gravy, green onions, cheese and chicken tenders with a side of ranch for me. YES PLEASE!! Tuesday night is trivia night and it's always a good time. You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I came in on Friday night looking to for a new neighbor bar and grill.   Although it was pretty busy, I was immediately greeted and went ahead and sat in the bar section.  I decided to try out the special which was the Fish Fry and was pleasantly surprised by a large portion of lighted breaded fish as well as fries.   Thought the fries were awesome along with the fish.   I decided to stick around for a while afterwards as it was Karaoke night and had a few beers.  Overall great atmosphere, excellent staff and good food.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This review is for the Pub House Mac and cheese.   IF this restaurant was in a cockroach motel in the middle of Death Valley and the wait staff all had dirty fingernails like a heroin addict, and when you walked in the place you were assaulted by panhandlers wanting you to buy them dinner........the Mac and Cheese alone would make this place a five star.   Seriously it's that good.   Don't worry the atmosphere is way better. A tad bit on the loud side.....or you could call it bustling, but lots of TVs to watch your favorite ball game and the staff was friendly and attentive, even though it seemed busy for a Wednesday night. It was our first time in and when we mentioned it our server brought us some pretty delish cornbread on the house.   Back to the Mac and cheese. It has a slight kick from the jalapeños. If you can't handle kick you need to figure that out. Cause you'll miss out on the best Mac n cheese ever! It has shredded pork which might seem strange to others (one of the staff mentioned that when I told him how great it was.....) but I like shredded pork so it was a perfect addition. The pork was hydrated (not moist! Who says that about food? Sick! Ok that was for my wife) and tasty. They add some crunchy topping stuff for texture. The noodles are oversized macaroni noodles and at this point who even cares what kind of cheese it is. Whatever it is it was great.   I just reheated it for lunch today and it was just as good. So I had to write this review. I've been on Yelp for like 7 years and this is my third review. It's that good."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood & stopped here. We ordered \"The Hub\" medium well & it was juicy & big enough for the two of us. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service the last few times we have been there for dine in or pick up has been amazing. We love the wings and the beer selection. This will be our new hangout and will not be going anywhere else for wings."}
{"text":"Yelp steered me wrong in this one.  To be fair, the food might have been good, had we been able to eat it hot.  Service was horrible.  After 20 minutes with no greeting and no one to take a drink order, we had to flag someone down and ask if we had a server. Drinks took 20 minutes. Food came out 20 minutes later, but no one brought silverware, despite us asking the server who delivered the food. She blatantly ignored us. So by the time someone could be flagged down to bring silverware, food was cold."}
{"text":"Even on a week night this place is crowed at 7:30 pm.  It's not the kind of place for romantic dinners or being able to sit and talk with your friends.  The Hub is large and very nosiy.  What do you expect it's a sports bar with  millions of T.V's all over the place, and people of all ages coming to sit, eat good food, and watch different sports.  We sat close to the bar at a table/ booth area.  I love to people watch so this was perfect for me.   My husband sat next to me so he could watch, Baseball.  It only took minutes to get our drink order and after we ordered, our food came fast.  The food is a little better than the usual bar food. Our food was made to order and very good. The Hub is not the type of place where you go to relax because it's filled with energy, but it is a place to go for good food and beer."}
{"text":"Loved it!! My hubby and I both had burgers on pretzel buns. The burgers were fantastic! As a side I got a salad which was really good. The service was great, our server was fast, accurate and very sweet. For a small neighborhood sports grill this place is tops."}
{"text":"Great place! Seating is always pretty easy to get. The atmosphere is really nice and very clean. Lots of tv's to watch sports but it's not too loud. The food is always good. Everything from the huge pretzel appetizer that's served with a mustard and warm cheese dip, to the burgers. I had a devil burger today and it was amazing. Not too hot to eat but just enough to still enjoy. There were half price appetizers on a Saturday. The kids had chicken strips and fries for $5. These were adult portions. We also had the biggest serving of nachos for $6. Both were really good too. Great selection of beer from both the tap to bottles. LOTS to choose from. They also have lots of mixed drinks and ciders to choose from.  Everyone always finds something good each time we go back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The burger was excellent as was the coleslaw. They also offered a spicy cornbread appetizer since it was our first visit. If they were closer, we would come here more often.   Update: their gluten free turkey avocado sandwich is SOOO GOOD! The bread is sourdough, the turkey tender and juicy. I ate the whole thing!! YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the service at the Hub. Ryan was our server tonight and he did an amazing job. He was attentive and he was friendly. Dustin, Aka \"da bomb\"( the manager) came over and chatted with us for a little bit. He also helped take great care of us. We had all of that going for us... And then... The food came. And it was amazing. We had the cheddar potatoes and the steak and bake and the Green chilies. Every single bite was heaven! We will be back The Hub, we will be back. (And we will never go to the Steak and Stone in Gilbert.)"}
{"text":"Great place for atmosphere and the food is always good. You are safe ordering just about anything off the menu but the peanut butter burger and the smoked cajun (wet is best) wings are out of this world. They even have a treasure chest where kids can pick out a toy to take home after dinner. Love this place!"}
{"text":"First time at The HUB after a suggestion from my wife's co-worker. Went on wife's lunch hour so it took about 15 minutes to get here but well worth the time.  Server was KC and she was excellent, very personable and knowledgeable. We advised her this was our first time at the HUB and they gave us a piece of their corn bread which was delicious. We started  with the Cajun grilled wings, which were excellent. Extremely tender and with a generous portion of meat on the wings. We asked for a side of medium buffalo sauce which gave the wings a nice bite. Wife and I shared the French Dip Roast Beef which also was excellent. Not a traditional French Dip, but actually chunks of roast beef with mozzarella cheese and gravy for dipping.  Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"Went here for wingsday. They had 1/2lb smoked wings for $4.79. The wings arrived & there were 5 of the tiniest wings I've ever seen. Yeah they were good, but I highly doubt it was a 1/2lb. Also, the server was super slow. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Good step up from the last place that was here.  Working out a few kinks as to be expected,  but the wings were good and the draft beer was cold and plenty of TVs. Can't say much more yet as it was a quick stop,  but looks promising!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here yesterday while exploring Mesa!  The food and drinks were good and the service from Ashleyrose wasExcellent! The manager Johnny was very friendly and made sure we well taken care of. We will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Had the worst service here! Restaurant had we guess an overwhelming lunch crowd and as we arrived there was waitresses screaming and totally rude!! Never have experienced this!! Unbelievable!! Will never go back! Waitresses are immature and management poor!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try this place out because it's close enough to our house that an Uber wouldn't break the bank and we were very pleasantly surprised. The drinks we're great and reasonably priced, but the reason we keep going back is for the smoked wings! We both agreed that they were hands down the best wings we've ever had! Not too spicy, but not too bland, and they just fell off the bone. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"The Hub is a nice place but what I ordered was lacking. I ordered the Burnt Brisket Sandwich. The Brisket is presented as mini burnt square pieces of meat in a sweet BBQ sauce. My sides were six thinly sliced pickles and I mean paper thin, with fries that came five minutes after my meal. Oh yes, I also has a splat of coleslaw on the plate. Everyone else had a small cup of coleslaw (what is up with that).  Would never order this $14.00 meal again. The good news is the staff friendly, so I will return."}
{"text":"The Cobb Salad and Arizona smoked wings are two of the many favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place... (Went 10/7/14) My friend and I actually just were gonna get a bit to eat and a drink or two when we first walked about 6:30 on a Tuesday. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice and very knowledgable about the drinks they offered. I ordered a Moscow mule (which is normally hard to get cause a lot of places don't have ginger beer) and my friend and I opted to share the pork tacos and nachos... About 10 min later our huge plate of nachos came out and I mean huge...they made it on a pizza platter and our amazing tacos... As we were finishing our food and getting ready  to leave they had started trivia night so we decided to stay and check it out and it was a blast...ended up staying until 1030 because we were having so much fun and just loved the atmosphere... It is now going to be our weekly ladies night spot."}
{"text":"The Hub is always a great place to take the family. Great food, reasonable prices, and the kids love the treasure chest. Will be back often. I like the atmosphere at this location!"}
{"text":"I come here often and the food is consistently good. Daily food and drink specials keep this place close to the top of my favorites list. Writing my review today because our server Austin did a great job and kept us entertained and made sure we needed nothing during our visit. Frankly I should have written it long ago because I have always enjoyed Hubs and it's friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, and the staff is super friendly! We came on a Sunday and it was crowded but they sat us immediately. They even brought us a complementary jalapeño cornbread as it was our first time here. We ordered the smoked buffalo wings-amazing!! Also a Cobb salad and fish tacos. Everything was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour always a good time. Love the Cobb salad and chicken wings are delish! Good deal on drinks too"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good selection of craft beers. The wings are amazing. Only wish they had one closer to home in Gilbert/Chandler"}
{"text":"We live nearby and wanted to try someplace new. The Hub was great. We showed up at 7pm on a Friday night, parking lot and restaurant were packed, but we were immediately seated. The waitress was friendly and the manager also made the rounds to make sure everything was going well. Food was great and the chocolate chip cookie dessert was amazing. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Always great service and good food! We usually go once a week.  Fun place to take visiting family."}
{"text":"Love the Hub, wings in Wednesday are the bees knees. They have smoked wings or regular fried wings. The other food selections are fantastic. If you order the grilled cheese be prepared for a monster meal. They have cornhole tournaments on Wednesdays also. We keep trying various items on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet but those wings, dammit they're good!"}
{"text":"So I recently went to both locations, and if  like me, you like wings that are not drenched in sauce, this is the place.  Their smoked wings are AMAZING (especially with the Cajun dry rub for some heat) and I am not kidding when I say that the meat FALLS OFF the bone.  After going to the east Mesa location on the way back from Saguaro Lake, I had such a craving a week later that I drove all the way to this location from downtown Phoenix just to get some wings to go.  I forgot how I ordered them, so a server named Katie was super helpful, and I had a beer while I waited and Nick the bartender was super knowledgeable about all the beers, as there were a couple locals drafts I had never had.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Smoked El Jefe wings are my favorite food right now. I have only done take out here so I am not able to comment on anything else.  French fries we not the best but I am sure they would be great if you ate at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best nachos I've ever had! The staff here is always friendly and make it such a pleasant experience. It's a great place to watch your favorite sports game or just hang out with friends and enjoy some drinks. Great happy hours prices as well! I would definitely recommend visiting this place if you get the chance."}
{"text":"As good as the other reviews make it out to be...  Reasinable beer prices, and pretty darn good grub for a bar!  The smoked wings are just too farn good...should have ordered a full lb... a bit pricy, but damn were they good!  The hub club filled me up and then some...only complaint was it was dry on 1 side and dripping juice on the other...well worth the price.  Next time im n town ill surely repeat!"}
{"text":"AZ smoked wings are great!  They have a wide beer selection and the atmosphere is what you'd expect in a sports bar."}
{"text":"Waitress starts out with a snap comment ... What do you want to drink ... Well I just sat down how about a menu/ beer list honey.  4 stars people???? I thought the chipotle raspberry  wings were ok at best  served with 1 celery piece :( sad I was planing on ordering a few more things but I was so turned off I had wings a few brews ..."}
{"text":"I have been here since 6:50pm and it is now 7:27pm and still haven't seen a server.  The service continues to go downhill here as well as the food. I try to come here to give them another chance and each time it get a worse. Done..time to find another place."}
{"text":"Could have been better. Didn't have a particular item in stock and didn't offer an apology or any discount to appease me. I asked twice. Honestly, a 50 cent discount would have made me happy. Two managers refused any sort of discount, so that sucks. Food is overpriced, karaoke was cool. That's about it."}
{"text":"Great local bar and grill in East Mesa with a large selection of food and drinks. It's a rather dark atmosphere inside but the food has been good. I had the Korean BBQ Rice Bowl my first visit and found myself thinking about that dish the entire week after. I went back shortly after and ordered it again but it just wasn't the same quality. The next time I had a side salad and the hummus which is clearly meant to be shared and I wish the waitress would've warned me. Additionally, it's a curry flavored hummus and not as appealing as a normal hummus offering. The thing that really bothers me though is the service. The staff has never been super attentive to even refill water glasses and doesn't seem to have a good grasp of the menu. Whenever I ask a question they have to go confer with someone else and one particular waitress continues to call me \"honey\" in a somewhat demeaning manner. Though I generally enjoy the food, the service could use some improvements."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times, can't believe I haven't reviewed THE HUB, my friendly neighborhood bar. Every single time I go here, whether it's a quick drink with my girls, a day off watching football with my guy, pregaming, or strolling in as a last stop after a night of bar hopping, I always have an awesome time here. Management, servers, bartenders have always been A+, fun and friendly. Such a relaxed atmosphere. They make me feel welcome at every level of my debauchery, mild to extreme haha!  And let me tell you about the smoked wings!! OMFG they just fall right off the bone and make you feel euphoric! The Kitchen Sink is my favorite appetizer. I think the only thing I've ever ordered here that I wasn't crazy about are the nachos... Can't put my finger on it. But this place makes up for the \"meh\" nachos in every other way!   If you wanna have a good time, delicious food, and adult beverages, I highly recommend. It's one of those bars/grills that manages to walk the fine line of boozy fun, but still family friendly during the day."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and decided to try this place. I ordered the fish tacos which came with cod. The tacos were super bland and dry. Even a few slices of avocado  ( which they charged me $1.49 for )  still didn't help.   Still looking for a good place in Mesa to eat."}
{"text":"Just got assaulted by a regular here. Friend of the security and they key hang around inside till I left. Regulars name was Chris. Security here will take care of their own.  This time I got threatened by another regular named Rob."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I must say, GREAT SERVICE ALL AROUND!!!!   Chill atmosphere!   Love LOVE LOVE their fried zucchini!!!   Pizza was delicious, crust was perfectly crisp!!   Will definitely be back whenever I am in the area!"}
{"text":"We live near the Fat Willy's in Sunland Village East, we don't go very often only if friends happen ask us to go with them.  The hamburgers are not bad, they do  have a good selection of beer. I don't really care for the food that much and some of it's overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Best smoked wings EVER! Raspberry Chipotle is the way to go! The burgers on Pretzel buns are pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!!! Absolutely incredible food and excellent service. Started off with the fried zucchini and an order of the jalapeño cornbread bites with a raspberry chipotle sauce and they were great! Next had a half pound of the smoked wings that were some of the best wings I've ever had. My wife had the \"ten dollar grilled cheese\" which was full of cheese and had bacon and tomato and loved it! I had the peanut butter and bacon burger with a side of fries and was blown away at how great all those flavors were combined. I had passed by this place numerous times in search of great food and today I realized I made a huge mistake. This place is awesome and needs to be visited by anyone looking for a great place for food and great service as well."}
{"text":"Found this gem just by chance, we ordered the stuffed Anaheim peppers and were very tasty, fish tacos (cod) where very good and very filling, and the hub club sandwich was great.  Brews where very cold and on sundays is happy hour all day so that was perfect."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try The Hub after readong all the reviews here, but I'm currently sitting at BJ'S because after 20 minutes of not being acknowledged by a server we chose to get up and leave. I hope that isn't there standard."}
{"text":"Tonight I had carne asada tacos.  They came with chips and salsa and were quite tasty.  My friend had a chicken sandwich and she liked it as well.  This place has a great beer selection.  I try something different each time I'm there."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice and friendly. However the food was not good. I ordered hot traditional wings and a bacon cheeseburger and was disappointed with both. Also their fries are really really salty."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've had great experiences the 2 times we have gone there. Very kid friendly (they give them a key to the treasure chest)! Great selection of beer on tap and the chorizo clam bake is to DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Well... Really wanted to grab some drinks here before watching a movie across the street. Came in, grabbed a high top at the bar and got ignored by the only server out there, for about 15 min. Section had about 5 ups, and the server spent all of her time with one of them talking about her hair. Looks like Bobby Q's will get my business instead. 3 strikes for the Hub now. Bad service Everytime."}
{"text":"It was Friday Happy hour when we rolled in and it was full at 5pm. We had to wait about 15 minutes but then we were politely seated. After looking at some previous Yelp photos we decided to try the smokes wings. They were Bomb. Tasted delish and we loved the fact that the meat falls off the bone with little work. Makes for clean eating.   My son had the Philly which he devoured. I had the Iowa Pork Tenderloin sandwich. It was tender, massive and a 5 star sandwich.   Great service, good draft options, lots of tvs...just get there early."}
{"text":"Great food.  Fish and chips were so yum! Have been to other location.  Super happy one closer to me."}
{"text":"The perfect Sunday restaurant and bar! They have massive amounts of TVs available for you to watch all the games and the managers will come by and put on whatever you'd like. The beer list is long and versatile to fit almost everyone's tastes! I've tried a decent amount of food on the menu and it's all really good and hearty (especially the H.T.C(spelling?)). I normally get the mashed potato balls each time I visit! The outside area has heaters for the colder mornings and the service is great. Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"The place is big and fun... lots of TV's showing every type of sport. The service was good and the beer selection was nice. My wife ordered a turkey sandwich and it was HUGE! As much sliced turkey as you find in a NY deli! My breaded and fried pork chop sandwich was very good and also very big. When we ordered, we were each asked \"what side do you want... fries, onion rings, salad...\"? My wife's fries were really good as were my onion rings - really good! So why just three stars? Here's the deal, and you need to watch out for this... I asked for a few pickle slices for my sandwich, and when the bill arrived we found out they charged $.25 for maybe 6 pickle slices AND around $2.00 each for the fries and onion rings! It's a nice place, good service, great food, but you'll get nickel and dimed."}
{"text":"After a long Friday, my buddies and I stopped by here for some dinner and drinks. It's quite a busy and loud sports bar with live karaoke, a dance floor, and a live DJ with a versatile music selection. With the right company you will definitely have an enjoyable night here chatting, singing, and dancing.   Our servers lost our orders, but made up for it with a free appetizer of cheesy mashed potato balls served with chipotle cheese sauce, which was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious and savory. I ended up ordering their Peanut Butter Burger, which came with bacon. At first bite, I couldn't taste the peanut butter, but soon afterwards, I felt the heaviness of the peanut butter, which definitely hit the spot and meshed well with the burger overall. One of the more interesting and unique burgers I've had, both savory and sweet at the same time.  For drinks, I ordered their Adult Root Beer Float, which consisted of Fireball mixed with Root Beer and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Couldn't go wrong with that choice at all, I was satisfied and full after that and my meal. My friend had their Arizona Mule, which tasted very similar to a Moscow Mule. It's a fun interactive place to be at, and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch a game and get some good food with great service. Patio service is ideal for our many Arizona days of beautiful weather. Their large food menu offers something for everyone. Their soft pretzels are to die for! There's a peanut butter bacon burger that is absolutely scrumptious as well...don't knock it 'til you try it. Their cajun fries are also particularly flavorful and seasoned to perfection. If you're a bloody mary fan like I am, go ahead and skip it as they can be a bit weak both in booze and in flavor. Service is usually friendly but not always timely."}
{"text":"The food was adequate the bartender was rude there was more than ample seating and I was told to move from the bar to seat a couple when I was trying to watch a specific football game that I asked to be put on I asked the game to be put on a tv that was at the end to stay out of everybody's way and yet I was the one asked to move when there was ample seating for the couple. I asked the bartender why are you making five people move when these two customers could sit somewhere else and her response was because I'm the bartender if you don't like it leave so I left"}
{"text":"The environment  was good our server Darcie was awesome! She was very courteous and provided a genuine conversation that made me feel comfortable best place ever will go back because of her"}
{"text":"Food is not that great and slow service. The Chicken Tenders would taste much better if they were a bit more crispy on the outside, very tender but tasted slimy. Do not recommend. Chips and Salsa are overpriced. The chips are very good but the salsa is lacking flavor."}
{"text":"This was Dubs bar and grill. We frequented Dubs often for meal specials. It is now HUB's. We went last night for the first time since new management took over.. DO NOT GO HERE, unless you want the worst service we have ever had in ANY establishment.... EVER!  We had 3 different waitresses. All of which abandoned us after one encounter... and NO it wasn't us. I'm 65 and my aunt is 79. We finally had to flag someone down and ask for out check. Then all they did was say \"sorry\".  SORRY seems to the the new FU these days for not doing your job. We will never go back. I will also pass this info along to my friends and neighbors who were Dub's fans."}
{"text":"I come here a lot, mostly for the Hub Mac and Cheese which is bomb af but they also have great drinks. Especially love their Moscow mule, buttery nipple shot, and Stawberry Field mule. They also have a pizza with pot roast and mashed potatoes and gravy which is aces."}
{"text":"The Hub will always be our go to restaurant, no matter what you're craving The Hub will meet your needs. A variety of craft beers on tap, attentive staff and unique food is what keeps up coming back again and again. The perpetual couple argument of \"I don't know, where do you want to go?\" Is nonexistent since finding The Hub."}
{"text":"Come here with your friends it is a real exciting place. Fast seating and nice background music. The menu will take you a while to read as there are lots of selections. Overall nice experience. Not sure if this is a chain but it should be."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Best az smoked wings I've had here. I like to get the sauce on the side because the flavor is soo good. The devil burger is amazing as well and they always have good daily specials. Good family place on the left side of the restaurant as well. One of my favorite food places in az for real high quality bar food."}
{"text":"This may be our new joint! Third time here, food and service were excellent and there's a little game room to entice your kids to be good and eat their food. The Cobb salad is amazing (and I eat a lot of salads!) Wings are great and kids meals are good - big selection and drink included."}
{"text":"We love The Hub!  We come once a week lately. Rachel is our favorite and we specifically ask for her and even wait to be seated in her area. She knows her stuff and makes us feel welcome and remembered. She really is a great asset to your team and is the reason we keep coming back!  The Hub punch is fantastic and a great price for a mixed drink. I usually try to try something different every other time. The food has not let me down! Im a very picky eater and everything including the appetizers has been great!  The atmosphere is great however I wish they would open the left side when there are longer waits.  Another thing I totally love is the treasure chest for kids! My nephew is 2 and he remembers it every time. This feature is one of a kind and really shows The Hub cares about its customers."}
{"text":"Loved it. Decided to try a new place near the mother in law, uncertain about a bar and grill with the kids but willing to give them a fair shot. Diners outside near the door were smoking so that was a turn off at first and the hostess wasn't as warm as could be but we still felt confident about it. Ashleyrose was our server and she delivered great info about the menu and provided excellent service. We received complimentary bread appetizer and my wife was impressed with the gluten free menu and she was not disappointed by the green Chile steak philly, daughter had the peanut butter cheeseburger and I loved the Cubano. Overall great experience and loved the food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sporting events on TV and The Hub has a clean modern rustic feel to it.  Burgers were delicious with a lot of flavor and cooked to the perfect temperature.  The Bloody Mary's are terrific and only $3 on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Having eaten here for the first time last week, we loved everything.  Food and service.  Steve, (manager?) came to our table with a fresh plate of bread (delicious). Greeted us on hearing it was our first time.  Told Steve we would be back.  Yesterday 4/4/17,  we returned with our friends @ 4pm..  This was their first time.  Needless to say, it will be the last.  We sat at our table for 10 mins.  Not one server came by. My friend went to the bar and asked for our server.  Still no one came.  I got up and got our silverware and menus. Trying to speed this up.  Still no server.  It had been now 15 mins.  By this time we decided to go have dinner at Uncle Bears.  As I was walking by the bar, the girl says to me,  \"I told you sever twice to go to your table\".  I told her we were leaving for Uncle Bears and to make sure to tell Steve.  The restaurant was busy,  many open tables.  There seemed to be plenty of staff.  At one time 4 people behind the bar.  Staff seemed to be everywhere but at our table.   Very disappointed on our second visit.  Thinking we won't go back."}
{"text":"My co-worker recommended this place so I decided to check it out on a Monday afternoon. I was told the smoked wings were good so I decided to give it a go. I got those with the raspberry chipotle sauce. OMG. Some of the best wings I've had! My friend got the potato nacho things (forgot what it was called) I tried some and it was good but the potatoes were a bit dry for my taste. The drinks were really good. I had the royal (something) and he got the \"big money\"  they were reallly good! I will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  Gets busy fast on weekends, so plan to go early.  Kids get a key to turnnin for a prize at end of meal.  Desserts are awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Polished off an AZ smoked wings order mild sauce and loaded potatoes. Delish! Coming back soon! Fills 2 people."}
{"text":"It was our first time tonight and we can see why everyone loves it here. We got lucky finding two seats at the bar just as a couple stood up, otherwise our wait might have been much longer. The smoked wings fell off the bone. We don't know how we are ever going to be able to go back to regular wings ever again. My nachos were enormous. I only finished half. The Gluten free menu is extensive! My husband has an allergy to wheat so orders GF at restaurants and was pumped when he saw the million options of full sized meals - it was the same size as the regular menu. The three women bartenders mdwere all extremely friendly, attentive and did I say friendly? Even though they were slammed, they were happy and fast. What a rare combo! The only slight negative would be that the restroom was messy with toilet paper and towels on the floor and I was out of toilet paper in my stall (had to ask to \"spare a square\"). My husband said their restrooms were very clean. All in all a great first experience. Great atmosphere and it was packed with people. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went for a good night out with my fiancé where we went in our first date. I have honestly never been more disappointed with the service. We wanted to sit at the bar, but they were packed so had to sit at a booth. I ordered a soda and drank half before I realized the cup had someone's lipstick on it.  it took everything for me not to puke  all over. Then as we're waiting for the waiter who took 20 minutes to bring my fiancé his first beer , I looked up to see there was food all over the barrier between our booth and the one next to us. I finally get the waiter Coleman's attention and he was nice about it, but definitely didn't see concerned. The manager came over ( or I think he was) apologized, got us moved to a seat at the bar. That's all great, but he didn't once offer to comp anything or offer a free drink. I felt like they tried but didn't fully care. I used to really like this place, but needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Service is super slow. There are children in the bar. We have been waiting 10 min to get a drink. It is busy but really not that busy. Menu is huge. Complimentary (dry and smothered in honey) corn bread for first timers. 5 wings for $8"}
{"text":"So far..not impressed! Our first encounter with THIS location AND (Just like the one closer to our house) the waitress doesn't seem to be happy she has a job nor that we're in her section. The host asked us \"table or booth\" and instead of cleaning a small vacant booth for us, he sits the 2 of us in this huge booth. My buddy's soda glass has been empty for approx 10 min, our waitress is nowhere in site...We ended up walking out Left $2 for the soda. I'm sorry, but if yr going to charge $13 for a cheeseburger, at least hv a FRIENDLY staff to welcome u into the establishment and serve u! WONT be back to either location!"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing! Be prepared to eat because serving sizes are huge! Excellent beer choices. You can't go wrong with any of the apps,  Go here!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place!  - Awesome.  Im from Cali, so i was just visiting here and boy, what a great place. We need a place like this in Cali. The people make the experience better.  Fact. The food was good.  I mean, Edamame is just edamame right?  Besides I was there for the booze.  Ryan was knowledgeable, eager to help us course correct on to some good eats and booze.  Nice choices in craft beer. The beer flights were good. We showed up at Happy Hour so of course the price was right too!  Tv's a plenty too here.   The owner James walks the tables and makes sure you're happy.   Nice touch James .. whispers... so was the cornbread... haha  I was taken aback by the smoking, im not a smoker and in Cali you cant vape or smoke indoors aaaaaaanywhere.  But ill let that go.  Its not your fault i dont smoke right? We were given a choice on where to sit and my partner in crime wanted to vape. Smoking it was.    All jokes aside,  great place to chill, drink, talk, eat and smoke. Ill be back before I head home."}
{"text":"Amazing from Start to finish! I called earlier this week to reserve a table for 25 people, we were having a company Christmas party  Well after arriving for our 9pm reservation we realized that the manager who took the reservation didn't pass on the note.     But your amazing staff and management very quickly came together and got our table together. The manager I believe his name is Chris was very apologetic and unexpectedly threw in a couple apps to take care of us. Even keeping the kitchen open a little longer for us.       Now onto your God send for a server DEE:  She was on her way out the door and stayed to take care of us and to insure we had the greatest service possible! Servers like her are very very hard to find (hold on to her)! She kept our drinks full, was very helpful,very nice and excellent with our staff, oh and her being bilingual was the icing on the cake! She all around rocked! THE HUB IS OUR NEW GO TO SPOT!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"For some reason I can't seem to stay away from this place even though I get the worst service every time I go the food is great if you get a chance to actually eat it you might wait all night for it. I think after today's experience that'll be the last time that I eat at this hub location at least.  The manager doesn't care either it's obvious. My only day without my kids in 6 months ruined by a crappy waitress!  Hub something needs to go back to the way it was."}
{"text":"I just walked out of the restaurant after being seated with my wife then waiting for about 10 minutes and never being greeted. We even asked the hostess to grab our server and still to no avail. We did however see another party be seated after us and be immediately greeted and served. This was after we notified the hostess we hadn't been served.   Before I left I asked to speak to the manager  I then waited up at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes before I walked out all together.   I'm super disappointed. I've been coming here for months and the food is great coupled with usually pretty good service. This however was pathetic. It will be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service, fantastic food! Had a large party and they handled us very well. Tried a wide variety of food and it was ALL good. The smoked wings were outstanding. Fall off the bone good. El Hefe was the best! Keep it up Hub!"}
{"text":"It is a great place for food and to watch a game.  Everything that I have tried is awesome!"}
{"text":"I always pass by this place on my way home and wanted to try it and on a random Wednesday, my hubby and I decided to check it out. We were greeted by enthusiastic workers and seated right away. The place was FILLED and they had sports playing in all angles on their flat screens. It was the perfect atmosphere after a long day at work, to enjoy some good beer and food.   It was Wing Wednesday, so the wings were half off. We tried their Smoked wings, which were excellent. You can choose from Chipotle glazed, chipotle smoked, and honey bbq. We also got the Philly Steak sandwich, which wasn't anything special. If the bread was a bit toasted with good cheese, it would have been much better.   I am definitely going back to try their other interesting dishes like the \"Peanut Butter Burger\" and various burgers. Their beer selection is also good and the servers will more than gladly give you a suggestion of their favorite! Great ambience for family dinners or a casual night with some friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I have had 10-12 dishes from their menu and they have all been to die for!!! A must try and I promise it will be a favorite of yours!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and nothing great. Service was terrible. Seemed to be a better bar than restaurant since it was getting busy around 930"}
{"text":"I like the nice cool vibe here in the outdoor bar area on a Saturday night.  Ordered the Devil Burger and it was pretty good for bar food.  We enjoyed our time here.  Service is good and friendly.  P.S. I forgot my phone, ie. no pictures.  Update: The burger gave me digestive problems the next day so lowering from 4-stars to 3-stars."}
{"text":"My guy and I decided to eat here because we were looking for a place to eat that would allow dogs. We are from out of town, saw on Yelp they had outdoor seating, and thought we'd check it out. We were very pleased with everything from the service to the food to the ambience. Our server, Rebecca, was so kind and courteous. So was their manager Steve who welcomed us to their restaurant. And the food was also very yummy, especially their asparagus! I'm really glad we stopped in for lunch, and if we are  in town again, would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Best wings hands down!!!! I did the dry rub that was smoked. They did not have a smokey flavor. They fall of the bone with ease. The bar is a good size with indoor seating and outdoor including an outdoor bar as well."}
{"text":"There food is awesome. Huge selection of food. My favorite is the wings. I mean all the wings. So happy for my date night."}
{"text":"awesome food! awesome drinks! bartender's awesome!!!! i recommend this place! i just found my new hangout!"}
{"text":"If you want amazing wings, this is the place to go! If you want extremely big portions, this is the place to go. By the looks of it, you wouldn't think it is family friendly, but it is with a kids menu and a treasure chest of toys for the kiddos to pick something out of.  If you are going for wings go for the smoked wings! Seriously! They Literally falling off the bone good!   For a con, I would say the last few times we have been in to eat, it had been super cold! It was so cold today that it was almost unbearable. I know it's hot outside, but it was just too much!   Another con would be the timing of service. Everyone is so nice, but it always seems like we are waiting for something to the point we are asking a second time. I can understand when it's busy, but not when it's not, like today.   Who likes to end on a negative!!! Not me! Get the WINGS!!! They will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"The nachos leave something to be desired, I heard good thing about the Hub but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"From Florida, found this great place on Yelp. Great food, great service, great prices...also loved the energy of diners inside. Appreciated server who guided us in choices. The Cheese Beer soup was really terrific"}
{"text":"Great service, food, beer.  Super busy yet still got great service.  Wings are great.  Plenty of tv's, big bar.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great local feel, family atmosphere, and service.  Kids are treated to the treasure box (when they're good of course).  Decent beer varieties and food quality."}
{"text":"Very different than the previous places that were here before. Service was quick and friendly (despite being the first week of opening), food tasted great and the wide selection of beers were perfect! The patio was huge and the bar outside came in clutch. I look forward to spending a lot of football Sundays here!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for an early lunch with our 2 year old. Great service, great food and they give your kid a prize if they behave and eat all their food. So cool!!! Really friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and the Hub didn't disappoint. My first visit I had wings, simply said, they were on point! Tonight, I opted for a seat on the patio since it was a nice Arizona night and was in the mood for a burger, not just any burger, \"The Holy Bacon Batman burger.\" It is, perhaps, the best piece of cow slapped between a pretzel bun I have ever had. Loaded with bacon, swiss cheese and caramelized onions. I highly recommend this place, the service and ambiance is tragically hip."}
{"text":"1st time here and had a great experience. Initially sat at bar while waiting for a table. There was a long wait while there where several open tables. Maybe they were short staffed. Only 1 bartender for a bar full of people at 3pm on a Saturday.  Once we got our table for 6 our waitress was good. We only ordered cocktails but she was attentive.  Definitely be back. I can see what the rave is with an interesting and big variety of food and cocktails. With our favorite 3 Olives grape vodka."}
{"text":"Empty tables with long waits. Not sure if their service safe needs a bump in manpower or what. Ended up leaving for a no wait brewery in Tempe. We've been here before and that's what we came back for. But it wasn't the same. Lots of empty tables and a 45 minute wait. Maybe another night, maybe."}
{"text":"Same great food, service and atmosphere as the other location on Sossaman, which is fantastic.  One of the biggest gluten-free menus I have found. They have a good happy hour too.  Their smoked wings are the best wings I have ever had. For an appetizer that is out of this world, try the stuffed Chilis. They even have a gluten free flourless chocolate cake. Or finish your meal off with an adult rootbeer float or adult milkshake!"}
{"text":"One of our family favorites. TVs on every well for the husband. Great gluten-free menu for me (probably the largest GF menu I've seen). Portions are huge and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and let's just say we will be back. The pork wings were nuggets of tasty porkness, I had a mushroom burger and could not finish it but not because it wasn't good. My wife had the Hub Club and she was completely satisfied, as was our daughter, who had the Peanut Butter burger. Weird combo but pretty tasty. Our server, Devin, was awesome and very attentive. No complaints at all. This is an extremely family friendly environment at lunchtime on Sunday."}
{"text":"We just found our new locals spot. The food was great. Especially the smoked chicken wings. Something like smoked 4 hours. Best I've ever had. We went during happy hour, and the prices were crazy low. Also lots of tvs to watch sports and a big Patio. We will be back."}
{"text":"YES!!! We found a GREAT sports bar. My wife and I have tried many of the sports bars in this area and I must say that this place wins, hands down. Service is good, the food selection is HUGE and everything looks and tastes amazing. Be sure to arrive early or be prepared to wait in line. Also this place is very clean. I found a worker cleaning the restroom several times. Try it, you will fall in LOVE TOO!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I was at the Stapley location. It was awesome! The food was great and the service was wonderful. It had a nice relaxed feel to it. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Their food is extremely good, and their service is awesome as well! Upon our first trip here, the manager James came out and brought us complimentary green chili cornbread that was to die for! He welcomed us and said to let him know if we needed anything. I ordered the pesto pizza, and others at my table ordered the veggie pizza, the margherita pizza with pesto added to it, and a chorizo mussels plate. Everything was so incredibly tasty.  I would highly recommend this place, and our server Melissa was so nice and very helpful when choosing our meals. Great job guys, keep the work up!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Staff was super friendly and chill and food was on point. Next time I'm back in the area I'll be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and personable staff; knowledgeable and attentive bartenders. Service sometimes suffers when extremely busy (example: UFC fight nights).   Food is good. I highly recommend the Wings and the Hub Chips. I don't recommend the Stroganoff. Portion sizes are huge. Decent selection of beer, I like the frozen fruit Margaritas with sugar on the rim in the summertime!   Love the atmosphere, cleanliness and people. There are games: a billiard table, corn hole, etc...but the dart board buttons don't really work to select multiple players and the shuffleboard table is incredibly unbalanced/slanted.   The HUB hosts Trivia Tuesday's which are super fun!"}
{"text":"This place is super good. Katee was our awesome waitress. She was very attentive. The food was amazing. Definitely recommend the wings. It's pricey, but well worth the service and food that you get. They have a lot of tvs which is great for football. I love the music too. A great variety of music playing while watching football."}
{"text":"Everything about The Hub Grill and Bar was fantastic!  The service was great and the food was amazing!!  I highly recommend this place.  It is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here with my wife and kids for our first meal in Mesa but I was rewarded when we decided to stop in! The menu was great as it has tons of different options for different tastes, I had the Green Chili Steak Phili and it was phenomenal!!! I am a stickler for ones with Wiz but this made my taste buds come alive! My wife had the quesadilla which was also great as well my children enjoyed their classic chicken tenders( surprised me for being better than good) all in all this is a great place  for the entire family and a highly recommended place when your going to eat with people that have a variety of tastes."}
{"text":"Great menu, great patio, great people, even better than the original! These guys have figured out how to take care of the customer and to provide a great experience. Looking for a really good meal or just a place to hang, this is it."}
{"text":"Reserved the back room for 17 people for a company event last night. Most of the group had never been before but all were very impressed. All of the food came out within minutes of each other, all hot and exactly as ordered (a lot of places can't seem to accomplish this feat).  All of the food was outstanding and it is not just your typical bar food. If you have not tried their smoked chicken wings it is worth the trip just for those. Finally, our server Jessica B. was great. She handled a lot of special requests, and a few interesting characters better than I have seen a lot of servers handle a party of 4. If you haven't been you definitely need to go, I guarantee they are now on our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to HUB's, we decided to check this place out for MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL!! GO COWBOYS!  We were greeted as soon as we walked in, asked for a booth close to the big screen and the waitress was very accommodating, they have a good amount of food choice from salads to burgers,wings,sandwiches.. And a lot of beers on tap! Our service was good, we both had the burger of the day which was  a huge burger patty cooked to order,buffalo sauce,bleu cheese,lettuce,tomato,onion on a realllyyyy good pretzel bun! At first I didn't think I'd like it but it make my mouth very happy! The place was clean, a nice group of people there and good service ... What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed when sitting at the bar - the bartender \"Austin\" greeted me with a hand shake and took my drink order. While observing and over hearing the ladies next to me decide what they would like to drink, he offered a few different sample beers based on a description they gave. He had knowledge of the beers and they chose a drink. I'm addition he shook their hands and offered a menu with several recommendations. It's not easy to find good service and this gentleman delivered! #highfive! #niceworkaustin!"}
{"text":"BEST GLUTEN FREE MENU!  Also have been there for karaoke and that was fun :)  He seems to turn the original singer's voice up higher than other karaoke dj's.  Which could actually be a good thing.  LOL"}
{"text":"I love to sit in the patio and grab food with my family while people one table over smoke cigarets one after another. Never coming back. I thought this smoking thing was over, or only in Vegas. But guess in my own neighborhood is okay. I am not sure how this is allowed in AZ! Food was okay, service was okay but the stench of smoke killed it for us."}
{"text":"I was so excited for the new Hub to open as I had been craving the Peanut Butter Burger with raspberry sauce.   Went here for lunch today and was not disappointed at all. I had asked for a booth only for one person so I could have a working lunch and the hostess didn't hesitate a second to my request.   Homer was my server and was prompt and very sweet. When I ordered the burger he brought back my water accompanied with the raspberry sauce immediately. I did not even have to ask him for the sauce. Great training by the team here!   Looking forward to returning with a group of friends and enjoy the amazing outdoor patio. Thanks Hub!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. I would recommend this place to everyone. The Cajun Garlic fries are amazing!!! Thank you to my server Brandy, for suggesting them!!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to visit with the family!  We come in here weekly with our kids and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  Their management team is stellar!  Service is great - food is wonderful and we love the atmosphere.  One of your favorite places to eat in AZ - a MUST try!!"}
{"text":"They said they were having a bad day and appoligzed but I will never go back. Took over an hour to get our food and then it was just ok."}
{"text":"If I let my first impression of this restaurant solely dictate my review I would give it zero stars. Thankfully the server and the quality of the food allowed me to give it 3 stars, and quite frankly that's still being generous. Whoever is managing this place needs to immediately remove Miss Grumpy pants, otherwise known as Sarah,  from the hostess position. She was extremely abrupt, snarky, rude, condescending, and just plain nasty. If it were up to me we would have left and never come back but we were part of a larger group that was hungry. In short, if you like to be greeted in a friendly manner and actually like to be smiled at when dropping money at a restaurant don't go to this place. On a much brighter note, our server Allison was outstanding and if I were just reviewing her she'd get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we visit this location probably a couple time's a month and we ALWAYS order the smoked wings, the best wings I've ever had!!!!!!!!  The service has always been wonderful, super friendly staff.  The t.v.'s are everywhere and great quality also.  The patio is huge, comfy and a big bar area out there.  Love all the options on the menu and never have been disappointed, amazing food."}
{"text":"Went to this location on Sunday very early. We were the first group seated in the bar and we had a lot of people (12). A guy came right over to ask us which game we wanted to watch. I told him we wanted to watch the Bruins hockey game. He told me absolutely not, he wouldn't turn on anything but football. Fine, don't ask then. I've never had the Sossoman location refuse to turn on a hockey game, and we're very loyal customers. I get that Sunday is all about football but there were plenty of TVs  (many side by side on the same game). Or, if my request was so absurd, why not move our party to a corner where we could have a TV of our own? Lacking customer service in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love the food and the bartenders at the HUB. The original is a frequent goto for me. The problem is there inability to keep current sports on the TV's. Its a College Football Saturday at 11:15 am and most TV's are on infomercials and the others are on MLB TV with rerun highlights. News flash, you are a sports bar and sports are on get it on your TV's. Having managers that cannot operate your complex system seems to cause mass confusion and shitty TV management. There is a need to be better at the new store and it starts with Managers managing the atmosphere and ensuring guests have a great sports experience. You are falling short of Sossaman at this point. People will stop coming for their favorite game if you cannot get on top of this."}
{"text":"Sport bar with TVs galore and shockingly good food with gluten free options. Service was also above par for a sport bar. Good choice when in area."}
{"text":"My hubby loves there jalapeño burger. To me it's just bar food. They have some decent items.  It's definitely a good place for east Mesa because we don't have a lot to choose from.  I like that they give the kids a toy bin to choose a toy from! The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and on top of it!"}
{"text":"Best bar food in the east valley, only suggestion is to change the Hub burrito back to the old recipe, it had so much more flavor. With a location so close to the mall, they are a step above the competition. They have a great staff and we have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. Super kid friendly and did I mention how good the food is, proud to be a new patron of the place!!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible customer service. Charged $3.09 for soda water when beer is $2.75. I mentioned it to the bartender and she snapped back i should of gotten a beer then. Never wasting my $ on this place again."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! I have been there numerous times and tried something different each time. The dining area closes later at night so we were required to eat in the bar area one night.  It was extremely loud so not a good place to go if you want to talk. During the earlier hours it is kid friendly.  They even give the kids a key to a treasure box to get a gift after the meal if their parents allow."}
{"text":"Came here last night for food and drinks.  I ordered the Swedish Meatballs...I never return food but these were the driest meatballs I've ever had.  Our waitress was super nice and let me return it for something else.  Ended up getting the pot roast sandwich - delicious!  Great atmosphere and draft beer selection.  I haven't tried too many things on the menu but the meatballs are the only thing I've had from there so far that was not good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Always busy which says something about the food. The Big Hub burger is out of this world and will feed two. All of the food we have tried has been sensational. Servers are also great. I will frequent this place often."}
{"text":"Wow. I am a frequent Hub customer (both Sossoman and Stapley locations), but I felt I had to post something tonight to give homage to the meal that I just got through eating. I was watching the golf and trying to figure out what I was going to eat. I always like to ask for recommendations from the staff. I am also a big believer in the daily specials menu. So on today's menu there was Oyster Po'Boy sliders, Chicken Parm, and Pork Osso Bucco (POB). I asked for a recommendation and after a really good rec, I went with the Pork.   All I can say is; wow. This is probably the best POB that I have eaten in I can't remember when. I was so impressed with the meal: taste, cost, portion, and even presentation (served in a to go container) that I felt I needed to give the Hub another bump up.   I would break it down with service, food, drinks, price, and environment; but it would all be a 5 for today's visit."}
{"text":"Wow what a cool spot to hang at. They have an awesome patio that offers a smoking and non-smoking area. The patio is huge as well. I didn't feel all closed in. I had the wings which was recommend by my server. Amazing! They were fall off the bone wings. Something I had never experienced before. The fried pickles were okay.  They were a little bit too bready for me. I would probably not get those again. This a place I would like to check out again. Such a fun place that is fun. Staff was very knowledgeable and knew the menu well."}
{"text":"Smoked wings are legit. Seems like a good spot.. Great service.  Great value.  Ate alot of wings, had a salad and half sandwich, and a wicked chicken. 1 beer, 2 people $30!  We will be going back and yes, the smoked wings are as good as you hear!"}
{"text":"I like this place but I will say the bartender was not very attentive to me.  She gave me water pretty quickly but then she never came back...I had to flag down the bar hand to get any attention.  I hate to give a bad reviews but I was frustrated."}
{"text":"One of our most favorite date night and family night spots! This place fits the bill for extraordinary food combinations and a great atmosphere!  Friendly service and smiling faces!"}
{"text":"This visit was actually very good. The manager on the floor actually remembered us from a previous visit which was not a good one. He went out of his way to put on our game, and to acknowledge us.  Great visit great food!  Great Gluten free menu, which makes us extremely happy."}
{"text":"I have been to the Hub a few times. I am always treated like a VIP (don't know why)  Service has always been great, food is good and the prices are fair.  I recently went to a Realtor after hours there and they had pretzel bites and pizza. The bites were great, just the right amount of butter and salt.  I also love the milk stout they have on tap.  I don't go to the far east valley but when I do I will make it a point to stop here again.  Oh, I guess they have a corn hole tournament every Wednesday night. It looked like fun."}
{"text":"I have to say I specifically got a Yelp account JUST to write a review on this place. First of all the only bummer about this place is that it's LOUD and BUSY but it's a sports bar so we expected no less.   However the food in this place is incredible. My husband and I consider ourselves food snobs - or foodies if you will. Everything we have ordered at this place has been incredible. The Popper Burger literally made me tear up! I couldn't believe the flavors on that burger!!  BEST BURGER EVER!   Anytime we decide to go to the Hub we think \"are we willing to wait?\" Because it's usually so busy - BUT the three times we have gone I think we have waited once for only 10-15 minutes. The other times we walked right in and got a seat. I'll admit the servers could be better. They haven't ever been terrible - and trust me, we've had terrible. But they keep us satisfied!   Matt on the other hand, the manager, is INCREDIBLE. Each and every time we have been there to eat he has found us and made his presence known. Asked us how the food is and if he can do anything for us. He is a genuine guy who KNOWS customer service and isn't fake about it! I know customer service after working in that field for years. He has been what has brought us back here (and to this location). Keep it up Matt!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of beer and an awesome atmosphere. I really enjoy coming to this location. The patio is large enough for gatherings with friends and the servers are always so great!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! I'd eat here everyday if I could! The wings are the best I've ever had (Cajun and Hot is the way to go). Tons of beer options...the peach ale was recommended to me last time and now I get it every time. Our server was on it! He was quick even on a busy Friday night, checking on us frequently and getting our food and drinks out fast. We like this location better than the one on Sossaman, just a different crowd but the food is equally delicious. Would be a great place to watch a game, there's a huge patio area too. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to bring me here for months so we finally came on Saturday night. We sat outside to enjoy the nice weather, only bummer was the smoking all around us. It was pretty busy but we got our food right away. The Cajun wings and Green Chile pork mac n cheese were soooo good!! Loved that they had different items from most restaurants. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place  Good welcomes for first time visit The wings are amazing Recommend this place for food and hang out"}
{"text":"This place is great. We had a party of 6 and our server Rebecca was awesome. The managers were really friendly. I had the fish and chips and they were so good. There appetizers are really good."}
{"text":"The new location is great! The patio is huge and they have heaters which is nice right now that it's so cold. We went in late night and still had great service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the good - the food was pretty decent. The Thursday night happy hour deal on the pizzas is a good deal. Unfortunately, that's all that was good.  The service was pretty abysmal. Our waitress seemed stressed out and disinterested in serving us. We were lucky to see her twice an hour. It was routinely taking over 15 minutes from ordering a beer to receiving it, which is ridiculous. We never actually received the drinks from the waitress, they were delivered by what I assume to be barbacks or bussers(more on this later). Related to this, my buddy arrived 15 minutes before the end of happy hour. We wait, and we wait, and we wait and there's no waitress. She conveniently shows up a minute after happy hour ends and my buddy asks for a flight under the happy hour deal. She looks at her watch and then says, \"Sorry, you're one minute late, I can't do that\".  Seriously? You neglect us all night long and then you have the balls to pick nits over *one* minute, after you're the one that disappears for long stretches of time?  And this is the icing on the cake....  One of the aforementioned bussers that they have delivering drinks managed to dump an entire pint of Blue Moon(sticky) into the lap of my buddy's wife. I'm not even sure how someone manages to do that, but we didn't get a chance to talk the person because they ran away as fast as they could upon it happening. The manager finally came back out 10 minutes later with some towels and assured us she would comp us the beer that was now residing in the lap of one of us. Gee, thanks, how generous of you. The jersey she was wearing was probably ruined and the experience was certainly ruined at that point, but we got the $4 beer for free. Outstanding.   Amusingly, the waitress who could never be found was not surprisingly completely oblivious to what was happening and when she finally did come back around, she thought it was our own fault and didn't try to assist.  I forgive mistakes pretty easily because we all make them, but in the totality of the night, and the complete lack of any acknowledgement or response for what they had done, this was the last straw.  We finally had enough, paid our bill, and went over to Chili's. We were there for Thursday night football and probably would have stayed another two hours drinking and running up our tab, but instead we ducked out half way through the game and went across the street. Interestingly, we ran into a couple over there that left the Hub for the poor service as well.   I want to see them do well in their new location, but they need to do something about their level of service. Either hire more wait staff or retrain the ones you have. Ensure that you stress proper customer service with them instead of this lackadaisical, \"I don't give a crap\" attitude. I understand it was a busy night for them with playoff baseball and football, but other sports bars around the area don't seem to have any problems with it."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars for these reasons: 1. Service with our first server was awesome!  He checked on us every 5 minutes, making sure we had a drink and if everything was up to par for us. 2. The food is delicious and decently priced.  Our waiter's shift was up, but my party stayed anyway, which meant we had a new server.  Her name was Veronica.  Veronica is the reason i'm rating at 3 stars.  We wanted to order more food and a few drinks.  We waited. And we waited. Aaaaand we waited. 45 minutes later, she checks on us, we order some water since we were limited on time.  So we waited.  And we waited some more. Another 15 minutes, comes by with the drinks for the table NEXT to us, says \"i'll get that water for you.\"  We got up and left.  Thanks, but no thanks Veronica."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here due to being in the area. Walked into a huge dining area with a very impressive bar and a large amount of seating. I ordered the fish and chips and it was phenomenal. Service was great and the owner was making rounds speaking to clients. Food came out quickly and the portions were very generous. It seems to be a popular spot within the area and I can understand why."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this place about 3 months ago and we are now regulars. The Hub is in the top 3 of our favorite restaurants in the Valley. Top notch service, amazingly consistent and delicious food, great atmosphere, and it's only 2mi from our house. I'd recommend a menu item to try, but honestly they are all great. The smoked wings are THE best wings I have ever had. I can eat them by the pound (Wednesday is the wing special btw).   If you haven't been here, you are missing out on great food and a rare dining experience that many \"fancy\" restaurants can't even come close to matching. Ask for Audree, she is our favorite server. Chances are Chris, the manager, will come by and chat as well. Say hello and enjoy!  Oh yeah, kids get to go to the 'Treausre Chest' after the meal to pick out a toy. Usually Hot Wheels, Barbie, princess stuff, etc; Definitely kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last two weeks twice food was very good along with service the other night beer cheddar soup was cold but they made it right the Iowa pork sandwich was huge and delicious also had the the hub burger what a monster almost to much to eat charbroiled and tasty always a crowd nice place to grab a meal a beer."}
{"text":"First time here. Lively, busy, a really fun crowd. Great front desk greeting and prompt seating.  We told the waitress it was our first visit and about 5 minutes later comes a manager named Steve with a complimentary green chili cornbread for us to try. Very welcoming and warm. We had smoked wings-- delicious!  For our entree we had the spicy mac and cheese covered with a crunchy sourdough crumb crust. We spilt it and still took some home.  This may just turn into our new happy hour hangout!"}
{"text":"Not a good place at all.  Over priced. I got takeout and got it home and it was burned.. And took a very long time."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Loved seeing the manager, Matt, stepping up and doing whatever needed to be done.  Very refreshing to see a manager pitch in and help wherever it was needed.  For that reason alone I will return.  My meal was good as well."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. Everyone very friendly. Food came out fast after we ordered it.   The food is good, but not great. The prices is good.   We would defiantly come back"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely amazing. The only reason I gave one star is simply because of the blonde female manager. I come here a bare minimum of twice a week. I have witnessed on multiple occasions how rude she is to the staff and  I have never seen her engage  in any customer experience. It never looks like she enjoys  being here and I have personally felt as though she is rude to me. Delaney and Jesse are amazing servers. Very personable and friendly. The food is also amazing!"}
{"text":"wow such a huge disparity between the reviewers for this place. It's like a hit or miss joint seems like. Well I decided to give it a try as my friend recommended it and we wanted to watch one of the NBA finals games here.   Upon walking in, you got the semi quieter dining room area to your left and the rowdy bar area with plethora of flat screen LCD TVs to your right. Sat down in the bar area and got one of those jukebox things which is actually a speaker for the TVs. They play all kinds of sports here and I'm sure they will accommodate you if you ask nicely. Not sure about big event PPV stuff.   The service was great I thought. The waitress was nice and helpful. I would say the food is above average bar food. Nothing fancy. I really liked the fish and chips b/c they weren't buried in 2 inches of deep fried dough. It was a nice filet with a good amount of fried layer outside.   I gave it 4 stars for my positive experience, but how knows many the service is spotty. I do like it as a first timer though b/c they have got some great Happy hour deals and daily specials. I think it's worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool place to just hang around and watch sports. Drink wise is decently priced and their cocktails are super good! I had the blueberry (something) couldn't remember the name but it was really delicious! Couldn't even taste the alcohol, could be dangerous! Food wise isn't the best here, I had the bacon cheeseburger with the pretzel bun and it was alright (meat was really dry), I couldn't even finish all of it. Onion rings are really good though here. Service wasn't the best, but what do you expect from a sports bar. I would come again strictly for the drinks next time."}
{"text":"Best wings in the valley hands down! I've even tried a few other things such as the Green Chile Philly which is legit as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Highly recommend.  Our waitress was extremely accomodating especially because we have a 1 year old who is impatient and always hungry."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation but was not impressed. We asked to sit together (same side of table) but were given a small table sitting across from one another. Our server didn't attend to us for roughly 12 minutes. Not even a glass of water. Our food was cold and had very little flavor. Haven't been back don't intend to."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! One of the managers named Ryan and our server Lauren were extremely friendly and very helpful. We will definitely be back! 1st timers get free corn bread!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Was busy and windy out. Agreed to sit outside next to heater which ran out of propane after we sat down. Asked manager for propane- said he would get it. Waitress comes out 15 mins later we inquire she says she knows there is no propane. Manager never followed up with us.. basically left us hanging. To be clear there is only one seated table on one side of restaurant inside. SEE PICTURES. We were outside for an hour, inside now waiting and waiting. Outside Waitress would not put our order in if we were moving inside because she would have to \"find\" us. Really? My parents who are with us said they have never had a positive experience here. Keep in mind we are still waiting for a table!!! There is an open high top and open both... still waiting!! Now walking out"}
{"text":"This Hub is the second one opened by the owners. We love the one on Sossaman. This one is larger, with much more seating, and a huge, gorgeous outdoor bar area. There are tvs everywhere, and the staff made sure that we had access to whichever football game we preferred. Our server was knowledgeable and really friendly. Our drinks never ran dry, and he was spot on with whatever we needed. Our kids had the turkey raspberry sandwich, and chicken tenders. They always love their meals. My husband had a southwest crispy chicken salad. He said that it was tasty. It sure was huge! I had the chicken tenders as well, but with steamed veggies as my side. The veggies we're nothing to write home about, but we're plentiful. The tenders were large...like each the size of a breast. I got the raspberry chipotle dipping sauce, which was really tasty. Not too sweet, not too spicy.  I love this place, and have never had a bad experience at either location. We will be back."}
{"text":"The Hub is always a great place to go for a good meal.  The newly renovated restaurant has tons of room for parties large and small. The menu has many types of fare, so your craving is almost always satisfied.  The staff is friendly and courteous, though at times are so busy that attention to any particular table is lacking. To remedy this, they always have a manager or other staff roving, so you will always get what you need. One exception to this, and not the norm, was a few weeks ago. There was apparently a staff meeting, and our server disappeared, with no one taking care of us in the interim. We had no refills, and our food order was not correct. But again, this is not the norm, and we have never had bad service beside then.  Today, I had the Turkey Avocado sandwich with onion rings. The rings were plentiful and the sandwich was huge! I coold barely fit it in my mouth! The Hub appetizer platter was great, with everything cooked perfectly. I loved the crunch and season to the batter of the mozzarella sticks. My companion had the fish and chips, and pretty much always does. It's her favorite!  The burgers are great, cooked to order. The peanut butter burger was a little too weird for me, but was good considering.  The prices are great for the quality and quantity you receive.  I would recommend The Hub to anyone...families and ladies night...pretty much anytime. I also plan to visit The Vue, the new sister restaurant.  We'll see!"}
{"text":"Lived near by for years and heard from many friends this place was great. Talk about an understatement. Had lunch here with my mom today and the food was excellent! The smoked wings were smokey and flavorful and the other items we ordered were all perfectly done. Andrea was delightful and will be requesting her on my next visit to this new found local favorite. Wish I would have listened to my friends sooner......thank you HUB for the great service and food today!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this place when it used to be the previous name, which was a shame because it's so close and has nice outdoor seating with misters and TVs. I returned twice recently in the last few months. The service was wonderful, food was marginal. But it has a good ambience and we enjoyed ourselves. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and food choices.  A great experience every time I visit.  The wings are leaps and bounds better than any other resturant / bar I've visited."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's could use some work but the kitchen sink is a must for your table. The smoked wings are also fantastic with the Cajun and insanity. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The raspberry turkey chipotle is also very good. Nice beer options and pitchers on football Sunday's are $5 or $8! Can't beat that."}
{"text":"The Hub far exceeds expectations.  It was slammed when we arrived around 6PM on a Friday. I expected there to be at least a 45 minute wait, but they got us seated in under 5. Our waiter was great! I forgot his name, but when the manager made his rounds, I let him know that he was sincerely the best server I've ever had in a restaurant.   The Peanut Butter Burger is AH-MAZ-ING. I don't ever want another burger without PB, again! I didn't try the smoked wings, but my man said they were the best wings he'd ever had.  I think I'm going to make it my mission to try everything on the menu, since it all sounded so good!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service and an awesome patio. Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"The food is a hit with some dishes and a miss with others! For instance, the burger and fries you can skip, the burgers are great!, but the fries are saturated in grease, and its like a pool on the plate that saturates the burger! Disgusting! The korean steak bowl is a big miss! No flavor, and the veggies in it are way undercooked! The pizza is good, of course the service is good 90% of time, but very slow 10%,i can say the Hub is not very consistent!"}
{"text":"Our first time. Received complimentary corn bread which was a little dry but tasty. Ordered a fruity drink that was delicious. Waitress offered to put in an order for a second round of drinks before happy hour was over which was actually pretty clever because we probably would not have ordered otherwise. I had a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings that came with ranch; both were quite good. Hubs ordered fish fry which wasn't bad compared to the many others we've tried in the area. His fries and coleslaw were also good. There's alot to choose from on the menu. It all looked/sounded good. Although the place was very busy, the service was fast and friendly. Our request for extra tartar and BBQ sauce was no problem (we hate places that charge extra for this). Two different managers separately visited our table to personally welcome us and make sure we were happy. Overall, it was a good experience. We'll be back.  UPDATE: Second time here not so great. Started out fine and our food was good (ultimate grilled cheese, pulled pork and Mac and cheese), but our waiter disappeared. A waitress then came by stating she would be taking over. Asked her for a soda refill, never got it. After finishing our food we waited a very, very long time and finally had to ask someone else for \"to go\" containers and our bill. Once ready to leave, the waitress finally came back and asked us if we needed anything when it was obvious someone else had taken care of us because we were getting up with our leftovers in hand, and the bill was paid. Not sure what happened, but we were clearly forgotten for a good half hour."}
{"text":"First time at the Hub 12/23/16 40+ tvs inside!! Holy NFL Batman !! We stopped in for happy hour for some apps and a drink. We had the chipolte tater skins, quesadilla and the green chili bread. All were ok.....didnt blow me away. The bacon chunks on the skins were good. Beware...the apps are large orders. 2 would have been enough  I'll need a second visit for further review"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my wife for dinner.  Had the smoked wings and my wife had the surf and turf.  The food was excellent!!!  Thanks to Matt for coming out and bringing us some cornbread and welcoming us.  Big plus will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food with a large beer selection. It's definitely a sports bar, which for me is the reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5. That's because they always have sound on for the sports games (even when it's an obscure east coast baseball game during regular season - i.e. Nationals vs Marlins) and they have a rather large smoking area on the patio. I dont smoke and I dont like eating anywhere that I can smell the smoke. Their whole outdoor bar is smoke-friendly as well as about 1/2 of the outdoor tables... however, the wind often brings the smoke-smell into the other half of the outdoor patio.   The HFC Bowl (their take on KFC Bowl) is amazing. Like really really good. I was surprised to find such tasty chicken."}
{"text":"Meet some family here from out of town on a Sunday afternoon. Very busy. But was able to get a table right away. The service was sub par. They kept bringing us the wrong things- whether it be drinks or food. We had kids with us so one of our beers in our flight we ordered spilled. They replaced it but it was not what we had ordered. I think they need to get better waitresses who can handle the pressure of taking multiple orders from different tables better. I really liked that they gave the kids each key passes so that with their parents permission if they behaved themselves they could redeem the key to get a special prize out of the treasure box up front. Overall the price was fair but I just wish the service was better. I think I will try the location on Stapley next time."}
{"text":"In my recent visit to the Mesa/Phoenix area I had the opportunity to come to this establishment a few times. The servers and bar service was excellent and it had seemed that this place is a great bar scene atmosphere and a date night type of place or a place to find a date. It has a great vibe to it and the servers bust their butts!!!!  4 stars for the area for my vote  However the food was just ok. For example the burger was over cooked, I order the pot pie which was interesting to look at but it was a round donut looking bisquick biscuit over a very salty version of a shepherd pie that I had sent back and they kindly removed from my bill. I did enjoy the smoked ribs and the grilled cheese. Food 2 stars although presentation of food was great  the staff was great the actual food overall was not up to my standards in any state I visit. The food will hurt the servers tips I feel and there might be a high turnover of servers which is not a good indication of a restaurant.  If your looking to take a date or find a date this is a great place but not to have tasty meal overall."}
{"text":"The Hub has been great. They have my favorite wine and beer. I gave it a four as I don't make the trip out there as much anymore since they changed the edamame. We would go there a lot just to get orders of that before we ate. It was AMAZING! We will still stop by but the newer version isn't ordered from us. Tried it and it doesn't compare to the old! We have enjoyed the wings and other items from the menu. I love all the TVs and have loved watching Sunday football there. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Overpriced garbage. The \"chef\" is pretentious for no reason. Said he's been in the business for 31 years. Wow bud in 31 years you've learned how to make a hamburger. Good job. 5 year olds can do that. Look on indeed they are always hiring management because they are incompetent. No real talent wants to work there. So avoid because when the management sucks everything else does or will eventually. I'm not willing to bet my stomach on that."}
{"text":"We're fans of the Hub both eating in and take out. We have been recently disappointed with the edamame.  We are used to having the big fat beans and as of late they've been tiny little beans. Did you change brands or sources?  Also there has been way too much soy sauce and seasoning. By the time we get to the final layer, the beans are swimming in a pool of sauce. We typically get this for takeout and every time we've ordered it has been in a different container. Usually it has leaked within the bag and everything is soaked with soy sauce. It's really not a big deal but it's just annoying to have to clean and soak up everything.   We also order the regular traditional wings for take out. However the last few time they were soaked in HOT sauce. My 8 yr was in tears the last time. Please let your customers know when ordering what the heat stat is on the wings.  Ever thought of having an actual lunch menu? Your salads are WAY too pricey for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I went to this place more than 10 times and it's always packed doesn't matter which day or holidays. The service is always fast and friendly. Lots of TVs and they are ready to put your game on! I already recommended this place to my friends and family! Good place check it out!"}
{"text":"To start this place is amazing! Cold drinks are always available but the best part is the food. If you come here I suggest highly you get the smoked wings, I kid you not fall off the bone deliciousness. Other than making them myself I have never had wings this good in the valley.(I have eaten a lot of wings) I would give an award for those if I could.  Aside from the food our server was great didn't have to ask for refills, food came out hot and fast. Great experience, try it, you will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat, they have a good amount of gluten free options which is great for my niece's gluten allergy.  It's a little expensive, but the food is quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the HUB during the NCAA tournament for half price pizzas. The pizzas were delicious. I was concerned because we were seated on the patio at the table farthest from the dining room and kitchen. I was afraid this would effect out service, but Christian was our server and he was excellent. Despite the distance from the kitchen, he made sure he had refilled drinks out to us on time and checked on us despite there being fewer occupied tables by us as the night went on. We have been here multiple times and the food is always good. We were happy to receive suck great service from Christian despite the difficult seating and how busy the restaurant was."}
{"text":"The Hub...I'm really not sure about my visit. Our adult daughter has been here several times and suggested it one evening while we were out.  She loves it.  Me, on the other hand, not so much.  The location is great with a really cool outside bar.  It was a bit late on a Thursday evening when we walked in.  When trying to find a table, we were told that one section was closed but we could take any table in the open area.  Great, we looked around and there weren't too many customers so that would be fine.  Not great, all the tables in the \"open\" area were dirty and stacked with plates from former customers.  The only open and clean table was in a far off corner.  We were then told that anyone underage needed to be out by 10:00, which gave us about 30 min, but it wouldn't be a problem because they would be right over to take our order.  We had our teenage daughter with us but since it wouldn't be a problem, we made the decision to stay.  Unfortunately, they didn't come right over to take our order.  They also didn't kick us out at 10:00, but it's not a great experience wolfing down your food because you think you might be forced to leave.  On to the food...I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese.  I know, a simple dish, but I'm trying to find that perfect sandwich.  This one sounded promising, including two cheeses, tomato, and bacon.  Sounds delish, right? Let's just say that I'm still searching.  My daughter loves the cheesy mashed potato balls and smoked chicken wings so that's what she ordered.  The hubs and I tried both and thought they were just okay, pretty basic.  Our younger daughter loves a good buffalo chicken sandwich.  This one was huge! Check out the pic! And she really enjoyed it.  The hubs ordered the raspberry chipotle turkey sandwich and he thought that was pretty good as well.    So, based on everyone's food and experience, I'll give The Hub a solid three stars...pretty average."}
{"text":"I am from the Midwest and enjoy pork tenderloins which are hard to find in Arizona. The sandwich I had was lightly breaded and just plain good. My wife had the smoked wings and they were very good. Finally the beer was ice cold and fairly priced A good experience and we will be going back"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hub several times and have brought friends in as well. I always thought it was comfortable with good food and friendly efficient service. Last Friday night I met several friends there and instead of the usual hamburger and fries opted for the pork tacos. So without exaggeration they were so good, I went in today for lunch, couldn't stop thinking about them and again they were incredible!  So yes, this is not your average sports bar!"}
{"text":"I've gone a few times, and let me tell you--this is awesome. The beer bread, pretzels, burgers, wings, and quesadilla are amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Realtor events here. The food is good, not greasy, and the service is excellent. I enjoy having lunch during a Realtor training class or networking group because it feels to me the time goes by quickly."}
{"text":"This place has super tasty wings, smoky flavored and too good to share. The giant smothered burrito I shared wasn't that flavorful.  It definitely was lacking some spice, even if the chicken would have been marinated a little."}
{"text":"Wow! The place rocks! Great food and an abundance of beer to choose from! I had the Raspberry Chipotle turkey sandwich, my taste buds were satisfied to say the least! Great atmosphere and very family friendly! I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Update: I feel not only should establishments be called out where they fall short, but also deserve praise where praise is due. This is one of our favorite places. They have really done a great job since my first review. My girl and I specifically enjoy burger and pizza nights. Our favs!"}
{"text":"We are newer to the area and stopped in for lunch.  I don't get why others have complaint on their reviews.  Nice food selection and the service was great. They had a nice Sunday mimosa and Bloody Mary special for $3 each and we took them up on it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was overall amazing  -staff was nice  -food was good -huge GF menu -prices were fair due to the amount of food"}
{"text":"Waiter tonight had really bad attitude and got order wrong..just looking to chill and enjoy myself left within 30 minutes because of this.. if I was owner I'd be firing a few people right away! I don't work hard to go out and get attitude!"}
{"text":"Service here is just okay, we were here Sunday night and just kind of hung out with apps and drinks. The server wasn't by enough to check in/for drinks. Beer selection is pretty good, food is typical greasy bar food."}
{"text":"Ugh I love their smoked wings . I did a pick up last night and I get them grilled they were not grilled. I decided to try the cheese soup bad idea it was super salty and I had 2 bites. I ordered 2 pounds of wings and one pound had sauce and the other plain they combined in same box so I couldn't eat any of the wings that touched the flavored ones.  I guess this has to be a dine in only place or I need to check my order each time"}
{"text":"Yelpers have done it again.  Had a guy from work mention this place.  Went to Yelp to see what the \"hub\" bub was about! Y'all were spot on.  Best wings hands down.  Got the Cajon spice.  Perfect in every aspect.  Went for the peanut butter burger next.  I was leary of it, but damn it's tasty. May not be every time, but I will get it again"}
{"text":"Upon our initial impression, the restaurant looked appealing. However, that's when the stars started falling off of the review. The tables were dirty, covered in ash, and hadn't been properly bussed before we were seated even though the restaurant was basically empty. The service was extremely slow, and the beer was flat. The restaurant again was not busy therefore there was no reason for the service to be a slow as it was. We had to go inside to find our waitress just so that we could pay our bill, which had not yet been delivered to the table. The food was mediocre at best, and the flat beer just drove the nail in the coffin."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken wings ever! Definitely get the smoked wings here. Extensive menu, great service. Burgers are phenomenal, giant burrito is 17 feet long. One of the best restaurants in the east valley."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with a party of 6. Great service, tv's are all over, table shuffleboard was fun, food was great and there is a large selection of food. the manager also came around to ask how the food was, how the service was and she definitely listened to us and was interested in our feedback.  Oh yeah....great beer selection too"}
{"text":"All I can say is, don't believe everything you read.  We ate here several years ago and it was awful.  We were looking for something new to eat today so I Yelped the area and this place came up.  It had great reviews so I figured this had to be a different place so we gave it a try.  Two dollar bloody Mary's, how could you go wrong there?  Well, you can.  It taste  like ketchup, was thick, but not in a good way and had a fishy smell.  I Ordered the peanut butter burger WITHOUT the pretzel bun.  Just wanted a regular bun.  My husband ordered the Patty melt with corn.  The waiter asked what side and told us they had a list on the back of the menu.  I tell you this because the waiter said that no one had ever ordered the corn and it was something he should have noticed when it didn't show up on his plate.   I received a burger WITH a pretzel bun and covered in peanut butter, more like gravy than a condiment.  The bacon was in balls, not strips, but blobby balls.  And they were under cooked.  There was so much peanut butter on it that it almost choked me.  It was horribly dry and thick.  Like trying to eat clay.  Keep in mind that this burger is over 10 dollars.  The side I picked was fries.  It came with about a hand full of shoestring fries scattered around the basket.  I guess they know they are so bad, you won't want very many.   My husband got a patty melt with the same hand full of dried nasty fries......remember the corn?  His burger was on hardly toasted thick bread. He ate half of a half.   Service........hmmmm.  The hostess was very sweet and sincere.  I didn't get a good vibe at all from our waiter.  His insincerity was palpable.  They have a very large menu, from burgers to wings to pizza to quesadillas. This has always been a red flag to me.  It Usually means they do a lot of stuff poorly rather than a few things very good.  This place is no exception to the rule.   They do have a very large selection of beer, and this may be where they shine.  I totally hope so as there food is very subpar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sports bar!  Great atmosphere, tons of TV's, friendly service, but most importantly the food is amazing!  Everything I have tried is delicious, but the smoked wings have ruined me.  All other wings pale in comparison."}
{"text":"You would never know they just opened this week! Once again, we are blown away by the creative genius behind The Hub establishment. Between our regular stomping grounds (the Hub on Sossaman), The Vue, and now the new Hub we have three restaurants where we are guaranteed excellent service, wonderful and consistent food, and a welcoming environment. We feel like family when we are greeted by the staff and management. Anyone who has been to it's original location knows what they are famous for--smoked wings, which are hands down the best in the valley. An extensive beer menu, creative dishes (i.e. The Hub Mac with smokey pulled pork and roasted green chiles), and omg that chocolate porter shake, makes this restaurant a foodie heaven (**heavy breathing**). The new digs has an epic patio to enjoy our amazing weather, and every seat is the perfect spot to watch football. Our server Hanna and the manager Chris took such good care of us, and as much as every other server was smiling, I know the rest of the team would give us the same outstanding service. Can't wait to go back and bring my crazy coworkers. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Love coming to the Hub, but really ticked off when bar stools are empty and you can't sit in them because some dh is outside smoking."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now.... great drink specials and the bartenders make a kick -a$$ bloody mary.   Lots of TVs and manager tried to find us some ncaa volleyball but no games were being televised while we there.   Definitely appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"We started when this place was called Dubs. After the change the place has steadily improved thru the years. I love the pulled pork sandwich (I ask for the pretzel bun), burgers are great too.  They have great French fries! Thursday is 50% off pizza, great time to get left overs! The H.F.C. is comfort food to make you smile (bowl of mashed potatoes, gravy, corn topped with deep fried chicken breast), beef stroganoff was delicious too. If you like spicy, try the Giant green chili HUB burrito. Tons of T.V.s to watch and a full bar. Daily luncheon specials and drink specials  too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the hub a couple times now.  Both were great experiences!  It is your typical sports bar with plenty of tables, tv's, and everything you could want on tv.    The food has also been good both times.  The first time there I got the Fish and Chips.  The fish (deep fried cod) was a little bit greasier than I normally like but it still tasted great.  The second time I got the Popper Burger.  It was surprisingly good!  I would definitely come back just for the burger.  My wife got the nachos and they were HUGE.  The platter took up about half our small table.  They had plenty of cheese and all the other fixings that come along with Nachos.  I was also pleased with their drink selection.  They have plenty of beers on tap and even more bottled stuff.  Plenty of local beers too!  The service was good both times.  Every member of staff we came in contact with was friendly and helpful.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with family two weeks ago on the recommendation of my husband's coworker since we were in the area. It was nothing extraordinary. The service was horrible. The smoked wings was the only thing that was ok. We also ordered traditional wings and were not good. My children got the mac n cheese. I'm always disappointed when I order Mac n cheese at a restaurant and they serve \"kraft\" Mac and cheese. I can make a box at home to feed my kids for $1. I thought people go into the restaurant business because they can cook their own recipes. My husband and I also shared a burger which was just ok. I would not go back there."}
{"text":"Really good food and service after Tough Mudder!"}
{"text":"This is the place that my husband and I can go to that suits both us! E can have his steak, hamburger and the beers he likes but they have a very extensive gluten free menu that is just fabulous that I love. The place is packed on a weekend   but it is worth the wait! I would like them to open one in the growing town of Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are fast.. food is really good for bar fare.. beer selection is off the charts and cold.. a rarity in az. (hint WOB)  staff is friendly and lots of tv's for football. I'll be back"}
{"text":"The best sports bar I have been in while living here in the valley. Owners really care about the service"}
{"text":"I put very visiting new bar and grills. The Hub was referred to me by my brother, so I checked it out. The place is clean and big. The atmosphere matched that of other bar and grills. I sat at the bar, as I usually do. The seats were great and actually comfortable for bar seats. The bar is full service.  The staff was great. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and drink orders taken as soon as I sat down.   I ordered the basic burger (medium well) and fries.   Big thick burger, made exactly how I ordered it, on crisp pretzel bread with lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup, mustard and onions. I absolutely loved it!!  The fries were amazing. A little small in size to go with such a big burger and the offering of fries was a tad small.   The Bud Light from draft tasted great and made the glass frothy, as I expected.  On my second visit to The Hub, I ordered the Hub Burrito. It was a green chilli chicken burrito the size of my head, topped with spicy sour cream and cheese. I could only eat half of the monster and I was starving.   This visit was late at night, music played really loud, could had to push the words out just to talk to the rest of my party.   Bathrooms, we're clean and well maintained.  Even in a crowded restaurant, they seem to be able to get the food out quickly.   Overall, I really like this place. I will definitely recommend this place to people.   Final score (out of 10):  Food - 9.0 Atmosphere - 7.5 Service - 9.0 Time - 8.0  Overall - 8.4"}
{"text":"Everyone from friends and family love this place. It's cool, but the hamburger was so tall it made it messy to eat. I suppose it's \"fun\", but I was hungry and wearing a white shirt.   Good burger and fries though."}
{"text":"Problem is, the place doesn't know what it's trying to be. Are they a sports bar? Family restaurant? Well, there a million giant TVs everywhere. You can't get away from them unless you go outside to the patio! I am giving this place the one star because of the patio. Other than that, it's just a mess - too loud, overpriced for what was just mediocre bar food. They seem to think they're a real cool, cutting edge restaurant with good, quality food. I strongly recommend going across the street to a really cool pub. Too loud and too many huge TVs in your face to be a family restaurant. I guess it's a sports bar wannabe? Hard to know. The waitstaff really were nice though, so perhaps I should give them another star for that? .  . . ."}
{"text":"I am a handicapped person that requires my leg to be straight so I put it up on the stool next to mine and they kept asking me to put my leg down even though no one was waiting for the seat or asking for the seat. The manager came over and asked me again to put my leg down so we left. I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Some family and I recently came here to watch the playoff games while in town. This place gets super packed for football games, but it wasn't anything unexpected. We were able to get a table for four within about 20 mins or so and I loved that their were multiple TVs covering the place.  Once seated our waitress was very good with checking back on us and making sure our drinks were plentiful. As for the food it was good, but nothing out of the usual bar and grill style. I had a turkey sandwich and house side salad. Their ranch was banging which is always a great thing and the sandwich portion size was huge.  I'd recommend this place as a good sports bar and place to grab some wings, sandwiches or apps."}
{"text":"NSFW: language.   So my boyfriend and I decided to get a late dinner on a lazy day, and we tried The Hub for the first time. Walking in, I saw an advertisement for their \"horrible beer cheddar soup,\" described by one reviewer as having been so bad, her dog refused to eat the leftovers. I ordered that just for kicks along with a peanut butter burger. Mistakes happen to the best of us, and beer, cheddar, bacon, and onion sounded good, but ultimately it was bland, boring, and even a little gross. The bacon seemed too chewy and a bit \"off\" in a way that's difficult for me to put my thumb on. I had a few bites to make sure the first try wasn't a fluke and then stopped. The burger was fantastic, however, so I thought, No harm, no foul. This soup ain't for everybody. We'll come back another time to try other menu items.   My stomach begged to fucking differ.   I woke up at half past three in the goddamn morning feeling nauseous. I don't know about you, but for me nausea has always had one of two forms: an \"ewww disgusting\" feeling that's enough to bring my mood down some at most but doesn't go further, and \"go to the bathroom NOW\" mode that meant honking up the contents of my stomach was sure to come. This was definitely the latter. I spent a few minutes in denial, using breathing exercises and telling myself it would pass, until my stomach said, \"Nah, honey, get to the toilet ASAP or your carpet's gonna be a bitch to clean in the morning.\"   I smelled and tasted nothing but beer cheddar bacon soup, bile version, while bent over the loo.   Take this as a lesson to be learned: if a DOG turns down BACON AND CHEDDAR (presumably a non-picky eater, as that review implies--to say nothing of the fact that cat shit and their own vomit are like delicacies to them), maybe you should, I don't know, take note of that. Especially if someone throws up after eating a bit of your shit. Is that a lot to ask?   At this point of reading, if you try the garbage at The Hub known as the beer cheddar soup, aware that a dog has turned it down and a customer has thrown up, you deserve any nastiness tossed your way.   The peanut butter burger and chips were absolutely FABULOUS, though. 10/10 would try them again. I'd just need someone to pick them up for me because I ain't goin' through Hub's doors any time soon. Perhaps I'll work up the courage to return; my stomach can be forgiving sometimes. Just please, if you're reading this, stay the heavenly baby Jesus' sake away from that blasted soup unless you've got a titanium belly.   +3 stars for the cool atmosphere and awesome burgers aside from the devil's piss.   -2 stars for ungodly-sacrilegious-soup-induced night of stomach upchucking."}
{"text":"We love this place! We're here several times a month. The service is always great, we never have to wait long, and the food is amazing. This is not your typical bar food, they actually have really good food with unique combinations. It's not just fried bar food. And I love that they offer new food items that rotate each week! I eat something different every single time and have never been disappointed. This place will never lose our business."}
{"text":"Went to The Vue a sister restaurant and they were booked for a wedding. So we came down to The Hub another great place. As always Josh and Veronica were AMAZING! Always going out of their way to make sure I have the coldest of beer and just the right amount of water at all times!!!"}
{"text":"Had my wife's bday party and they know how to take care of you at this place. Our server, Molly was on point all night (6+ hours) and had a smile the whole time. For 45+ people and separate checks and patio and banquet room,..that's handlin' yo bisness. And the manager Steve made sure everything was ready when we got there to set up decorations and the cake. Would not hesitate to go there again or recommend it to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken sandwich ever. Great food, perfectly placed televisions, huge beer selection. I will definitely be back. Jenny the bartender was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked insanity wings ... Nothing like you've ever tasted before!! Must try!  Nachos were delicious. Large open space, friendly atmosphere and good selection of microbrews!   My son wanted a burger and oh boy! This burger was no joke, huge and full of flavor!  So kid friendly that they offer a key to the kids upon arriving, if parent agrees the kid can turn it in and the end of a visit for a surprise!"}
{"text":"The best place sports bar in the area! Over 100 big screens, great comfortable place to watch many games at a time. Food was yummy. Pretzels outstanding. Go relax!!"}
{"text":"So you're hanging out with friends at a Memorial Day pool party and at 12am you decide to Uber it to the local bar and have a drink with friends. Yes, you have had a few to drink, hence the Uber, but far from stumbling or slurring and just want to have a drink at your local gathering bar. But the HUB will have nothing of this debauchery. ... at least until they sucked a few bucks out of you before THEY decide that you're too drunk to serve. ... After trying to get a second drink we were told that we would not be served because the manager smelt alcohol on our breathe as we walked in!  AS WE WALKED IN! ???? Are you kidding me? It's Saturday night at a BAR,! who's breathe doesn't smell like alcohol? But yet they still served us with 4 drinks and 3 shots. I guess the \"manager\" felt we were sober enough to give the bar a few bucks before we were kicked out. ....... Hey David Bee,! if you don't want \"drunk\" people in you're bar then don't serve them when they walk in and kick them out after you have they're money.  I am not the one that gets off on slamming businesses. I give credit where credit is due. Check my reviews. But when a business pulls this uncalled for, selfritgheous judgment when I'm trying to patronize they're establishment (that being the business of serving people alcohol) then I have to call you out.  Horrible customer service. I'll go across the street next time."}
{"text":"They advertise happy hour prices.  When the bill came, it was full price.  The point of sale (POS) isn't recognizing happy hour.  Are they doing a bait and switch.  I think so.  I will never be back.  Can't trust them."}
{"text":"The Hub is a nice little sports bar. We asked a few locals where to go for good craft beer. They recommended this place. The Elysian IPA is excellent and the French Dip was great. They wait staff is OK....the drinks were a little slow to arrive, but they were down to one bartender. So they said.  Veggie platter for girlfriend was pretty good, she had the Chardonnay. It was \"good\".   Overall I would recommend this place. 50 plus beers, quite a few locals, pinball table. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have you ever been in a bar where you literally have so many TVs playing football games that you don't know where to look? Thanks to The Hub, I have... and it's awesome!   This place really blew me away. Great atmosphere, lots of TVs, excellent customer service, and they have a really nice outdoor seating area (and bar) for when the weather cools off. Oh, and the food is really good too! I got the Carne Asada quesadilla and it was great. They also have a pretty extensive selection of beer.   All in all, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Wow, is all I can say (very positively). From the above and beyond customer service, to the awesome food and extremely welcoming atmosphere (as well as a dog friendly patio)  this place is a serious force to be reckoned with. A bar it is, a restaurant, damn, they have that down too, service...stellar.   I came here with my work buddy for a late lunch, we walked in and were greeted immediately by a very friendly hostess. She was getting ready to seat us when two barstools at the bar opened up. We asked for those instead, she was kind and said \"go right ahead\". We were greeeted at the bar by a very nice, pretty bartender. She got us drinks immediately and handed us menus. We ordered food, my co-worker got boneless wings and fries, the amount of food he got was insane! The boneless wings were giant, not dry inside, crispy out and an abundenet amount of sauce. The fries were equally excellent. He ordered hot for the wings, they could have been hotter but they were still basically perfect. Unfortunately my food didn't come out, lol. The super sweet bartender came over and apologized and stated they made my salad...with no chicken. I said \"no worries\" :) she ran to the back.... I just kept drinking my drink and chatting.   Here is where shit gets real, an attractive tattooed gentleman brings out my salad after my co-worker is done eating and apologizes that my salad was not made, they messed up and this guy was owning it. I like that. I didn't want, nor ask for anything for free....he just offered since they made a mistake. He comped our drinks, comped my cajun chicken Caesar salad and that was how it was handled, professional. My salad by the way was awesome. The chicken was cooked perfectly, super moist and the cajun flavoring was excellent. I know all I got was a damn caeser salad but it was damn good. I want a lot more of their food, this place is so cool and such awesomely staffed employees definitely added to an impacting experience. I am moving about a block away I now know where I can enjoy a cold one and a great meal with awesome staff after work. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The smoked wings are the bomb! Now if they ever get PBR, I will be moving next door. Also, the service has always been spoton!"}
{"text":"We were at an event nearby and wanted to catch the end of a football game and saw this place was close - I have nothing but good things to say about it! The service was great, food came out hot and tasty, our server was really nice. We had more friends come than expected and they were quick to accommodate more chairs and an add on to our table. Several steps improved from when this place was Mad Dog Saloon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for being a bar. I go there with my kids for lunch and we have tried almost the entire menu. Karaoke us s lot of fun on the weekend there as well. Staff smiles when serving you and seem to like to work there. Lots of TVs. This is my first pick to watch sports events since there's not a bad seat with so many TVs around.  Nov/2015 Continue to enjoy this place. Took a friend that had never been there before. The food again was very tasty; fish tacos, boneless wings, tilapia. The waitress was attentive and checked in us often despite being very busy. They had a vendor raffling football jerseys and a bike. I won a jersey which made my experience even better."}
{"text":"Awsome place great food and drinks!! Great burgers, sandwiches, salads and apps. Fast service and great atmosphere. Lots of beers on tap."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have visited The Hub and as always they deliver! Some of the best food around and their mixed drinks are really good. It's nice to have a bar tender that knows what actually goes into a drink. If you are planning on coming down you need to order some of their Arizona Smoked wings! I have never had anything like them, smoked perfectly and falling off the bone. I really don't think you can order wrong."}
{"text":"I went to this place on recommended of a co-worker.  The staff was friendly, worked as a team to get food out, and refilled our drinks with no prompting. The food came out quickly. The veggies were fresh, the hummus was great, and all the food was warm. The kids meal was decent size, as well as the adult entrees. The fish tasted frozen but cooked well. The calzone was full of cheese and not enough green chilies or diced chicken. The worst part of our dining experience was a couple watching the Sunday football games. Apparently they had been there since noon and it was going on 6pm. One persons the party was loud and obnoxious. They would start screaming profanity, yelling \"come on\", or just started screaming/cheering I guess. The screaming would come out of no where and would make me or my child jump. I had to take some tylenol for my migraine.  We only sat in the dining area to be close to the game room. Everyone they seated after us left. It was that bad. I don't understand why management allowed these 2 individuals to commandeer their dining room."}
{"text":"We're excited for the Grand Opening this weekend.  We would love to come to the soft opening, if anyone has an extra invite.  We really like the wings and beer at the existing location, but the Stapley site is closer to us and should be more conducive to games and sports viewing."}
{"text":"I love there wings and everything was great when I left the place. But a couple days later I noticed I was charged a lot more than what was signed off for that included a tip. I called the hub several times and the manager still hasn't call me back. With customer service like this I doubt the management team there will last long."}
{"text":"The pizza was full of flavor. Veronica was our waitress, she was attentive, helpful and thoughtful. Chef brought us a first time appetizer of cornbread. It was good but the mashed potatoes balls were the bomb."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The menu items are mid to high priced but the quality of food justifies a few extra dollars per item. It is a great play to keep the preferred patrons who want a great experience as clientele.  They seem to put more care in preparation, such as an option of smoking the wings for tenderness then grilling as opposed to just dumping them into a deep fryer.   We have been there twice prior to this review so there is a period if consistency.  As of late, this has been my favorite restaurant.  It does have a bar theme but what it lacks is the drunk frat feeling of overserving, thankfully.  You can take your family there and not have to worry about the patrons ruining your time out.  My only recommendation is to dump the plastic bins amd wax paper when serving some of your menu items, your product deserves better.  The staff is also great, they seem to work together to service the client and the few we had were very professional and attentive to us, earning a great tip for going beyond."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best sports bar around.  Oh, and a great menu with tons of wonderful beer on tap!  The AZ smoked wings are great.  The Devil Burger is simply awesome.  Plus, managers like Mike that always want to insure you are having a great experience.  Service can be hit and miss with just a few of the servers, but overall still a great place...my favorite place.  Even the girlfriend digs it!"}
{"text":"We visited one night before a movie showing only in the the east valley. We sat at the bar even though we don't drink because the place was packed. The service was awesome because the bartender was right there.   They have good specials every day. The special the day we were there was half off pizza. We got one and it was very good. We also ordered the smoked chicken wings and they're probably the best chicken wings we've ever had. Even though we live about half an hour away we plan on going back as soon as possible just for the wings. Hopefully they'll put one in closer to our house so we can go more often."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and staff is very friendly. Why only 2?Stars???  Well their logistics SUCK!!  If you order a drink while sitting on the patio (mind you there's a full bar on the patio literally in breathing distance) the waitstaff has to get it from the other bar inside (which is completely overwhelmed with serving drinks to the inside patrons along with the entire patio).  Makes no sense since I watched the bar wench at the patio bar flirt with patrons for 20 mins without pouring a single drink while I waited 20 mins for a lousy blue moon from the inside bar!  Fix that issue and it's 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give the restaurant 5 stars because the food was amazing! Unfortunately, we got to the restaurant around 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. We were almost immediately seated (2 minute wait) and when we got to our table, we opened our menus and sat waiting for a waiter to come to the table. Waiters walked by our table back and forth and the hostess even walked by more than 5 times. Not one person stopped by to see if we needed anything. After 30 minutes of waiting my boyfriend finally stood up to go to the bar and ask for our waiter, when a waitress noticed and came over. She mentioned that the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a waiter assigned to it! We are fairly patient people and we understand weekends can be busier, but to have to wait 30 minutes before anyone came over to even offer us water, is absolutely ridiculous.   On a lighter note, I had the clam bake, which was to die for! The chorizo sauce was absolutely amazing. My aunt had the fish tacos, which tasted fresh and not greasy, and my boyfriend had a chicken salad which was huge and very flavorful. Overall, I believe we'll be returning because of the food quality, but I hope when we go back the hostess has her head on straight and the management has enough sense to address a table that has been sitting for 30 minutes with no waters, no drinks, and no food."}
{"text":"My daughter frequently mentions this place when I ask here where she ate so I finally gave it a try. Food was four stars and service was 3. Took a really long time to get service and then when we did it sort of felt like we were an imposition. We started with nachos and there were great and there was a lot of them. Would have probably been full just sharing the nachos! There was a lot of stuff on them and it was great. We had some wings, with bones, medium sauce. They were perfectly cooked and enjoyed them a lot. Huge selection of drink choices and nice patio and indoor seating. Lots of TV's so you can see games from almost anywhere and they asked when they sat us if there was anywhere in particular we wanted to sit to see a certain game which was nice."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! Definitively NOT typical bar food. Get the clam bake it will change your life!!"}
{"text":"STEVE ..... Sure, they've got at least seven of them.    God, I love this place. The food is great but the customer service is outstanding. Thank you management.   OMG tried the fish tacos tonight and as with all their food it was awesome. Mac and cheese is outstanding with pork and green chili. Smoked wings are always a favorite. This place is aces. Great servers, great food and full bar with rotating taps. Best bar/restaurant ever. Owner and manager and chef truly care about service and their product and community."}
{"text":"Very good food my wife and I stayed very full and happy we will for sure come back to this place. Maybe come back with some friends for karaoke night..lol or Saturday for the DJ very good place to come and eat."}
{"text":"I'm not a sports person, and I loved this sports bar. The food is really good, and decently priced. I had a chicken sandwich with swiss and avocado on a gluten free bun. I got veggies on the side. Everything was really, really good. The burgers are huge, and delicious. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service, food was delicious and the portion are pretty big. We could have easily shared the grilled cheese. The wait time was decent and they did bring out cornbread for being our first time there."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!! Awesome service too!!! Order the basket of pretzils!!! Ginormous basket! Also the carne asada quesadilla was delicious, be aware of the $5 sur charge for the carne!! The Giant Green Chili Hub Burrito is soooo big!!! 2-3 people can share seriously!!! Always delicious food and great service here!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like the HUB!  It's the go-to spot for having a drink and grabbing something to eat. Everyone who works there is attentive to customers and provides great service.  Love the great beer selection.  Prices are right.  Food is always good and much better than any of the area competing restaurant/bars.  Try them out!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Service was slow but we arrived  at 12:45 PM when things were in swing. We had to ask a manager to get someone to take our order. I just think too many tables. On the plus side the food was great! Gourmet bar food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar. I have tried to like this bar on four occasions. Bartenders don't care. Servers have had no training. The regulars seem to own the place. Unless you sit at the bar be prepared to be ignored. Food is way overpriced and served with the same lackluster performance that seems to define this place. I really wanted to like this place because a walking distance good bar is a great thing."}
{"text":"My husband keeps insisting that I update my review since we went back this weekend and I really enjoyed it.  Lets start with the best thing, the wings! Yes! I change my mind because this time I ordered it the way I like it.  I'm not a big fan of their sauces, they are all too sour or sweet (totally subjective), one of our friends suggested we try the wings naked and get the sauces on the side to dip if we liked.  So we tried that and AMAZING, now I finally understood why everyone loved their wings so much.  We also got a pizza this time and that was really good too!  My husband is so excited and happy that I will no longer refuse coming here.    Tips:  1. Get AZ smoked wings naked, sauce on the side so you can try more than one.  2.  Try the pizza! 3. Happy hour Sundays.  BEST DEAL! 3.50 Jameson shots."}
{"text":"This place is a locals dream. The really care about the area and the locals. And this place is definitely a foodies dream. The food is truly amazing, service is great, and try to accommodate everyone.  I love this place. .."}
{"text":"GREAT SMOKED WINGS GUYS!! When are you gonna let us home bodys have take out for the wings on wing Wednesdays special deal!!!!??? =) staff is friendly,  place is clean, mix crowd. Did I mention the smoked wings lol great job guys thanks for your great wings and pizza!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the same awesome waitress that works at the Sossaman location. She was friendly as always and every time I ask her her suggestion for food and normally go with that. We ordered the kitchen sink and added some carne asada. Wow was she right it was soooooo good and it was exactly we wanted, a little bit of everything. The carne was tender, the home fries were seasoned just right and the chips were crispy. We will back back again I'm sure."}
{"text":"The Hub Bar provides wonderful service and delicious food. I had my 51st (yikes) birthday party on November 9th.  Everyone raved about the wings and we are still getting compliments for everything that was served. The service was top notch and everything was handled and set up so nicely. I know more business will be coming their way even though some of our friends and family live in West and South Phoenix. They couldn't stop talking about how delicious your wings are!!   There is only one regret and that is that I don't feel that I tipped the waitress nearly enough. All of them were so efficient and on the spot when we needed them.  Your place ROCKS!!!  Thank you and thank you again!   Love ya, Jenni Macias"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a little while but we use to go here all the time. Their Arizona Smoked wings are the best I've ever had! I get them every time and they never disappoint! The have Angry Orchard on tap which is nice because it tastes better than bottled, in my opinion. Service is always great. The servers always seem to recognize their regulars and will stop to say hi. And I love Tuesday Night Trivia (if they still have it)."}
{"text":"Went there after a long day of work with 2 coworkers. We only ordered appetizer: quesadilla, edamame and hummus.  This place features a very nice selection of beers and offers the possibility of seating outside, on a covered patio (that hosts a bar). It's very nice but the patio is  smoking area therefore it can be quite bothering while you are eating.  The food: - Quesadilla: very bland, over cheesy, just a very average  \"bar food\" style quesadilla.Nothing special, not good nor bad, 2 to 2.5 stars.  - edamame: drenched in an over sweet (and over salty) soy sauce. I didn't get the point of this starter. 0 star.  - hummus: dry, pita bread: 0 star. The hummus itself beside being too dry was quite tasty. portion was huge. 3 stars.  I wouldn't recommend eating there but it's very nice for drinking outdoor."}
{"text":"I went with my girfriend during a UFC fight, and sat in the dining area. Ordered two tall craft beers and a pretzel appetizer for starters. While perusing the menu, the appetizer came out... 10 bitty pretzel bites and a small thing of obviously canned cheese. I told the server that I expected more for $7. Made me think twice about ordering more food. The server agreed and comp'd our order. I thought this was very stand up, and was about to order food. Then the manager came out.... This guy squatted down, put his arm on the back of my girlfirends chair and on mine. He then proceeded to spend the next 20 minutes explaining how he knows the pretzels are frozen and the cheese is from a tub, but that's how his patrons demanded it. He told me I was the only one to complain. Forget the fact that he did this during the main fight, which we missed completely. He took a positive situation that was handled perfectly by the server, and turned us away from that place for good. This place was 5 stars before the manager came to our table. Only one to complain? Sorry to ruin your perfect record.."}
{"text":"Really good bar food. We came to watch the AFC championships. Great sports bar. Lots of TVs. Had their pretzel bites, which were okay. The smoked wings were really good, although I like my wings a bit crispier. The Hub Club was really good.  Not your traditional club but really good. This will be out new go to place for bar food. The mussels sound really good, so will have to try those another time."}
{"text":"I am seriously in love with this place. The food, the beers, the overall customer service experience. Outstanding, each and every time.   The Arizona smoked wings are killer. A must have. The meat literally falls off of the bone and as an avid wing-goer, these guys are #1 in my book.  The Hub is hands-down, Mesa's best kept secret. Keep doing what you're doing and you have a fan fo' life."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Can't wait to go again! The platea are huge and delicious. The service was great from suggestions to fixing the drinks until we absolutely loved them. We were picky and a pain but they were happy to help us. I love the variety of drinks and the ambience. It does get full after 5 as many places do. Happy hour I believe starts at 4:12 and ends at 6:12...weird yes but it works :)  I recommend the calzone and burrito! They are huge, we took leftovers that filles us up the next day. Cost of food and drinks is good too"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch delivered quickly and enthusiastically by a friendly and attentive server. Place was packed for late lunch and TV's all over to catch whatever you want. Major beer menu and lots of seating inside and out."}
{"text":"First time at the Hub. Good stuff!  I has the bbq pork tacos, which were very fresh and tasty. We tried the honey bbq boneless wings and the pot roast French dip. All were great. The French dip was really more of a pot roast sandwich with gravy so dont expect a traditional French dip. The fries are the best we've had in recent memory.  This place is a fun, funky neighborhood joint. We'll definitely It was so great to see you all together one more time. back!"}
{"text":"Came to try this place out and ended up leaving. We sat waiting to be helped for about 15 mins and we no one even said hello. Employees walked right past us as we waited patiently and nothing. This was so disappointing because we were really looking forward to enjoying some food. Don't think I'll ever come back. Complete waste of time."}
{"text":"Great food and service - manager was super nice and the wait staff as well. Will def. go back"}
{"text":"We frequent this place for a couple years for the Arizona Smoked wings. They are REALLY good. Everything else on the menu is to be expected from a bar / restaurant. Portions are large and the staff is always very friendly.   They have generous happy hour deals and daily specials as well.   The environment is dark and typical of a bar with dozens of big flat screen TVS."}
{"text":"Worst food I have had in a LONG time. I ordered French dip \"AU JUS! I asked for no cheese on ordering. When it came there was cheese on it, sent it back. Next plate the only resemblance to a french dip I have had many times(Not at HUB) was the hoagie roll. The \"beef\" looked very very dark and looked as thought it had been sat in some sort of dark sauce(NOT a french sauce more like a bottle of barbecue sauce) for days. The AU JUS is supposed to be the juices from the beef. HMM don't think this beef had ever seen juice and the AU JUS was like thick slimy goop(Couldn't have dipped it as it was more like slime) The only saving grace is they ended up not charging me $15 for an awful sandwich. I had to go back home and eat. Definitely a poor excuse for cafeteria quality food. Maybe the \"cooks night off!\""}
{"text":"Hub has always been a 5 star in our eyes until the last three'ish weeks. Not sure if it is due to their new location opening or football season starting, but service at the original location has declined tenfold. Been there three times in last three weeks. Twice the wait to even get menus or water was 20 minutes. We walked out this most recent time.    Food is best bar and grill food. Wings are great. Bloody Mary's are awesome on Sunday. Pizza is bomb. Green chili stuffed bread is good.   They need to cater to more than football fans. Three tables outside on patio requested NASCAR on tv. All denied. Said tv's were linked to inside tv's whereas in past they had no issue changing one tv to NASCAR. Seriously, shouldn't have been that big of an inconvenience. Esp since multiple tables were requesting it.   Hoping management can rebound cuz we do love the Hub."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Excellent customer service, delicious food and cold beer. The staff makes it a point to remember us and our drink order which always makes us feel welcomed. Veronica is one of the servers there who stands out, she goes above and beyond to make sure all of her guests are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Four of us dined here the other night. We liked the atmosphere a lot. Although the only section that was open outside, was for smokers. While I did not go out there, I had to wonder what would keep the wind from blowing smoke from the smoking section to the non-smoking section?  Three of us ordered the Giant Green Chili Hub Burrito. The other person ordered the fish and chips. And none of us can say we had a good meal. The burrito was very doughy and chewy like chewing fat, along with a sauce that was rather watered down. The breaded fish was a small portion, overcooked and the Hub bread was hard.  When the manager came by to check on our experience we explained to him our experience. He excused himself and came back a short while later with a 20% discounted bill in hopes that we would come back and try something else another time. He confessed that the burrito is typically one of the least favorite items on the menu as others have had the same complaint. My thoughts on that are; why is it still on the menu and in the Specialties section on top of that? Additionally how do all the other Mexican restaurants make their a burrito shells a normal experience. Even Taco Bell has a better burrito shell. BTW the Fish and chips are also in the Specialty section.  If you want a lot better burrito with a fabulous sauce try the Special Chimi at one of the Moreno's locations.   On a more positive note our waitress offer very good service and great beer selection."}
{"text":"So I've heard about this place from a few different people, and I figured kids night was the perfect opportunity to test them out. They have two indoor seating areas but only one was being used. It was crowded with all the families coming in for kids night but not uncomfortable. I don't think anyone knew we had been seated as it took a while for a waitress to come over. She said she didn't know who our server was but that she would take good care of us, and she did. We both got cheese burgers with fries. My sons burger was a great size for a kids portion and he seemed to really enjoy it. My burger was also huge and the pretzel but was really nice. It was a bit over cooked, but I didn't mention it because the waitress seemed rushed off her feet. The fries were also served cold but as soon ad we told them they brought out a fresh basket with fresh hot fries. This is a comfortable spot with a good special kids special on Mondays. A few notes - on kids night could you put a few of the many tvs to cartoons, the burgers are delish, if they added few sauces to offer on the side it would really dress it up, garlic aioli, pesto, chili mayo ect, and please hold on to your amazing waitress, Molly, she was the real star of the night."}
{"text":"By far the best customer service I've had in a very long time. This is a must if you are in the neighborhood. I wish I lived closer. I would be a regular. Jesse and James both are one of a kind I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Second time there, first time ordering food. Ordered wings and the UFC Bowl. Good wings but way over priced. 1/2 LB wings cost $6.75 [ 5 wings ]. $1.35 for a wing is crazy, and not even a full wing. The UFC Bowl was served at best like warm, but tasty and enough for 2 people. The value of the bowl was way better than the wings. The service could have been much better. Server didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Wasn't attentive at all. The hostess and the young lady the delivered my food were both friendly and courteous, the server not so much. Decent price for cocktail. Next visit hopefully better service and hot food, but no wings. Flavor doesn't out do price"}
{"text":"Best...wings...ever!!!   Arizona smoked wings are smoked in mesquite wood making them smokey and fall off the bone awesome!  I got them with honey, bbq, hot  and parmesan.  The honey for sweet, the bbq for tang, the hot for a spivey kick and the Parmesan for texture and tang!  Add all that to those smokey wings and you have the best wings ever made by man!   A bit high on the price for the wings but they are SOoooooOooOo worth it!   The waitress was super nice and at tentative."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party.  Ordered 1/2 lb of wings and got 4????  Waited for the 9 pm Karaoke that finally started at 9:45....no kidding 45 minutes late.  Throw that in with the traffic problems of trying to go in any direction but west (no access to the 60 East or 202 in any direction for over 2 miles)....I'll pass in the future."}
{"text":"We went to the hub to celebrate a birthday.  Not a place for old folks as the 15 TV's were blaring numerous sporting events while loud rock music was blaring too.  We could not talk to others at our table without shouting.  The drinks were OK.  Frozen Margarita was bland with little alcoholic kick.  Food was actually pretty good.  I had a share of exploding potato skins which were excellent.  Followed that up with Cesar Salad with Cajun chicken which was very good, but spicy.  Service was good and prompt.  Might be better for lunch than dinner.  Huge parking lot behind restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9, sat outside on a beautiful 85 degree afternoon.  Maggie was out server. What outstanding service with a smile. Not the easiest group of people to please\" My family \". She smiled and handled every situation. The food was presented in mass quantities! Very tasty and enjoyable. I personally had the BIG HUB! A POUND OF RED MEAT WITH BACON. Definitely a challenge, but I won! We will definitely return. Thanks for the excellent service Maggie!"}
{"text":"I walked in to attend a regular group event held at this location, it was my first time attending. Food order was placed, we spent a total of just about $32 for very overpriced salad that didnt have much chicken, had a ton of cheap iceberg lettuce, minimal cheese and huge crutons. A meatball dish that had a large bowl half filled with mashed potatoes then the meatballs and gravy that weren't great. I wanted potato skins, that I clarified based on menu description... and in fact was told they were not skins, but potato chips waitress said, but they HAD skins made with queso poured on top with a different name. I asked the waitress for no queso and just the other ingredients shown on menu on an actual potato skin. Why have both types? Who wants chips AND potato skins made almost the same way? Unnecessary especially since the chips were called \"potato skins\". Waitress left me confused on what was what as the chips were labeled potato skins lol. Half our food wasn't eaten because it's mediocre at best..bacon on my potato skins tasted burnt, skins were hot but dry, no chives that should have been there, and minimal sour cream. Here's why I didn't bother asking for more sour cream or anything else tbh...   I didn't even realize I was carrying a half empty Starbucks drink when I arrived. I had set it on our table in the corner when we were seated. Waitress took drink order from us and decided to \"report\" my offending drink to management. Moments later, another female came out of the  kitchen and made a fast beeline for me and stated, quite nastily, that \"outside drinks are not permitted\" I said ok. I was quite happy to remove it as this is normal in most places, I had simply carried it in by accident. Her tone, body language and approach was absolutely horrible. Ok, I brought in a $4 outside drink by accident, spent $32 on crappy food, plus tip, and nobody except the gentleman that seated us smiled. Customer service here needs evaluating, seriously. There is a way to approach things, and your staff have no clue. I would have happily removed the offending drink if I wasn't treated like crap, hell, the waitress herself could have mentioned it instead of making it a management issue. Again, the drink rule itself is ok, but the enforcement was awful. It was an ACCIDENT. Won't be back, staff can't even smile for the patronage we gave. This place made a lot of money from the people at the event I attended....such a shame it wasn't appreciated, I shall recommend it be held elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical but this place is always hopping. The portions are huge so be prepared to eat. The smoked Cajun wings are the best in house, IMO. The smoked wings almost melt in your mouth they are so good. I haven't tried much outside of the wings but Smoke Wings + Mermaid Red from Coronado, CA equal deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome but what really sets this place apart is the incredible staff. Probably one of the best customer service experiences that I have ever had. Wow!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place is AWESOME!  It is everything you want in a sports bar - excellent food, decent selection of beers, comfortable - it is one of our go-to spots.  The \"Ten Dollar Grilled Cheese\" is SO good...its under-priced!  Try the smoked wings - you will love, love, love them!"}
{"text":"My waitress was very nice. Got there wings happy hour 1/2 pound witch came out to 5wings. Really good flavor i combined the raspberry chipotle with Cajun. There shotter/shots are two dollars off. Good deal"}
{"text":"A solid sports bar.  Good burgers, ok fries.  The service was fantastic.  We came in to watch soccer and baseball and they put it on for us and they gave us a remote for our TV.  That's neat.  The place always has chicks in it."}
{"text":"first time here, at happy hour, busy but,lots of room, had Pizza, very good,service was great, Andrea was very good about every thing. will be back soon.lots of tv's, food dishes look great."}
{"text":"Busy place. Burger looked great and tasted good. Only disappointment....the UPcharge for mayo and another UPcharge for a slice of onion...REALLY?! For $13 bucks for a sandwich throw in the ..35 mayo.  Took down from 4 stars to 3 for 3 cents...yes, 35 cents!"}
{"text":"Great food, the raspberry chipotle smoked wings are so good!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Drink selection is plentiful. And service has always been good and timely. Got to have the Arizona smoked wings!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was Zach and he was perfect. I usually never ask about menus at places because the wait staff doesn't add any context or value to their recommendations but Zach had very good knowledge on the food they make. Speaking of the food... Holy cow. I have been back 4 times now and each time I've tried something different. I have yet to be disappointed. High quality ingredients, creative entrees, and big portions. Prices are a little higher but there is almost always plenty to take home making two meals."}
{"text":"Get the smoked wings! Go now...really...they're great! The have decent beer prices, good burgers, and pretty good service. I'm glad we came across this gem. A great place to go for Sunday football."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because of the drinks. We were so disappointed with the food. We ordered a plethora of wings, just to leave more than half of them. They were not good at all :/ no crispiness to them at all. My son n law got  the philly steak sandwich and was disappointed also. The buffalo chicken dip and the drinks were the only good thing that we had here at this place. The atmosphere and building is great with an awesome patio but so disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"We live close to the Hub and been loyal/regular customers for the past 3 years. We love the food and used to love the service there as well. However, since the Stapley location opened their service quality dropped to 0. It used to be one of our go to place on week nights with our friends. But it's been consistently horrible last 7-8 times we have been there. Everytime we waited 10-15 minutes at the table for our servers to notice/greet us and give us menus. Then another 20minutes to get beers served by different server. Then we waited another 15 minutes for our server to return to our table to take our orders. 20 minutes later, food would come but someone's order is always wrong. After that when we are done eating we would sit there for another half hour waiting for our server to show up, so we could order dessert/another drink. But by the time she shows up we'd be so tired of waiting that we just want our checks and leave. I have given the Hub the benefit of the doubt and showed up over and over with the hope of improved service, but I give up. I wish it would go back to the family owned local bar/restaurant it used to be, where they cared about their customers and service."}
{"text":"nice space, decent food.  they got some of the good servers from uncle bears!  I like the unique beer selection and weekly specials."}
{"text":"O.....M.....G!!!!!! This place is the bomb for food.  Went there last night for a post-concert grubfest, and wasn't disappointed.  I had the Aluema-whatever the heck-Calzone, and I'm still trying to find my socks (as in they were blown off).  One of our members ordered the $10 grilled cheese.  Yes, ask yourself \"How can you justify $10 for a grilled cheese?\"  This thing was awesome, and Mike, who normally is a big eater, couldn't finish it.  Leave it on the plate?  Ain't happen'; it went home in a box.  Everybody in my party left happy.  The only complaint is that the cover music is a big loud seeing there's little sound absorbtion going on inside.  Turning it down a little will help us not having to shout our conversation."}
{"text":"The holy bacon Batman burger is great and so is the HFC. This is a great place to go any time and I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was average, we went because yelp gave it 5 stars, NOT ! Wings were tasty but expensive and super small. We got the appetizer called the sink, recommended,  add chicken, small chunks like salad bar chicken. Atmosphere loud,  service good. Not coming back, not worth the drive when so many places better for wings"}
{"text":"Get the smoked wings! They are amazing! The meat falls off the bone like ribs. They are off the charts. You have to go try them. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Well the food is still good I'd imagine but I don't know who this is or if you'll be working there by the time I'd come back. I had been there quite often but staff seems to switch often enough to the point where I can't recall seeing someone more than two or three times. Your a place I turn down every time now, I was a regular, not snowbird, so I like many people would love to come there year round, but it's to loud with all the shouting and whatnots from people watching the games to people with hearing aids shouting, and yes I can say that because I am deaf in one ear and have an aid in the other!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  This was our 1st time here and Matt was very accommodating! We will definately return and look forward to trying other things in the menu...i recommend the pretzel bites,  and the sosarita was delicious:)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times friendly bar staff,  good food and a great spot to catch your favorite sports game."}
{"text":"Came here while in town to visit family & the food is AMAZING!!  We had the Spicy IPA'd Shrimp to start & it was so good!  Then, my husband had the Baja Chicken tacos that were good, as well. I had the Hub Mac & Cheese and it was TO DIE FOR!!  Ambiance & Service were fair, but the food is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Always a hang out, whether it's with co-workers for HH, a family dinner, or a getaway with the hubs for a couple of hours snacking & watching a game on the TV. Definitely more than \"classic\" bar food. They step it up for sure starting with the raspberry chipotle smoked wings, to the nachos, to the Devil Burger, to the all you can eat fish & chips on Fridays, to the Iowa State Sammie. We've had so many things from this menu, you can't possibly get disappointed. Service on regular nights is fast and friendly. Busy nights, are gonna get you in trouble, so no high expectations during a school or pro football season, although I have never come to that problem. Great atmosphere, great drinks, nice selection of beers, and overall a go-to place to get some grub and a sports game!"}
{"text":"When I first tried The Hub I would have given it more stars, but it recently expanded & since then I don't think the food is as good and the service is slower.  Definitely come here if you want to watch some sports and drink some beers.  They have tons of tv's and will put it on pretty much anything you want.  The beer list is pretty expansive with some creative beer cocktails.    Still my go-to for UFC fights."}
{"text":"Stopped off here with a friend. Came in and watched some UFC on one of the many flat screens they have (I counted 19). Decent selection of beer, including gluten free. Didn't eat any food so I cannot speak to the quality but it's clean and not loud which is nice. Bar, high tables and standard tables, also outside seating. All in all it's a pretty good place to stop at."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Lively atmosphere. They have tons of local beers on tap. 36 tvs, pool. It's a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go.  I have never left without enjoying my meal.  Only once was it unpleasant and that was when the local musician was just too loud and it didn't let people have an opportunity to have conversations.  But the food, the TVs for when a game is on, and our second favorite place in Arizona to get wings."}
{"text":"On a normal scale, I'd give it three stars. Recognizing that this is a sports bar though, it's one of the better ones in the area.   There was plenty of seating, and even though the parking lot was packed at 9pm, they still had room for us.   There was a good beer selection at decent prices, and there were a lot of tasty sounding options on the menu. We ordered the buffalo fries with chicken as an appetizer, and the beef fajitas and Friday fish fry special for our entrées. We ordered too much food.   Service: Service was great! Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing, and took the time to explain a few of the menu items to us. It wasn't the fastest service I've had at a sports bar, but given how busy it was that night, it was a reasonable wait time.  Food: Here's where the restaurant lost some of its points with me. The buffalo fries were pretty good, and were honestly the best of the three dishes we ordered.   For the price, the fajitas my boyfriend got were lacking in substance and flavour. I wish they had a more oomph to them. In a normal restaurant this would have been a problem, but in a sports bar? Tolerable. Only three small tortillas came with the meal. There probably needed to be at least five.  My fish fry was a plate of fries, a piece of unidentifiable fried white fish, and a thing of coleslaw. I wouldn't order this dish again. The fries were boring and the pan fried fish lacked any flavour. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it was underwhelming.   Ambiance: This place was packed, both inside and outside, with the basketball game playing on most of the TVs.   If you're ever looking for a decent place to hang out and watch a game, I'd seriously consider coming here."}
{"text":"We were here on 11/5 to catch some NFL games and meet friends.  We had several items including their Arizona smoked wings, salads and their \"carnivore\" pizza .... all were great.  Our waitress was very attentive even though the place was very busy on an NFL Sunday afternoon.  Had some great adult beverage prices too.  A great place to hang out and catch some games."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am so extremely happy with my experience here. Didn't have the baby one night so hubby and I decided to do something more like a bar scene. Was not disappointed. It was my first time here and we cannot wait to go back!!! You have to try the smoked wings. They literally fell off the bone. Chicken tenders were juicy and crispy. Of course, they had a great beer selection. Rebecca was our server, and was absolutely incredible. She knew what to get food and alcohol wise. I also loved that they had a smoking section on the patio. Very hard to find restaurants like that now a days. That was awesome. Steve, he manager, was so friendly and really helped out as well. GREAT experience. And one again, cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time to The Hub.  Table had a variety of food from Pizza, Chicken Tenders, Gluten Free Pasta and the amazing Raspberry Chipotle Smoked Chicken Wings.  Food was very good and the wings were like I said amazing probably the best I ever had.  This restaurant has a full gluten free menu.  Serve and manager had full knowledge of their gluten free process.  They cater for customers with diseases like celiac's.  All the employees were over the top friendly."}
{"text":"I love the selection of Dark beers on draft...the food? Have yet to have something that doesn't leave me coming back for more and I have had just about every item on the menu! The service is friendly and great, love going as a family, with friends or karaoke nights are fun too! Now with their expansion, it just makes it that much better! Great neighborhood bar to hang out at!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a good meal, or just some delicious drinks! Fantastic selection of foods, beers, and mixed drinks. Totally kid friendly... Yet a sports bar /pub atmosphere. Service was very good! Cozy outside seating is nice! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was good, wouldn't know. Server after server walked by and no one said anything! Wasn't busy enough for no acknowledgement. Sorry guys but no thanks."}
{"text":"We went to the location on Sossaman and have been there before for their burgers.  This trip we were both charged .59 cents each for the cheese choice, and I asked for mayo to go on mine with lettuce and tomato, and onion.  I was shocked to see they even charged me .35 for the mayo.  This place is padding the bill with things that normally at other places there is no charge for.  At $9.79 for a burger and fries on the side, there is plenty of profit there without padding the bill with nonsense adds.  Glad I hadn't asked for pickles too, geeze!"}
{"text":"We had the best time after work tonight! Best beer ever! The servers are so much fun. We love to meet for drinks after work"}
{"text":"I came here tonight and ordered a Hub Rita on their happy hour menu, it basically was just lime juice. I don't understand having drink specials for this very reason. I should have just gotten wine, you can't water that down  :("}
{"text":"Absolutely love the HUB!!!! Chris (owner) is always very friendly and makes sure to check on each table during their meal. Service is always impeccable and the food is amazing. I would highly recommend the HUB Club. It's an original twist on the club sandwich and will quickly become your new favorite meal.   5 stars from this family."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good their food is considering the strange location. The restaurant itself is pretty nice inside but the area of town and the strip mall...not so much. I actually never would've realized it was there if a co-worker hadn't recommended it to me. But...glad I know now! Went there for lunch and I ordered the chicken ceasar salad, my husband ordered fish and chips. Both were delicious and the manager was nice enough to bring out a cornbread appetizer since it was our first time there. The server was friendly and attentive and they had plenty of tv's for us to watch every sport our hearts desired on. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Hub hosted a group of gf's of mine for a 30th birthday party and it couldn't have turned out better! Thanks to the manager Steve for making it all happen and huge thanks to Paul our server who made it memorable!!! The food came out quick and hot and Paul did separate checks for us all! He was very patient and knew what he was doing! Me and the girls plan to come back for another girls night soon!! Thanks again to The Hub staff!!!!"}
{"text":"The place has plenty of TV's for football Sunday. The wings are ok too. Kind of a different kind of style with that smokey flavor behind it. Lots of beer and drink choices. The service is ok and there's lots of servers. Even the manager is pitching in which is a good sign of management. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Great gluten free menu one if the biggest we have ever seen. Big portions and good good. Waitresses and staff very friendly and very nice."}
{"text":"We have been to this place three times and it is very good.  The smoked wings are great and burgers are good too!   Service for a party of 8 was wonderful and on spot.   If you are new to the hub they give you a free cornbread to try.   We go everytime we are in town"}
{"text":"Not only were our burgers amazing but the potato skins?? Two full potatoes cut in half!! And the manager heard it was our first time in, so he came over to thank us for choosing their restaurant for lunch and had us try their signature cornbread on the house. That was one of the nicest things I have ever experienced from a restaurant manager or establishment. Absolutely, definitely, positively coming back!! Ignore any low ratings....someone always has to find something to b**** about."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new.  Thank you Yelp!  Walked right in and liked the vibe of the establishment.  We were greeted and offered menus and refreshment in a snap.   We asked about the local beer offering and were given a taster to help make decisions.  Once they asked what we enjoyed they provided offerings that were a hit.  We let them know it was our 1st visit.  Very wide menu and we went with suggestion, while waiting for the meal the manager dropped by your introduce himself and thank us for giving them a chance.  He gave us a little nibble to get started.  Cornbread with jalapeño and topped with butter and syrup.  Very tasty sample.  Well we were both pleased with our choices and will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for a late dinner, last night, just in time for Tuesday Trivia not was a lot of fun. We ranked third and got a $10 gift card out of it.   We had great service from both our server and the trivia master. I stuck with my trusty El Jefe smoked wings, but my husband branched out and tried the Biscuits & Gravy. Being from Tennessee, he is quite picky about how this dish is prepared, but our server was so enthusiastic in backing up their recipe, he went for it. He was not disappointed; he raved about them for the rest of the night.   Seriously, if you haven't been to The Hub, go... NOW!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were craving a burger and The Hub did not disappoint. We went on a Friday around 5pm and the place was packed. Has the standard bar food plus some other selections that help this place stand out. Our waitress was very kind (and very busy) and took the time to chat with us. Found out it was our first time there and brought us out a little treat on the house! Those kind of actions go a long way.  I could definitely see going back for a sports game as this place was full of TV's and seemed to have a good atmosphere. Felt like there were quite a few loyal customers there - which is usually a good sign."}
{"text":"The Hub is an excellent sports bar! They provide SoundDog that gives you a personal sound box on your table for a specific channel playing. So you're able to listen to the game you want.  Their Arizona Smoked wings are the absolute best wings I've ever had - they have great flavor and fall off the bone.  They have a good variety of beers available.  There can be a wait sometimes because it's so busy, but it's worth the wait.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice stop for an outside beverage. Not enough draft beer choices. Hope to try the food soon."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings I've ever had in my whole life. Ever. Arizona smoked wings. I went mild because I was sharing then with a toddler. Will go hot when they're mine all mine!! Ordered a loaded baked potato to share with the baby and was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly delicious it was.....also smoked and that flavor carried thru from skin to center. I can't think of another dining experience where I'd say I'd go back for the baked potato...because seriously who's got a baker that memorable? The Hub does that's who!  Saw some reviews on here talking about inappropriate waitresses that made it sound like an after hours meat market for cheating spouses which made me wonder if it was the type of place I'd want to take my husband and child. Don't judge based on those comments if you see them too. The young lady that served us was helpful,  prompt, professional and great with our kid. Normal family friendly sports bar and grill with killer wings. They have a cool chest full of toys kids can choose from. Nice touch."}
{"text":"My girlfriends love to karaoke here. My fella got food poisoning eating the nachos. Not too many vegetarian options for me to eat there."}
{"text":"This sports bar is about as far away from where I live as possible (ok, maybe not, but it's far!). I came here for a paint night event, which was very fun! I tried their mushroom burger, and it was not bad. The burger was large and juicy, but not the most exciting burger in the world. The pricing was decent. I would come back here if I were in the area to try more of their extensive menu, but based on the burger alone, I would say they're ok."}
{"text":"Was there for Friday night Happy Hour with a group of friends and Homer was our waiter ( he was a ninja) always there to fill drinks & answer questions about food. Drinks were great! The food was great and  the atmosphere was very fun! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is.. customer service is terrible here..   We wanted a table on the patio. Once we were seated, we basically were never acknowledged after that. We had to flag down at least three people to see if they were even going to come help us. The same hostess that seated us, walked by and asked if we have been helped. Nope. We honestly should have left. All we wanted was some drinks and an appetizer.   We ended up ordering the buffalo chicken dip. It was a bit spicy and dry. I wasn't a big fan of it.   I honestly wish that they didn't change the bar since I really enjoyed it when it used to be Mad Dogs. We probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is usually fairly decent (for Mesa) but not too happy tonight.  The Hub Club is not a Club as advertised, more like a heavy, greasy grilled pork sandwich.  Beer was stale, service mediocre."}
{"text":"Terrible service, ordered the Philly Steak Sub and it was the worst I've ever had. Bread was BONE DRY!! Go there for drinks and order 2 drinks for yourself because you'll be waiting a very long time for someone to help.  I'll never go there again. Way too many other places to visit."}
{"text":"I was dining alone so I chose to sit at the bar. 2 bartenders made solid eye contact with me but not one greeted me or said \"be with you in a minute\". After submitting my drink order I'm the one who suggested I get a menu. Didn't start off the greatest. Ordered their cubano which I've had plenty of back in NY. This cubano was not served in a panini fashion as they typically are but more for a thicker bread that was not heated. The pork was dry and bread didn't make it any better. The French fries were the highlight of the meal and it should never go that way. The gin and tonic I ordered was ok but when ordering never asked if I wanted top shelf or well... he just assumed."}
{"text":"This is becoming one of our favorite stops. We had dinner last night and there was a little mix up in our meal but Steve went out of his way to make sure everything was corrected immediately. Nice place, great atmosphere and lots of friendly people.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this a five star merely for the smoked wings. With rasp chipotle sauce. They were nice big wings. And ordered by weight. (About 10 to a pound)  the meat fell off the bone! Haven't had that good of quality wings in a long while. Big place with lots of seat and lots of tvs. Nice clean bar even though a Cardinals game just got over. Nice fast service. We will be back for some of those wings!!"}
{"text":"This place is just hit or miss on the service. Just finished lunch with the family. Two kids meals the chicken tenders looked burnt along with my smoked wings. Meat was so so on the inside but this should have never got the floor by a supervisor. We spent twice as long waiting for service after food arrived then anything else. Waitress lost out on another order of a beer and kids didn't get refilled either. Appears the struggle here is the same. Mad Dogs had better service all around."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and enjoyed our early evening. We were warned about the wild crowd on the patio but was good until about 7. Ordered a pound of wings to go but after getting home looked small. We have a food scale and after weighing the wings 14.1 oz. basically got screwed out of two wings after taking one off the scale to see the difference. Just to add salt to the wound no carrots or celery even requesting. Our bill wasn't cheap either.  Love this place but just like the Stapley location they need some Management to try see what's going on."}
{"text":"Been five or so times now. Keep wishing the food was better, and I keep trying new things, but still haven't had a great meal - mediocre at best. I hear the wings are good, but I'm just not a wings person. I think the reason I've kept coming back is because the menu sounds so promising and ambitious, but the execution is anything but.  Beer list is extensive and good, and the atmosphere is awesome with plenty of televisions to enjoy your favorite sporting event.  Service, as others have mentioned, is really hit or miss, despite having what always appears to be an ample number of staff on hand.  Come here for drinks and fun, eat dinner/lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great drink specials and decent food.  Loved the hot smoked wings!!!  Also, loved the change to a more family centric atmosphere.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"The plates are huge. I definitely recommend sharing. I got the beer cheddar soup. It was awesome. And the 10 grilled cheese which was ok to much bread in my opinion but it was ok. Atmosphere is great for sports. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Food was a little pricey but it was good, no shortage on TVs, no pool tables or dart boards"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best wings ever this is the place!! The smoked wings are so tender the meat falls off the bone, delicious sauces to pick from too. And don't get me started on their grilled fish tacos! I dream about them! We drive a good 30 minutes and it's worth it every time! I can never decide between the two but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best place to go if you want a laid back but fun environment. My sister and I go here when we need a \"bad mom's\" night out. The food is always great, the service 9/10 times is quick and the drinks are never watered down. It's great to go Saturday's for reverse happy hour and the DJ. I've even taken my special needs daughter there for dinner and she was happy. Our server brought out a replacement plate of (plain) edamame for my daughter, who is very sensory driven, when my daughter saw that it had pepper and a sauce on it. Our server was very sweet about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. First it's right around the corner from my house which makes it so very convenient, but the food is amazing! I've never had a bad meal. They have an amazing selection of craft beers on tap & available. And son adores the treasure box - bonus not having to be the angry mom making him finish his meal....he wants to finish to earn his prize.  Tonight was an extra special experience while making his rounds, the manager, Robert, stopped and asked how everything was - then noticed my son only had a basket of fries in front of him (my son had finished his mini corn dogs already) & my vocal son told him he love the corn dogs but they were all gone and he wanted more. I asked if we could order just another order of corn dogs  (minus fries) and he responded with \"I don't know, but I'll figure it out and I will take care of it.\" Not only did he take care of it - but he didn't charge us! This is an awesome example of how the staff at the Hub go above & beyond to make sure that the customers' experience is exemplary.   I can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"If I could do no stars I would website says open until 2am but the doors are locked wtf"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, service was great, nothing bad to say about him establishment it's self. However there was a man going around selling raffle tickets for a \"youth charity\" and as a table we paid 45.00 in good faith. Then there is no raffle and the guy is gone. So all I can say is DO NOT BUY tickets. We complained and they mentioned it is not the first time this has been an issue."}
{"text":"We stopped by here with a party of 10 people and sat at our table for 15 minutes without getting offered a water. No servers even acknowledged that we were there. The servers were more concerned about standing around and talking to each other. The manager was standing at the bar watching basketball. When we finally had enough and walked out, he tried to tell us to stay. We decided to leave and go get fast food.   I went back today to try again with some co-workers and service wasn't any better.  She took our order, brought us our food and didn't come back to check on our table until we were totally finished. Never even received a refill on a drink.   If you're looking to get good service, then stay far from this establishment. Food was ok as long as you finally get to that point."}
{"text":"Not happy at all!!! Place looks real nice but that's as far as it goes. Some health issues on the food.. Don't like posting this but watch what you order NO MUSSELS!!!  Or SHRIMP.."}
{"text":"I have loved this place ever since they opened their second location here on Stapley, but today I tried the fish and chips for the first time here and they were awesome! Great tartar sauce too! We sat outside because it was a gorgeous outside and our server was Darrian! She rocked--thank you!"}
{"text":"Good food and cocktails!! I mad the mistake of getting the Carne Asada Fries when they were on special and now I have dreams about them, yet they have not returned to the menu...it's a very sad sad thing.  However the Fish and Chips I had the second time were fantastic!! Crispy breading and good flaky fish!  The Adult Root Beer Float is a fun and delicious drink! The root beer plays really well with Fireball and the creaminess from the ice cream makes it all blend together."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to eat and drink.  I stopped in last week to eat there and instantly fell in love with this place.     The service was excellent.   My waiter constantly had refills and recommended what to eat.  I ordered the calzone, mushroom burger and traditional hot wings.  My waiter said they had a jalapeño cheddar bun.  I had to try it.  It was fresh bread and the burger had to of been Angus.  I'm from Illinois and know my fresh beef.  The wings were perfect the calzone was as well.  I loved the environment and even the General Manager Chris came out and asked how it was going and I just had to comment on how great everything was.    Everything is so clean plus they have so many TVs the staff was so friendly.  The bathrooms were very clean as well.    Just went back yesterday ( May 18th ) and tried the smoked wings Cajun flavor and HOLY SHIT THEY WERE GOOD!.  Plus the service was excellent once again.    So 2 out of 2 times iv been there absolutely perfect time!    This is for sure my new spot and even going to get in touch with Chris the General Manager to do something there with my family that Flys in to see me.   I live in queen creek and have no problem driving 40 minutes to eat there.  Best place hands down!"}
{"text":"The only reason this is even getting a 1 star is because the food was good. For starters I met my friends there 10 minuets before their happy hour ended, surprisingly the server showed up 1 minute after and when I ask her if i made it in time she says \"I'm sorry but your 1 minute late\". I bit my tongue and ordered anyway.     Next I asked if they excepted the New Times I'm a Crafty Bastard card, the server took my card and said ill check... 15 minuets later i finally got my beer i ordered but i did not get my card back. I had to ask the server for my card back and if they accepted it. She brought my card back and said no they don't. I went to the New Times web site to check and sure enough the sight says they except it. So I brought it to the managers attention and she states she never heard of it but would honor the discounts, ok maybe they redeemed themselves. WRONG! So wanting to take advantage of the discount we got a craft beer, 15 minuets later we get that beer only this time the server throws the entire glass of beer on my wife (probably another mistake). They came back with towels and in trying to defuse the situation the manager is telling us reasons of why we should come back other days of the week, Oh and don't worry she will comp the beer that they spilled.     This was a horrible experience and at least me and 3 other people I know will never go back. I have nothing good to tell my other friends about this place all because of the way this was handled. If anyone of importance to the company reads this then they should question the people in charge at the time (they should know exactly who we were). But instead there will probably be some kind of automatic response to this saying to call them because they are concerned.   I will finish this by saying I have never stiffed a server before,  but this time if I'm going to pay full price for this crappy experience then someone else should pay also."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot. Love the smoked wings (but tended to be burned lately). Food is generally good. Place seems to be getting dingy & dirty. Last few times there were so many flies inside that we've stopped going :("}
{"text":"Three of us went to dinner today, and overall it was a good experience.  Our server, Chelsea, was amazing! Very attentive and friendly.  We started with Brussels sprouts and stuffed chili peppers, both were delicious.  I had fish tacos,  and my friends had wings.  The tacos were ok, not the best I've had but not bad either. The wings had a nice smoke flavor and were good sized,  9 in a pound.  We each had a drink as well,  and lucky for us the craft beers were on special tonight! $3.50 for a pint on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Hub today! And to say it was a hot spot would be a understatement;) lots of family's after soccer games and couples enjoying a Saturday lunch , A wide variety of patrons all enjoying the beautiful weather and amazing food. The restaurant inside was full so we chose to eat outside under the misters with a great group of people around us all friendly and each one enjoying their food and amazing cocktails  . We decided on the Holy Bacon Batman Burger triple the bacon bacon aioli with delicious caramelized onions and Swiss cheese to share and a order of the Exploding Cheddar Potatoes . Both were so good , juicy Burger tons of flavor and did I mention the BACON . The exploding Cheddar Potatoes are thinly sliced and fried with bacon on the bottom the Potato's cheese more bacon with sour cream . This is a must stop in for anyone wanting a great meal good atmosphere and friendly waitstaff"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer to this location, and everyone I've ever brought here and shared meals with enjoys it. The service is always wonderful, doesn't matter which server we have, the food is always delicious, and it's just a good time every time. Definitely a place I would suggest to anyone looking for a good place to stop for some food and a drink!   A special thank you to James for being a gentleman, even after I spilled my water on you!"}
{"text":"What can I say... The food is pretty good which is why I came back two more times, yet I didn't learn the first time and thought I'd give it another go. But the service and management are not the best. Don't get me wrong, the server's are generally nice and attentive, and maybe the issue is their kitchen and not server's mistakes. But everytime I dined-in there were significant issues with my order. They barely seem to have an interest to try and make it right. On my last visit, the order was so bad that nothing we ordered was correct. We actually seemed to have been served someone else's order possibly, maybe?? However, when the server sent over their manager they handed me a card with the corporate number and said have a good day. They made zero attempts to correct the order so we walked out without eating. Keep in mind this was after being there for over an hour waiting to be served, etc. Seriously bad response and so I never returned after this.   Also, I hate how at certain times of the day they close off sections of the restaurant so as luck would have it, when we went in we would be forced to sit in the loudest section with the most obnoxious bass pulsing speakers. This happened mid day on a weekend or after dinner time on a weekday. I was not going for the bar atmosphere and should have an option for seating.    All in all, decent food but terrible experience."}
{"text":"My buddy and I had thought that this mad dogs saloon place had become another local bar. After arriving we were surprised to see it had become a Hub... I had a experience at the other location but told myself I would give this one a try. We sat at a table where you share with other people and its actually not that bad, the place had been remodeled nicely (bathrooms are amazingly clean and remodeled also). It feels more of a restaurant then a bar though.   Our waitress for the night was Mandy. She is a big part of the reason this place got 5 stars. She was super nice and very quick with getting our order. She did spend extra time at our table explaining foods to my buddy, which I thought was great customer service. Unfortunately, a lady from a table next to us must had forgotten to take her Zoloft and was apparently angry for the extra time Mandy spent with us explaining foods, so she came up and was extremely rude to the waitress and went off on her. My buddy and I looked at each other because it was our fault Mandy was tied up with us... Mandy still put a smile on her face and helped the rude, inappropriate lady out so props to Mandy.   My buddy and I ordered the smoked wings and OMYLANTA they were the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. The chicken falls right off the bone and the flavor was amazing, after eating the food we had decided we will be coming back next week. Seriously its hard to get great service and bomb chow, so we decided we will watch the Cardinals game here and ask to sit in Mandys section... My buddies wings were not enough for him so he got some clam tomato soup thing. I don't know what it was but he was telling me it was so good he wanted to make sweet sweet love to it. HAHA!   Overall its a great place to watch the game, get great food and service. I wont take stars away for the experience from the paragraph below.   **One thing I would tell people to be careful with is the guy selling raffle tickets for jerseys and a bike. I asked what the money goes to (usually charities) and he really never explained, mostly tapped dance around. He did say it pays for his airfare to come to AZ from Oregon to raflfle jerseys for the owner and his food and drinks while here.... Sounds like it funds his vacations. After asking him more, he told me that the The Hub is setting up a foundation (which I couldn't find anything online for)... Then he told me it goes to pay for team league fees... I asked if it was for sponsored The Hub teams of local childrens teams. He never really answered that either... He \"raffled\" off 3 jerseys however we were sitting inside and he only came around 1 time to read off numbers. How legit this is not for me to say.. Sounds shiesty as hell though."}
{"text":"This place wasn't the best before, but my wife and sister wanted to go and I won't turn down beer so rolled along. We walked into a pretty hoppin Friday night and found a standing table that was completely open. We stood there for 10 min with no one asking us about drinks or anything. I went to the bathroom and came back to a server kicking us out of the table... I asked him what the problem was, he said the table is resevered for a group that was outside smoking.... SERIOUSLY!!! I asked him if he was serious.... He said yes then told us we would have to go to the front and put our name down and wait for a table..... WTF! This blew my mind, I have never been told at any bar that I have to put myself in a waiting list to have a Damn beer.... We ended up leaving and going down the street to a better spot. If your not a regular, or have reservations for a beer, do yourself a favor and,keep driving on. They officially lost a customer last night."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too new to Arizona and should expect mediocre. Maybe I work too quickly and the majority of customers are on laid back time. If this is the contingency of restaurant etiquette, then cool. If not, read on.  I am the type of person who pays for experience.  I'm a great cook and I have a Costco card, so if I wanted unlimited booze and a meal, I have a house for that. I am on a business trip and I have never before walked out of a place refusing to tip. (I mean, that's what business travel expenses are for, right?) The gentleman next to me offered to pay my tip because I said I wouldn't.   I sat at the bar because I was alone. I had a couple of guys next to me out for a drink as well. One man sat down 5 minutes after I did and immediately received a coaster. I still waited for acknowledgement. If you want to fire me up real quick, go ahead and have someone POINT OUT TO ME the lack of acknowledgement. Homeboy did JUST that. He asked if I was drinking or ordered anything. I told him Nope! Sat down before him. Because I finally was graced with someone's presence, I quickly made sure I got a menu and my drink order. I ordered the $5 special.  Drank my drink. Now time to order. Since it seems like people are assigned to work the bar and it all goes to a kitty, I guess all service must stay subpar. I watched each bartender gracefully ignore eye contact with everyone because they are just \"so focused\" on their tasks. (I'm looking at you, Kayla, as an apparent regular tried to say hi) I got my meal. I was not checked up pm the entire time. In fact, didn't even speak to the same bartender twice.   Now here I sit with a plate and glass full of ice. A bartender came and grabbed my plate. She circled back about 2 minutes later and asked if I wanted a drink, while in half sprint to the other end of the bar. I'm not asking her to stop, but again, asking for acknowledgement for my business. Since I was so uncomfortable just sitting there, I decided on a to go order. Now, because I complained about the wait time on my to go order, I can share the information. I walked out of the bar at 7:53. The order for a slice of cake was at 7:38. This bartender felt the need to correct my assumption that it was a 25 minute wait and that it's standard to wait as long as I did for dessert. This is new to me.  Food was above average. I actually combed the menu making plans for another meal there until I was just punched hard with the lack of service. The thing I find so compelling is how every review on this place that complains about service is written by a female. If that's the case, I am so sorry. I will make sure I come with a man next time to be an equal. I found it so delightful to be corrected by the bartender who showed up at the end of my experience, to then tell me I'm wrong.   I'm all out of facks  (you know what I mean ) . I drank my empathy for the bartenders on staff tonight when I had to chew on ice for something to wash it down."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Decent crowd for a Sunday lunch without being loud. Both of our kids ate free since we got burgers. The kids got grilled mac n cheese sandwiches and the portions were huge so they have dinner tonight too.  We both had the Devil burger. Honestly is there any better burger than one served on a pretzel roll? The burger was good although a little over medium. A heads up the jalapeno on this includes seeds for those of you who may not like that extra kick.  We tried the Honey hot smoked wings. Very nice flavor, not over or under coated and easy to eat as the meat was ready to fall off the bone.  For the drinks we got a peach ale, obsidian stout and a mimosa. The stout and ale were great on tap and the mimosa was poured with a heavy hand, woo! All were on sale for $3-$3.50.  For the sports fans, they had enough tvs to cover 3-4 games per wall.  Lastly all the servers seemed very nice, and our waitress helped the kids pick out the free toys they get for coming in."}
{"text":"Just around the corner from my place, I have over looked this establishment every time Ive passed it. In dire need of a good burger and too lazy to go any further, I decided to step in and see what their menu has to offer.  Let me tell you, this place did not disappoint!  Ordered the Popper Burger which on their menu is described as, \"house made panko crusted cream cheese & jalapeños, raspberry chipotle jam, pear slaw.\" Ordered that on a pretzel bun and bam! My obsession with this specific burger was born.  On another occasion I did order their calzone which was delicious as well. I was a bit disappointed with their wings. One order of our wings was over cooked and burnt but the other order was cooked perfectly and slid off the bone.  As for the overall taste of the wings, it was alright. I will have to pass on their wings but I will be back for their burgers and other items on the menu.  Excited that this place is near by!"}
{"text":"We went at like 7 for dinner on a Friday. We were seated quickly. The waitress came quickly, took our order, and the food and drinks came out fairly fast. Then our waitress literally disappeared.  They were not short staffed. In fact, if say overstaffed.  They spent a ton of time talking to each other.  I was there for nearly in hour and she never took a 2nd drink order. Let me reiterate,  1 hour, Friday at 7pm, one freaking beer. That's unacceptable. When I finally got to ask for the check she asked, incredulously,  \"What, no 2nd beer?\" After an hour? Insult to injury. My food stunk. I got the Hub board, which is like a meat plate with a kind of fondue dip. The dip was OK but the meat was completely hammered.  The sliced sausage was so overcooked it bordered on jerky. This place could be so cool, especially if you have kids, since they give away toys. But they fell really flat.   Speaking of family friendly... there was a couple basically dry humping in a deserted corner of the patio... which happened to be right outside our window."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, after we left a different bar and grill where we witnessed two drunk patrons sloppily making out and dry humping each other on the outdoor patio furniture in the smoking area as we were walking up.  (Talk about a huge red flag about the standards of a place.)  Anyway, while were there drinking our ONE drink and plotting a quick escape we looked up on Yelp for a suitable replacement bar and grill and found this little gem just a few miles away.  What a huge difference!  Thank Glob we left that den of iniquity and headed over here.  We shared an order of Stuffed Green Chilies ($9) and their Southwest Chicken Ramen ($10.59) and both dishes were not only a nice break from the traditional bar fare, but also very tasty.  He had a beer and commented that he was pleased to see how many taps they had at the bar and I departed from my traditional margarita and had a Bloody Mary, which wasn't bad.  Our server was prompt and friendly and we had zero complaints about anything here.  We will definitely be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Get the wings. Best wings I've ever had in my life. Smoked grilled and retossed medium...you will love them over any wings you ever had"}
{"text":"This experience was horrible. It was the grossest bar food we'd ever had. My wife's soup was inedible. Everything was cold, including the gloppy cheese dip and the black bean dip. Yuck. The bread sticks were okay. We complained, and the manager addressed it, but it was so bad we'll never be back.  When food is that bad, all the way around, that means there's no quality control, from the cooks all the way to the waitress, nobody cared enough to check the food.  To my fellow vegetarians, there's not much here for you. I usually take typical bar/tavern food and make it veggie, but there weren't many options to do that here.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has such great potential, but it just misses the mark.  I had the smoked chicken wings, fries and a beer.  My wife had the fish tacos.  The wings are really special.  They were tender, smoked, and had okay flavor (I had the 'hot' flavor).  The fries were meh.  My wife said the tacos were really good, but one of them didn't get the sauce and was kinda bland (it was the first one, so at first she thought that's how they are).    The Good: Great beer selection.  Good service (unlike Hertz).  They found out we were fist timers, so the manager brought us a chili corn bread, covered in butter and honey -- it was awesome, and that was a nice touch.  Wings were excellent and unique.  Not Great: The place doesn't have a personality yet.  It feels like a chain.  It'll get there with time, though, I'm sure. My 10 wings came with 9 drummettes and 1 wing, which was a bummer b/c the wing section is my favorite.  Three stars b/c we probably won't go the distance (from Gilbert) to eat here, but we would stop in if we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Walked in and was given a rose and wished a happy Valentine's Day, then sat down and was told by the waitress that I get a complimentary glass of champagne or mimosa!! Heck ya.. I have always loved the food and service here for football games but this is so awesome.. I will continue bringing my business back to the hub..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Monday afternoon. Half price liquor on Mondays! Got a few $3 magaritas. We got the Green Chilie cheezy bread which has a similar flavor to Rattle Snake bites from Texas Road house but this cheezy bread is packed with more flavor. My wife had the Hawiian Calzone which was so amazing and big my wife wanted to finish it because it was so good but there was to much! I had the Smoked hot wings, the blast of flavor was so unique its my new favorite wings of all time. I love wings and always get wings from whatever resturaunt we go to. Bufflo Wild Wings, ATL Wings, Long Wongs, Native, Wing Street are all good wings BUT they are not as amazing as these smoked wings! Love it. Found a new hangout to watch some football and eat some amazing wings and food and drinks all day long. Oh and the service was beyond good. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice and both times received very good service as well as exceptional food.  The first time I got the peanut butter burger and it was very good, but the second time I got the hub double cheeseburger which was fantastic.  So much meat, cheese, and goodness that I was regretting not being able to complete it after we had appetizers.  Atmosphere is very relaxed with TV's inside and it is very much a bar/grill setting with the food impressing us each time we visited.  Looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Bunch of fucken raciest assholes work here. Wouldn't even serve me because Im asian. Can't say anything about the food since no one would take my order but its probably as bad as the service"}
