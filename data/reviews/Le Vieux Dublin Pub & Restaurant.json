{"text":"We enjoyed the Dublin pub with it's selection of beer and atmosphere. Flet sorry for Alison as she was the only server / bar tender in the place with about 40 people. Had to open the downstairs area as so many people arrived. She did a great job in covering it all. Only problem is that we split a dinner and they charged $2.75 to split a meal. Do not think this is fair at all. Great service and busy for 6PM on a Sat night."}
{"text":"Food is good but otherwise kind of lame. Usually not a big crowd at night time. Sometimes they have decent music playing"}
{"text":"Ah, the Good Ole--merde, je veux dire \"vieux\"--Dublin. Gotta love the language police. Anyway, Le Vieux Dublin is an authentic Irish pub, name notwithstanding, with lots of crowds and foot-stompin' live music. It's actually not that weird a concept, since the Irish are traditionally one of the four founding cultures of Montreal (hence the shamrock on the official Montreal flag).  While it's a great time inside, Le Vieux Dublin is in a rather dead location, and it's tucked away past a parking lot off University, near René-Lévesque. It's a bit easy to miss as a result, but don't give up..."}
{"text":"Pubs have Atmosphere, Service and Food too!  Atmosphere: The Old Dublin is a pub's pub.  Everything wood, everything with purpose - you walk in you know you're in a pub.  Comfortable and in the middle of the downtown core, a great place to meet with friends to watch the game (any game).    I will go out on a limb here and say that the days of the Old Dublin may be numbered (along with other places in that area) as a huge and very posh condo complex is being built right next door.  This may hark the advent of more upper-end type dinning locations to accommodate the new residence.    Service:  The Staff works hard, so much so they are certainly pushed to the limit on busy nights - but they still maintain composure.  The staff tend to be a little older (i.e. not of the University crowd) and some have been at the Old Dublin for quit some time, and thus give the place a good sense of continuity.  No complaints whatsoever.  Food:  Pub food served in a pub way - plain and simple.  Hit and miss sometimes - but it doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.  Surprisingly - because the cook is Indian - the old dublin has some items on the menu that may surprise you!  Fun place."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but all very honest. Great beer choice. Burgers are a sure bet. The curry is also decent. What you see is what you get which is getting more and more rare these days. Only expect a decent pub with beer and pub food."}
{"text":"If you consider the atmosphere and the interior of other irish pubs around the globe, this one is a weak one. Though you have the large bar and some irish live music, as well as a great choice of beers on the tap, the interior reminds you up to certain grade of any standard northamerican fastfood / deli restaurant. The tables stand rather close to each other to get the maximum seating capability and the floor isn't the typical carpet but a regular floor.  I don't know wether if others see it the same way, but on a wednesday night, when I was there, there were just a handful of customers around. This was actually o.k. for us, as we had to talk some things over. We were a little surprised, as a guitar player startd with some live singing, was this was ok too, as the volume was on a reasonable low level."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar beside drunk off duty staff. Got a beer and then was ignored for about 20 minutes. Finally got food and it was straight out of the freezer and into the deep fryer.   Didn't enjoy a second of my visit. Wish I had gone a little farther to real restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner and a pint or two on a weekday evening.  The pub was quiet and cosy, and the Guinness was quite good. The food was mediocre, so skip eating and just have a beer or two. The beer list was OK, but it would have been nice to see a couple interesting local beers instead of the usual \"Irish Pub Beers\"."}
{"text":"Moyen. Pub irlandais qui a déjà été intéressant, mais qui a perdu de son intérêt. Le fish n' chips est meilleur au Hurley's et au Maclean's. Le service et l'ambiance également."}
{"text":"We recently had a large group in town for a conference and Le Vieux Dublin was where we held our annual party. The staff and management were exceptional and our group (50+) had an amazing time. We basically had an entire section of the bar to our selves, with dedicated staff to our group and the entire night went off without a hitch. Everyone commented on how wonderful the bar was and what a great time they had. I definitely recommend Le Vieux Dublin."}
{"text":"Quick Visit My first time at the Dublin and I was disappointed. We arrived before 930pm and the bartender told us upfront the kitchen was closed. I thought that was highly unusual for a Saturday night. The atmosphere was loud full of people and pleasant. So we stayed for a few very good drinks. The staff was congenial and understanding of the food shortcomings. I will try again on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"As for Irish pubs go, this place was fun, friendly, and had a good vibe. We took over the lower part of the bar and had a great time. The food was really good. A nice variety of traditional and nouveau cuisine.  Big thumbs up. My hats off to the staff for making this place a good spot to watch the Canadiens/Alouettes play."}
{"text":"Fresh breaded mushroom, yummy hard cider, Guinness, decent fish & chips, friendly server.  This place was much better than McLean's pub- it was our second bar right after McLean's pub.    Nothing really special except that.  I could go back but it's not super memorable place or super special.  I won't be sad if I don't have a chance to go back.."}
{"text":"Pub irlandais, qui n'a selon qu'irlandais que le nom, Le Vieux Dublin est essentiellement un place à hamburger. Quoique correct, on y ferait pas de détour pour les manger. Ambiance bruillante et vieillotte, l'endroit gagnerait à être rafraichit. Le service était cependant rapide et efficace."}
{"text":"I've been at the old location, but first time at this location. Pretty jammed for a Monday night.. I guess trivia nights are pretty popular on Mondays.. not just at the Vieux Dublin,  but many other places too.. like the Peel pub etc.. 3 stars because I ordered MEDIUM lamb curry , and it was very mild.. I even asked the waitress if it was for sure MEDIUM and she replied something like \" yeaaa medium is more on the milder side..  \"..... :/.... Really? Come on people, when a customer asks for MEDIUM , he/she expects some kick!! So a heads up Vieux Dublin, either fix the MEDIUM spice level, or tell customers to go HOT if they want ANY kind of kick.. we were in a rush , so I gobbled it up anyway... still pretty tasty. The nachos were good too (fiancé grabbed the nachos). Definitely a congested, 'city like', friendly atmosphere, which I like! I haven't been to Montreal for a little while, but it was somewhat of a tradition to pop in the distinct green, and oddly misplaced( in a parking lot lol) Vieux Dublin with the old man... Wide open and tavern like.. Now, it seems like it succombed to modernization. I guess that's just a personal thing meh.. they lost their \"unique-ness\"."}
{"text":"An Irish pub on Yelp with good reviews?  I'm there.   We stopped in as the snow piled up outside and went straight for the Guinness. After a couple beers we ordered fish and chips. The batter is spot on. It's not too thick, it's crispy, and it had tiny bit of sweetness to it. The fish inside was cooked perfectly. While the chips were tasty, they were small. My colleague suggested that steak fries would be better. He's right.   Guillaume, we had a great time!  Thank you for hanging out with us. J'espère pour vous acheter une autre bière bientôt, mon frère!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after doing the jazzfest as it was the closest pub with  tvs showing the soccer game (Canada - England); good selection of beer but on ordering a cheeseburger I was served it with a default side of the world's worst, greasy, limp, disgraceful fries I've ever had the displeasure to scorn on my plate. The waiter ran away with my plate on asking for my feedback which I gave as I've done here. Avoid anything fried here and ask for salad with your burger."}
{"text":"Vraiment bien situé si vous travaillez autour de Square Philipps, pour faire des 5@7 entre collègues et même rencontrer d'autres personnes si affinités!! Il y a toujours du monde et les gens sont en mode décontractés, cool, discutent de table en table parfois (déjà vu!) Il y a toutes sortes de bières et d'alcool, vous trouverez forcément ce dont vous avez envie! :) Le décor est très sympa, en mode pub irlandais, on s'y sent vraiment bien!! Parfois il y a des live band (le vendredi soir je crois), et il y a beaucoup d'écrans pour regarder les matchs! Bouffe correcte, de pub Service ok, parfois on dirait que la serveuse est en training, donc on lui en veut pas ^^ A essayer si vous êtes dans le coin!"}
{"text":"Great place located in a part of downtown with a wide selection of drinks & food. This place has been around forever. Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This little hidden treasure seems like it's out of place....an authentic Irish pub in the middle of French Canada??? But it made me feel like home, though I was clear across the country....  Pretty much every night that I was over there, this is where my colleagues and I would go. My fellow Seattelite co-worker would always go here in the past for her Scotch. But they had my Hard Cider! I don't remeber what kind it was, but it was different and delicious.   The atmosphere is phenomenal- it's loud and packed like an Irish pub should be. Long bar. Great staff. Gooooooood food. This is definately a party/group place. The have 2 levels- we sat upstairs one night because we couldn't hold a conversation among the loud crowd downstairs, so even though they had it closed off, they let only us go up there giving them the perk of us tipping them well. But- I'd much rather be downstairs most of the time.   I would go back to Montreal for this reason alone."}
{"text":"Really meh.  The food was okay but the service was not good. Half way through out meal we were waiting and waiting when we noticed our waitress sitting at a table eating. Caught us looking for her and finally Gabe us our check. But then went back to eating so we had to walk out bill up to the bar. Fries were soggy and burger was dry. Don't bother unless you just want to have drinks."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went for a few pints after a long day of flying and thought this place was decent.  The beer selection is pretty impressive, with about 16 beers on draft including 8-10 Canadian beers, some of which I had never heard of.  The staff was somewhat friendly, and same with the crowd.  I thought the prices were high, especially for the non-Canadian beers ($8).  There is also a lot of construction on the block, which made it kind of hard to find.  There are many worse places to go for a drink I'm sure, but I'm pretty sure that there are better ones as well."}
{"text":"A group of about 14 of us came here for dinner and drinks to get our night started.  The bartender/waiter informed us the kitchen would be closing soon, but the manager ensured us that we could order dinner.  I think he was happy to accommodate our large group ordering food and booze, and our bill definitely made it worth his while. Anyways, the bartender/waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.  He even drew us a map of the area and gave us a couple good places to check out.  In the middle of dinner, a two-piece band came in and started playing.  And they were playing absolute classics, and they were playing them well - Ring of Fire, Take Me Home Country Roads, Margaritaville, and more. The food was good enough - typical pub food - and the drinks were strong.  A great start to the night."}
{"text":"Fish and chips= AWESOME Beer selection= AWESOME Friendliness of the crowd= NOT SO AWESOME  I popped in to this bar for a quick dinner and one drink solo while shopping in downtown Montreal.  Everywhere I went was jam packed and I didn't have the patience to wait.  I found this bar a few streets over and decided to go in since I didn't see a line out the door as I saw at other bars and restaurants (apparently there was some hockey game on TV).   When I first got to the bar, people were cordial and somewhat friendly.  As the night progressed, people gave me dirtier looks and looked very disinterested in making conversation with me.  I didn't know what was going on and I was starting to get a bit upset, so I decided to finish off my beer and food and hail a cab back to my hotel.  Just as I was about to leave, I asked the bartender in a very nice manner why people were so cold.  She pointed at my shirt and didn't say anything.  Apparently wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers shirt in to a bar while the Montreal Canadiens are getting their asses beat by the Pittsburgh Penguins isn't the way to go about making friends in Montreal."}
{"text":"The way an Irish Pub should be, too bad they had to move out of the old location. It had such character. Food is great. The curry dishes are super."}
{"text":"Good place to stop and grab a beer. They have a large selection of beers on tap!  The service was good. They offered up the happy hour menu even though it wasn't happy hour. We also ordered the nachos with chilli and guacamole. The chilli and guacamole were really good!"}
{"text":"The Old Dub is a long time haven to me. Having spent many, many hours (read $$) their during my college days at the old location.   Since the move to Catchcart - the place has been completely remodeled. Bigger, brighter and great wood accents around the bar and throughout the pub.   Their beer selection is always great. With the classic Irish beers, some Canadian classics and some not so common Canadian West Coast beers.   Lunch times are busy - On a recent visit I reserved a table for 16 people. We had arrived a couple of minutes late, only to learn that a table of 8 had been given away to another group!! The lunch menu is fairly simple: burgers! It's the one item on the place mat that repeats itself. I personally like the Joyce burger (caramalized onions, sweet bell peppers and swiss cheese)  As of Friday April 29th, Liam Callaghen will be leaving The Old Dub.  But honestly - pull up a stool and order a pint of Guinness and enjoy a game or friendly chat with the staff.  JOYCE BURGER = Great ARRIVE EARLY, EVEN WITH A RESERVATION YOU CAN LOOSE YOUR TABLE"}
{"text":"Poor service (the waitress asked if we were eating dinner, took our drink order, then NEVER came back to take our food order) Overpriced and tasteless food. And on top of that-rude customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the Duffy burger and it was amazing! I liked their fries too. They have a really interesting menu, a lot of dishes with curry which I'd go back just to try.   My only gripe would be they don't have a lot of staff (at least when I was there on a Friday after 7PM). The first bar maid was all over the place doing literally everything and she did a great job, I admit.   Once she left the guy was alright but he seemed clunky and a bit of a dope head. My friend ordered a few Irish coffees which each time came with a different consistency. We ordered shots of Jameson and he basically hinted that we should order 6 (the 6th being for him).   Other than that I think I'd go back."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time here on my last visit. It was a great place with a lot of wonderful people lolling around, half in the bag. I started up a long conversation with a dude from Seattle about which is worse: a year in New York or a year in LA. We both agreed New York, largely because the Vegas valve is much closer in the LA scenario.   The selection of beers and ciders is pretty good and though I typically stick to Cider, I did enjoy a couple of lager and had a ball.   The place gets crowded and gets really loud, but it's a fun time still!"}
{"text":"Très bon burger dans une ambiance de pub."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Le Vieux Dublin Pub & Restaurant.  Apparently it's been around for about forty years and is one of Montreal's oldest pubs.  I was in the mood for wings and that's what I ordered.  They were basic ... deep-fried with BBQ sauce on the side.  Patrick was the server and bartender.  He was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Went in at barely 7PM on a Sunday night (the night before Thanksgiving, but still) and there was no one inside but the bartenders. Asked if they were still serving supper and was told that they could order us a pizza or pasta from the Italian joint next door. We passed and ended up at McKibbin's instead. Maybe next time we're in the city we'll give them another shot.  Also of note is that they are opening up in the nearest storefront on the adjoining street, though not sure when. Don't know what the new location will be like."}
{"text":"Overpriced, seating is too crammed up and food was below expectations for the price. The place smells like a pub (as expected). Good for a drink and that's it."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on a lark. Pleasantly surprised to find Indian curries on the menu. And even more surprisingly, the curry was actually better than the fare at a lot of so called Indian restaurant else-where in the world. I had the medium spicy lamb curry which had a thick curry with potatoes and reminded me of home. Absolute comfort food. My wife had the spicy chicken curry which was delicious too. The place had a huge selection of scotches and whiskeys, which we enjoyed on the rock. The lone low point was the Irish coffee which we had ordered two off. They both seemed to have different strength with one being much stronger than the other and the key seemed to be the Irish with the coffee almost as an after thought. All in all, a pleasant experience specially if you love scotch and Indian food."}
{"text":"Gosh, I miss the \"old\" Old Dublin. It just hasn't been the same since they moved into their most recent digs. The older Old Dublin sat like a weird out-of-the-place kid in an empty parking lot , it was smaller, definitely crowded on Friday nights and St. Patrick's day, but it was full of character, had a spot in the corner for musicians and was the best place to sight the laddies from U2 long before they became the billionaire rock gods they are now.  Now it looks like every other generic Irish pub in Montreal. New wood paneling, new seats, new tables - gentrification has hit Montreal really hard in recent years and like other cities, everything is starting to look like monotonous and the same, generic skyscrapers, generic condo buildings and generic restaurants and pubs. The same has happened to the Old Dublin unfortunately. You can still get a pint of Guinness and a burger. You can still meet friends here after work. They still have live music, but the magic of old is long gone."}
{"text":"This is a great English style or Irish style pub as you can see in my photos. They have great beer selection and nice food menu (which is around 15$ not very cheap). They tend to be packed during lunch time as early as 11:30 so plan ahead. Also the food looks great but I once had the veggy-burger and its over priced and not that good, I advise you to take something else."}
{"text":"Un pub n'a jamais besoin d'être compliqué ou fancy. C'est le cas ici au Vieux Dublin. J'y suis allé pour prendre une bière après une soirée au cinéma et c'était bien tranquille, sans prétention, et sans fla fla. Le service a été un peu lent, mais dans un pub avec un seul serveur/bartender, je comprends pourquoi ça arrive, surtout un mardi soir. L'endroit aurait peut-être besoin d'être rafraîchit côté déco, mais en même temps, je pense que ceux qui adore cet endroit, l'aime pour sa simplicité. Ici, c'est une bonne bière et de la bonne compagnie qui sont les éléments importants. Pour la bière, j'ai été satisfaite et pour la compagnie, j'ai bien aimé les grosses banquettes qui permettent d'être une bonne gang assise ensemble en \"cercle\" ce qui rend la conversation beaucoup plus plaisante quand on est plusieurs. Par contre, j'ai l'impression que si j'y allais seule ou avec une copine, ça n'est pas la meilleure ambiance. C'est plutôt un bar de gars, à l'irlandaise, donc pas mon genre, mais pas mauvais non plus. Simplement pas à mon goût."}
{"text":"We just arrived in town and stopped here for our first beverage/meal.  The workers seemed to know several of the patrons.  This, in my view, is a \"hole in the wall\" type place where I'm from.  We ordered a Maker's and a half and half.  The makers was truly a 1 oz drink, but my beer was perfect.  I ordered a burger which came with fries, and my wife ordered an extra order of fries.  The burger came out well done, which is fine, and the fries were good.  The burger was very bland, no seasoning at all.    The beverages were good.  The entertainment came as we were eating (guy with a guitar), and in this venue, that would be perfect.  There were about 20-25 people in here, so as a neighborhood bar, I'll give it high marks.  The food wasn't the best, but it hit the spot after getting off an airplane.  Overall for us it was just OK.  If you live or work in the neighborhood, though, it looked like a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere.  A pub with several levels that divides up the space to watch sports or get together for drinks without those two things coming into conflict.  The walls are lined with whiskey boxes and the space has a sense of history; like it's much older than it likely is.  The selection on tap is decent, the selection of whiskey is better.  I can't comment on the food except to say the kitchen was closed at 10:30pm.  Given this is in such a vibrant city, this made no sense and wasn't expected."}
{"text":"Wow, now I know why this place gets such poor reviews. I stopped in for lunch and the place was packed. Funny, though my order for a burger and fries took almost no time to arrive. The bun was stale, the patty had obviously been sitting and the fries were old. Then the bar tender hassles me about using a credit card. Never again Dublin, never again."}
