{"text":"We have been coming for many years. Sometimes it can be very quiet. This time we went for the thanksgiving brunch and there were quite a lot of ppl! Juices and tea/coffe included. Delish food! Fresh seafood including lobsters crab legs oysters. No sashimi though. Special thanksgiving mains including turkey....so juicy...how do they make it so juicy...I ate a ton of that. Desserts were a bit weak but I didn't have room left anyways. Miss the pasta station though, it was one of my fave parts of the buffet. Free parking. Had a lovely time here, was so stuffed though."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here, just few blocks from my home. I'm coming back here with my family and friends."}
{"text":"I don't really want to waste the space to review this spot, but I have to :)   Food is absolutely awful and ridiculously expensive. One of the worst breakfasts I ever had.   The service is excellent, however you go to a restaurant first and foremost for the food, so not much of a saving grace.   As the hotel charged for parking, please note that you can get your ticket validated at the restaurant, if you have the misfortune of eating there."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for Sunday brunch! They have a great variety of food with 4-6 main dishes, seafood, salads, breakfast items & desserts. We've always had top notch service from the staff and they are always very accommodating & helpful when there is an allergy concern or question. I've been to places where they have no clue about the menu and i need to wait 20-30 min for someone to get help from the kitchen. At Whitesides there is always someone nearby to answer any questions. The food is always fresh, warm & topped up regularly. Great place for large groups and to celebrate special occasions such as Mother's Day/Father's Day, Easter brunch. At Christmas they have all the fixin's in addition to 4-6 International dishes etc. The pricing is a bit higher than a few other hotels  we've tried out for brunch in York Region, but they do offer more variety than some places and they are still less expensive than the downtown hotels. I just wish they had better pricing for kids because my 3 & 6 year old don't eat enough to justify the kids pricing. We've also eaten at the Whitesides for dinner from their a la carte menu and had a wonderful experience too. Steak dinners with wine - steaks were cooked perfectly. If i were to complain about 1 thing, it would be the noise level. It is right near the pool which is on the lower level, but it is all an open area. While you're having brunch, lunch or dinner you can hear all the commotion of kids & adults in the pool."}
{"text":"I wish I could say something better about Whitesides.  I know, it's a restaurant in a hotel, what can you expect?  Quite a lot, actually.  Unfortunately, it didn't really hold up.  I will say that the staff were all, without exception, extremely friendly and courteous.  The breakfasts here are pretty standard, with a selection of buffet items like pancakes, French toast, bacon, sausage, cereals and breads/bagels/muffins, fruits, an omelet station, etc.  Everything was just about as expected. Meaning, if you've been to a breakfast buffet at another mid-level hotel, this will all look quite familiar.  I ate dinner here once, ordering the special for that day. It was a 10 oz. NY Strip that came with a salad, veggies, and french fries.  The steak was cooked to an exact medium well, which would have been great except for the fact that I had ordered it medium rare. The vegetables (sliced carrot, broccoli, and cauliflower) were okay but a little undercooked, and the fries were... just... fries. Oddly, they had put down a bed of french fries on the plate and then kind of just tossed the steak on top of it.  When all is said and done, I can say that nothing that I had here was outright bad.  It just didn't hold up to the pricing ($26 for the dinner, $20 each day for the breakfast; thankfully the breakfasts were included in my quote for the room)."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I can just survive on beer alone! But I need food, so I ended up ordering and eating mediocre food instead of The Boss (64 oz Jug of Beer) at Whitesides Terrace Grill inside Delta Toronto East.  Burger with Fries ($12) is not overly expensive for a hotel restaurant. It looks ok.. but the patty tasted bland...like eating cardboard.... The garnish tasted much better than the burger itself..  Now I know I should just order the beer.. at least I would be happier and have the Jug to take home!!!"}
