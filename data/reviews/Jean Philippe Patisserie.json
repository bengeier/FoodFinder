{"text":"Words can't explain how this great place. Stoped by before checking and wow I'm glad I did! To start of the sandwiches are amazing but the dessert left me speechless oh and did I mention draft COFFEE! I would give this place 10 starts.  Must go if you love sweets just saying!  I previously reviewed this thinking it was the location at the aria so I went to the biallgio one this one was horrible the crepe tasted like j opened a bottle of nutellla so gross!"}
{"text":"Oh yes.  Delightful.  Breakfast at the Patisserie Jean Philippe... located inside the Bellagio Hotel... offers a wide range of selections for not-just breakfast but lunch as well and any number of appropriate snacking moments in-between.  My usual is a ham and cheese croissant, OJ and coffee.  But what ho?  Those cinnamon rolls look awfully good... with a thick shmear of buttery, sugary goodness slathered on top.  And maybe a crepe?  A Nutella crepe?  Yeah I think maybe so... just to warm up the old boiler... hey is that gelato?  Dulce de leche gelato?  well maybe just a small scoop.  No small scoops?  Okay, pile it on there, ma'am!  Wow is that gelato good.  So rich...  So sweet...  So right next to all those pastries.  Do I dare compound my gluttony with a pastry?  I suppose I should man up or or Chef Maury, possessed of his \"Meilleur Ouvrier\" tricolor collar will accuse me of being a \"leetle bit girly, avec un appetit comme une oiseau\"  Well that freakin' tears it, chef.  Gimme a black forest ham and gruyere crepe and a chocolate eclair, a blueberry danish and another latte.  And maybe some of the carrot cake with the decadent frosting and why not a couple of boxes of chocolate orange cookies and a bag of the marshmallows in assorted flavors to eat in the ambulance on my way to the hospital.  EMTs gotta eat too, right?  They might have to pry the confections from my cold dead hands, but given enough time at Jean Philippe a more likely scenario may never emerge.  I will say this.  If you have anything resembling a sweet tooth and you visit Las Vegas without making a pilgrimage to Patisserie Jean Philippe, God doesn't have enough lightning bolts with which to strike you down.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Un maitre patissier au pays des casinos, dans l'un des plus rafiné. Les gâteaux sont excellents, les sandwichs également. Vous voudrez tout goûter. Comptez 7$ de gâteau, 9 à 11$ le sandwich bon et frais. Ensuite, vous pourrez vous jeter sur les excellents chocolats, la spécialité. Ne manquez par la plus grande fontaine au chocolat du monde, oeuvre du maitre des lieux. A ne pas manquer, sous aucun prétexte!"}
{"text":"The quality of the chocolate and pastries is amazing but it's expensive. If I wasn't in vacation I wouldn't spend much money here. As for the sandwiches, it's quality but they should give more meat on a sandwich due to the price.  I would think this place has more people around it but it's a decent amount for the area. However, this place I always make a stop when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced breakfast in LV that was actually quite tasty as well.  Definitely try the savory crepes - they're huge and could easily feed two people.  They also have hot and cold sandwiches and quiche which have garnered good reviews, but would try a crepe over these.  They also have a yummy almond croissant - buttery, flaky, and full of almond, although much larger than a normal croissant...this could also easily feed two people at least.  There is a chocolate fountain that was drawing a lot of attention a la Willie Wonka ... Many tourists and kids gaping and snapping pics, but was personally not overly impressed and more nauseated (and I do love chocolate).  Drawbacks: extremely long wait during peak hours or holidays.  Wait was more than 1 hr just to order.  Also, the line was awkwardly wrapping around the crepe station, where gawkers were also gathered to watch the crepe making."}
{"text":"Place looks amazing. It is heaven for a sweet tooth people... :-) All the deserts are beautiful and tasty. It is given that youll have to wait in a line for a little bit but it is worth it.   I ordered vanilla souffle crepes and I barely finished it, serving was pretty big. Prices are little high as well."}
{"text":"We bought two desserts - chocolate eclair and triple chocolate. Did not like the eclair as much as the triple chocolate. It was hard to cut and did not taste fresh. Have had better desserts before. If you are in the area then it is ok to get a dessert from here but making a special trip just to get desserts was not worth it."}
{"text":"I thought it was super pricey but what do you expect in a resort with a casino. The food was really good though. We got 2 build your own omelettes and they were made fresh to order. They were really good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pastries you just can't go wrong with anything at this place. My personal favorite is the triple chocolate pastry. On busy days you have to get there early because sometimes later in the day they will run out of the more popular items. The location inside Aria is a lot less busy than Bellagio so if you are just looking to get food and not stare the chocolate fountain I recommend going to Aria."}
{"text":"This is a great little pastry shop! I love the decorations - I marveled at the fancy cakes on display and the chocolate river in the ceiling. There are long lines and seats are scarce, but eating here is totally worth it! The salmon sandwich was amazing, as was the ham and cheese panini. The crêpes and other pastries looked scrumptious, too. What really took the cake (pun intended) for me was the Nutella napoleon. The chocolate cream combines perfectly with the flaky pastry and rich Nutella. Eating here definitely keeps you wanting for more."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced as hell, but I don't care. I would sell my body just to get something from here.  I love the crepes, the 'spensive gelato they put on the crepes--my favourite crepe is the original because it's just a delicious crepe.  I think these dessert crepes are better than the ones at Paris, Las Vegas.  I remember the smoothies costing ten bucks, what the hell! I've never gotten one because I always want a god damn crepe.  Man, I love this place, but I hate that there isn't any freaking seating.  I love how all the servers wear a tag that says where they come from--degrading if you ask me, but fun to know.  I always want to try everything else, but always get a crepe--sometimes I get two. I love this place. I love it. I dream of it. I love the chocolate fountain that goes all the way around. It's beautiful.  Go there, get anything, it will be good."}
{"text":"Cashier very rude and the guy making the food was only wearing one glove ... Spoke to mgr and she could care less ... It seems like the people working here hate there jobs"}
{"text":"Best dessert place in U.S. This place brings out all the dessert fantasies. They should open locations all over the world. I am surprised they have not. Their sandwiches and salads are fantastic too."}
{"text":"I drew the short straw and had to go get coffee/breakfast early one morning for my husband and me while staying at the Bellagio.  It was early and the hotel / casino was still quiet and I scrambled downstairs in sweats and a pony tail, figuring I wouldn't run in to many people.  That was until I got to Jean Philippe Patisserie, where the well-formed line was already the center of activity in the hotel/casino that morning.  :)  I grabbed some coffees (they have soy milk - love that - thanks JP) and some muffins and croissants for my husband and some fresh fruit for me.  The muffins and croissants were way too much food for my husband, but there was no way I could limit the choices down for him -- everything looked amazing.  His favorite was the chocolate croissant.    Even if you don't indulge, go there to check out their chocolate fountain (makes you think of Willy Wonka), cakes or other decorations.  It's a fun place to sit and people watch too."}
{"text":"Beautiful pastries,  delicious sandwiches, and coffee! Great stop for a light breakfast, or lunch."}
{"text":"The food was good but the cashier and the other team members weren't nice!! I ordered a nutella strawberry crepe, but they gave me a strawberry crepe without nutella! And I told the lady who made it that it was supposed have a nutella but she told me I have to pay more for that! I think thats stupid! Theyre the one who made mistakes! I dont care about paying more, they just have to be friendly!!"}
{"text":"I only had two items here, a chocolate croissant and a powerade (to help restore some electrolytes lost from the night before). The chocolate croissant was awesome, with a fluffy inside, chocolate bits scattered around, and a nice crust on the outside. The powerade was... well... powerade. Oh, by the way, why a 20oz powerade costs $5.25? I have no idea."}
{"text":"Gelato, cakes, crepes and sweets - this place has it all.   Tourists flock to the Bellagio garden display, but if you want to step into Charlie Bucket's shoes, scoot around the corner and gawk at the chocolate cascades that go from ceiling to floor. White, milk, and dark!   There are a few tiny tables inside this small shop but if you head down the hallway (away from the gardens) you will find much more comfortable seating and tables for enjoying your consumables.  For my savvy shoppers: I didn't see any organic or fair-trade chocolate."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I go to Vegas.  I love the individual desserts here, especially the Chocobana, which has a very nice balance.  It isn't too sweet and the consistency of each bite is perfect.  There were a couple disappointments here but overall, the desserts are delicious and reasonably priced for the quality of desserts.  Other things to try here are the tutti frutti, the savory crepes, and the rose macaroon.  If you're lucky enough to grab a seat, it is a nice place to relax on a Las Vegas afternoon when you're just getting away from all the excitement."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg as most of the restaurants in Las Vegas that have a good reputation"}
{"text":"Everything was great in JP, and I like this JP more than the one at Bellagio. The service at Bellagio wasn't good, and the place was older, so I guess that's why I like JP at Aria better. I have tried a triple chocolate cake with a macaroon on top, a bear claw, gelato and soufflé crepe. They all tasted great.  There was an incident with my crepe though. I found a piece of plastic in the raspberry topping (I was eating it at the hotel room while staying at Aria), so we brought it down immediately, they compensated by giving us a refund, and making a new one for us. And they throw away a tub of contaminated raspberry immediately afterwards. Very good attitude. I would go back again and again as long as they keep the food quality and service the same."}
{"text":"We got a Nutella brioche and bananas foster crepe. Totally disappointed very expensive and not tasty at all!!! Go to Max Brennar at caesar's palace!"}
{"text":"I have the worst experience here. I am a hotel guest at the Aria and I was a fan of Jean Philippe.  I love chocolates and am chocolate addict. Since I am staying at the hotel, of course, we will pay a visit to JP.  My daughter picked up what appears to be a white chocolate bar and it was for $9.50. I also brought two croissants and paid for them at the cafe side.  It came out to a total of $17 something.  I didn't remember exactly how much the change was.  Anyhow, we started to walk back to our hotel room and I noticed the ingredients contained peanut.  Peanut is something that my daughter can't eat and will develop serve allergic reaction if consumed.  I told her I will exchange it after her nap. I don't think it will be a problem since its a very simple exchange.  Oh Boy, I didn't know what's to come was so horrific and humiliating that I am still upset over it.   A few hours later, I went back and tried to exchange the white chocolate peanut bar for a white chocolate bar.  The white chocolate peanut bar was in its original package unopened and in the same shopping bag I purchased a few hours ago.  The male cashier took out the bar and asked if I have the receipt.  I told him that we were never provided with a receipt.  He looks annoyed when I said that. He then went on to say the bar appeared to be broken.  I told him we didn't open it and it was in the same package as we purchased it.  He then replied saying that the manager said \"NO\", we can't exchange it.  He didn't even check the ones on the retail shelf after I told him about the condition.  I was upset since it was only a even exchange and don't know why management made it so difficult.  After 10 minutes, a female manager finally came out.  She looked very annoyed and didn't greet us.  I told her I just want to exchange the peanut one for the one without it.  She wouldn't listen.  I guess I was frustrated and maybe raised my voice without knowing it.  I simply told her that my daughter has peanut allergy and since we accidentally took the wrong chocolate bar and she will not be able to enjoy it.  She said \"You picked it, We didn't pick it for you\". \"There is nothing we can do for you.\"  I can't believe she just said that.  Wow, what happen to customer service?  I showed her the other white chocolate peanut bars with the same pressed condition and she ignored me. She then threaten to call the security on me if I stay longer.  I told her to go ahead and call the security.  I didn't use any foul language or said anything inappropriate to her.  A proclaimed first class pastry shop threaten its own customer if she tries to exchange something. It was unheard of especially in a five star hotel. I was humiliated.  I was horrified by the whole experience.  I was in shock. She then told me I can go ahead and take the white chocolate bar, after all this humiliation and hard work for just a piece of chocolate bar?  It just tells me how rotten the company is inside even when it appears so beautiful and appealing outside."}
{"text":"Yummy, pretty but very crowded. The Bellagio location is much prettier and has a lot of hotel provided sitting options."}
{"text":"Heads up for anyone with a nut allergy, and maybe any kind of food allergy -  Avoid this place and don't waste your time or money.  According to them they state all of their items have a warning label saying \"Please refrain for eating if you have any nut allergies\". So anyone with a serious allergy should not even step foot in the place - you can't eat anything.  Not allergic to all nuts, don't trust their labels because they really do not feel the need to actually list the ingredients used. So even though the nuts are listed, there's a chance there are nuts in it, which is why they have their warning label.   So I'm not sure what else they don't list in their ingredients.  They put nuts in cookies, but don't have the type of nut listed (or even mention that there are nuts in the cookie itself).   So again, if you have a nut allergy, don't go here.  Even if you have a concern, the general manger, Annie, doesn't like to address concerns, and will simply refer back to the warning, just avoid any concerns you have.  If you do happen to eat something that has nuts and you are allergic to they type of nut they use, you can likely get a refund for the product through, so remember to keep your receipt, you may need the refund to help pay for any hospital bills."}
{"text":"This review is for the crepes. I tried both the dessert and savory crepes during my visit in vegas. While both were decent, it was definitely not worth the $12. If you are coming here I suggest getting the gelato"}
{"text":"At first I had the chocolates and didn't think they were special. They were definitely pricey. However, I loved the pastries and really enjoyed the crepes. Overall I became a fan only with persistent attempts; it looked to good to give up on one attempt."}
{"text":"Funny the cascade of three different quality of chocolate  We ate: Souffle with vanilla and Nutella: excellent   Crepes with Nutella: exquisite  Crepes Apple sensation: sweet  The service was fast and very well done We'll come again"}
{"text":"Seriously the french are masters at bread and desserts. This place is a great to get your hangover coffee and croissant to soak up all the alcohol from night before. Very modern and wide array to choose from, all items are to die for. Tried the breakfast panini, still drooling. Perfect ooey cheese with paraboiled egg and ham enclosed in the most softest and fresh slices of bread.    Caffe Lattes, yum! Definite stop, too bad we were running late, wanted to grab some cookies and sweets for the road."}
{"text":"Sugar crepe with powdered sugar was ok, latte, buckwheat crepe with chicken, and tiramisu were good."}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich is amazing! A must try! We stayed at the aria, it's the perfect quick cafe for lunch!"}
{"text":"My favorite items here are the berry crepe, cinnamon rolls, croissant sandwiches, plain croissants, and coffee.  The other fancy-looking desserts tend to look better than they taste.  I love love love their berry crepe!  It's tart.  I've had alot of them!  Service is quick.  I prefer the Aria location over Bellagio just because there's more space.  Otherwise the food and service are great at both locations."}
{"text":"Glass Chocolate fondue fountain and beautiful cakes at the Bellagio!? Can you Say He- to the double Ls ya?   So this place is def. a must see and have when you are in Vegas!   I have a major sweet tooth and this place satisfied!   They have a crepe counter where you can also get gelato and pastries. Then they have another corner for Coffee and stuff.   I got the raspberry macaroon and I loved every single bite of it. Not only was it delicious but it had a candied rose petal sitting right on top of it that added to its beauty and taste. I also got the butterfly cookies that they sell packaged on the side- which were also delicious!  It may be a bit pricey but its worth every penny!  Happy Eatings! =]"}
{"text":"Since I have a sweet tooth, my friend took me to the World Pastry Champion's patisserie in Aria, a modern new hotel in the Vegas city center.  This extravagant French patisserie was Jean Philippe's dream.  Along with the extraordinary gourmet desserts were beautiful chocolates, sandwiches, and pastries.  I would stick with the cakes and pastries here.  We were recommended the Imperial cake and the Chocolate eclair.  Both went really well with the coffee but my favorite was the Imperial cake.  Mmm...  So intricately packaged together - creme brulee, crispy nuts, and dark chocolate mousse all wrapped with a smooth and creamy chocolate ganache.  These desserts are a work of art!  And yes, you will pay for it at $6.50 a piece.      This was a delectable and sweet experience for dessert!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this is rated so high. The espresso was sub par (no crema-for 4.25 it should be perfect), my husband's pastry was tough and old. They got our order wrong. The only thing good was my cherry danish."}
{"text":"Food ** Price *** Service **  Everything was average.  My major complaint was the long wait time even for pastries.  Almond brioche was good.  Iced coffee was mediocre."}
{"text":"Bought the Vanilla Napoleon,  wow I can't believe they would burn the wafer layers and still sell these. The creme inside is decent but the bitterness of the burnt wafer is overpowering.  Where is the quality control. Smh"}
{"text":"Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is a European-style pastry shop, located inside the Bellagio, just steps away from the Bellagio Conservatory (see blog post here). The mastermind behind Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is Chef Jean Philippe Maury, an award winning French pastry chef who grew up in the South of France. Did I mention that he is the Executive Pastry Chef at the AAA Five Diamond Bellagio? I thought I should slip the \"AAA Five Diamond\" part in front of \"Bellagio\" to emphasize my point. ;) Am I the only one who thinks this is impressive?  Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie has two locations on the Las Vegas Strip, one inside the Bellagio and one inside Aria Hotel. I have been to both locations, but only purchased desserts from the one located in Bellagio. All the pastries are made daily at his kitchen inside Aria, and delivered to the Bellagio.  Walking into Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is breath taking, the interior decor is nothing short of gorgeous. What first catches your eyes is the life-size mannequin on a pedestal, wearing a dress fashioned out of chocolate, then your eyes wanders scans the interior of the pastry shop, where you'll see shelves full of chocolates and confections, even a wedding cake or two, then you look towards the entrance, where you will see a multi-tier chocolate fountain, supposedly the largest chocolate fountain in the world. Lastly, you enter the pastry shop, look towards the display cases located in the centre of the pastry shop... where you will find pastries and a large variety of desserts, beautifully crafted, and you know it is time to let your inner glutton out.  I tried three dessert items: Raspberry Tart, Nutella Napoleon and Opera. The Nutella Napoleon consists of caramelized chocolate puff pastry, topped with chocolate creme brulee and chocolate mousse. The Opera is made of almond coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache. Lastly, the Raspberry Tart...  starts out with almond shortbread tart at the bottom, topped with pistachio cream, raspberry cream and stunning fresh raspberries. All three of these desserts were incredibly delicious and rich. The taste absolutely lives up to their appearance, if not exceeding it.  Honestly, I need stop writing and let the photos do the talking, come to my blog to check them out! ;)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/09/jean-philippe-patisserie-bellagio-las.html"}
{"text":"Although I did not taste the food at this shop, it was well worth the walk to Aria to just walk around and view all the stunning artwork that this staff has created from chocolate and sugar."}
{"text":"This shop, located in the Bellagio, is smaller then its counterpart located in Aria's. The chocolate fountain is amazing to look at and take pictures of.  The line is confusing and there are people everyone in this very small shop with very limited seating inside.  I was so excited to be ordering individual desserts for my friend's birthday that I failed to listen to the girl that was describing what I was pointing to. My taste buds heard \"Raspberry Macaroon\" and the girl actually said \"Raspberry Macaroon with ROSE OIL\".  Needless to say I did not like the mini that I purchased for myself but my friend's all enjoyed, with great enthusiasm their desserts."}
{"text":"The Brioche Nutella and the Chocolate Croissant was the best pastries I ever had. It was buttery, flaky and when you bite into both, you get ooey gooey Nutella goodness and bits of dark chocolate in the Croissant. I am so going back the next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Decor: Cute with displays of drool inducing pastries/chocolates and etc.  Service: Polite and efficient.  Food: I ordered the gelato (strawberry and mango/passionfruit).  Verdict: Yumtastic :-D"}
{"text":"Pot luck at work today. I was charged with desserts and stopped in this morning to pick up some cakes. Was not disappointed, nor were my co-workers. I'll be back next month for more cakes for a birthday. :)  There are 2 lines, one for quick grabs, the other for coffee, cakes, etc.  this line was lengthy but moved fairly quickly. I picked up a chocolate cupcake, red velvet cupcake, tiramisu, chocolate eclair, vanilla napoleon, and raspberry cheesecake. While in line I didn't feel right NOT ordering coffee, so I picked up a Caramel Twist (coffee with caramel sauce & whipped cream).  The cakes were divine. I enjoyed the vanilla napoleon. It's light & creamy, very flakey. The cheesecake was very creamy and smooth, the sweet coming from the raspberry sauce. My coffee was very fresh & had a nice roasted flavor. I did not have to add sugar which I enjoyed. Everything was lovely!  Will definitely be back!!  The cakes I purchased were $6-7/each. Not for daily visits, but if you're looking for a sweet treat, try here. Well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Their Creme Brule Gelato is uhhhmazing! every time I go to Aria or the Bellagio I stop here!"}
{"text":"Here's a rare 5-star review from me, but Jean Philippe deserves it.  If you're in town, make sure you go here (or the Aria location), you will NOT be disappointed.  I went nuts ordering 5 pastries to eat all to myself, but I decided to share.  Chocolate Croissant - WOW! Flaky, great consistency, just enough chocolate and just freaking awesome.  I easily could eat half a dozen of these  Almond Croissant - Again, flaky outside, almond filling was just enough and not too sweet which makes it really good  Dulce de leche brioche - The brioche is the best I've ever had, ever.  The consistency and texture were perfect to me.  The filling was a tad too much, as far as how much they injected in. It's still good as it's not too sweet  Sticky bun - I'll repeat myself, delicious!  Not my favorite of the bunch, but still very good.  As you get closer to the shop, you smell all kinds of buttered goodness.  The shop was currently setup with a chocolate fountain, tons of other goodies to get from chocolates, macaroons, crepes, and on and on.  Again, make sure you stop here!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was NOT HAPPY with the service at all, but the delicious dessert made up for it.  Definitely Try: 1. White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - OH MY HEAVEN, BEST WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE OF MY LIFE. The raspberries are delightfully fresh, the white chocolate is not overly sweet, and the graham cracker center is DEEEEELICIOUS (I am drooling as I type)  2. Banana Nut Breakfast Muffin - NOM NOM NOM with real pieces of Banana which are soft and delicious when the muffin is toasted!  Good, but skip 1. Granola and Yogurt - this was really good, but I didn't think it was worth the price because I've had yummy homemade granola and yogurt for half the price ($7.50 or $8.50 - I don't remember exactly)"}
{"text":"Holy moly!  I was just visiting Vegas and came across this place.  I went there twice in one day, and one of those times was for dinner.  Yup, you heard me.  Twice.   The pastries are tasty.  I don't like sweets, so I appreciated the fact that they aren't busting at the seams like Twinkies.  The Napoleon is yummy!"}
{"text":"Great chocolates and setting! The staff at the Bellagio location was really nice and help me get a box full of pralines!!!"}
{"text":"Opens at 6am, great breakfast choices. I had a croissant that shattered as I ate it with little shards of buttery flakes - soooo good. They rival the ones at La Boulange. The cafe au lait was wonderful although the coffee could have been a bit stronger for me, but that's just me. My husband got the croque monsieur which wasn't the nicest I've seen but he enjoyed it. He had a bit of a time wrestling with the ham. He said he wouldn't order it again. Everything is pricey but like everyone says, it is Vegas..."}
{"text":"Wow!  Everything on display here is soo gorgeous and yummy!  The buds and I walked up and down that line for a very long time to decide on what we wanted.  The brioche is soo delicous.  Coming here would be one of the few  reasons to return to Aria."}
{"text":"First off, the  Creme Brulee gelato was fantastic and if I was only reviewing that Jean Philippe's would be a solid 4 stars. It actually tasted like creme brulee (I HATE how creme brulee flavored things taste nothing like it - it's worse than fruit flavored stuff that may or may not even be the same color of the fruit it is supposed to represent).  HOWEVER, this is all about  the savory crepes they have.  My first tip off that I should avoid them was how there really weren't any reviews when I looked them up on the the ol' phone even though there were 400 + reviews for this place (a total of 26 when I just filtered them online - so clearly not what people come here for). The moral of the story is you won't be able to make any substitutions because they just microwave little bowls of the filler to put in that freshly made crepe of yours. So existentially you are buying yourself a frozen dinner - which is what it tasted like.  You also get a little blah salad to really round the order.  Considering the plethora of great food options in the vicinity I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"The bad thing about staying at the Aria is you have to pass by this sweet joint to get to your room. How can one resist? Anyway I ordered the chocolate croissant and quiche lorraine. The croissant was extraordinary! This is not your corner deli, flat bread type of croissant. It's crispy and reminded me of being in Paris. Make sure to finish your dessert off with a strong iced cafe au lait."}
{"text":"The manager was excellent however her staff on the chicolate side were very disorganized.  I really wanted to try the chocolate but a 20 minute wait while there only 3 people ahead of me was too much.  I finally left because the line really was not moving.  In addition there was a lady who bumped into me and did not say excuse me and would constantly make sour faces while serving others.  She really soured my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Definitely it's my favorite spot great patisserie best quality you can get    Coffee and ice cream it's the best I will go back for sure and I do recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Service can be slow and indifferent due to the huge crowds.  However, the pastries are top notch.  Add an overpriced coffee and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"We tried this place at about 11PM, and the lines were short. They serve only four types of savory crepes, and since M doesn't eat meat, we tried the one vegetarian crepe. As a savory crepe, it is made authentically with buckwheat flour. The vegetables are in a tomato cheese sauce. The crepe was heavenly, probably the best we've had in our limited experience. And, as a $10 meal inside the Bellagio, this is a steal and therefore the lines are insanely long, so minus one star. The cappuccino is decent also."}
{"text":"Such an awesome set up. The chocolate drip down is unreal. Great selection of amazing pastries. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it is really hard to get a good cup of coffee in Vegas. This place has good coffee. It opens up right to the casino and is right next to the guest rooms so you can people watch or take it back to your room. I also tried the chocolate croissant (yum) and the breakfast yogurt parfait which was huge and really good."}
{"text":"This is my for first stop in Vegas to eat.  They have the most delicious crepes.  Gelato is good too.  It's in a great location, love walkng through the Bellagio."}
{"text":"All the pastries and chocolate fountain made me felt like i was in sugar wonderland! Tried the hazelnut gelato with real nuts on it, super creamy and delicious! I also had the tiramisu it was great in the eye and great taste too! I wanted to the pistachio gelato but the guy in front of me got the last of it at 4 pm or else I would have given this patisserie a 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Apparently I'm like the slow kid who didn't learn to NOT put her hand on a hot stove. After a very unsuccessful visit to their location in the Aria (which I have also posted a review for), I decided to visit the one in the Bellagio.   The pastries are so delicious, but the service is just awful. The lines are undefined and a mess, the workers are impatient and rude, and the wait in line is long. What else is there to say?   I wouldn't go out of my way to get a pastry from here. If you're in the area, great. Just be prepared for yummy desserts, but lackluster service."}
{"text":"Based off the service alone, this would have gotten a one star, but the pastries are pretty stellar, so in order to do justice to that, I settled for a two.   After a long night in Vegas (just walking, eating and watching a show - Jabawokeez rock!) we landed up at John Phillipes for a dessert around 12:15am. Note to Patisserie: I know it's late at night and even though you don't close until 2, you have run out of most of your pastries... but please, please take the signs out of the window for the ones that are missing! The longer I stood in line, (total 15 minutes), the more disappointed I got because of viewing the pasty item tags that weren't there that I was actually in the mood for!   Anyway, we finally got to the man taking the orders and he just looked at us and grunted with a pen and pad in his hand. I stared back at him until he finally spoke and said in a rude tone, \"know what you want yet?\" (No, I have been waiting in line for 15 minutes staring at me feet the whole time. A little, \"Hello. How can I help you?\",  would have made all the difference - and by the way, when did we get off the plane in the east coast?) So I told him our Oder and I was debating on coffee, but before I could tell him, without asking if \"that was all\", he went on to the next person. I decided not to say anything and went to the cashier instead.  No hello from her either, or smile. She looked like she wanted to commit suicide and that being there was the last place in the world that she wanted to be. My hubby ordered a bottled soda and I asked her politely for a glass of ice water. She never acknowledged me or my hubby and went to get our drinks. She wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, because she came back with a glass of ice. I looked at my hubby and he shrugged. So I took the glass of ice, figuring that he could use it for his not-that-cold soda and asked her again for a cup of ice with water. She looked at me like she was about to murder me, than turned around to get it. I was pretty pissed. It takes a lot for me not to say anything, but I decided against it.  We got to our table with our desserts. The caramel chocolate thing was excellent, the fruit tart, not so much. I've had better at Portos Bakery in Los Angeles (my home). I would have returned here to try some other desserts later on, but won't, simply for the inadequacy of their employees. I don't excuse the lack of customer service for the late hour. I work for the airline as an agent. When you have a delayed flight with an original 10pm departure that's delayed and delayed, then finally cancels at 1am, passengers don't give a crap how tired you are and don't want your attitude. It's your job as a CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON to provide excellent customer service at all times. If you can't do that, get a different job.  You know, Airline agents are rumored to be some of the most horrible customer service personnel ever (with the exclusion of myself). So Mr. John Phillipe, thanks for giving us a run for our money."}
{"text":"I swung by just as they opened because for some reason I thought they would magically have desserts ready at that time (and you know, it's Vegas, you can find anything you want at any hour!). With limited options (and time) I hastily decided that a  French establishment they would nail croissants. And they DID. Hands down best chocolate croissant I've ever had. Yeah, five stars based on that one item alone, but man, it was so worth it! I passed by during regular hours and yeah, the line was huge, but it seemed to move rather quickly."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST chocolate souffle crepe I have ever had. Oh-my-fawkin-gawd! That sh*t was out of this world. Ah-mazing! Inside the thin crepe pancake consisted of creamy souffle goodness; it was topped off with chocolate brownie bites, drizzled chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. At first, I thought it would be chocolate overload. Boy, was I wrong. The first bite, I was in dessert heaven. If it were not so damn expensive ($9), I would have definitely bought another one.  My friend and I tried other things on the menu. Creme brulee gelato was too sweet. Tiramisu ice cream, on the other hand, was fantastic. Both scoops on a waffle cone cost a whopping $10. Ugh! We also had the nutella brioche. From afar, it looked yummy. The name itself drew us in. Unfortunately, it was not up to par with the awesome souffle crepe we ate a minute earlier. Tried their white chocolate bars as well. The secret ingredient must be crack because I kept chomping on it while we walked back to the hotel.    The place is a spectacle. If you cannot dish the $$$$, at least go there to take picture of the world's largest chocolate fountain. Makes you think of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. They also have ornate cake creations displayed in glass cases.  Two negatives about this place were the insane prices and workers. Talk about unfriendly b*tches. Seriously, they should get laid. While we patiently waited for our crepe, the female at the counter looked utterly miserable. Gosh, I would hate my job ,too, if I flipped pancakes over and over and over and over.  Bottom line:  Yes, this place is helluva expensive, but worth every cent. In a city that charges an arm and a leg for mediocre food, Jean Phillippe Patisserie is head and shoulders above the rest. Just look past the robotic factory workers and redunkulous prices."}
{"text":"All my excitement vanished when I saw how unprofessional the staff was. I can forgive someone who mistakes our crepe order, but its hard to forgive someone who yells at their costumer because they made a mistake. Sadly I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you can stomach the costs it's seriously the best pastry shop in Vegas. Their breakfast nutters crepe and their pistacchio and coconut Gelato is so ridiculous that I find myself making excuses to go walk through the Bellagio or Aria to get what I want from there everytime I come to Vegas for work or vacation.  Do yourself a favor, go snap some pictures of their sweet ass chocolate fountain and while you're at it, let your fat kid inside enjoy the goodies they have at the counter.  Oh.....and I almost forgot, their Millefoglie pastry is also AMAZING."}
{"text":"http://thesoloreviewer.blogspot.com/   Ignore the whole casino and mall type environment while walking to this place through the Bellagio and when your in front of Jean Philippe Patisserie close your eyes and pretend your a kid again. Now open them. A candy store is for losers, this is place is a candy store on crack. I felt like I was walking into Willie Wonka's factory when I came to this place and felt so overwhelmed. Chocolate, Cheesecake, Fruit Tarts oh my!! After checking out all the wonderful treats, I went with my favorite desert. Cheesecake! Now this was no ordinary cheesecake. I felt like it could have been in a art gallery because it was so beautiful. After the first bite I was in heaven. Literally the best cheesecake I've ever had and probably the most calories I've had but it was worth every bite. So rich and creamy with the raspberries almost making it seem healthy, HA HA who am I kidding, and every bite just leaves you rushing your fork back to it. Amazing! Willie Wonka has nothing on Jean Philippe!"}
{"text":"SUPER GEM!! Read this review!! I would love to be the one to find a diamond in the rough, needle in the haystack, that elusive hidden gem.   But, until then, I tell you about the current gems.  JEAN PHILLIPE PATISSERIE is one of those gems.  Chef Jean Philippe Maury is truly an artist. He is captain of the US Pastry Team. (I know..., that really exists? - yes.)  Location:   Las Vegas strip. Inside the Bellagio and inside the Aria Hotel. (This review is for Aria)  Area:   Las Vegas, if you have never been just Google it, there is too much to say about it.   Parking:   Difficult and confusing to say the least (but hey, it's free)  General Ambiance:   This is difficult to describe. First, you have to remember that the PATISSERIE is located inside the Aria Hotel (which in Vegas means inside the casino) so, in general it is loud, smokey, and filled with mostly drunk gamblers. However, once inside the patisserie you are transposed into a different place. It is loud, bright, and exciting almost like an art museum. Sort of... Like I said, it's hard to explain.  Customer service:  Top notch. Friendly, attentive and very helpful staff awaits you.  ======== THE REVIEW  ========  5 STAR equals perfect, and Jean Philippe PATISSERIE is pretty close. The only thing that prevents this place from receiving a 5 star rating is the Aria. Not that the Aria is bad, but, the parking situation sucks. It's literally \"on the strip\", and they allow smoking inside the casino (smoke knows no boundaries).   The pastries are simply amazing. They are created by a true artist. They taste as good as they look. The one thing I do have to say is... If you want a Mercedes, you're going to have to pay for a Mercedes. This stuff is NOT CHEAP nor INEXPENSIVE. It is, however, worth the money you will spend.  The ambiance is party and shop and gamble and smoke... and did I say party? There are several places to eat within the Aria, so it's a one stop shop and the patisserie simply adds to that. The patisserie, however, is truly a stand alone facility worthy of its own review.  I would love to have seen the patisserie separated from the casino as a true stand alone location.  The lines are standard for shops in Las Vegas, not too long, but busy enough to wait.   The place is clean. I have to give them that. They must pride themselves on that. It's organized, neat, and \"pretty\" for lack of a better word.  ======== OVERALL REVIEW ========  Clean, great customer service, excellent pastries, decent location garners this place 4 solid STARS. Although it is inside a casino/hotel, it holds its own. Great job!!!  ~ therealtred"}
{"text":"Is amazing how good this place is plus the service is really good I really recommend this place if you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pure chocolate art.  The white chocolate moccha is a MUST!!!  Loved everything!!  It is just a little hard to find seats."}
{"text":"This is pure art!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But it is hart to find a seat."}
{"text":"This is a very cute and convenient little shop in the beautiful aria hotel lobby. The chicken pesto panini and chocolate gelato were good, but not great. My sister had the coconut gelato and really enjoyed it. Both the almond and chocolate croissants were delicious-highly recommend those! I would go back, but only for the croissants. Prices were on par with the usual elevated prices of vegas."}
{"text":"Their food and chocolate is very good.  However, for the price they charge you would think they could clean the tables a little.  There is very limited seating area as it is and the open tables are covered in dirty dishes."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service ever. My sister in law ordered her wedding cake from here and sitting at the wedding dinner waiting for the cake to come my husband and brother in law had to go in search for the cake. Only to find out that the cake wasnt even made, apparently someone had quit which i realise this can cause problems but no one ever contacted them to say their was a problem. When your paying good money you should get good service. For something coming out of the bellagio you would expect top service but instead my sister in law was devistated, it truely ruined her day!"}
{"text":"A beautiful open-air shop on the ground floor of Aria with an array of delectable treats on display.  I wanted one of everything!  Instead, I bought a few gifts - choco covered pretzels, hard candies, and choco covered espresso beans...which set me back over $40.  Besides pre-packaged goodies, there is also a display case filled with a variety of gelato flavors as well as another case filled with truffles and other choco goodness.  Coffee is available, and they have some tables set up right outside of the shop.  Two questions I had were...where the heck does your line start, and why do you only have one person working??  Cute little place to stop for a treat or two...or three, wallet permitting."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR DESSERTS because of their QUALITY.  As  Vancouverite from Canada, we have similar french passeterie cafes. The prices of Jean Phiippe desserts are reasonable  because the french pastisseries are normally priced like that even in Vancouver. However, J.P. Patisserie is beyong good quality. I don't know why? Is it because of the chocolaté ? or I really do not know. I  I always drop by  whenever I am in Vegas  just to have their desserts. I should definitely try their chocolates next time."}
{"text":"4.75 Stars  I've been to this store in Bellagio before. This place has good pastries :9 what I like about this place compared to the one in Bellagio is that there's nice seating areas.  $6+ for Fruit Tart & Chocolate Mousse w/crunchy hazlenut inside. Not too bad on pricing, but I think it's still a little bit on the expensive side :0   Fruit tart: Good, but nothing too different. Chocolate Mousse w/Hazlenuts: Delicious, but very heavy. You'll want a straight coffee/tea w/this one! Good dark Chocolate flavor :9"}
{"text":"The wait is usually about 30 mins but it's totally worth it. They have so many delicious crepes and I haven't even tried half of them. I ordered Nutella crepe. As I was waiting for my order, you can see the cook making the crepes right in front of you. It was simply beautiful. How they make the crepe so thin and perfectly cook. As I got my order, and that first bite... Soft, buttery and moist inside full of flavor with that perfect crunchy texture. Yummm"}
{"text":"We were there a few days ago. I stupidly expected the same level of service as the one at the Bellagio restaurant. No way! Very slow, they just ignore you when you need something - you can stand there and stare at them forever. By the time I got my breakfast, the coffee was barely warm."}
{"text":"I have heard many good things about this place in the past I just had to visit it when I was in the are. All the pastries looked so delicious that it was hard for me to chose. I decided to go for mixed berries crepe, because it looked super yummy and an iced coffee. The crepe was really out of this world delicious and I am really sorry I didn't take a picture because it looked great too. The coffee on the other hand, is not worth it. It was way too expensive for what it was. So next time I'll definitely order only pastries."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my birthday at Julian Serrano in the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas, and I ordered my birthday cake from Jean Phillipe. I was looking for something kinda fancy, and I heard great things about their pastries, plus the designs on the website seemed along the lines of what I was looking for. Since this was going to be a part of a large group dinner I was having at Julian Serrano, I ordered through the catering manager. She sent me this very basic word doc to fill out. All I selected was size, shape, wording, general design aesthetic (male/female/child, elegant/flashy/traditional/fun, flavor, and filling. Since I was planning this from out of state, I had no idea what it was going to taste like or look like.  Since the pastry shop and the restaurant were in the same hotel they were easily able to deliver the cake to the restaurant directly. I must say I was EXTREMELY surprised and delighted when my cake arrived. It was beautifully decorated and tasted as good as it looked. For having planned all the details of this birthday dinner, I actually surprised myself when the cake was brought out.   Jean Philippe delivered fantastically and I would use them again for any other event.  NOTE: when you order a cake from this bakery (which is also in the Aria hotel) you don't have to pay a cake cutting fee ($5 per person)."}
{"text":"Yes it's pricey but what else do you expect? This is Vegas and everything in Vegas is pricey since they take advantage of the tourists, so I won't be rating it on the price. Actually at $4 a piece (pastries section), it's not THAT bad especially because they are SOOO good. Their almond croissants are delectable. I haven't been to Paris but this is probably the best croissant I've tried so far. They're flaky, buttery, and soft with the right amount of sweetness. MMM my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.  I probably brought $50 worth of pastries back to L.A. with me. They really should open one up in LA. I would die and go to heaven if that happened.   Must tries: The Almond Croissant Nutella Brioche (to die for) Almond brioche their chocolate assortments  I havent tried their macarons but that's going to be the next thing I taste when I'm in Vegas. This place is a must try if you're in Vegas, ESPECIALLY if you're staying at Aria or Bellagio."}
{"text":"The decoration was beautiful, however, the desserts were a little below my expectations.  I've had better french desserts at the same price at other french bakeries"}
{"text":"Ok, so obviously Jean Philippe has great pastries but I have to tell you about the Vanilla Scone I had on my latest visit.    So... it was about 9:30pm and I was going to head back to my room but I decided to venture over to Jean Philippe for a late dessert.  I hop in-line with no clue what I really want.  Should I get the caramel filled muffin that looks so delicious, the chocolate croissant that I know I love, or should I try something new?  I opt for trying something new and though I don't tend to like scones, I gave the vanilla glazed scone a try... I figured if it was bad then I would save some calories.  Upon the first bite of my scone, I knew this is what heaven would take like if it was a food.  The scone was dense but not too dense and it was moist and not dry or crumbly like many of the more commercially purchased scones can get.  The vanilla flavor was powerful but in a very welcome and appreciated way.  I think I could have eaten 5 in one sitting, lucky for my waistline, I didn't have that many.   I can't wait to get back to enjoy another one of these delicious treats, it is a MUST try item!"}
{"text":"The desserts and gelato are amazing, but the service was so pretentious and cold that they managed to make you feel like an unwelcomed peasant. The coconut and strawberry gelato will knock your socks off though if you're willing to bear with the snobby service. One star for each of the gelato flavors we tasted. As ashamed as I am to say, I wouldn't mind coming back to feel like a peasant once more to experience the gelato again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Wonderful chocolates make it hard to chose. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe ... please start investing little on your to go boxes. I got sweet trio to go and found all caramel out side of Creme Brule because the box in which it was packed was too small. I have seen small cupcakes shops doing better job in packing pastries"}
{"text":"The best Almond Brioche I've ever had.************ Pick up a Cafe Americano w/ it and you will not regret it.   You're welcome."}
{"text":"talk about luxury plastic utensils!! i secretly stashed a handful in my bag because they were so pretty.   now onto the crepe, i got the chicken breast one!! yummm!! make sure to eat it all while it's still hot or else it gets a little nauseating. i also shared it with my sister because i knew i couldn't finish one by myself.   the whole place is so chic and modern. lurv it"}
{"text":"10/26/2016- we decided to have dessert here at the Bellagio branch.  The line was not long around 8 p.m.  We tried the fruit tart and the snickers.  The fruit tart was not too sweet and the fruits were fresh.  The Snickers was a bit too sweet and I wish I tried the dark chocolate cake instead.  We also tried the cappuccino gelato and the pistachio gelato.  Both gelato were true to its taste.  I may return to try other sweets but this place did not \"wow\" me."}
{"text":"Omg my friend told me about this place.. She told me every time she's in Vegas, it's a must go, before she comes back to La. So I figure I give it a try!  Wow everything is amazing!! They have cakes, muffins, croissants, crepes, all kinds of pastries and coffees, they even have gelato too. I especially love their Berry Crepes here, I pair it with a Coffee Latte. My bf love this place too, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm..... This place rocks! My fiancé got me a custom cake for my birthday that was ridiculously gorgeous.  Like the prettiest cake ever! It also tasted really good. ;) I can't wait to go back. I doubt I'll get another cake out of it though."}
{"text":"I was all excited to try this place when in Vegas. I was seriously disappointed with their pastries.  Waited in a long line on a Sunday at around 10:30. Purchased a Napoleon, vanilla eclair, and a sticky bun. The sticky bun was tasteless and hard/stale, the vanilla eclair custard filling had a thin film/coating in it like it had been sitting there for days and the Napoleon was just Ok. Definitely not worth the wait or the inflated price!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I would scoff very loudly at such extravagant prices-- $7.50 for a cup of coffee?? *Starts foaming at the mouth*  But arrrrrrr the cheese danish!! Let me warn you, don't try to finish the whole thing on your own. I mean, you can do it, but then you'll end up with a food coma and I'll be right here pointing and calling you a fatty.   Seriously though, it's no wonder Jean Philippe won the Food Network pastry challenge. As far as I know, every crust is perfectly layered, every filling is a creamy folding of silk, and every topping is fresh and immaculately placed. Even the sugar free desserts are divine!!  Mmm, a patisserie where even my diabetic dad can enjoy himself? A definite five-star eatery! However, minus one for the ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"Very fancy pastry shop that's decent.   So after playing craps from 10pm-5am, I wanted to grab something quick to eat in my room before flying out. The place doesn't open til 6am and there was already a line forming.   The decor and display is just beautiful. Wide variety of fancy looking pastries. I opt for the breakfast panini, a raspberry muffin, and orange juice. Results are mix. Panini good, muffin, and OJ decent.   Being Vegas it's pricey, the 3 items totaled up to $20. But you got to pay the bills and all the fancy decor some how. Service on the front line was spotty and a little disarray, but that maybe because of the long line.   A decadent shop that's alright. I would check it out, if you crave something small to munch on."}
{"text":"my favorite dessert place. I have had 3 or 4 things but the snickers dessert is prob my fav"}
{"text":"Great food and bad attitude from the staff- it's a bad feeling that you come for a nice experience but get a bad one. We ordered an omelette and for some reason they skip/forget our order. When we ask the staff they even accused us that we haven't paid yet. Luckily I always save and ask for a receipt so I can show t to them. They just look at it and without saying a word, and make us wait for another 5 minutes and finally make our order. It is very insulting and just feels horrible. I hope this review will stay here so people can read it."}
{"text":"OK, I know tons of people gave five stars, and almost all our friends highly recommended this place before we went to Vegas, and we actually enjoyed our dessert there.  BUT, a high-end dessert place ending up being so cheap at their packaging was quite a disappointment.    We bought 1 pack of biscotti and our friends bought 1 too, for families.  However in less than 12 hours, by the time we left Vegas, both containers (ours and our friends') were broken from the bottom at the exactly same place.  These are $16 ish each for like 8 pcs, Jean Philippe should have chosen at least some decent enough packaging without ruining our luggage!!!    Next time, think twice before you buy them, or maybe ask them to double wrap them first!!!"}
{"text":"Come here as much I can for take out I usually get salmon or ham sandwich awesome desserts ice mocha and blue berry Danish .... Always check your take out bag. Never miss it's always wrong ask for 2 Danish I get muffin or 1 Danish. If not for this it's a 5 star... But it's all good !"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent here. Crepes were delicious!!! Dulce de Leche with strawberries and Oreo gelato was perfect. The assistant manager Julius was so friendly and helpful and answered all my questions. Even if it was busy they valued me as a customer. Will definitely be back. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit for me whenever Imm in Vegas. Their buttery croissants and beautiful cakes are worth some extra calories, besides it's Vegas, you can walk it off afterwards.  We all know their sweet stuff is tasty but their savory sandwiches are also very good. Fresh and yum!   The line up wasn't as bad the last time I visited and they had my fav almond croissant every time! If you don't see your fav pastry displayed, just ask! They just might have some freshly baked ones in the back."}
{"text":"As a retail space to get something to eat, this place was very aggravating.  I went after a Cirque du Soleil show next door.  People mulled around in front of the place, not sure what to do.  It's a very unconventional space.  I expected display cases, a line, and maybe some seating.  No.  Services comes from a circular area around which, not one, but two lines go.  People asked each other where they should get in line.  When they do queue up, these lines of people block the views of the product.  The menus aren't much more helpful since they are large computer monitors which constantly rotate through different displays.  Ironically, despite being color monitors capable of displaying pictures, they show mostly text.  Some of them can't be viewed unless one is well inside the shop.  The walls are covered with display cases of things that you can't buy; its like a bizarre museum of confection.  Perhaps worst is the seating, squiggly (thats the only word for it) table tops crammed into unusable spaces around the circular serving area.  It's an ergonomic nightmare.  When I finally did get my Napoleon, it was average.  The layers of pastry between the cream were tough, making it difficult to cut with a fork without destroying the layers.  A great Napoleon can be neatly and easily cut with a fork.  Overall, I got a not-so-great confection from a frustratingly unusable space.  I understand that the man is well-credentialed, but if he can't deliver delicious product in a pleasant space, then what's the point?"}
{"text":"In one word, amazing!  We had chicken and nutella crepes. We also had a brioche and coffee. Everything was done to perfection.   The only complaint is the line. Not that a place like this, in Vegas, wouldn't have a line. But the staff seemed less than efficient. Especially the lady making the crepes / omlettes.  But like I said, the food really is perfect."}
{"text":"Whatever, it's good. If you see some elderly individuals approaching the patisserie line, quickly use your physical advantages and do whatever you can to get in that line first. Old people can't decide or make decisions. Come on, all you want is a chocolate muffin. Go get that chocolate muffin."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on the last day. Already had the buffet the day before and wanted to give this place try. It is convenient to the elevators to the rooms. Sign says line starts on the right but to order crepes and omelets it is on the left before the cashier. There is usually a line of people waiting to get bakery items and chocolates on the right so you can bypass them if you just want to order an omelet. Had the ham and cheese omelet and coffee that came to around $16. Omelet I think was around $13 and $3 for the coffee. They make to order and you can actually see them making your omelette or crepe. The omelet was large and plenty for breakfast. Not sure how many eggs were in there and they seemed to have the eggs, ham and cheese preprepared in this plastic cup  and they just pour the contents on the grill. I would guess it would be equivalent to a three egg omelet. Eating there was much faster than going to the buffet but keep in mind the breakfast buffet is $19 so still the better deal. But it you don't want to do all your breakfast at the buffet this is a good option. The coffee as you would expect is French roast. There are tables at the corner and all along the hallway so not too difficult to find a place to eat. They serve on these thick plastic plates and the utensils are on the is shelf across from where you order the omelets."}
{"text":"This is the best spot for sweetness.  Everything here is very beautiful and tastes good.  I'm a sweet tooth and this is a paradise for me. Next time I come here, this will be my favorite place."}
{"text":"So yummy!!  The price is reasonable for French pastry and I think it's worth it. Opera cake is my all-time favorite. The sponge cake was so moist; the buttercream between the layers was delicious and I think it taste like ice cream :) with the top layer of the coffee glaze/syrup (whatever it calls)...it's the bomb!!   I also like the cupcakes. They are moist and fluffy. The icing is tasty and it's not too sweet. I haven't tried the gelato and the crepes but I will come back for them."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous... in a good way lol  Bad for your waistline and wallet, but so so yummy.  I stayed in an Aria suite and stopped at Jean Philippe each night I was there (4) and once in the morning for a chocolate crepe before I left for the airport.  Each dessert is around $6.50, which sounds reasonable except for the fact that you'll want to try all of them!!  My favorite turned out to be the cheesecake with the raspberry on top- It's described as \"cream cheese, graham cracker, and raspberry compote.\"  I just call it nummy goodness.  It's bascially a small moist graham cracker disc topped with a sweet cream cheese which is then topped with this sweet raspberry mixture and encased in what I remember was flexible white chocolate.  I mean, it's so smooth and delicious you're bound to get addicted.  Don't miss it!  Expect to spend at least $40 over the course of your Vegas trips due to repeat visits =)  Also, there's one in Aria and also one in Bellagio.  The one in Bellagio has the cool chocolate fountain.  Aria has the bigger Jean Philippe, yet Bellagio has the chocolate fountain... So, I'd say visit both! lol"}
{"text":"$4.00 for an espresso that tastes stale and burnt. I believe next time I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Super awesome rose flavored French macaroons."}
{"text":"Worst customer service...waited 30'min for coffee and almost 8 dollars for a small late. No apologies for getting our order wrong after waiting so long and \"Jasmin\" giving us additional attitude. We ask for a refund...manager comes and is not apologetic but is trying to convince us that our order is correct...really? Look At at the receipt! After all the attitude, she refunds us for the coffee but charges us for the $5 croissant. Wow! Considering so many hotels are in Vegas and the way to compete is with customer service, this was a big blow in our book for Aria!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Every time I'm downtown I have to come here! The staff is so helpful and amazing! Must try(:"}
{"text":"I waited in their inefficient line for 20 minutes just to order a coffee and a crepe.   Their system is horrible!! If they were going for French authenticity then they definitely got the Parisian inefficiency on point.   You stand in a line and there is one person that takes your order, makes the coffee, takes the money, AND she walks the crepe order to the crepe guy on the other side of the operation.   Wth, why.   You order the crepe then walk back around towards the end of the line to pick up your crepe. So asinine.   Salmon crepe + large cafe au lait = $20 and I'm so hungry but will not finish this crepe because I prefer to eat things that taste good."}
{"text":"I clearly messed up by not getting the almond croissant. Next time. But the carrot cake was good, it looked very decadent and had a nice custard going on inside. The brioches were forgetful, both the nutella and dulce de leche (caramel), were just bread injected with a small amount of the above ingredients. It gets crowded and there isn't a lot of order to the process of placing an order. It also takes an exorbitant amount of time for them to grab a pastry and put it on a plate. Still, there is enough variety here to make it a stop for sweets when on the Aria's casino floor."}
{"text":"Rhe best crepe that I have ever had. Thats awesome,  Tried both savory and sweet crepes and their are delicious .  Their black forest savory crepe is the bomb, mixture of ham with wild mushroom and cheese, it is amazing"}
{"text":"It is not only a tourist attraction with cameras flashing at the worlds largest chocolate fountain, it is home to some AMAZING French macarons. It is worth the trip to Bellagio to pick up some of those macaroons!"}
{"text":"We always visit the JP location in the Aria and the quality is always consistent at their location. However after trying this location today I will never return and only give my business to the Aria location.  I love the Iced white café mochas made by JP Aria so I assumed the quality would be the same at this location. We were passing by so we decided to pick up some drinks. We ordered 2 large iced WCMs and watched the lady(didn't get her name, she was older Asian lady with black glasses and short hair in a white coat without a hat) make our drinks. When I'm ordering a large I expect them to give me a large, not just the cup size but filled to the correct amount of espresso, milk, and white chocolate sauce. When she was finished, the cups were not filled to the rim and in fact left 1 inch of air for us to drink. Each large costs $6.75 and if I'm going to pay the price I expect to get a full drink. I asked the manager if the drinks were supposed to be filled to the top and she immediately apologized and corrected our drinks.   I'm sure not every employee here is frugal like the one that made our drinks but I am definitely not returning because of this experience."}
{"text":"Every bite of everything is like a dream!! So good!! All the pastries and ice cream and crepes are made from top quality ingredients, and it shows. You should definitely stop by to satisfy that craving for really great dessert. Avoid all the other crap that is made of junk and will still cost you an unreasonable amount of money. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because the coffee is not very good at all."}
{"text":"We always make a stop here when in LV. Our favorites are the regular crossaint and the ham&cheese crossaint. So good!  Best I've tasted in the States. They even sell Orangina which makes it awesome....."}
{"text":"If i could give this place more stars I would... home of the largest multi-chocolate fountain in the world... it deserves a billion delicious stars! After drooling and oggling everything in the Patisserie for around 15 minutes I finally got un-stuck and realized that I could have spent the past 15 minutes devouring the delicious goodies I had been salivating over.  After weighing my options.. as difficult as it was.. I limited myself to only 2 desserts. A LARGE CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRY and the IMPERIAL. OH-eM- Geee!!!  .::OVERALL::.  Imperial (dark chocolate, creme bruleee...) = Heaven Chocolate covered Strawberry = *drool* 'nuff said  .::Recommendation???::  NO. I don't recommend you go here (that way there's more for me) haha JK GO and enjoy! Seriously... go now haha"}
{"text":"Amazing but except for this one Bi*!hy lady. I asked her for a cup of water and she replied, \"for what!?\" In a rude, I never got laid in my life, manner. Like I'm going to use that cup of water to get her wet.  Jokes aside, I would recommend you bringing your own milk or an empty cup to get milk from their coffee station. Also 4 stars only because it would be so much greater warm."}
{"text":"I was in heaven! There are so many pastries and chocolates. Everything I got there was really good, especially the rasberry tart. It is the best fruit tart I've ever had. If you love sweets, you have to go here."}
{"text":"Found this little gem several years ago and never make a trip to Las Vegas without stopping here.  Even if you are not staying at the Bellagio, you have to stop by anyway to take in the flower garden.  Instead of stuffing yourself with the buffet off to the right of the flowers, make your way around to the left and you'll find this little slice of heaven.  Can't say I've tried everything, but everything I have tried have been nothing short of divine!  Savory crepes, dessert crepes, croissants, and sandwiches are all amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time, I had a croissant and my wife had a bagel. The croissant was flaky and buttery: it went well with some preserves and hot coffee.  My wife was happy with her bagel and cream cheese.    This last time we went, my wife had a bagel again and I had the croque monsieur. It was mid-day and they were phasing out breakfast. Her bagel was a little hard, but acceptable.  My croque monsieur, on the other hand was the worst sandwich I ever paid more than 5 dollars for (If it costs less than 5 dollars, shut up and eat). This thing I had at Jean Philippe tasted burnt, like no one had cleaned the grill.  I couldn't taste any ham and when I opened it up to check, I found one paper thin slice with HARD edges.  They are just too busy to do a good job on food made to order, maybe....stick to the sweet stuff......"}
{"text":"The pastries all looked amazing, especially all the desserts, but I was there for a quick breakfast so I ordered a croissant and coffee.  The croissant was light, flaky and buttery.  I could have one every morning.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to write a review for this place?! Just came here again last night... It's crepe heaven! I don't know how many times I've been here but I keep coming back for that delicious, mouth watering chocolate crepe drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with brownie pieces and whip cream..yummy in my tummy! The crepe itself is perfectly done right, not too soft and not over done. If you dont live near the strip and you are craving for a nice and satisfying dessert, def stop by here. It's worth the drive. Do prepare to spend some money because it does not come cheap. Nine bucks for this delicious crepe and if you want water w it, be prepared to pay 5 bucks for a small bottle of Aria water. The good thing is the portion is pretty decent. Seriously though, hands down best dessert crepe in town.  FYI: if you are planning on getting crepe, just head straight to the register and do not mind the line of people trying to get some gelato. And if they give you crap about 'cutting' in line tell them to piss off and point at the sign saying 'Please order crepe at register' . I was told I didnt have to stand in that line if I wasn't planning on getting gelato."}
{"text":"So last time, I only had cakes which were not impressive, thought maybe just chose the wrong things....  well this time I tried their crepe people seem to rave about...  wow... for the name, for the price.... I was not expecting amazement due to my last visit, but at least decent..  This is review  on their Banana Foster Crepe,   Banana was soggy, and most of all they use BOTTLED WHIP CREAM! like the kind that gets bubbly and disappear, not rich handmade yummy cream.. I was  shocked, even starbucks use real whip cream...   I'm so disappointed with this place, won't be wasting my time and money again.  I think its the Vegas atmospher, its the tourists, that makes this place so popular... Decor is pretty good, thats about it."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Bellagio just steps from this place, so I had my share... fantastic everything, really!  I read that the lines are long and confusing, but not when we were there.  A must on the strip."}
{"text":"We were looking for a dessert place late night and actually drove into the Strip for this place. Fyi this is not a standalone restaurant but a mini open cafe near the lobby area. There is minimal seating in the actual place but it's near an open seating area with great plush love seats overlooking the pool. We got the forest crepe- excellent flavor sand super filling for two people. We picked out two desserts -  a key lime dessert and a blueberry cupcake, super yummy and perfectly flavored. Overall a great place for sweets if you're looking for unique desserts beyond the usual brownie sundaes and cheesecakes every place has."}
{"text":"This is my second time staying at Aria and this cafe is the best thing about the hotel! The pastries - there are so many! They all look beautiful they taste delicious and most importantly they are always fresh! So many people are constantly ordering that all the deserts are being made constantly! They have delicious gelato too! I had breakfast here today and let me tell you, the Salmon Crepe was SO good also got the Nutella crepe with fruits which was so yummy! The staff here is friendly and works great under pressure. I just wish the prices of the to go sweets were cheaper - they are ridiculously priced. Also the place can get pretty crowded during meal times. They have sandwiches and omlettes too. The crepes and omlettes take a little while so opt for a sandwich if you are in a rush. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We got:  1) Pastries : the dulce de leche brioche and the cheese pastry.  Both tasted OK -- something that I could easily get out of a Chinatown bakery but I wouldn't choose to buy. 1 star and overrated.  2) the Opera cake and the creme brulee covered with chocolated (forget what it's called).  These were good, Jean Philippe really knows his chocolate - 5 stars.  3) 2 scoops of gelato.  Don't get me wrong, the desserts were good, but they weren't so amazing that I'd need to go back and visit a second time around."}
{"text":"As pastry shops in the United States go, I don't really know how you could top this. I visited three times during my Vegas trip this past week. It's a beautiful space, the pastries look incredible, and the adjacent table space (really part of the Bellagio, not specifically Jean Philippe) is a lovely place to sit and enjoy your goodies.   I got the chocolate crepe, which was delicious and very pretty. Props to the crepe maker, who was working very hard and turning out perfect crepes each time. Right before I left for the airport I returned to get an almond croissant, because they have marzipan inside, but I wasn't impressed with that. I think the butter of the croissant gives the marzipan a greasier-than-usual texture-- no thanks. Might be better fresh, but not to pick up and eat later. Their coffee is good.  A lot of people have criticized this place for the service. I would describe the service here as \"efficient.\" There is a constant line and they are trying to move it quickly. It's true that this was the least friendly service I had in Vegas, but these folks are (almost literally) like Lucy in that chocolate factory episode. They're getting my order right and keeping the wait time as short as possible, so I'm not going to require them to also act like they're delighted to see me.   Prices are... Bellagio. The crepe prices ($11?) are fair enough for something that perfect, but I couldn't deal with $11+ for a croissant turkey sandwich. Still, you're not coming here to get a great deal. You just walked under a Chihuly ceiling and through a fantasy wonderland flower conservatory with a harpist. Yes, you are going to pay more than you do at a neighborhood Starbucks that is between a Subway and a Hair Cuttery. It's worth the extra $5."}
{"text":"when we got there, we automatically noticed the chocolate fountain (which is actually the tallest chocolate fountain.) and the pastries look so good too! i really like their \"intense\" pastry (that's the black one with a bag on top.) overall, it's great!"}
{"text":"I've gone to both the JP at Aria and at Bellagio. I've been there often because my friends love it. The pastries are quite good. However they are way overpriced for what you get, and the service at the Aria location is remarkably BAD. They are invariably slow and rude. I would never go to the JP at Aria but for the fact that friends want to go. On the other hand service at the Bellagio location has always been good."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, but have never written a review. The presentation has always been absolutely outstanding. Today we decided to try out the Nutella Crepe, Strawberry Crepe and Mushroom Omelette. All were very good. We had walked up to the counter because we already knew what we wanted. There was one employee who was fidgeting under the counter for roughly 3-4 minuets. I had leaned over the counter where she was, and asked where we should place our order. I thought maybe she didn't noticed us. She stood up and shot back with a rude tone, that I needed to do that at the register. Our food was served to us in togo container lids, actually 2 lids to be exact. My whole point is that this is not the first time we noticed the staff was unfriendly here. We gave them another chance because everyone has a bad day. It's one thing to come here and pay for overpriced food, but it's another when I have to be waited on by unfriendly rude staff. Next time we'll stick with ARIA Cafe."}
{"text":"5 stars: Woohoo! As good as it gets!  Even though I prefer the Aria location, sometimes I find myself at the Bellagio location of JPP.  I dislike how they don't have real seating here, so you need to take your goods to the random seating in the hallway and fight some chinese tourist for a table, then put your food down on it and hope it doesn't get eaten or thrown away by the vigilant maintenance and cleaning crew while you scare up some chairs, which are usually all occupied by other chinese tourists.   Last I checked, two large jars of nutella cost $7.39 at your local warehouse store.  A nutella brioche at JPP costs $4. I believe that is inclusive of tax, but I'm not certain.  You don't really come to JPP for value. You come to eat delicious baked goods.   If you are ok spending $4 on a nutella brioche and can eat it without choking on it thinking about the $7.39 it costs for two industrial size tubs of nutella at Costco, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"5 stars: Woohoo! As good as it gets!  I prefer this location in the Aria to the one in Bellagio because they have adjoining seating.   I dislike that they run out of nutella brioches so damn early in the morning.   I cherish every tropical crepe I eat, and that coconut sorbet is crime-worthy.   There's usually a long line of people queued up at JPP. Sometimes they have a couple counters open, one for everything, the other for just retail pre-packaged goods from the shop area, and cake orders, and this creates confusion amongst the typically brain-dead early risers attempting to get a coffee in order to become functional human beings again.   Just get in the longer line, and play with your phone for a while.   There's not really a menu, so you need to get up to the front and waste everyone's time while you decide what you are going to order.   Depending on what you order, you will then calculate how many extra miles you need to run on the treadmill, or how many crunches are in that chocolate croissant. You won't be able to figure it out.   You'll order the croissant anyway.  You can't go wrong with anything here.   It's probably the best bakery on the strip.    I challenge you to try a different thing every time and order something bad.   That's why there's so many brain-dead people in line here every morning."}
{"text":"I love cafe au lait and croissants... just not the ones here.  Same food as I could have gotten at a basic airport bakery.  So disappointed.  Service was friendly but not organized."}
{"text":"This place is worth the money. We ordered a few pastries to share and they were all exquisite. A really special treat."}
{"text":"Those crêpes, though.  Good heavens, I dream about them for months before I make it to LV, and they're always a must-have.  I've had great experiences at the locations in both Aria and Bellagio.  Add a scoop of vanilla gelato to the banana or berry crêpe, and you'll be in heaven.  I've even taken it to-go, then headed out to watch the fountains.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"One star for breakfast, based on the value.  I ordered the breakfast panini, a cup of coffee, and a bear claw; and that came to $21. The menu promised a high class version of the classic breakfast sandwich, but the cooks did not deliver. I received two pieces of plain white bread with some grill marks on the outside. Inside there was a touch of lunchmeet ham - the kind where you can see the pressmarks through the package at the grocery - a small over-hard egg, and melted Velveeta. For an $11 sandwich, I am used to receiving the heavenly goodness of Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor, an equally overpriced town, and that I happily pay for. Jean Philippe left me feeling angry and abused.  The bear claw was decent, and the coffee was OK."}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered gelato! The way it was made and mixed were so good!!! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I had their chocolate and pastries. Met my expectations and beyond - definitely a good stop for a gourmet snack. The chocolate brioche was oh so soft and every bite was delicious. Everyone else seemed to love the gelato though!  the chocolate fountain however wasnt a real 'fountain' in my opinion. It was more like a layered tap? But still an eye opener."}
{"text":"Had some crepes, berry filled and the banana version.  It was just ok.  I can understand everyone wanting to give 5 stars because the ambience is great, but those two crepes and two cups of joe was over $30.00, but they won't get 5 stars from me.  It is what it is and what it was was a mediocre crepe.  I shall try more in December for my end of year trip.  To be fair, I only tried a small sample of whats available."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for lunch, while staying at the Aria. Their tuna melt is amazing! I passed by this place several times thinking it was just a pastry shop but they have several lunch options available from quiche to ham and cheese croissants. Their desserts are beautiful. I had the snickers mousse tart and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Yes. All of it.  Quality service. Quality food.  La Colombe draft latte.  One of the best milk shakes I've ever had.  For real...Close your eyes, pick something...you'll be happy."}
{"text":"okay the chocolate fountain was kind of a disappointment. that's it? i wish we could like dip some fruit into it or try it or something. you're literally just watching dripping chocolate.  but the store itself was pretty cool. so many things to choose from! crepes, muffins, cookies, cute desserts, and of course chocolate! gelato was yummy too!   nice place to get useful souvenirs/gifts for someone. because most of their packing says \"las vegas\" on it."}
{"text":"This place is a great stop for something sweet! It can be a bit pricey, but it satisfies the taste buds!! The gelato is delicious, but my favorite thing to get is the crepes! The bananas foster crepe and the nutella crepe are delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Why does this place have only 4 stars? The pastries here are the best on the Strip. Yeah, they're pricey, but who cares, it's only a few dollars more than usual. Worth it for an out of this world experience."}
{"text":"Over priced and they serve you a coffee that is not full to the brim and charge $13 for it. The service was not good and the waitress was rude when I asked her to fill the coffee up more. I watched her put the cup under the coffee filler, walk away, come back (with nothing being added) and handed it back to me. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Got the exotic sweet crepe.   Mango and pineapple chunks in a sugary sauce drizzle on top with a scoop of coconut ice cream on the side.  The crepe was pretty thin.  Buttery.  The fruity topping was not too sweet.  The coconut ice cream was delicious!  Very creamy.  Rich coconut flavor and I can actually taste the coconut flakes. There's a nice seating area for you to eat at.    Next day came back to get the vanilla Napoleon.  Good.  The puff pastry was thin and crispy.  The vanilla custard filling was creamy and the right amount of sweetness.  Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"While on holiday in Vegas, we stopped by the gorgeous Bellagio Hotel. Filled with freshly cut orchids, and covered with gorgeous mosaic tiling, this place was decadence to behold. In the lobby one can look up to larger-then-life hand blown glass flowers by Dale Chihuly.  And of course, a true world-class resort is not complete without its own World Pastry Champion. Stop by and see the work of Chef Jean-Philppe Maury. Be dazzeled by the floor-to-ceiling glass chocolate fountain, or the beautifully crafted chocolates, pastries, cakes and crepes. My personal favorite was the elegant strawberry tart: bright, fresh berries sliced atop a thin, swirly macaroon and light vanilla cream. Yum!"}
{"text":"I always have to stop by this place when I'm in vegas. I've had their dry pastries-the chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and the pecan bun in the past. Their gelato is also really good. I don't care too much for their crepes, there's nothing too special about them, and when the place is packed it takes forever for them to make it. They now offer sandwiches I haven't tried them but they look good!"}
{"text":"Croque Monsieur was delicious! Nutella brioche and Nutella donuts - oh Lawd! You can't go wrong with anything here. Even the orange carrot juice looking drink looked tasty. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum, this is definitely s great place to stop if u want to get your sugar fix! Great Creppes and you can add a scoop of icecream for 2bux!  Wird how the ppl working here are not friendly at all, no greeting with a smile... I wonder if being around sugar and icecream all day is the side effect?... Ya I don't think so either."}
{"text":"Really darn good pastries!  Also lots of great snack gifts that are beautifully packaged."}
{"text":"Great pastries and desserts selection. I tried the cherry danish and the brioche. The danish had delicious, gooey cherry filling that was just delightful. It was that good that I ended up eating this pastry myself even though I was planning on bringing this home and saving it for my husband. (He is not that much of a foodie, so I'm sure he can understand my struggle of having to stare at this deliciousness during a 4 hour flight)   I ordered the Nutella brioche but they accidentally gave me the sugar one... Discovered this mistake after I left the place, but I won't hold it against them because the sugar one was also delicious.   If you're staying at the hotel, definitely visit this place!"}
{"text":"Great crepes but people that work there not friendly. They don't smile and ask them where to pick up the food they just point. I showed this worker my receipt and she said \"what do you want me to do with it\". Are you kidding me. I am here to pick up my food. Can't you tell that is the only crepe sitting there! They need to go to a customer service training."}
{"text":"This place offers a variety of pastries and salads to choose from.  Items offered are aesthetically pleasing and tasty.  The thrstar rating is for the lack of care on the staff who not only are bad at serving, they also do not wear name tags.   Lastly, we saw a fly landing all over the pastries, and the staff was not concerned about it at all."}
{"text":"We had gelato. It was good, but it was too heavy/creamy for gelato. The cakes and cookies looked pretty, so the next time I am in NV, I will try it.   3 stars for gelato."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. It's mandatory to provide a glass of water with espresso, if the buyer ask about it!!! They forced me to buy a bottle of water! The same story happened with my dad. We're completely frustrated, although bought only 4 items and spent approximately $33!!!!! THE HIGHWAY ROBBERY..."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous!!! Service levels needs much improvement!"}
{"text":"I don't know if there's anything I can say about this place that doesn't already come across in the pictures.  The pastries are fabulous.  They also have sandwiches that are great for taking back out to the pool or just eating right there.   The drink prices are a little higher than you'd expect - the Aria is one of the only casinos on the strip that doesn't have a Starbucks, so your run of the mill chai latte will run you around $6 bucks as opposed to $4 at Starbucks.  But you really do get what you pay for - I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"The desserts are great (that's why 2 stars),  but every other thing on the menu is premade and microwaved and tastes awful. For $10???  McDonalds does it better and higher quality for $1...    Been to the Aria for 3 years now and this resturant still sucks. Plenty of better places to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is good, BUT the service is horrific. Servers in the \"chocolates\" side was awful. I overheard a man tell the sever, \"Be honest, do you have any interest in me, because I felt like you took extra time to make sure my sandwich was good.\" After he left, we asked that same lady about the pricing on macarons because there was no pricing for it anywhere only the chocolates and she quickly said something and left to the back and never came back. We proceeded to wait a good ten minutes to be serviced by a man that would rather be restocking, (they seriously had no other clients). Also, when we were finally serviced they were so rude and barely answered our questions. When he got our food for us, he made us feel like we were an annoyance to his \"busy\" day. The only reason why I gave two stars was because the food at least deserved that. Otherwise, I'd give them zero stars if I could. My boyfriend and I had heard so many good things about this place so we decided to give it a try and were willing to pay to try a bunch of their items, but for the price and awful service, you're better off spending your money elsewhere. We bought two sandwiches, five macrons, a raspberry tart, and a chocolate croissant totaling almost $60. We weren't even able to enjoy it because we were so upset with the service."}
{"text":"I am in the Bellagio drinking coffee...who cares how good the coffee is and the pastry. BTW both were good...time to explore now;)"}
{"text":"A beautiful cascading chocolate fountain sets the scene for this hip chocolate laden patisserie...in one three-day stint at the Bellagio I think I ate here at least 4 times. The gelato is unbelievably creamy and the ultimate way to beat LV's desert heat. Crepes are also a wonderful treat; very decadent and with a variety of creative fillings. If you are trying to be at least semi-health concious, the sugar free chocolate Napoleon is an excellent choice- so rich you won't even realize the lack of sugar!"}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S . All the pastries are scrumptious , end of story . It may seem a little pricey to stop and get some brekkie there but you have to know how to order ... Don't fall for the $9 bottle of water but indulge in the flaky goodness and sticky fun of a caramel pecan roll or dive into the Nutella crepe . The coffee is brewed very strong so if your into lighter roast opt for half decaf / half reg but enjoy !"}
{"text":"crep ini yemelisin hicbir sey yemesen bile çikolata selalesini gormek için gitmelisin!"}
{"text":"They are doing something really crazy the gelato is not only tastless but one scoop or two you always pay for two,is'nt  that orrible ? Maybe we should get the two scoops we pay for and just waisted ,the manager says she doesn't make the rules \"this is JEAN PHILIPPE!!! TRY TO DO THIS IN FRANCE,LET ME NOW..."}
{"text":"Overhyped pastry shop with 20-30 minute long lines and average at best products. I tried both locations, Aria and Bellagio, and was not very impressed with the food or its customer service. Both places are decorated beautifully with colorful cake displays and chocolate fountains which helps draw the throngs of people standing in line. The food is pretty average however.  I tried the Nutella brioche, almond croissant, blueberry danish, tropical smoothly and cafe mocha-all for a whopping $50 and was very disappointed. The Nutella brioche was stale and cold, the almond croissant was soggy and the cafe mocha tasted like warm milk sweetened with sugar, no flavor whatsoever for a $6 coffee. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Superfun place! Check out my in-depth review (especially about the crepes) here:  http://dessertobsessed.com/2009/10/10/las-vegas-dessert-tour-worlds-largest-chocolate-fountain/"}
{"text":"There is always a long line and looks popular so we thought we had to try it. Well, not impressed. Deserts, pastries, candy are good to buy but for breakfast not impressed. People were kinda rude and its basically like a drive through. No eye contact, or good morning or welcome, just a \"next! What do u want.\" Karen and Courtney helped us, not very happy looking workers."}
{"text":"Note: My review is based on their pastries and desserts and chocolates.  I read a lot of good reviews on their crepes but my rating is not based on crepes, since I have not tried that.  I am a big fan of sweets and desserts...but I find this place overrated.  The desserts are beautiful to look at but taste just ok.  $8 ea.  Pastries $5 ea.  Chocolate syrup in a bottle for $16 ea.  Chocolate spread and peanut butter spread $12 ea.  I didn't mind the prices if they were really good...but they were not that special.  Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Pastries were pretty good, but 5 dollar coffee and you don't have any cream or half and half right now or for the next 3 hours?  I don't mean to seem needy, but it doesn't seem like too much to ask to have something thicker than milk to put in my coffee.  Especially when they leave you two and a half fingers of room for cream .  Sorry, I mean milk.  Did I mention they didn't have cream?"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by for a quick snack after some lounging by the pool. There were 8 of us and I have to say everything we ordered looked much better then it tasted! It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. I found the food to be mediocore at best.    The place it's self is a treat for the eyes but looks aren't everything and Jean Philippe Patisserie proves it!"}
{"text":"Had the salmon sand which, it's probably me, but I wasn't into it at all. I couldn't finish it. The coffee was the bigger disappointment. My wife and I each got a drink, mine was crazy full of foam and my wife didn't get any at all. Kind of seemed like it just came out of a machine. A lot of sugar and not a lot of craft. Servers were kind of all business as well, not friendly like the rest of Aria's staff. Nice dining area though."}
{"text":"First thing you will notice is their insane chocolate fountain hidden behind a thick layer of glass. Apparently it is the world's largest chocolate fountain in existence.   In any case, gelato and crepes are top-notch. Prices are on point given how expensive Vegas has become. Worth a stop if you need a break from the hustle and bustle of the casino floor."}
{"text":"I always stop by Jean Philippe Patisserie inside the Bellagio hotel every time I am in Las Vegas. I don't mind the line up as it gives me a chance to look at all the intricate desserts and savoury offerings. This is like my version of the Oxygen Bar. The sight and senses refreshes me after a long day of walking and shopping. My favourite items are the chocolate croissants, ham and cheese croissants, fresh fruit crepes,  mille feuille and tiny mousse cakes. They also serve coffee, salads and sandwiches. The prices are reasonable for Las Vegas. This place makes me smile like a cat every time I am there!  Don't forget to ohh and ahh over the large chocolate fountain :)"}
{"text":"No chocolate waterfall, but I like the deli layout at the Aria location. Reasonably priced sandwich and salads. I always get a desert and coffee."}
{"text":"Came here one night just before they closed, and while I should know better than to order food from a Patisserie, I ordered food anyway.  I got a Cobb Salad, that was pre-made, and had probably been sitting there for hours.  It only came with Blue Cheese Dressing, and while that normally isnt a problem, there was already a ton of blue cheese on the salad itself, and I felt like it was a blue cheese overload.  My friend ordered the Roast Beef sandwich, which had also probably been sitting there for hours, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Either that or he was just SUPER hungry.  After our food, we decided to try some crepes.  We ordered a savory crepe with chicken and mushrooms, that was just so-so. The crepe was good, but the chicken and mushroom was more liquid than anything, and the flavor was just so-so.  We also ordered a bananas fosters crepe, that was also just mediocre.  Again the crepe itself was good, but there was only a small serving of bananas fosters on top.  The bananas were inconsistent, some were hard and others were too mushy.  The flavor was just so-so.  While I probably could not make a crepe as good as the one from here, I could definitely make better bananas fosters.   I'm not writing this place off completely, as I would probably come back to try something that they are better known for."}
{"text":"This place was decent. I ordered a berry crepe which I thought was way too sweet. My friend ordered an omelet which needed more flavor."}
{"text":"This review is based on their crepes only.  Very flavorful and fresh crepes.  I enjoyed the berry crepe, the exotic one was a bit too sweet for me. Will be back to try out the other pastries and goods!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. Friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Fun to visit. I tried Salmon crepe."}
{"text":"The pastries were OK (I'm a pastry chef myself, so I can make the same stuff), but the service is terrible. Bored looking workers, no acknowledgement when you get to the counter. No hello, no smile, just give me your money. Took 10 minutes to get two items that just needed to be put in a box. And it wasn't from being busy, I saw a lot of screwing off. I get that working in customer service in Vegas can be trying, I wouldn't do it. But, I paid $15 for two small pastries, is curtesy to much to ask?"}
{"text":"I have only tried their ice cream, it was really good, and they have different favors that I haven't tried before, they are always busy as a result of the high number of people trying to see the chocolate fountain, but they do serve people super fast and they really do a good job, my parents did try their pastries and hot drinks and they were also satisfied. Worth every penny. I just wish it had more space."}
{"text":"COCONUT GELATO. I am eating it at this very moment... so. good. Every single bite is filled with loads of shredded coconut and creamy goodness. If you like coconut, order this and you will not be disappointed!  I have also tried:  - Almond croissant: very large croissant and in every bite you get flaky layers with almond paste, even at the very ends. Sliced almonds on top. Perfect.  - Crepes (souffle with apple compote, chocolate, and some savory one I don't remember): The sweet crepes are so decadent! Can't go wrong with any of them. The savory crepe is just alright.  - Vanilla latte: $6 for a small. Nothing special.  I've been to both the Bellagio and Aria locations, both serve the same items. The employees are very nice, always smiling, never seem impatient or annoyed. I once dropped and broke a glass of chocolate sauce on accident and they only joked with me and didn't get angry at all, even though I felt terrible. I prefer the Aria because it has the dining area, but the chocolate fountain at the Bellagio is still fun to look at.  That this is located right next to the guest elevators in Aria... oh man. I walk by this three times a day and I want to eat everything!!!"}
{"text":"If you love french pastry this is one place that you will definitely have to check out.  I would recommend their raspberry and strawberry tarts.  It's a little bit pricey (over $8 a piece) but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! The baked goods are all authentic French (I know cuz I'm French).  Some favorites: -The pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant) -The Palmier -The Croissant aux amandes (Almond croissant)  -Their curry chicken sandwich YUMMMMM! I wish I could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast. The line was fairly long and service was fairly slow. Two of us got a coffee and one of their forest crepes. The food was absolutely worth the wait. They were enormous, delicious, and competent stuffed with meat, veggies, and cheese. Excellent place if you're staying in the Aria and don't want to stray too far. Not much seating available unfortunately, so avoiding it at busy times may be a good decision."}
{"text":"Love the shop!  Lots of goodies to drool over and the humongous chocolate fountain is a great photo op..especially for chocolate lovers. Jean Phillippe was one of my stops when a friend and I did our \"macaron challenge\" during our last trip to Vegas.  So, my review is really only for the rose macaron, which is the only thing that we ordered.  There were other pre-packaged macarons there, but we wanted the pretty one behind the window.  The only one they had was a rose macaron.  It was huge and was really pretty..almost too pretty to eat.  Unfortunately, Jean Philippe's rose macaron did not fare too well against the macarons we had from other patisseries along the strip.  It's probably not a good comparison though because it's ROSE flavored.  Duh...it tasted like rose.  I know some people love it, but I don't really like my pastries tasting like lotion, which is exactly what it tasted like.  Lesson learned...so much for being a lil adventurous.  Next time I visit Jean Philippe, I'll stick to flavors a little more traditional."}
{"text":"I think this is the one Aria.  There's another one in Bellagio next door.  Had the prosciutto sandwich, their breakfast sandwich, and some chocolate dessert (forgot what it was but just ask the servers what they recommend and they will give you that).  All were very delicious.  Great eat inside Aria.  Kinda pricey for the food, but hey, its Vegas."}
{"text":"If you're in the vicinity of the Bellagio, its definitely worth a stop. (There is also one in the Aria). Be forewarned, it is pricey.  But still worth the coinage for some yummy (though small) desserts.  They also have crepes and some other savory items.  The \"Intense\" chocolate mousse was very good...the strawberry tart was not quite traditional with a strong almond flavor (not my fave, but still good).  Even if you don't want to spend money, they have what is supposedly the world's tallest chocolate fountain, displayed on beautiful glass plates.  When you're there, be sure to stand back (like towards the gift shop) to take in the beauty of the whole store.  And, of course, there are chocolates you can buy and take back to your peeps back home--or for yourself to savor the memories.  And if that's not enough, you can shop online, too!"}
{"text":"I have never met a cake I didn't like at this place. Everything here is so good! The cakes, truffles, gelatos and crepes are all good and yes, I tried all of these! This store is my frenemy!"}
{"text":"Habe hier meinen morgendlichen Rundgang durch das Hotel begonnen mit Kaffee und Gebäck. Ein bisschen zu teuer aber sehr lecker - auch die deftigen Sachen. Kaffee war konstant gut."}
{"text":"Best pastries I've ever had in my life! Pricey but definitely worth it. Not to mention the design and quality that goes into them. Recommend to anyone going to the Aria to stop by there and pick up something sweet."}
{"text":"Two words: Rose Macarons!  Ok, their other desserts are fabulous as well.  Just don't get the crepes (savory or sweet).  This place is what any business or person should aspire to be: detailed, refined, beautiful, clean, amazing..."}
{"text":"The manager jasmine decided to talk to an employee for 5 minutes before greeting us to take our order. Then was completely rude while taking the order. I guess the employees conversation was much more important than a guest's order.. won't be returning !"}
{"text":"Came here last night after having an early dinner at the other end of the strip and yet again, despite the fact that my favorite croissant was sold out, I ordered a cheese Danish and the taste was still fantastic even though it had been made earlier in the day.  OAN - I passed by JP's other location in the Bellagio which is much smaller although they do have a nice flowing chocolate fall display. If you have never been to the JP locations, I recommend going to the one in the Aria to get the full \"sweets\" experience!  In closing, for those of you who live in the San Francisco area, this particular location probably rivals Belinda Leong's patisserie in the Upper Fillmore area of the city."}
{"text":"5 stars for their gelato. I have not tried anything else here.  We were checking out the Aria hotel, and wandering around, we saw the amazing cake displays at this little sweet shop/cafe. To my surprise they were selling gelato, which got me excited because the day before, I was not willing to spend $8 on a 2-scoop ice cream cone somewhere else.  I tried their tiramisu and dulce de leche gelato (2 scoops in a cup =~$5). The tiramisu was HEAVEN in a cup. The dulce de leche was good as well but a little too sweet at the end, my throat almost hurt. But hey, 2 scoops for $5 is a pretty good deal, especially in Las Vegas!! I would so come here again for gelato!"}
{"text":"We came here for a design convention and had to check out what the Aria was all about. Blown away by the ambiance of this little dessert place.  They had gelato, pastries, crepes and anything that can cure a sweet tooth.  I shared a nutella crepe and had them add strawberries for $2!!! A crepe for $15, better be amazing and it was!!!  The crepe was drizzled with nutella and on top they put powdered sugar and chocolate shavings with whipped cream. Can we say pure gluttony."}
{"text":"ZoMG! Absolutely best savory crepe I've ever eaten - the Italian @ Jean Phillipe. Sautéed zucchini, juicy roasted slices of grilled tomatoes, perfect ricotta cream sauce, topped off w/ pesto & mountains of prosciutto on a buckwheat crepe."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is  3 at most. Sure the food is a 5 but the service is truly lacking. The employees don't seem to be engaged with the customer. They're just in their own worlds, ignoring the customer. We had to remind them just to give us water and we had to tell them to change the cake because they gave us the wrong order. But otherwise the cakes were good."}
{"text":"They serve THE BEST crepes!!  I had tried all their flavors in these past few years, you couldn't go wrong with any of them!  I feel something is missing if I don't go there during my Vegas trip!!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for good coffee - it's just machine. Pastries look incredible but not a gourmet coffee spot."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, gelato! Our eyeballs lit up as we were on our way to our room. BFF and I were tired and had just withstood what seemed the longest and most agonizing flight to Vegas. Gelato was our answer to our late snack hunger. We each had two scoops with two flavors. Straciatella and dulce de leche for moi, mmmmmm.  Trio chocolate fountain--we only took notice of it the next day since I guess we were so out of it from the night before. Disgustingly beautiful and looked sooo yummy!  We just loved this place. We just had to get our final dose of sugar before we left. Tiramisu in a shot glass for BFF and banana foster crepe for me...we were late to meet our shuttle ride but dessert was worth it."}
{"text":"Cute and huge selection of sweets and desserts!! Some can also be given as gifts :)   They have a good amount of small meals/ deli snacks as well: bagels, sandwiches, salads, etc. this place is convenient if you're cruising through the Aria hotel and want a quick bite to eat or are craving a sweet treat :)"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for a crepe but worth the $.  Doesn't look like much at first but filling nonetheless.  The bananas foster crepe was not too sweet as most dessert crepes I've had.  A great place if you are into crepes and need a quick bite in Aria."}
{"text":"I stop here every time I'm in Vegas! One of the best pastry shops around. Their chocolate croissant is to die for."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service.    Crepes were excellent!!    Wife had Iced Mocha which was very good as well.  Iced Caramel Macchiato just tasted like black coffee with a touch of milk.  No caramel flavor.  Bit pricey...but worth it!"}
{"text":"A rare miss for an otherwise amazing if predictable chocolatier. After waiting in line for 30 minutes; I was greeted by an indifferent staff and rewarded with a day old pastry that should have been withdrawn. I'll give them another chance the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Chocolate streams - dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate. That's what you'll find here. Right before dinner we were wandering around in Bellagio and came upon this place. It's dessert galore - cookies, cakes, chocolates, crepes, chocolate covered items...I had to restrain myself from buying 1 of each. All I needed was something chocolate-y. I ended up buying the chocolate coconut tuile - thin crispy wafers covered in chocolate. This one will be hard to share and I will savor every cookie. At $16 a container it's an expensive treat but I chose well. If not for dinner - I would have tried a crepe. But there's always next time to walk around and dream of dipping strawberries and rice krispy treats in the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"WOW!  That is a HUGE fountain.  Of chocolate!!  But no one can eat it .  Probably a good thing, who knows what it would taste like since it has probably been doing that for years.   Yummy pastries, and gellato.  Pricey, but you're in the Bellagio!    The kids had vanilla gellato and we split a napoleon.   Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Worst Customer service ever!!! Bad bad experience with the store manager and one of their employees. I can't believe a store like this will argue a $2 extra for Chocolate sauce! I paid for it, never got it, and was asked to show an ID with my receipt!  My mouth just dropped to hear it and walked Way.  The sad part the store manager. Britney asked me to do so...  Shame on YOU.....  Store needs to learn how to treat customers in America......"}
{"text":"This was usually my go to place for breakfast and crepes during my stay in Vegas.  Very yummy sweet and savoury crepes.  Awe...and the desserts can give you a sugar high just by staring at them.  I donno, it can be a very dangerous place to be at just staring at all the delicious food.  It's so true that sometimes the 'eyes can be bigger than the stomach'."}
{"text":"I love this location in comparison to the Bellagio one.  This one has a really good design for seating, while at Bellagio, everyone is fighting for a seat at the limited 3 tables that are off to the side of the shop that are always occupied or the chairs have been dragged to another table so that a family of 6 can dine at a table for 2.  Their selection of sweets aren't are large as at the Bellagio, but for a quick bite this location suffices.  Not to mention it's not far from the sky suites lobby.  I love their crepes, the savory ones comes with a small side salad with a nice vinaigrette dressing.  I always get a box of their truffles to take home with me.  They're so smooth and creamy!"}
{"text":"I adore jean phillipe. everything here is so decadent, and has such great presentation, but my fave location is the bellagio one. this one is more spaced out then the former, but i dont feel it serve the same goodies as the bellagio does,extra points for having a dining area. the dulce de leche gelato is to die for, the chocalate chip cookies are heaven as well as the sugar cookies. next time i ust try the crepes they look to delish."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must try! Being a big huge addictive fan of French pastry, I've always crave for more explosion when travel. Came here on the 2nd day of trip before heading to Zipline, ordered a Almond croissant, Plain croissant, breakfast sandwich more like a French toast panini w porched egg and turkey=yum)   Great quality Croissant, buttery flakey and really big. A $4.00 pastry, it's well worth it. Breakfast hours is always pack of people. If you want pastries - cake, it starts to serve after breakfast hours. Of course, don't expect to just arrive there and order cuz the lunch/tea time or even till 9pm, the lines are always there! Still it's well worth it.   Highly recom-  Rose macaroon, Nutella Napoleon, and Tiramisu dessert cup!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, not only for their lovely desserts but also for the gorgeous chocolate fountain that adorns this JPP location.  For the amazing food they have, getting through their line buffet-style is relatively quick.  Their hours are also very convenient.  Choosing between what types of sweets to eat can be difficult due to the variety of sweets available -- I highly recommend the lemon pie and chocolate cakes, or the trio if you can't decide.  I've been here a few times, the latest being during halloween.  They really decked out the place with halloween decor, just like the accompanying garden."}
{"text":"I was pleased to find that this was one of the few places open late after attending my Zarkana performance (especially pleased as I am familiar with JPP from the Bellagio).  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they serve sandwiches and other savory foods as well, so its a great place for a bite after other restaurants have closed.  I tried a little of a few different things: the sweet trio, nutella napoleon, and strawberry cupcake.  The sweet trio is probably the best value and the one I'd recommend most.  It was sweet but not too sweet, soft, and delicious.  The nutella napoleon was very delicate, but also very dark chocolate and rich.  Slightly crunchy, I doubt that if you got this one to-go that it would last with the proper texture to your room.  The strawberry cupcake was okay, but too tart for my tastes.  Overall, I was pleased with the variety of desserts they have here, just like the original JPP.  If you have a sweet tooth or want to get a delicious souvenir for someone with a sweet tooth, this is a perfect place to get it."}
{"text":"The cakes are good in almost every way posssible - taste, flavors, presentation. And the location right in the casino with all the lights and the high chairs is very fulfilling."}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with the Raspberry Cheese cake!!! It is by far the best cheese cake ever!! Trust me on that! Must visit. Only downside; few tables!!"}
{"text":"Bumping up the rating here! I've finally got around to trying *most* of the pastries here, I haven't started on the gelato or crepes yet!  This place is sweet tooth heaven(given, they have items for the not so sweet fanatic)! Everything, and I mean everything is delicious. Most of the pastries are 6.50 and up. But its well worth every penny because its never a miss. No disappointment yet! The fruits they use are always sweet, not too much fruit or too little. Also not too much of the crust or fillings in the selections. They also have a selection of chocolates which I haven't tried ...yet! But if you do decide to get some chocolate, its 2$ a piece. Crepes are made to order, and ranges from 8-11$ with add ons, like gelato/ice cream for 2$ more. Gelato/ice cream has some variety, not exactly baskin robins with 31 flavors, but they have the regular fruity flavors, to pistachio, and popular flavors. One scoop is about a size of those stress balls, which comes in for about 3$ and more scoops for more.  They also have boxed treats available for purchase too, like cookies, sugared gummies, chocolate shaped shoes, and dry caramelized popcorn.   If you ever have time, make sure to drop by! To go, comes in a nice box to carry your treats, or stay and eat there, they have a comfortable area sit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for exquisite pastries and to-die-for gelato, Jean Philippe Patisserie is your place.  There always seems to be a crowd oohing and aahing over the flowing chocolate display, which is indeed quite mesmerizing.  I know I spent a good minute or so just staring at all the cascading chocolate and wondering how exactly the whole system worked.  In any case, the chocolate waterfall is what draws you in, but its the gelato, crepes, and pastries that make you stay.  We got some gelato- the pistachio and the banana.  The pistachio was just okay- they had whole nuts in the gelato, but they were a little stale and rubbery.  The banana, though, was amazing- full of rich, banana flavor with little chunks of banana and caramel.  All in all, the banana was, as they say, the bomb.  At $4.75 for one scoop and 75 cents additional for another flavor, the gelato was a tad pricey but not as bad as the gelato store in the Forum stores, which charged $6 for a small and $13 for a large (!).  We also decided to get some of the pastries, which looked more like miniature works of art than little cakes.  We decided to get the Imperial, which was some kind of insanely good chocolate cake with chocolate mousse, topped with a chocolate crisp, and covered with chocolate ganache.  The exact ingredients elude me, but they all added together to make heaven on earth.    Because of my obsession with carrot cake, we also got their version, which featured a coconut/pineapple cream cheese frosting.  I couldn't really taste the tropical flavor, but it was still a delicious cake.  The cake was very moist and not overly sweet.  Decoratively, the cake was beautiful, featuring a ruffled white chocolate fan with orange accents, a little marzipan carrot and gold foil.      What adds additional points in my book is that they offer sugar-free pastries as well.  When we were there, they offered three choices- a fruit tart, a raspberry napoleon, and a chocolate cake of some sort.  We decided on the fruit tart, which looked beautiful, with delicately sliced and arranged fruit.  I'm not sure how it tasted, since my dad and uncle were the ones who ate it.  Overall, a patisserie that features delicious baked goods, as well as chocolates.  While we were there, the man himself, Jean Philippe, showed up and walked through the cafe to the back!  Very cool.  I didn't get a chance to try the crepes, since we were full from the gelato and pastries, but those will be up the next time I'm back.  This place is definitely on my go-to list for Vegas!"}
{"text":"The selection of pastries is enough to keep you mesmerized for an hour trying to decide which to eat.  I had a delicious prosciutto panini for lunch here which was piping hot. I also took a cherry danish for a late night eat which was equally delicious. I recommend a stop in for a quick bite if needed!"}
{"text":"this place is sweet tooth heaven! okay, i didn't get to try anything here (too stuffed at the time) but i'm pretty sure that it tastes as delectable as it looks! they have crepes (sweet and savory), cookies, candy, chocolate, pastries, cakes...you name it, they got it! they also have a cool cascading chocolate fountain that you can oogle at."}
{"text":"What's not to love about French passteries or gelato. The mango gelato is one of my favorites. Only reason they get 4 stars is their beignets. Disneyland has better... sadly. But everything else is great."}
{"text":"Like the other JPP in the Bellagio, the pastry is undoubtedly gorgeous and awe inspiring.  The pastries look like little works of art.  This location doesn't have the record-breaking chocolate waterfall, but I feel is more spacious and modern, easier to access when there's no tourists crowding around the waterfall.   The paninis are beautiful, but you can tell the lettuce gets soggy and the tomatoes do too when they're sitting in a case, waiting to be pressed.  Same with the salads.  So, so beautifully composed, but again, like the supermarket, have been sitting in their little plastic clamshell containers for hours.   Don't get me wrong.  The desserts are tasty-- the crepes delectable and fresh, the pastries, attractive.  But sometimes, you can tell they've been sitting out awhile.  The fruit tarts had fruits that started to soften below their clear glaze.  The pastry crusts slightly chewy, not crisp.   Overall, it's more of an experience than anything.  For $6.90+ tax for a tiny two-bite pastry is a bit over the top...but again, you're in Vegas, and somebody's gotta pay for the extravagance."}
{"text":"It was quite confusing at first as there was somewhat of a long line that starts from the cashiers and circles their work station (it's in the shape of a circle).   We wanted good dessert after our meal at Lago and found this place online with good reviews and photos of mini cakes - obviously, we got really excited! After waiting in line for about 10-15 minutes, it was our turn to order and we got two mini cakes and two pastries: raspberry intense cake, opera, blueberry tart-like pastry, and the raspberry jelly filled donut. (Their coffee is just made from a machine, so we decided to go somewhere else for coffee!)  The raspberry intense cake was really underwhelming - it had more of a chocolate taste and not enough raspberry flavors. It had a type of chocolate mouse with a hint of tiramisu styled bread on the insides (but not soggy, which was great!), which wasn't what we were expecting from it's name. The opera was good, but I'm not sure I'd order it again as it was too heavy for me - chocolate-wise, not the texture. This one made me really thirsty! The blueberry tart-like pastry was really great - we ate this a day after and it was still good, so I assume that if you eat it fresh then it's even better! The jelly filled donut was delicious as well, with good quality filling and slightly sweet and sour sugar as coating. I am not a fan of jelly filled donuts, but this one did the trick!  The place isn't that easily located as it's within a hallway towards the end of the hotel (google map it!). All in all, it was a pretty good dessert spot (with some waiting and not enough tables/seats on the inside nor the immediate outer surroundings as it's a popular store), but as with anything else in Vegas, we felt that it was over-priced. The total was around $28 for the 4 pieces! Not a huge deduct for that though, because everything in Vegas is over-priced - half of the desserts that we had made up for this, hence the four star. I'd probably go again (only if I were near it) for the pastries, but not so sure about the mini cakes anymore. Who am I kidding - I'll still probably try a different mini cake too if I'm there again! (Maybe with less anticipation though)."}
{"text":"This review is for the crepes only.  DELICIOUS!!  The best crepes I've had -- soft and tasty.  Had the dulce de leche this time, which was heaven (but very sweet so have some water handy).  Almost picked a hole-in-the-wall crepe place instead (to support local business), but I'm glad we came here instead.  The only con is that they don't wash their fruit so don't order anything with fruit in it -- I was watching the lady make a crepe for someone else and she just dumped a pack of raspberries (straight from the plastic container like when you buy it from the grocery store) right on the the crepes without washing the fruit first...eeewww."}
{"text":"the Nutella Brioche is nothing short of resplendent. I had to pause various times to ensure I was savouring it properly. The almond croissant was also very good and quite frankly left me impressed with the quality of Las Vegas pastries. While i do not dare say they rival numerous Patisseries in Paris they do a great job. The raspberry macaron was also delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here.   The only note of caution i would share is that everything here is expensive. $4+ for a croissant or $10+ for a crepe is very steep, so hopefully you did well at the slot machine the night before...  The chocolate fountain (more like waterfall) is free to look at however.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed looking at everything and I mean everything that was made out of chocolate!   Amazing work!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just got back from staying at the Aria. On our last day I went down to get us some food from this place, to bring back up to our hotel room. After waiting almost half an hour, dealing with the rude obnoxious people behind the counter, and the highly overpriced food that was not worth it, I would never eat here again. The girl behind the counter was so rude to customers while I was waiting. One lady was circling just to peek at what was in the containers, and she was barked at to get back, there's is a line. I heard the woman explain to her husband how rude that was. She was right. Another man was just peeking, and wasn't sure where the line was, because it is not clearly marked, and she barked at him too. For how much we have to spend per night to stay at this hotel, I was appalled at the service here. Completely unprofessional and rude. Your food isn't worth half the price you are charging, and your service ruins everything for everyone. We have a lot of friends that are planning on staying at the Aria, and I will make sure each and every one of them knows about how terrible the service was here."}
{"text":"Beautiful little patisserie.  Whimsical cake statues and little boxes of candies cover this small space.  The gelato caught my eye immediately and I tried several flavors over the few nights I stayed at the Aria.  They were all very good and fairly cheap for Vegas!  The gelato containers are well filled and look luxurious.  I had a waffle cone with cheesecake gelato and it was creamy and rich.  The cone was a nice crunch.  I also tried the bright green pistachio and it was nutty and delicious.  My favorite was the lemon gelato I had after a big meal and it was light and citrousy and the texture was similar to an Italian ice.  But of course creamier.  The crepe's looked well made and very good too.  The one star subtraction was for their coffee.  I grabbed a black coffee before heading out and it tasted a little burnt and bitter.  It smelled ok and was hot but I think maybe it had sat too long?  Otherwise, great little place."}
{"text":"Woah dude, whats with the chocolate fountain. Even in the debaucherous city that is Vegas, that thing stood out as way too sinful. Didn't feel like chocolate at 3pm ,so ordered the chicken tomato panini. Not impressed at all, although I did see others enjoying their sweet crepes and the various brioches at display looked nice. Does it really cost the Bellagio so much to stock orange juice to justify pricing a small glass at $6, I don't think so!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I love this place and can't stop thinking about it.  Perfection in both the pastries and savoury foods.    Croissant and Chocolate Croissant - both very flaky and buttery.  The chocolate had great bittersweet chocolate nestled in the middle.  I think they were the best croissants I have ever eaten.    Chicken Cobb Salad:  Very fresh produce, shredded crisp lettuce, with perfectly poached chicken breast (very tender and moist).  Sables:  Yummy buttery cookies that are mild in sweetness and have a sandy texture.  Very addictive and roughly a dollar a piece.  They sell in packs of 10 and a tube of 20.    Fruit salad - consisted of mixed berries, cantaloupe, honeydew and pineapple.  Everything was sweet, fresh and neatly cubed (melons).  I was very content while eating this on the plane and had some jealous onlookers.    The sandwiches looked very tasty too, but I was really craving a salad for lunch.    Warning: Go early or they will sell out!!  I went back at 5 to pick up some dinner for the flight and boo, almost everything was gone."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit it, I have a weakness for almond croissants and other fancy little desserts, but Jean Philippe Patisserie surpassed my expectations! It was a fab way to start off the day and then the airplane meal package was amazing!"}
{"text":"First off, they have the guiness book of world records largest cgocolate fountain.  Bf discovered that the window it's behind is made up or multiple panes with gaps in between.  Needless to say, we looked strange sniffing the choclate decadence through the gaps.  Hahahah.  Crepe: got the nutella with strawberries.  Omg so good!  They were generous witht the nutella, the crepe was perfectly thin and they gave a generous dollop of fluffy whipped cream.  So yummy!  Brioche -nutella and dulce de leche: to die for.  Will be aure to get some before i go home.  So much nutella dn dulce de leche in both.  Wish i extra bread, that's how much filling there was!   Roast beef sandwich: bf claims was delicious.  Disappeared down his gullet before i could take a nibble.  I guess that says smthg?  Hot caprese panini: pretty good.  The sauce (pesto?) Was superb.  Bread nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Just the right amt of tomatoes ... didn't taste any basil ... and the mozarella was a little too chewy for my tastes but i did like how it stretched.  Oveall, really good place.  Going to try the chocolate and almond croissants everyone raves about soon.  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Delicious dessert choices. We had the white chocolate cheesecake which was divine, the raspberry and chocolate cupcake. All had great textures and flavors"}
{"text":"It's no surprise that I have a sweet tooth, given the crazy amount of pictures I took at Jean Philippe Patisserie.  It's just that everything looked so pretty AND tasty that I had to take document it all!  Unfortunately I didn't get to try much.  We ordered a sugar brioche, almond brioche and almond croissant.  Every single thing was very light yet still rich with flavor (and probably butter and sugar).  The almond brioche and croissants were especially pleasing, given the copious quantities of almonds and almond paste/marzipan, which I love.  The croissant was flaky and not rubbery, much better than what you'd get at typical bakeries or grocery store pastry counters.  We took them to go, and they were still delicious after a plane ride home back to San Jose.  Kinda pricey but I wasn't shocked.  It is Vegas, and it is fancy-ish.  Would go back again next time to try the crepes and gelato."}
{"text":"I got my daughter the macaroons and she said they were best she ever had and she is a macaroon expert. Next time I might try something for me."}
{"text":"They have a large selection of baked goods and pastries. I have tried a few things from here and I have been impressed for the most part. Later in the day, they do tend to run out of many of their items. When I want a macaroon, I want a macaroon!!"}
{"text":"The absolutely best crepes! We tired both sweet and savory. The apple pie one is to die for!! Definitely made sure we passed by everyday, ironic right? Reasonably priced for the quality and taste. Would recommend to stop by once, or multiple times, during your trip."}
{"text":"An outstanding experience. I am not sure about the comments about the servers. On all of our visits here they were extremely friendly. The croissants are the best ever. We had a turkey croissant sandwich and it was amazing. Contrary to some Yelp comments, the sandwiches are quite good here. The truffles are also extraordinary. Today I tried the apple strudel and it was perfect in every respect: the crust was flaky, the apples perfectly cooked, and the cinnamon was just right."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but good chocolate.  I'm a self-confessed chocolate snob.   and French chocs are my fav.  It costs $2 for a tiny piece of  dk choc pistachio from their case.  It was creamy with a hint of pistachio but I wouldn't go running to the store as a must have.  Hubby had a choc ganache and Jr. Yelper had salted caramel.  After spending $6 for 3 tiny pieces, I felt jipped.  They have gorgeous displays of their chocolate sculptures, museum quality works of art.  The desserts looked great too."}
{"text":"The crepes here are fabulous! The nutella chocolate one is a great dessert w/ a cafe mocha on the side. All the small desserts are great and the price isn't too steep for being on the Strip."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for desserts!! Their literally the prettiest & tastiest dessert I have EVER had!! Don't miss out!!!!"}
{"text":"I do not care how amazing the food is, I ABHOR waiting in lines for it. especially when the food is not that amazing. those TVs behind the counters playing videos do not fool me. I am not that easily entertained.  steer away from the crepes -- they're overpriced and not worth the wait. the pastries are disasters.  the coffee and espresso drinks, however, are delicious. as are the myriad of pre-packaged goods. the palmiers, in particular, make for a perfect buttery late night snack."}
{"text":"Can't decide what to get. Everything is so good. Love their specialty coffee and fresh baked goodies. It's always a treat stay at Aria."}
{"text":"I'll be back.  I can only give it 4 stars because we only had one item from here.  My review might change upon a revisit.  Awesome place to get some sugar in you and people watch for a little bit.  Had the mousse."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to finish our date with something sweet...end of story! Got the brioche with crepe souffle ... Yum-o! Awesome staff too!! Highly recommend this place if you just want to chillax."}
{"text":"Jean Phillips is in a secluded part of the ballegio  hotel. It's is a crepe and dessert/ chocolate dig.  It is pricey but they make everything right in front of you and they do a great job. While others are getting filled on buffets and trendy restaurants, I suggest you spend a few more bucks to enjoy this place and it's  fantastic food. It is a very small place  only enough room for you to  get in line and get your food and step out. There is seating along the wall but sitting usually causes more congestion than just getting your stuff and sitting nearby."}
{"text":"Overpriced French bakery.  I ordered the cinnomon bun which was old and hard.  After being disappointed by the price and the quality of the goods I window shopped at other bakeries on the strip  and i saw the same cinnamon bun at another bakery. I came to the conclusion that Jean Philippe Patisserie bakery does not make their own stuff.   The only thing that they have going for them is the chocolate falls that attract tourist like me to paid for overpriced stuff"}
{"text":"OMG. BEST DESSERTS EVER.   We weren't expecting a feast. We just wanted to have some desserts for our post-Secret Pizza meal at the Cosmo. Alas, yelp came to save us.   This place is undoubtedly amazing. We must've ordered at least 7 items between the 4 of us. Everything was amazing except for this crazy dark chocolate cake. The star of the show was the 3 layer cheesecake and the flan!   I would definitely go back again...even at the risk of diabetes."}
{"text":"I have never been to the one at Bellagio. Only the one at Aria. The dining area provided to enjoy these wonderful treats looks like an upscale food court, but in a good way. The plates appear like glass, the silverware looks real, but they're all disposable plastic. Very nice ambiance.   I came here one late night for a sweet tooth fix on the suggestion of a friend. I got the raspberry cheesecake. I love how the cheesecake was encased in a white chocolate envelope. I'm not a fan of strong raspberry flavor, but this was subtle and absolutely divine. This dessert was not overly sweet either. My boyfriend chose the Nutella dessert, which was a few long cuts of puff pastry that sandwiches as well as topped with a light chocolate/Nutella cream. It had the wonderful Nutella flavor and wasn't overtly sweet.  There were so many choices and everything looked so good! It's hard to choose just one. I was overwhelmed by all the chocolate, gelato, croissants, danishes, and sweets available. I need to make more trips to get a taste of everything and to try out the sandwiches and coffee they also offer."}
{"text":"Fresh chocolates, chocolate muffin, regular palmier and croissant were delicious. Being a coffee lover, I really enjoyed the milk chocolate coffee truffle! Visited here three times during our stay in Vegas and the customer service was bad every time."}
{"text":"Everything was gorgeous, coffee was average but croissant and nutella doughnut  were great.  Very busy seating area was small but ample"}
{"text":"I ordered a nutella Napoleon to-go, which was very tasty.. if you love chocolate, it's a must have. The reason this place doesn't get more than 3 stars from me is because the fruit tart I had didn't seem fresh and it had a weird flavor to it. For $7 each  I would expect something good, but it wasn't.  Their service was also just ok..they seemed like they were not excited to be there and they didn't give me a bag for my boxed to-go pastry, I had to ask for one and was given a white plastic one instead of their nice little paper ones.  Anyway the place wasnt busy like I had expected, it has a nice seating area, wide variety of treats and drinks. I might go back and try something different."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their creme brûlée and their chocolate covered strawberries are to die for. Their pastry case is fantastic and I've been able to call in orders ahead if time. Their staff is usually friendly but when they are busy can get frazzled. The only disappointment for me was their cappuccino. I've given it a couples of chances but not a fan."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad. Unfortunately, the staff at the Aria has 0 personality. I asked if they could not put a slice of cheese into the sandwhich I ordered and was informed they are not allowed to alter items. He then told me I could remove the cheese myself (fine, but whatever)... He hands me the sandwhich and the cheese is melted.... Good luck on me removing that....  The crepes aren't too bad. The coffee is generic and tastes like the type you would get at a 7-11 or a wawa.. Seating is terribly cramped and I'm a thin guy. Heaven forbid you have a booty on you!  On a positive note, their plastic silverware looks fancy!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the cheese danish, which we ordered based on previous reviews.  For us, it wasn't much better than something you would get at Panera, and nowhere near the cheese danish from the Bouchon at The Venetian."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the gelato and it was good .... but the place was messy.  I actually had to clean a table just to get a seat.  So not much to write home about .  Cool to see the chocolate fountain but other wise just OK"}
{"text":"This place is WONDERFUL!!!  The gelato is absolutely heavenly.  Their desserts are whimsical and tasty.  I would love to dive into the chocolate fountain.  The only bummer is that the place is too small.  They have a deli on one side and a desserterie on the other side.  They also have a few table that you have to crowd around.  They really need to enlarge the place in order to give the tables and lines the space they need."}
{"text":"I've been to Jean Philippe for years, so it's about time for a review.   This past weekend I decided to try their gelato.  I had the pistachio and hazelnut gelato, and it was very good!  I enjoyed the pistachio more than the hazelnut, but both were delicious!  And it was under $5 for a cup with two scoops of gelato, definitely a bargain compared to the other gelato shops in Vegas!   The crepes here are also delicious, but they are a tad expensive, about $10 if I remember correctly.   They also have a large selection of pastries, which are excellent.  My favorite is their chocolate croissants, it's loaded with chocolate, but it isn't overly sweet!  The butterfly cookies are also excellent.  I have tried their chocolates, which I cannot complain about.  They recently came out with a fruit jelly chocolate, which comes in a pack of 6.  These are excellent fruit chocolates and I would recommend them as a substitute to the regular chocolate truffles.   The prices for pastries and gelato and very reasonable and they taste great.  The crepes are a tad expensive and so are the chocolate varieties, but they won't disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Everything looked amazing, and tasted incredible. The Nutella pastry and hazelnut gelato were  amazing. Crepes and coffee for breakfast were perfect. A must do in Vegas for a decadent treat."}
{"text":"Visited 1/10/16,  Jean Philippe Patisserie - Bellagio has great coffee & great pastries. Great place for a simple breakfast. Crepes are also wonderful for a simple snack.  Any time I'm at the Aria or Bellagio, I make a point to hit this place."}
{"text":"Thanks to a MyVegas reward,we were able to enjoy a couple of comped breakfast pastries. My almond pastry was delicious. Flaky with a wonderful almond paste and little chocolate balls on top. And the employees couldn't have been nicer."}
{"text":"I love their chocolate croissant and cheese roll, each $4 each!!  Yum.  The chocolate croissant is pretty big, too.  The cheese roll/danish is delicious!  My husband got the berry crepe as well, which was ok.  It was kinda tart and came with lots of whipped cream.  I've tried their savory crepes before- forgot which one, but they were delicious!  The crepes are about $10.95, kinda expensive for the size you get.  They have lots and lots of sweets and desserts!  Will have to try their macaron one of these days.  oh yeah, they have the cool-looking chocolate fountain!!"}
{"text":"The cases are full of beautiful looking pastries and the allure of a delicious coffee in the morning is much more inviting than the Starbucks 1 level up...but the pastries don't taste nearly as good as they look (except the chocolate almond croissant :)) and the wait is very long. Coffee is ok, but nothing exciting to talk about...one morning my cappuccino was made like a latte and the next it was made right. Anyhow, it's a better alternative to Starbucks! ;)"}
{"text":"Dulce de leche gelato was rich and so creamy! Also tried the mixed berry which tasted like the most awesome mashup of fresh berries you can imagine.  Great balance of tart but sweet! I definitely want to go back to try the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"A trip to Vegas is never complete without at least one visit to JP Patisserie. Their scrumptious, delectable offerings are beautiful to look at and wonderful to eat, and now, you're able to indulge in these treats all day and all night long since they extended their hours to 24/7."}
{"text":"Great crepes and chocolates. We had the Nutella with strawberry and the cinnamon sugar crepes."}
{"text":"I highly, highly and highly recommend the coconut gelato! It is sooooooooo good! My first time to try a coconut ice cream and this place raised the bar really high cause when i went to other places to try a coconut gelato, nothing compares to this place! I would definitely crave for this whenever im in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried the vanilla eclair and the raspberry tart. Both amazing. If you are looking for a dessert to finish the night, or give you a pep up to keep partying this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries but whatch out for the employees! Your order will be messed up!"}
{"text":"I love love this place. Too bad they don't have one in my area.  I have been to both locations at Aria and Bellagio and both places offer fresh pastries and coffee drinks. I have to say I like the Bellagio location better simply because they have a seating area facing the Bellagio garden/pool area which feels like you're somewhere in Europe enjoying your breakfast. This time, we tried one of their savory crepes - very tasty and creamy. It reminds me of chicken pot pie wrapped with crepe. We also tried the almond croissant which is so flaky, buttery and yummy.  Prices are pretty reasonable for Vegas. Each almond croissant is $4 each, which is the same price they offer at Starbucks! Now, tell me you want the fresh pastries over the factory made muffins."}
{"text":"Pricey but it's a nice little alternative if you just want to grab a snack, coffee or light meal. Reasonably good coffee and cakes here."}
{"text":"Yuuuummmmmmm!  This place is conveniently located right next to the guest elevators enticing you to take a look every time you return to your room.  I got gelato and strawberry shortcake.  The gelato was good.  It taste pretty much like any other gelato I've had.  You get 2 scoops per cup and I think they're pretty generous with their servings.  I tried some of their flavors, but got my usual mint chocolate chip and pistachio.  The pistachio was a strange looking bright green, but tasted good regardless.     The strawberry shortcake was delish nice and fluffy.  It didn't hurt that it was presented nicely as well."}
{"text":"Gelato was rock hard and full of crystals. Flavor was way too strong. Sweet like corn syrup. Seriously threw it in the first garbage can we saw."}
{"text":"I had a Raspberry Tart with Pistachio cream and it was simply an amazing treat. The whole place is decorated with all the possible French pastries you'd hope to find in little cafes: from coffee, sandwiches to petite decadent desserts. The little gifts of treats they have for sale are also very nicely packaged.   If you want to indulge, this is the place to visit, especially if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the cheesecake - too bland.  However coconut gelato was amazing."}
{"text":"Very good gelato. Line was so long that decided to grab some coffee and gelato to go. Sat at Starbucks upstairs and enjoyed our coffee. Service was so slow and not the best. Nothing so amazing."}
{"text":"Best Macaroons ever! A little pricey but you are at Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and to celebrate Superbowl, they offered a Superbowl cake which was a decadent chocolate cake which looks like a field and there was a small chocolate football-yum! Also tried the trio that consisted of a big cake pop, creme brulee, and a raspberry macaron. I was not a fan of the creme brulee. My son enjoyed the cake pop, but it was so big that he only ate half of it and the macaron was good. The macaron even had fresh raspberries on it. The trio was placed on an edible chocolate setting. The line can get long but it moves pretty fast. The pastry line to order your pasteries and sandwiches are located on the right. To your left is where you can order your coffee beverages, gelato, and crepes. Located right by the casino."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The store manager was very rude and she rushed our order.   The tea was scalding hot (anyone remember the McDonalds coffee lawsuit?) and we had to wait 20 minutes for it to cool down.  The seating is very cramped.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a review of their coffee. It is way overpriced for coming out of an electric machine, similar to what you find at a gas station. I paid over $14 for two coffees (one small, one large) and the flavor was mediocre at best. This is pretty disappointing for such a well known bakery and to be located in two of the best hotels in Vegas. I was staying at The Bellagio, I expect better."}
{"text":"I was there on April 30th at around 11:00pm. I ordered a strawberry tart, a croissant, and a chocolate croissant. Since it was a to-go order so the server packed it up for me. When I got back to My hotel room at Delano and was about to enjoy it, I realized the server didn't pack any utensils, fork, spoon whatsoever, so I can only eat with my hands. Plus, the server didn't even put the tart in an up right position, so after carrying back super carefully, it was ruined since it was put in the togo box originally."}
{"text":"What a find - amazing desserts and sweet treats AND open 24 hours a day.  If you are craving something more meal like (especially at 2am) the arancinis are a MUST.  Otherwise, my favorites are the wide selection of Italian cookies, where I can choose just a handful of each kind and make my own variety box.  Service is friendly and helpful, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"You will find the world's largest chocolate fountain here, it's certified by Guiness World Records, so don't even think you've seen one larger than this.  It's actually a very amazing thing to see and it draws quite a crowd during the day.  They serve some fantastic candy here, have some amazing looking cakes and pastries and ice cream.  I've only tried some various candy and it's all been outstanding.  Hope to try some of the pastries here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I brought some coconut tuilles and chocolate dipped pretzel sticks back as souveniers for co-workers and these were pricey!! BUT the coconut tuilles were ah-mazing. SO good I had to force myself to stop eating them. The pretzels were ok. I would skip on these next time.   They were all gone by the end of the day!"}
{"text":"Go for the dessert - not breakfast.  The morning staff are inexperienced in customer service.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I always stop by the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio when I'm in Vegas. Partially for the world's largest chocolate fountain and to have a crepe. Before I returned this time around, I read reviews about the soufflé crepe and I'm so glad I stopped by to try it! I got the one with warm berry compote and it was so light and amazingly delicious. I watched as they formed the crepe with ease. Then they took out a large disk of premade custard and wrapped the crepe around it to let it melt. Finally, they put a whopping amount of warm berry on top. I could hardly wait to dig in! The vanilla soufflé custard in the middle oozed out and it mellowed the semi tart berry taste. What a perfect combination! I'm definitely getting this again when I come back."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this a 5 star but unfortunately poor customer service ruined the otherwise perfect experience.  I ordered 8 pastries to go and only received 7.  Since this isn't McDonalds, I don't double check the bag for every item.  I returned the next morning and the first thing the manager asked me was \"you didn't call?\".  While she did give me my missing item in the end, the experience was not pleasant.  Her final advice was \"next time call us\".  I certainly hope they don't constantly mess up their orders and expect customers to call them to call them.  If there is any doubt about my story, there is always security footage that will show your staff messed up my order.  I think it's just customer service 101 to apologize for your mistake rather than tell customers what to do in such situations, since such situation shouldn't have happened in the first place when you aim to be a high-end shop.  Tips: Any of the varieties of the Napoleons there are to die for.  It is absolutely the best napoleon I've ever had! Oh, and of course double check your order if you order more than a few items."}
{"text":"Our wait was 20min for crepes but they did warn us.  Savory: ordered the ham and cheese. Amazing. It was like a ham and cheese omelette inside a crepe.   Sweet: Apple crepe. Delish. Tho may want the bananas foster next time."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome cakes on display.   We had iced chai, cookies, brioche muffin, all we very good. Disappointed they didn't have any napkins out.   Overall you should at least check out the chocolate fountains."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. After waiting forever because Theodore could not run the register, i finally pay for my dessert and head up to my room on the 18th floor. Well after getting dressed for bed, i sit down to enjoy the lemon meringue tart I ordered but instead it was key lime. I called to let them know and spoke to \"manager\" Beth who basically didn't give a crap that her staff screwed up. There was no apology no offer to bring it to my room just a matter of fact we have 3 left for you to come get. The nerve."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is a top rated restaurant, even though they only offer dessert. There is a reason. There are individual desserts at a few restaurants that will challenge Jean Philippe, but not many. If you don't want to waste your calories on low quality, this is the place for your sugar fix.   The crepes are excellent. Okay, the crepe is just a crepe, but the toppings are transcendent. I tried the apple crepe. Apples, grape, and pecans swimming in a bath of cinnamon sugar. While incredibly rich, it actually seemed light and healthy.   The gelato was rich and flavorful. The creme brûlée actually had brûlée texture mixed in. It was a perfect blend of flavors and pure delight. The pistachio was also well made and one of the best I've had.   The pastries may not be as strong. Perhaps that is why they are in the back. I tried the Napoleon and was disappointed. The creme was fairly typical and the dough had an odd, bitter flavor (perhaps burnt). I was surprised and disappointed after the excellent quality of the other desserts.   I have mixed opinions on the design of the store. The chocolate fountain was cool and it is fun to watch the crepe preparation. Unfortunately hundreds of tourists stop to gawk and photograph every few minutes. It is hard to even find the line. On the upside, if you find a table you can really enjoy the people watching."}
{"text":"A very very long waiting line.  There is no manual so you have to remember what to order when standing in the line. But the breakfast is very good. Their chocolate is famous."}
{"text":"We love the gelato here albeit the place was crowded.  After taking our order, the server asked us to walk to the other side to pay for it.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at Jean Philippe three times. The first two times were pretty good (hence the 2 stars), but this last time (tonight October 8, 2011) was just awful. My friend and I both had the Banana Foster sweet crepe. The crepe itself was cold and the topping was bad. I don't just mean, \"bad\" I mean it was spoiled caramel banana topping. Yuck! We brought both of them up to the woman at the counter and she was extremely rude. She didn't apologize and, in fact, she told us they were supposed to taste like that because they were \"caramelized.\" now, I did attend culinary school and graduated a chef and I know what caramelized is. This was wretched. They refunded our money, but we never heard an apology or got an ounce of sympathy (or even interest). So... That was our experience, for what it's worth!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I had the rose macaroon and I am hooked! A friend of mine recommended this place at the Belagio and we had to go two days in a row hunting for the macaroon. We were fortunate enough to purchase the last two on day 3. Every time I go to Vegas from now on I will definitely stop by to get it"}
{"text":"Best gelato! I love this place but it is always busy!!! Fresh and yummy crepes... Cute pastry shop! U can't miss this place if you are coming to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Wicked expensive but it's Vegas.  We got a Snickers bakery item with chocolate mousse, caramel and chocolate wrap.  Oh my God!  It was divine.  The Pabana smoothie I got was horrible.  I took two sips and threw it out.  I should've taken it back and asked for something else but I didn't feel like it.  There's always a line and very confusing where the line starts and how to order.  But we made our way through it.  Nice place to get some caffeine."}
{"text":"I was bored while waiting for a work engagement to begin and I hadn't eaten lunch, so I decided to hang out here and ordered a berry crepe (crepe with marinated berries and whipped cream) with a latte. Not only were both items delectable, the selection of baked goods and treats were quite attractive. I felt like I was in Paris. In fact, many French tourists stopped by amidst their shopping and gambling.   The only negative comment I have about this place is that some cashier asked me if I had paid, since I was taking my food and drink with me to a counter to sit. I said yes, and she stared at me questioningly. I didn't appreciate this. If they're worried about people not paying for their food, they should change it such that they receive payment when the food is ready."}
{"text":"So many options for breakfast. Fluffy pastries. Wonderful and delicious crepe. Potion is big enough for two. Hubby and I shared the Forrest crepe- ham, mushroom and cheese. Fresh made of course. The Forrest crepe comes with a scramble or sunny side up egg on top. It's a piece of art. And it filled up both of our tummies. Don't forget to get a hot chocolate to go with it. They are known for their chocolate. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Second morning in Vegas. You wake up disoriented and look around the room to see who else has woken...The body lying next to you asks what time it is, but you have no idea..'Where is my phone?' There is bright light seeping through the edge of the blinds hinting at the possibility that you slept till noon.  In the quiet room you start to hear a rumble and a grumble. The people are getting hungry. There is a collective yawn and a stretch, and the mood in the room seems to be that of hunger. But not a stuff your face hunger. No, you are way to nauseous for that.  You want something light, but delicious.  Something fast yet sophisticated.  You're in Vegas after all, you want a party in your mouth and sustenance for the night to come. So you go to Jean Philippe's.   I'm a sucker for a good crepe, so I've tried them all.  It's a bit pricey, but I usually win at the roulette machine right next to it anyway. Next time you're walking by Aria and want a quick bite, check it out.  They have a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. I had the quiche, almond croissant, neutella crepe. All were very good. I can get a little busy and the workers a little grumpy. But would definitely return."}
{"text":"5 stars... for the overall atmosphere, decor, and very cool running chocolate glass fountain.   2 stars for the service... The family before me waited for about 15 minutes and were complaining to the manager. I was next and was helped by a very rude lady. She took my order and threw the box at me without wanting to give me a bag for it. She wasn't very helpful and looked like she hated her job. I wanted to slap her for dampening my experience.   5 stars for the overall presentation and layout of the food and desserts. Everything looked very delicious and appetizing not to mention beautifully created. However, I can't really rate the taste of my dessert. If I had to rate it - it would rate 2 stars but that would be unfair to Jean Philippe. lol. Walking back from the Bellagio to the Wynn with 116 degree weather doesn't do good for the dessert. By the time we walked back my dessert was mushy, soft, gooey, and nasty. I'd go back and actually eat the dessert there. Don't take it to go unless you know for sure you'll be eating it ASAP and not walking in the heat.   Other than that I think that the overall patisserie was cool - especially the chocolate fountain. YAY for that. and NAY for that stupid lady. =)"}
{"text":"I never knew who Jean Phillipe was, still really don't know much about the man or the name of the place I was visiting. All I knew was that I wanted some coconut gelato, and we found this place that served it in the Aria. I've been searching for good coconut gelato for a while since I became coconut over it after having it many times in Italy. Well the ones I got at Jean Phillipe were pretty good and almost like the ones in Italy. Can't say much for the patisserie since I only got gelato. I think I'll try it next time."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pastry shop EVER! Everything here is so amazing and I love trying new things, but I almost always end up getting my favorites. I would highly recommend the raspberry tart, snickers pastry, any of their ice creams and the chocolate bear claw for breakfast. The chocolate crepe is also good.   The service is so great and even when there is a long line, it moves very quickly. I would say that their items are a little more pricey, but they are so worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place...at least every week we stop by get a chocolates and pastries . The crepes is very food too.."}
{"text":"One in Aria is better than Bellagio. Both lines are usually equally as long."}
{"text":"The Panini I ordered was really good. Hubby's breakfast sandwich was ok. Coffee was really good. Dulche de leche was good, but nothing out of this world. Tried other desserts. They are very pretty but not good enough for the price asked. I had better. Service was not good enough for such a bakery."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our Tart and Cheesecake a lot. The cheesecake was excellent! Presentation was very cool as well. Ill definately be back!"}
{"text":"We had rewards through MyVegas for free crepes.  They are conveniently located on the casino floor. When we got there there was no line, then we realized we had to go to a different crepe section in the restaurant (there's a separate register for just bakery items or sandwiches). That line starts by the display and gelatos and were 5 people in.  No worries, the line moved long and the cheerful crepe maker made the line pass fast.  We ordered the Black Forest crepe from the savory crepe menu, it had black forest ham, wild mushrooms, finished with chipotle drizzle and topped with scrambled eggs, and the Exotic from the sweet crepe menu which was a crepe topped with pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and a scoop of coconut sorbet.  The savory crepe was just that, so savory and wonderful blend of flavors. The exotic crepe was also good, the tartness of the fruits contrast against the sweet, light coconut sorbet. They were about $12 each but so worth it as it kept us full for 5+ hours of gambling.  We'll definitely have to come back for their pastries and other crepes!"}
{"text":"First time checking out the Aria location.  It's not as fancy as Bellagio's with the chocolate fountain but it is wider with gelato one side, and the pastries & coffee on the other.  All of gelato & pastries are great, with favorites being the hazelnut gelato, strawberry sorbet, and the Nutella brioche.  Their coffees are good too, and much needed with the Nutella brioche, since it is just a brioche FILLED with Nutella.   Of course, with it being a casino location, it is pricey, but quality-wise, very good.  Expect $5 and up for a latte and $4 for a pastry.  It is also close to the Vdara so if the market cafe at Vdara's not looking too good, make the short trek over to Aria for some legit pastries!"}
{"text":"Crepes are amazing!!  I've eaten there probably a good dozen times!! It is really good everything! Panini's are well crafted and delicious! Crepes are AWESOME.   FYI- For crepes, if you are a NUTELLA fan, i HIGHLY recommend on getting a nutella crepe, but have them add bananas and strawberries (or other fruits of your choice)! It is to die for!  Their coffees are well made, and the beans are great and the pastries are exquisite!  For a crepe and a coffee it is very expensive (~$25), but then again it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Incredible macaroons. Tried most of the flavors. Highlights we're passion fruit, pistachio, and rose lychee. Desserts are delicious as well. You can't really go wrong, just go with the ones that look the most appealing."}
{"text":"i just went in for a mocha drink at the ARIA location and i was soooooo pleased with it!   yeah, i get the usual starbucks/coffee bean or mcdonald's iced coffee...   but i dunno, this one mocha drink just topped it all for me.  i have to go back there to try the rest."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Jean Philippe Maury, you are a genius!  Seriously, can you please set up a patisserie in my house???  I would be FOREVER grateful.  I would also probably be well over 500 lbs :x.  But!  I would always have my sweet-tooth cravings settled because of you!  The Nutella Brioche is pure HEAVEN.  Sweet brioche bread (about the size of a tall cupcake) with Nutella in the middle.  And not just a smidge of Nutella either - more like a globful of Nutella!  It was pure decadence in my mouth.  Mascarpone truffles.  Need I say more??!  So rich, creamy, and indulgent.  Just the right combination of sweetened mascarpone cheese filling and fruit filling.  We bought each flavor.  I can't recall all of the fruit flavors, but there was raspberry, orange, blueberry, and lemon to name a few.  Other must-try chocolates are the orange marzipan, the crispy chocolate, and the tiramisu.  I think those flavors are square-shaped, unlike the mascarpone truffles.  Also, try the World Champion Cookies.  They come in a box of 8 cookies and may be dubbed \"Praline cookies\".  They are rich in hazelnut flavor and topped with milk chocolate - yummy!  J.P.P. also has a good selection of gelato as well as decadent pastries and desserts.  Even if you don't like desserts, just check the place out for the culinary artistry.  It is over-the-top eye candy!  I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love visiting this patisserie when I am in town. They have a wide selection of the tastiest treats you will ever see. There is always a huge delay and seating is limited, but it is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"RUDE STAFF! I could write more and more but I don't want to be misbehave like they did to a paying guest of the hotel!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate Fountain at Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio is a must see when you are in Las Vegas.  It's a modern day Willy Wonka choco wonder.  This incredible chocolate fountain is rumored to be a million dollar worth.  I took a lot of pictures, because the first time I've seen it 5 yrs ago, I never thought  its got a tag of a million dollar, but I am totally awed by this tall, inticate continuous flow of dark and white chocolate, that I'm so tempted to go underneath it, if it is not enclosed in a glass.          Lucky they have crepe in front, fresh to order so I decided to try their \"crepe nutella\".  I was not disappointed.  It was nicely presented, softly made and with just the perfect amount of that yummy chocolate/hazelnut spread of ferrero's Nutella.  I usually get my crepe at Paris Hotel across the road, but with a show of chocolate fountain while eating your crepe, I would definitely choose Jean Philippe.  I would definitely try their other stuff next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"!!!!!!! No words for how much I love this place!!!!!! Gelato is my favorite dessert and I could eat theirs all day!  The decor in this place is absolutely amazing!! Haven't tried their crepes yet, but judging by the length of the line for them, I'm sure they are to die for as well!"}
{"text":"This is the first of two reviews. The coffee was appalling - some of the worst I have ever had. Burnt and metallic. The chessecake was of excellent quality though, and well worth tasting."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the palmier, it's overly price $14.00 for a 10-12 small little pieces. But definitely worth to try if you are a fan of good palmier.  We did try the savory crepes, and Nutella. I think they are decent, typical French moist crepes. If you live in San Francisco, I'd recommend you 'Genki Crepes'.  Agreed with previous yelpers, bad placement on menu versus cashier. They should have create a menu book with picture to better assist hungry customers.  Customer Service: I don't think they are trained to smile. It's ok so far. Cleanliness: Very good. Cons: only reserve to 1 location. I wish there's another location in SF."}
{"text":"between checking in at aria, racing to buy ka tix close by, and having to get ready, we didn't have much time to grab a proper dinner.. we stopped by here to grab a bite before heading up to the room to get ready for the night..   picked up.. -basil aioli panini: nothing special and took forever to get our order and there was no line! i didn't it was worth $12 -gelato: pistachio, creme brulee, passionfruit sorbet.. good but not great..  the chocolates and other desserts looked enticing.. i was struggling to stop staring at them while waiting for the panini so i have to go back and try a few of them next time.."}
{"text":"We were just looking for some lattes and stumbled on to this place.  Coffee was so good we got some the next day.  We were short on time and got lunch here on our way to the airport and...low and behold..we discovered....hands. down. The best croissant (both plain and chocolate) I've had in the US.  It is better than a lot of croissants I've had in Paris.  This is one of those do not miss places in Vegas if you are a coffee and croissant fan.  I didn't try anything else but i'm sure they are all of the same quality."}
{"text":"What can i say this place is ace!! I always get the Dulce de leche gelato but never a cake, this time i tried a triple chocolate cake which Ive posted a photo of... try it it has about 10 different layers of chocolate type stuff going on inside of it..yum yum."}
{"text":"I can't see too much of this place since I didn't eat here, but what I can say is the 25 minute wait for an $8 almond milk latte is more than I can take."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.  If you happen to be wandering in the area of the Bellagio, Jean Philippe Patisserie is a must-see at the very least for the visual experience. Their World Record breaking, 27 ft. tall cascading chocolate fountain is amazing and decadently sinful.  Oh, and their pastry is great too. But their best dish is their made-to-order crepe. It's pure heaven. Only complaint? They charge Vegas Strip prices: For example, a turkey sandwhich, a small fruit bowl and a caesar salad cost nearly $40 bucks."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**  I visited Jean Philippe in the Aria hotel for the crepe and desert.  I am sure I would appreciate all the food and dessert here IF i didn't stuff my face prior to visiting this place.  I ordered the Ham Crepe and it was a my first time eating a crepe.  It was a positive experience, but it's something I could do without.  Glad I gave it a shot though.  Maybe I am not a Crepe type of guy.  I'll try a dessert crepe next time.  You can see how the crepes are made in front of you.  It is quite a delicate process.  I also tried the white chocolate cheesecake and that was amazingly good.  The cheesecake has a smooth texture to it and will melt in your mouth.  Eyes will roll all the way back when people eat this.  It was covered with a thin sheet of white chocolate.  Presentation is superb.  I would go back just for the desserts.    The restaurant is set up in two sections.  One area is serves gelato and crepes, the other half serves desserts, sandwiches, and coffee / beverages.  The location has a very modern look / design to it and is very appealing.  The glass case showcases all the desserts they have to offer and it just makes you want to order 1 of everything.  I was very tempted to do it too.  I swear every dessert were chanting my name.  The prices are bit higher than what I normally would pay, but hey its Vegas, you win big and spend big.  To give you an idea of the prices, a large cup of soda is $4 (~ 32 OZ).    Check this place out for great desserts.  Do not go if you are on a diet because just looking at the desserts will be considered cheating!  This sin is perfect for city.  Bon Apettit!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I have to come whenever I come to Vegas.  I love its Jungle crepe. So...good.  All the cakes/desserts I tried so far is fabulous.  Check it out yourself when you get a chance to go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved the salmon crepe and almond croissant - my sister and I shared both as both were quite large.  A lovely spot at the Aria to people watch."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful creme brulee during our recent trip to Vegas! Love the chocolate pouring down from the ceiling. Would've been nice to drink it. The people working there weren't too friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. Located in Aria Hotel, it is not only beautiful and trendy looking but the pastries are so good. Hubby and I ordered almond croissant ($4 each), cappuccino, and cafe au lait.  OMG- the biggest, beautiful, and delicious almond croissant ever. Huge size, fresh almond slices on top, generous amount of almond butter inside, flaky and so buttery. We were there 4 nights, 5 days and ate there 4 times. We also tried the location at Bellagio's and quality wasn't was good. I wished they had more locations but it seems like it is only in Vegas. Also tried dulce de leche brioche- kinda dry bread and too much dulce. Would stick with the almond croissant- u must try it at least once."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever. I had the strawberry and it was the best ever. For about $6 I got (2) scoops and a waffle cone. The gelato was really fresh and the fruit taste just as fresh. The Chocolate display was freaking amazing. The other desserts in there looked really good but I had my eye on the gelato only. They also had $10 crepes. It's next to the garden, YOU HAVE TO GO."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I were here this last Sunday and were really wanting to try this place for breakfast. After waiting 25 MINUTES in line, we get to the register to place our order and the lady tells us it's going to be another 25 MINUTES for our food to come out. Whatttt?? 50 minutes for a crepe? No thanks Jean Phillipe's. The least you could have done was to give your customers a wait time in advance. Unfortunately, we just left and didn't get to try their crepes so I can't tell you how they tasted but as far as customer service goes, this place is a thumbs down."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME.    What I was expecting - Overpriced desserts and overpriced bakery items with a very mediocre taste.  What we got - DELICIOUS and HUGE desserts, yes a little pricey, but based on how large they were, it was worth it.  The croissant was UNBELIEVABLE.  I may just be a high end croissant newb, but this was by far the best croissant I've ever had.  The crust was super crispy and flaky, with a light glaze over the top and the inside was pure fluff.  If you like grocery store croissants now, then this will ruin you forever.  I've had croissants at \"fancy\" bakeries before, but this was soo good it deserves its own paragraph in my short review.  As you read this on your phone deciding whether or not to try it, DON'T think, just GO TRY IT NOW!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this. I expected a lot better.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a hard and heavy name to say for a reason. It's high-end here -- bring your prettier bills. But I learned that even after so much excitement and buzz surrounding the illusion of grandiose desserts and exquisite taste, even after waiting 20 minutes in a line that snaked around the ice cream counter and an Aria bathroom hallway, I was so displeased to realize after everything that the same cashiers were the very people handling the food, and not changing their gloves after dealing with the cash.   This was something I noticed after ordering my crepe, which was just average in taste. With the decor and general fantasy-land atmosphere, that average crepe could've been just right, actually. But my dirty discovery soured my experience twofolds, and I could never recommend this place to friends because of that.   I truly hope conditions have changed since my visit in January. Until then: caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Wow! Crepes out of this world! Delicious! Love love love!!!!!!!!! If the crepes weren't enough, this incredible place is inside of both the Bellagio & Aria.  Please make this a sweet tooth pit stop when you are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm a self-professed chocoholic and a chocolate snob. And I absolutely loved the hot chocolate they serve here. Our group got a few crepes and they were all good. The veggie crepe is a great choice if you don't like to be overwhelmed with cheese. The nutella crepe was delicious. They also have a great pastry bar. The flowing chocolate display is unique.   But the hot chocolate takes the cake for transporting me to a different continent. :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying gelato, and I am a fan. Jean Philippe has other assortments of treats and goodies ranging from drinks to cakes. Their display of these goodies will make your mouth water.  The prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, but I guess it's because it's right in the middle of everything (casinos, sites, shopping). My one scoop of tiramisu cost about $3.75 + tax. It's not at all outrageous, but it could have been a tad cheaper. I don't recommend getting the tiramisu. The caramel brulee tasted pretty good as I stole a sample from my friends. If you are unsure about what to get, you can get samples and test out the flavors yourself.   This is one of two locations in the area. I believe the other location has a chocolate fountain because I did pass it along the way. I would say give this place a go, but I am sure there are other places selling gelato for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"The first one we went to was the one in Aria.  We got one white chocolate strawberry and one milk chocolate covered strawberry.  (Both were really good, albeit more on the expensive side) Additionally we go the raspberry cheesecake.  We did let it sit in the fridge overnight (way too full from dinner) but it was still just as good as if we has eaten it the day of.  It tasted like a mousse cheesecake, really light and just the perfect amount of sweetness.   The next day we went to the one in the Bellagio and each got two scoops of their gelato.  We got the mango and strawberry and the mango and berry.  Both combinations were really good but by halfway into the cup it was way too much gelato for the both of us.    Overall a really good bakery."}
{"text":"We eaten here for many years and always say the same thing: the crepes are outstanding, the pastries and coffee is great, but why are the attitudes of the workers so poor? The answer is that they hate their jobs, having to stand there for 8 hours a day, taking orders from goofy tourists. We have been here no less than 30 times and always find the staff curt, unfriendly, and in some cases, rude.  We always order a couple of crepes, coffees, and pastries, and always know that the staff will be sullen, and inefficient. The crepes must be worth it for us to keep returning."}
{"text":"delicious and beautiful cakes,. I loved the chocolate croissant. it was pricey but worth it. the croussiant was buttery and flaky,"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible, they are always confused the result is messed up orders. The confusion spills over into the foolish sections they have with some people able to some things and other people do others. If you want a coffee and a croissant it's mass confusion.  The products are also highly inconsistent. Aside from being extremely expensive the inconsistency is not acceptable. The cookies are often not fresh, hence not great. The croissants are inconsistent and not crispy enough. The coffee is horrible, I mean you are better off at Starbucks, it's sad..."}
{"text":"Came into this bakery while roaming the halls of the beautiful Bellagio hotel. I immediately noticed the chocolate waterfall in the display window and knew that I wanted to come inside. The many handcrafted confections looked very tasty and inviting. However, the prices for these things did not seem nearly as inviting though. But my fiance was hungry and wanted to buy something, so he ordered a cinnamon bun. The frosting on top was a bit too sweet for me and the cinnamon bun itself was a bit dry. Overall, I did not like it, although presentation wise, it looked quite delicious.  I liked that there is a seating area right in front of a few big windows right next to the bakery. And I noticed that a lot of the people sitting near us were devouring crepes and other little chocolate covered confections.  Overall, I am not nearly as impressed as I was when I first walked through the little bakery/ eatery. I guess I set my sights and standards for something a bit more, especially with expensive prices like the ones they charged, I really thought everything would have been delicious. Perhaps we just didn't order the right thing, but I won't let Jean Philippe Patisserie rip us off again and find something else along the strip."}
{"text":"The peanut lollipop is amazing! I highly recommend it. This restaurant also has a great view of the casino!"}
{"text":"They have good stuff. All their pastries are great & a good sitting area. I tried their crape which was good too."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype and all the artificial glam. This place just sells you on its decor and fancy presentation. At its core the food here is bland, flavorless, way over priced and had no soul. All the sheeple that gave this place a 5 star rating are out of their mind. Here is a small review on each of the things we tried. Flan- completely bland and flavorless, came in a pie shell for reasons that I do not understand. Had a tasteless coating of gelatin to give it a shinny finish. Had a texture unlike any other flan I have ever tasted, if your version of flan is this far off, please don't call it flan. Save us the trouble, you lost half the battle by misleading us. White chocolate cheesecake- once again bland and tasteless, very creamy texture. Although very nicely presented wrapped up in white chocolate, the actual cheesecake is comparable to the Jell-o no bake cheesecakes that you buy as a kit at the grocery store.  Basil pesto chicken panini- flavorless, and VERY greasy, expensive like everything else here."}
{"text":"Beautiful shpp with too much to choose from. The apple brioche was scrumptious. The smoked salmon sandwich was so so good. The strawberry shortcake was not too sweet and just right! I enjoyed everything we ordered and the shop itself was worth seeing. Service could be improved but not bad"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place!  When I left Vegas, I wished I could pack it up and take it home with me! Everything from the modern decor to the location, presentation of desserts, flavors and quality of all including: chocolate candy, truffles, gelato, pastries, cakes and more are all made to perfection! Rich, creamy, delicious and absolutely worth the visit! A great place to stop by for after dinner desserts, date night while in town or to simply satisfy that sweet tooth, it's just one of those places that will make you wish you could try it all, and make you want to make return visits for more! A must return to for me the next time I'm in town! So if in Vegas, or visiting soon... I urge you to try it! I know you will return to this review later and thank me!"}
{"text":"i didn't have any of the chocolates (which is what he's known for), and the chocolate hazelnut brioche was all out when i got there :(  the lines were a little crazy - so i told myself i HAD to at least try one thing. per the recommendation of one of the workers there i tried their chocolate hazelnut donut - it was absolute perfection. i can't recommend it enough. the dough was super airy and light, perfectly accompanied by the creaminess of the chocolate hazelnut filling with a dusting of sugar. surprisingly it didn't feel too heavy or too sweet. i wish i could've tried their other pastries!"}
{"text":"The crepes here are too die for. Freshly made, and you can add scoops of gelato to it. A light hint of icing sugar dusted on top. Sweet, creamy, delicious!!   Chocolate fountain here is amazing. Pools of chocolate dripping down into other pools...looks soo good.   Lots of fancy pastries and cakes. Grab a piece and take a seat by the windows overlooking the pool.   Relax and savour!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars.  Boo, I had such high expectation for this place, but it was just \"alright..\" I don't mind paying premium price for good/quality food, but Jean Philippe Patisserie will not be something I would come back to.   I gotta give them credit for presentation though.   Chocolate souffle crepe: 3/5 Coconut gelato: 3/5 Almond chocolate bar: 3/5"}
{"text":"The display and the chocolate fountain look fantastic but the pasties I have tried were actually quite disappointing.   Rose Macaroon - It looked beautiful but only tasted mediocre. The size of the macaroon is simply too big. The shell were not thick enough to get a good chewy texture. The rose flavor is very distinct but overwhelming. Fillings were just fresh raspberries. Nothing to rave about. The macaroons from Bellagio buffer are much better than this.   Cheesecake - More of a mousse like dessert covered in a white chocolate shell. The chocolate shell was way too sweet. It might look great but the texture didn't compliment the cheesecake fillings either.   Overall the desserts were just too sweet for my palate. I had trouble finishing them even though I have a sweet tooth.   P.S. I have tried the crepe at their other location in Aria hotel and it was one of the best I have had. Had I ordered the crepe instead, I might have a much better experience. I definitely prefer their other location. There are more seating area, nicer display, friendlier staff and much shorter lines."}
{"text":"I know I am partial. I gave the other Jean Phillippe Patisserie at Ballegio a lukewarm 3 stars review but this one a 4. The reason is simple. This one at Aria is larger and has a decent seating area.  The pastries and chocolates were pretty much the same deal at either locations - all looks very pretty but not all that impressive once you have taken a bite. Definitely more style than substance. I come here just for their crepes, the sweet ones in particular. Savory ones I have tried were mostly on a dry side and not saucy enough. The sweet ones were another story. They made good sauteed fruits and caramel sauce. The gelato was good but not spectacular. But how can you resist getting a scope with your crepe though?   Apparently this is now a fairly popular spot for all those casino goers. Last time I went there it was very packed. The line for food was long and getting a table was not that easy. That was a shame. How I wish I could have the whole place to myself."}
{"text":"This used to be the Jean Philippe chocolate and patissie.  The pastries and cakes still look the same.  The chocolates look the same too.  The only thing is their packagings. I used to buy boxes and boxes of them to take home for gifts and for myself and the packaging were so great that the chocolates would made it home without damage and looked amazing as gifts. This time since it's Aria Patisserie, i believed I paid the same price,  the packaging was so bad that all the chocolates got out of the boxes and it didn't look good to gift it.  I was kind of upset because for the price I paid for those 5 boxes of chocolates, they should have better packaging. Very disappointed.  I guess it would be my last time buying them unless they change the packaging."}
{"text":"Located inside the Bellagio, the Patisserie has a display of flowing chocolate which draws a large crowd of folks.  I like the design of the check out (circular) which helps with the impact of the people blocking the hallway.  We had two lattes and split a cheese danish.  I was anxiously awaiting to taste what $25 cup of coffee and pastry would do to my awaiting taste buds.  A lot of anticipation...very little flavor.  Couldn't distinguish between the fancy cheese danish and what you'd get in the mutli-pack at Costco."}
{"text":"After reading the raving reviews on Yelp, I decided to walk a mile to Bellagio this morning just to try. Chocolate waterfall is certainly full of wonder.   Nutella brioche is outstanding! Huge too! Everything is right about it, so JP - bravo.   Ham and cheese croissant is another big hit! I love the hint of nutmeg in the sauce. The croissant itself is really better than some that I had in France. Impressive!   Chocolate crepe is thicker & with firmer texture than what you'd get in Paris, which is what I prefer. Chocolate can be more flavorful and whipped cream isn't as rich or delish as European but American dairy contain less milk fat anyway... Solid crepe in conclusion.   Fast moving line. Mediocre coffee honestly. If you are close by, go try it out. Otherwise, don't walk a mile, unless you just want to walk :)"}
{"text":"Dessert is well-presented. Their coffee ice cream is good, so as their hazelnut cake. The matcha cake is just so-so, tasted like green tea swiss roll with some fancy topping.   As it is on the pricey side, I would give it a 3 star overall."}
{"text":"I was really craving some gelato after an afternoon run and decided to brave the lines to get my fix. I couldn't quite figure out why the line took so long since they're just doling out scoops of gelato....is it the ridiculously slow people that can't make up their minds, or was it the employees moving slowly? I still can't quite tell, but it was honestly probably a combination of both.  I settled on the lemon gelato which was pretty tasty, but nothing I couldn't live without. They do have a pretty spiffy chocolate fountain and chocolate sculpture that is quite eye catching, but I'd probably prefer to seek out Serendipity the next time I'm craving frozen treats on the Strip."}
{"text":"So we got the fountains of bellagio beautifully dancing outside and the chocolate fountain of Jean Philippe inside.  One of the many cool things to see at the Bellagio but let's be real, I didn't venture into the Bellagio to look at the chocolate drip down, I came to eat dessert.  My buddy and I decided to split a crepe and were we happy.  We ordered the mixed berry souffle crepe and sure the price is a little expensive, but its the Bellagio and it's Jean Philippe the best french pastry chef.  Well worth the price. The crepe was delicious and the souffle just melted with amazeballsness.  Here's the crepe: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=BpNT1nRCmL8xnwcJDebgBA  Don't worry, if you don't like crepes, there are a ton of other confectionary items and yes... GELATO..  If you have a sweet tooth and are on the strip, JP Patisserie is definitely the place to go..  ** P.s you cannot play in the chocolate fountain, I was deeply saddened.  *** P.p.s chocolate dipped strawberries are awesome, but $4 for 1. :)"}
{"text":"I love the pastries at this place. We often get their gelato/ ice cream as well. The wait to get the gelato is ALWAYS long, they only have 1 person at the counter regardless of how busy it is."}
{"text":"Ok, so four stars because the line situation is a bit odd and confusing and could probably be constructed a little more intuitively. Also, my friend and I both made a modification to the crepe that we ordered and neither were done. Not a big deal for my friend as hers was just removing something, but for me I added bananas to my crepe (an extra charge) so that was a bit frustrating. I ended up not worrying about it because the line and process was just such a mess.  Anyway, all in all this place was very good. We ordered the savory Forest crepe which was delectable. And the Nutella crepe (no bananas) which was also very good. Note that the menus on the digital screen are slightly different than the menus set up around the bar. You actually can't order from the digital screen. So weird.  My friend ordered a regular croissant which was good but I would have preferred chocolate (which I was told by another friend was amazing). I ordered the raspberry filled doughnut which was BEYOND good. I would order it again 100 times.  All in all, despite some of the quirks I liked this place enough to recommend it and even come back if I am at the Bellagio again."}
{"text":"Beware - that place is dirty. Pictures taken yesterday, March 20 2018 at 11.30 pm. The place is closed. Look at this mess. Spills of ice cream all over the freezer, dried spills of crepe dough, and dirty cleaning cloth everywhere. Yikes!! Would you like some ice cream next morning served with the germs? I wonder what is going on inside of the freezers where they store all deserts - since all deserts contain cream that is the perfect substance for bacterias to grow. Would not get anything there and would not advice anyone due to these hygienic conditions."}
{"text":"What else can i say. Another amazing trip to Vegas with another amazing stop at Jean Philippe Patisserie!!! There deserts are to die for !! Anyone that hits this town needs to to stop here for an amazing treat!! So many options. Try the Almond croissant heated slightly, creme brûlée,   Or chocolate crepes OMG sooo good"}
{"text":"I have been to Jean Philippe Patisserie several times and every visit makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. But being a grown adult now I have learned to control myself..well maybe not! Lol!    Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria is a sugarwhore's wet dream! Just the abundance of goodies was breath taking.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?selected=kHGid_18CMepOF9_vxqglw#GEyIV_nJKKleGTcfEIz_qA Gelato's: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?selected=kHGid_18CMepOF9_vxqglw#qqt3rxlq2aoYWr5Aq3E-Zw Fine Chocolates: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?selected=kHGid_18CMepOF9_vxqglw#aSUOizlY2YGT7pN0UPisMw Pastries: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?selected=kHGid_18CMepOF9_vxqglw#U_hd7e22lett8LDr8zbtTA Creme Brulee and Palm Leaf  sampled was just a delight.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?selected=kHGid_18CMepOF9_vxqglw#ExEBn0n8Y_Kug9UqrHSojw   They also have crepes and sandwiches, small seating area to sit to enjoy.  My LV Trip Bookmark #4"}
{"text":"Sat on a table with a view of the swimming pool at the Bellagio.  Had a restful time here with a coffee and 2 flavors of the gelatto while waiting for the world famous musical fountain display to begin in the evening.  The chocolate fountain at this patisserie is great fun to look at."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Cheese Danish, Nutella brioche, and everything else.  You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Beautiful, decadent, and reasonably priced confections.  This is my go-to-spot to take guests when we want to indulge for the afternoon.  Behind the smoke-filled gambling tables of what is typical Vegas, you'll find this delicious pastry shop.  It's tucked in the middle of the Aria Resort and Casino next to the guest room elevators.  The decor is beautiful and modern, yet playful.  It's what I would envision as a pop-up version of today's modern Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  I've had the following: - Nutella and Berries Crepe - Pistachio Gelato - Coconut Sorbet - Fruit and Yogurt Parfait - Raspberry Macaroon - A variety of mixed chocolates  All have been delicious although the experience has not been perfect.  Lines can tend to lead to long waits and the tables aren't always clean.  Other than that, I highly recommend treating yourself to their sinful pleasures."}
{"text":"This Patisserie is such a beautiful place to behold. There's the chocolate fountain, the grinch, you get to watch crepes being made while standing in line for your treats! It really is a full experience.   I was really hoping that I would get more than I did. The pastries are beautiful! They are literally breathtaking to behold. However I find that their flavors did not hold up to their looks.   We made a few purchases here. I got the carrot cake cupcake and a raspberry macaron. My friend got the raspberry tart.   I must repeat, the presentation is breathtaking!! And actually, the raspberry tart might have been one of the best things I put into my mouth. The macaron was also pretty nice. The filling not too sweet, not too tart.   I was disappointed by the cupcake, because it was the simplest thing to make, and it was the most lackluster. The only part worth eating of it was the topper. The cake itself was way more dense than it should have been, and honestly I thought I had a textured vanilla cake. Maybe it was just a bad day for them, but I just expect to get what I pay for, and I don't think I got it here."}
{"text":"So enticing!  I wasn't hungry, and yet I had to get something here after drooling over the assortment of pastries and gelatos.  I settled on a simple cinnamon sugar crepe, and watched with anticipation as it was prepared.  It was tasty, but still overpriced.  However, most dining establishments in the Bellagio gave me that impression."}
{"text":"Amazing looking sweets, chocolates, sweets, and more to look at. I enjoyed a scoop of the gellato. Highly recommended. They have a fabulous chocolate dragon display up right now. It's perfectly lit to take pictures with no glare."}
{"text":"Great Pasty shop!! We had some of the best croissants ever here. The croissants are fluffy and I really enjoyed the almond filling. Also tried the crepes which were very good but I would still say the croissants were the highlight for me. Also had to \"blue berry cupcake\" and it was excellent. This is not really a cupcake so don't get fooled by the name. It was delicious and the amount of detail that goes into making one of these is impressive."}
{"text":"A MUST SEE for foodies.    There are two Jean Phillippe Patisseries.  One in the Bellagio and this one in the back of the Aria.  You'll know you're close to it when you run into hoards of tourists bumping into each other because they are walking around with their cameras in front of them.     Imagine what would happen if Disneyland imagineers decided to get  into the baking business...this would be the result.  Amazing fondant enrobed cakes in brilliant colors twirling around on tall sparkling chrome vines.  Brightly lit display cases filled with row after row of (fill in a superlative here) desserts.    First off this patisserie is an assault on the eyes.  Eye popping cake displays of Alice In Wonderland colors and movement.  If you eat with your eyes you'll be full before you get within four feet of the counter.  Once there you will be dazzled with art gallery-like pastries and chocolate desserts.    Diabetics must curse Jean Philippe as they load up their syringes for a suicide mission to the dessert counter.  I am a type II diabetic, but damned if I was going to be denied.  I choose a round chocolate morsel that resembled a chocolate dipped apple.  Even though it was only the size of a plum it satisfied the appetite of three people.  Devastatingly rich chocolate layers of mousse, caramel, ganache and nuts with I'm sure a good dose of butter and egg yolks folded inside.  So worth it for $7.  Actually, it was very cheap for what I got.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great sweet and savory crepes! Very fresh and they make it fast. Great for brunch and our latte and cappuccino were delicious"}
{"text":"hungry or not, this place makes me wanna eat.  there are two things in life that make me ogle, \"d\"aniel henney and \"d\"esserts.    daniel henney is a fiiiiiiinnnnnne piece of artwork.  don't believe me?  here, check him out for yo'self:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAmOwJEq3dI&feature=related  yes.  hello.             there.  i'm glad we can agree on SOME things  :)  his voice  \"alone\"  makes me melt.  he's HOTTER than hot lava baby!  ANYWAY....let's talk about jean philipe patisserie.  the variety of desserts make my mouth water.  the decor was simple and beautiful.  i love the chocolate waterfall display behind a uniquely designed glass wall.  it's like viewing a live piece of artwork.  everything looked so yummy.  they got petits fours, cookies, cakes, salad, sandwiches (cold, hot and mini), sweet & savory crepes and gelato ice cream.  oh!  and fruit shakes too!  i came here for breakfast on saturday and there was a huge line.  i happily waited.  i had the ham and cheese panini ($9.50), peanut butter cookie ($3.50) and tropical smoothie (pineapple juice, fresh banana, mango puree and coconut sorbet - i forgot the price) mmmm....mmmm....mmmm....my tummy \"meowed\".    this is a great place for breakfast or lunch if you want to spend at least 20 buckaroos.  don't forget to bring back a few of the viennoiserie (freshly baked items) for ME and i promise to u.f.c. you lots of love!  :)"}
{"text":"One of the best pastry shops with authentic french pastries. Although they look and taste good, I have to say it is disappointing to see the lack of selections. Yes they do offer a lot of different pastries, but they are mostly the same with slight variations on the toppings. Anyone who id familiar with french pastries knows they could have a lot more choices, especially for a fancy place like this. Speaking of fancy, even though they cater in high end hotels, the prices are ridiculously high with at least around 300% more than what you would pay for the same quality. It is the equivalent of paying $20 for a burger! I am still giving them a 4-star rating because it is almost impossible to find authentic pastries in Vegas, much less anywhere in the US. Great selections, from salads, chocolates, sandwiches to cookies, you will not be disappointed, and be ready to be in line to order your food; the place is always busy!"}
{"text":"The look and feel of this place is really nice and definitely makes you want to try their goodies. However, their actual products are sub par. I got the roast beef sandwich and the pretzel bread was stale and there wasn't anything special about it. The water cress was a nice touch but that's about it. I also got their flavored marshmallows and that was quite the bust too. I actually prefer the original kind at the supermarket. The flavors were artificial and it as $10. Enough said.   I wouldn't spend my money here..."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the multiple lines/stations setup, especially when some cash registers are closed (crepe station was combined with the \"express coffee\" station) without any signage.  Family ordered a brownie soufflé and cinnamon sugar crepe.  The brownie one I sampled was a little underwhelming.  Family did not seem blown away by it either (sister said the brownie one is too sweet), which is sad since they had been talking about getting crepes non-stop since we arrived.  I actually preferred the texture and thickness of the crepe from the Creperie in Paris.  I picked up a flan pattiserie.  The girl working the pastry counter was not knowledgable, and could only offer that it was \"a pastry\" as opposed to \"the liquid\" that was the creme brûlée.  I expect more product knowledge for such expensive goods.  The cashier girl also seemed harried and unhappy.  I had to ask for a bag, and while napkins were shoved into the handle of the cardboard carrier, there was NO FORK, making the gooey pastry very difficult to eat.  The pastry itself was a heavily vanilla bean flavored flan atop a flaky pastry crust.  It was also HUGE and could definitely satisfy two people with how rich it is.  A dollop of fresh whipped cream or fruit would have made it restaurant worthy.  It did have more flavor than what Whole Foods offers.  Solid food, but they really need to work on the employees.  Minus one star for the lackluster employees and another for not including a fork.  Very disappointing.  Is this why the Bellagio location is so much more crowded?  I'll brave the crowds there next time to compare."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful at both Aria & Bellagio.  Aria is a bit less packed, compared to Bellagio w/ the streaming chocolate fountain since eveyone is in awe over it, as they should be.  Aria finally changed their Zarkana display into cherry blossoms & monkeys which is super cute!  Like 200 or 2000lbs of chocolate love.    I also love the holiday themed gifts & chocolate sculptures.  Talk about pastry chef ARTIST!   For Easter, they have beautiful egg shaped rice krispies that when you break it open there are these sweet chocolate eggs!  Mmm!  My personal favorites include the gemed white, dark & milk chocolate w/ dried gem fruits!  Also, the chocolate covered orange peeled are to die for!  I actually ate them all on the way home once lol!  Ahh yelp me!  My only disappointment was the three mini sandwiches.  One was tuna, one salmon & one turkey.  It was all dry & I was starving!  But I can overlook it cause 99% of everything else & the employees are excellent.    Thank you pastry chefs!  You are the absolute BEST!  I love it all!"}
{"text":"Every time i visited Las Vegas, I came here for the crepe! It tastes sososo good! I also like the decorations here, so stylish! The chocolate foundation is special, looks yum! Don't miss the crepes here. I think the other cakes and breads are also good, I would like to try next time! Have a relaxed morning with crepe here~~ Its life!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what the hype is. I was staying at the Bellagio for work and the business center is right next to Jean Philippe so I went during a quick break. The dessert collection is not that big. I wanted to get a gift to take home, but the macaroons are not made fresh there and are prepackaged. I got some chocolate instead that was labeled \"coffee bean chocolate\" which I discovered when I got home was just dark chocolate shaped like coffee beans and did not have actual coffee beans or the flavor of coffee beans. I got a scoop of pistachio gelato, which was actually really good, but I wouldn't go back. Go to Hexx instead if you're looking for candy or chocolate."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! The chocolate fountains were mesmerizing n all the cakes n chocolate decors were stunning...We ordered the Nutella crepe n it was to die for!!! :D It's the best crepe I've ever had in my life"}
{"text":"The place is very pretty! the only down side is the casino is too close... the smoke makes me have a headache."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my review will just be on the gelato since that is what the pic is. The crepes are awesome too. Back to the gelato. It's the best gelato in Vegas next to Payards. Please enjoy. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"This place by far had the most heavenly crepes I have ever eaten and they make it right in front of you! I love the chocolate fountain they displayed and this little gem was by far the best at our stay at the Bellagio. 2nd best is their breakfast buffet lol  I also had coconut macaroons and madelines as gifts and the receivers said they were great as well!"}
{"text":"The chocolate art never ceases to amaze me every time I pass by. I always buy a small piece of chocolate on every trip. It has become a little tradition of mine! Good chocolate, never a line, great chocolate art and very accessible."}
{"text":"Great. Desserts fresh and delicious. Compliments Aria's restaurants"}
{"text":"Crepes! Had the exotic crepe which comes with a scoop of coconut sorbet for $8.95. Sounded like a delicious mix of mango, passion fruit, pineapple. But it was a disappointment. Wish I had done the basic nutella or berries crepe. The fruit was marinated in a hot sauce and was way too tart. Poor choice at trying to be different. The coconut sorbet was very good though. You can also add a scoop of your choice gelato to any crepe for $2. I added on a scoop of stracciatella which was good. However their 'gelato' tasted heavier like ice cream. Guess it depends on the flavor.   Also had their royal savory crepe with chicken breast, mushrooms and cheese in a cream sauce. Pretty yummy, cream wasn't too heavy to me like Payard's at Caesar's crepe. They also give you a small mixed greens salad on the side makes it not bad for $10.95. I'd eat here again for their savory and sweet crepes.   The pastries I got was the almond croissant and nutella brioche, both $4.  The nutella brioche was a last minute add on because it looked so yummy. I'd skip this one next time. Basically a dense dough with a huge chunk of nutella in the middle. Basically bread and nutella made pretty.   Onto the almond croissant. I usually get a chocolate croissant but reviews boasted the almond croissant it was yummy!! The almond paste in the middle and flaky crust. Definitely try! Worth the splurge from my diet."}
{"text":"located in the bellagio, from the check in, hang left, and it's on the right hand side, right pass the garden.  I had their blueberry brioche. YUMMMMMMM it was heavenly. The outside had a very thin crust, the top was a cross between a custard and sponge cake ish. It was delicious. Their chocolate fountain I think was rather a distraction from their amazing selection of delicious pastries...   Also, I saw few people getting their crepes. That's definitely on my list to try for next time."}
{"text":"It's only fitting for two world-class Five Diamond resorts to have their own World Pastry Champion. Nestled in the Aria Las Vegas and the Bellagio is Jean Philippe Patisserie. The artistic genius of Chef Jean-Philippe Maury is displayed daily at Las Vegas' first truly European-style pastry shops. You'll be welcomed into this imaginative display by a breathtaking chocolate fountain and large elegant designer cakes. Pastries, desserts, and snacks include carefully crafted chocolates, cookies, freshly made crepes, salads, sandwiches and delicious drinks. This is my favorite dessert place in all of Las Vegas. Be sure to try one of the fresh made crepes made to your order. It truly is a luscious experience that just can't be missed."}
{"text":"For the amount of time we spent queuing for what I thought would be a party for my tastebuds, I was sadly disappointed by what Jean Philippe had to offer.  The raspberry tart was forgettable, not to mention plain and dry.  The only memorable thing was their chocolate turtles, which I discovered by accident at the register. I thought they were divine! But when I had them again recently I felt they were too sweet. Not to mention, not really worth the exorbitant price for two chocolates."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely perfect place for breakfast or brunch. It is definitely expensive but worth it. Their coffee is incredible (particularly cappuccinos) and their crepes both savory and sweet are delicious. They have a wonderful selection of pastries as well. Every time we come to Vegas we come here at least 3 times!"}
{"text":"WOW!  that long line in the morning around 10:00AMish.  Because of the long line, we just grabbed an most delicious Almond Croissant EVER!  One afternoon we got a pretty expensive Iced Latte and a wrapped up brownie which was baked that day.  Both were yummy, but nothing special.  I was told that the other pastries were REALLY good - so next time, we'll be sure to try the Gelato and Napoleon.  Of course, it it wasn't so pricey, I might be more of a fan.  Everything is just so PRETTY!   PS - there is another Jean Philippe at the Bellagio and they have an awesome chocolate fountain display worth checking out. =)"}
{"text":"If you have an eye for all things cute and a sweet tooth to match..you are going to LOVE this place! I stopped by a couple Jean Philippe locations in Vegas, but this one had a chocolate fountain display that made me feel like I was walking in a Wonka factory. We only got the chocolate filled croissant because we were full from eating prior to visiting the place..but I have to say that the croissant tasted amazingggg. Crispy on the outside and sweet on the inside (but not too sweet).   According to my friend, they have yummy paninis and macaroons as well..I'm definitely going to try that when I go back."}
{"text":"Craving for some sweets and this place came in handy. No long lines, tables abound. Service is good. We ordered a cheesecake, eggpie type flan and triple chocolate cake. Taste is ok but not worth the $8 premium for each. Will I come back? Maybe not. 3.75 stars for me."}
{"text":"Such a yummy bakery, the desserts are all beautifully presented here! PRICEY too, so be prepared to break a bank if you plan on buying for a family...  They make fresh crepes, desserts and have a small showcase of specialty and wedding cakes! Theyalso have a candied out cobras right outside the main area of the shop.  I really recommend coming here to get a taste of a famous baker! I hope to someday be this famous...jk I doubt I could be as talented as this in making cakes and pastries!   But if I had the money to blow this would be the place I would do my wedding cake for sure!"}
{"text":"This is an overrated tourist trap.  There were too many people simply standing around looking at the chocolate fountain and  looking at the food taking pictures but not ordering.  After finally getting though the line after 15 minutes, I ordered the Opera tart.  It looked delicious but was just mediocre in taste.  I didn't even finish it which is rare, since I love chocolate pastries.  Maybe they were having an off day.  I prefer Payard."}
{"text":"As I was walking to and from the Bellagio Tram Station, I came across this bake shop. What really amused me was the chocolate fountain!! It looked really cool.  I did buy some pastries here, and while they tasted okay, I wasn't sure if they were really worth the price.  But do stop here to see that chocolate fountain.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"When I think of Jean Philippe Maury I think of pure perfection when it comes to amazing baked goods & patisserie. He had studied patisserie from the age of 17 and is a former Gold Medal Winner of the World Pastry Competition, so I trust his recipes and training in kitchen staff. Nothing comes close to their laminated doughs such as croissants, danish and puff pastry desserts. Love the Strawberry Tart with flaky layers of crisp puff pastry, custard and fresh strawberries. All time favorite is the Raspberry Rose Macaron. Great textures, macaron is nice and chewy with perfumy floral notes and a rich vanilla custard filing. There are only a few macs I approve of and this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a pastry in Vegas!  -perfect almond croissants  -nice brioche -delicious coffee with variety of options"}
{"text":"holy shoepruewiruweprweprj ! world class pastry's and dessert right here !!! best ive ever had !!! i have the tuttie frutti and cup cakes and triple chocalate mouseee man costed me over 25 dollars but you pay for what you get!!"}
{"text":"Oh sweet Heaven, am I dreaming? I must be as I'm surrounded by endless amounts of sweetness and over the top deliciousness.  There standing before me behind the glass is a fountain. Could it be the fountain of youth? I come closer and find something better, the nonstop flowing fountain of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate.   I'm easily distracted as something at the corner of my eye quickly grabs my attention. It that you, Jesus? Sadly, it wasn't but what I did see was a plethora of extraordinary mouthwatering desserts with an overwhelming variety.  Crepes, gelato, creme brûlée, fruit tart, sweet trio, imperial, vanilla eclair, tiramisu, triple chocolate cheesecake, white chocolate strawberries, chocolate croissants, cupcakes, cinnamon rolls and countless more. Every possible type of dessert I could think of was here in front of me. How does one even begin to choose?  So mesmerized by it all, I go with my first two choices, the Pecan sticky Bun and flan patisserie. The pecan sticky bun perfectly sweetened and soft with just the right amount of crispy pecans. Each bite is like a taste of heaven. The flan patisserie has an acquired texture and flavor that even leaves the taste buds confused. It lacks the flavor of what flan is suppose to taste like but still edible. I wasn't disappointed that the flan patisserie didn't blow me away since the sticky pecan bun had been so amazingly good.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a dessert lovers dream come true. It's simply the definition of happiness ^_^"}
{"text":"After brunch at Paris, having deserts at @jeanphilipp3 ... 8/10. Hope they only sell chocolate desserts, because they also sell crepes, sandwiches and gelato. Limited seatings. Usually crowded. The snicker is good. The line can be confusing with the sandwich and crepes, hence the rating. Barry  #oneeyefoodcritic #jeanphilippe #bellagio #vegas #foodie #chocolate  #saturday"}
{"text":"Like everyone else has stated, service here sucks. They are slow and inefficient, even when it's not busy and there is barely a line. I didn't try any of the baked goods and sweets, only the savory crepes which were decent. I had the one with chicken and bacon in it which was good, but a bit too salty. The boyfriend had the Forest crepe, which consisted of ham, mushrooms, cheese, and eggs...they even asked how he wanted his eggs cooked. But when we were digging into our crepes, we noticed there wasn't even any egg in it!! Oh, and while placing our orders, I had also asked for it to be packed to-go...when they called us to the counter, it was obviously not packed to-go, so I had to ask again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like leaving bad reviews, but I'm still mad about the way I was treated (or NOT treated) during my birthday.   I went to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday. I love Vegas and have always been treated well. I made reservations for Sage at Aria for dinner and was hoping JPP could make my birthday cake. I called them for WEEKS--no answer and no call back from the messages I left. I e-mailed. No response. I FINALLY spoke to someone named Jessica--only to be hung up on in the middle of explaining what I wanted! I thought maybe we'd been disconnected, but I called back and no one answered. Never heard from them again.   I wound up ordering my cake from Freed's Bakery and having it delivered. It was beautiful and tasty. I highly recommend using them if you're celebrating a special night and you're from out of town. I won't be trying JPP next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is a treat one should NOT resist. From the Gelato, desserts, coffee to the sitting area, I feel it has Bouchon which I love, might take a second. Moving on, I tried.... Nutella Napoleon...yummers! If you like Cinnamon, go for the cinnamon roll or bear claw...delish! Also has the Lemon Raspberry which I don't care for, but I share with a friend, it melted so tenderly my tongue was treated like royalty. Now, I ordered a coffee latte, one of the best I have had in quite some time, delish! I will be back, I just hope standards don't change. For now...yours tops!"}
{"text":"Inside Bellagio around the corner from the Conservatory. We tried the Napoleon and the nutella crepe. The nutella crepe was a bit on the sweeter side than I'd liked, but I did love the Napoleon. The chocolate fountain was pretty cool to watch. We went in the afternoon, so there was no line. They have really cute cake displays and the tables and chairs looked very fancy. The service was pretty good, the guy gave me some recommendations when I asked. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is like a pastries heaven for me, however, it is way too overpriced (as are most restaurants in Aria Hotel). $5.75 for a small little cinnamon roll? I remember having my first iced mocha drink there for nearly $7! The problem is, for certain types of iced drinks, they only offer in Large sizes so you are forced to pay for more than you really want to drink. So my choice was either a small hot mocha drink (which I didn't want to drink on a hot day) or a large iced mocha for double the price. Sheesh.   I do admit they make everything look very pretty, colorful, and whimsicle. If I weren't on a diet, I probably would've tried every single one...well, eventually, if I'd stayed in Vegas long enough. I only tasted their cinnamon roll and it was pretty good. Semi crispy around the edges and softer texture inside, with a thin layer of frosting on top.   I think Porto's - locations in Glendale, Burbank, and Downey (CA) - has similar stuff for wayyy cheaper prices. So unless you want to drink a large iced coffee drink for $7, you might want to just walk by to admire the pretty designs and colors, and then walk away. :)"}
{"text":"Cool place to visit. The chocolate fountain was cool, I wish I could drink it looked so yummy. This place is located to the left of the botanical garden right behind it to the left. its worth seeing and while you're there you can order a coffee, dessert, or ice cream."}
{"text":"Cool place to visit. Love the gelato. The pastries are all delicious. The displays are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is breathtaking beautiful with all their Easter candy on display.    Had the hazelnut gelato.  Heard rave reviews on it but for me it was just ok.  Something sweet for dessert in a beautiful candy store."}
{"text":"I say this place is 4 1/2 stars!! The crepes are amazing and they make it when you order them. I had the strawberry nutella crepe with an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream. It came out to be around $12. I really recommend the extra scope of ice cream, you would taste the hot and cold dessert at the same time!!! pretty amazing!!! my bf usually is not too fond of sweets, and he loved it too!!!  I was here on a tuesday afternoon so there really wasn't a line which was great~~!! All the pastries they sell here look absolutely delicious. I also tried the tiramisu!! one of the best I have ever had~~!! and it was only $6.50. After the dessert, you should take a look around all their fancy cakes~! I really liked the hello kitty one!!  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We bought a couple of lattes and chocolate cakes at this cafe inside the Aria Resort & Casino where we were staying for a few days.They tasted reasonably alright......nothing amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me break it down for you.  Desserts, crepes and sandwiches as fresh as you can get?  Check.  Fast service?  Check.  Most importantly-- delicious?  Check!  Everything I have had at Jean Philippe's has been great.  One of my favorites is the fresh mozzarella and tomato panini.  The palmiers are flaky and buttery goodness.  There have been many a times when I stopped in there on the way to my hotel room to bring a snack up with me for the night.  I even get food to go for the flight home.  Sometimes the line can get long but it moves pretty quickly.  You'll usually find a group of tourists standing around the area taking photos and videos of their famous chocolate fountain.  I'll be back Jean Philippe -- c'est magnifique!"}
{"text":"If youre ever in the area, you need to eat not only with your mouth, but your eyes, with the gorgeous little gems sold here. They do a bang up business of sandwiches, coffe, and chocolates here but their prized offering is their vast and beautiful (and tasty!) selection of pastries. My favorite was a merengue with edible rose petals and raspberries--oh my! Heaven! These are amazing to bring to someone's house if they live in the area. When we pass through, we try to grab some to bring home to the family, however, we've never actually had any left to give :-o oooops!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here late at night to get a coffee. The place is beautiful and set inside the Aria Casino.  The glass artwork and colorful displays drew me in.  The smell of fresh crepes being made was wonderful. It was after midnight and there was a line!  They looked delicious,  however, did not get one.  Chocolates, pastries and macarons were beautifully displayed behind glass. There was a nice display of gift items ... all set for the holidays. I thought some of the items were over priced.  I ordered a caramel latte. It was nice and hot, with just the right amount of caramel for me. Not to sweet."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just hype but I was surprised to find out the food (i.e. the crepes) are pretty darn good.  Yes, the food and chocolate is a bit on the pricey side and the lines are always long, but the quality of food you get is well worth it.  My only disclaimer is that crepes may take a while to make but you have to understand it's pretty much one or two people running the whole show.  The wait was worth it though - will definitely stop by here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"are you kidding me? i expected to pay a lot and get a little with gelato as always, and especially because this place is so widely known. but boy was i surprised-- i paid $5 and got a hell of a lot of gelato, mint chocolate chip and cookies and creme to be exact. so much that i--an avid ice cream/gelato eater--could not finish it. i didn't think it was possible, but the nice guy at the counter gave us all a nice portion. the gelato itself.. the best mint chocolate chip gelato (or ice cream for that matter) that i've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I go to Vegas. There berry crepes are a must, the gelato is also delicious. I am not a big fan of chocolates but my friends love them so they must be good.   The location is perfect too, it's next to the casino at the Aria hotel. It is currently my fave."}
{"text":"If you go to Vegas and you want a place to get sweets, this is a solid place to check out.  It's probably my favorite bakery.  I try to make it a point to drop by here when I head to Vegas.  When I come here, I get lost in the options.  They have great cakes, crepes, and candies.  Jean Phillipe is a world champion chocolatier and you can't go wrong with any dish containing chocolate in it.  I love their custard-filled crepes.  I add nutella and fruits to it.   Their crepes are overpriced, but so good.  I hear that Jean-Phillipe opened a new location @ the new Aria hotel and that, that location has more seating and less crowds.  This sweets shop is located in the Bellagio hotel.  It's kinda hidden, but it's definitely there."}
{"text":"If you are looking for sweets in Vegas, your search will end with Jean Phillipe's Patisserie.    Not only are the items in the bakery beautiful to look at, but they're also delicious.  Their creme brulee gelato is absolutely delicious, their \"souffle\" is a custard filled crepe and it's the best crepe I've ever had, and their cakes are amazingly rich.  I prefer their location in Aria to their location in Bellagio because it is bigger and because they have a lot more seating available.  If you plan to eat there, then come here for eating and go to Bellagio to take a picture of the famous chocolate fountain.  I've been to dozens and dozens of sweets places and this ranks as one of my favorite places for sweets.  It's that good.  As I go to display case from display case, I feel like a kid at a toy store.  If you love sweets, then this place is a must-visit."}
{"text":"Have you seen this place? Unreal. How do you not buy one of everything as you're waiting in line? Those smarty pants. They know if we stand in line walking past all their foodie, pastry, deliciousness we'll buy it all. Even if we are working on our bikini body. Nope, I want ALL those cupcakes, scones, and lemon bars please. Oh and chocolate bars. Can't forget those. For serious, I refrained and only stopped by twice while staying at the Aria in July.  I enjoyed some delicious soy lattes and my man and I split a small bag of square chocolates. Next time we are in town I think eating there for brunch is in order. I am already dreaming about it!"}
{"text":"Palmiers palmiers palmiers, that's always my go to purchase every time I visit Vegas!!!  I get a couple boxes of these small, cute pastries every time because they are absolutely to die for.  I can eat a whole box in one sitting, dude.  It's one of those things where you have one, and it's so good that you have another, and then another, and then another, and then before you know it, it's all gone.  To die for, I'm telling you.  I skip on the savory crepes (not usually my fav in general) and macarons (although cute), but do try all the other pastries and chocolates that they offer.  It's a must try in Vegas (especially if you want something quick!).    But quick FYI - Aria has a smaller menu than the location in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Heaven on Earth!!!!!  But tooooooo pricy. Come on 7$ for a tiny cake?????"}
{"text":"This place is absolute heaven if you're a fan of sweets!! The first day we got to the hotel I locked in on this place while I was walking to go up to my room. Thinking to myself \"I'll be back for you later\" which I did go back...like 3 times.  Most importantly the crepes are fabulous! They are indeed a very popular item as the line for them is sometimes a little long. But well worth the wait. And I would advise if you order one to share it with someone else as they're pretty big. I also tried their gelato (butterfinger and the coconut) and they were delicious. I could go for some right now yummm :) Their coffees are good, but I'd prefer to go upstairs for Starbucks. Wasn't blown away way the coffee but it's A-ok as the main attraction here is the desserts.  They have beautiful displays with their delectable confections that you can purchase to take home with you. I never got around to trying some of their truffles and chocolates behind the glass, but I guess that's more of a reason to come back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and wanted to stay the desserts are BEAUTIFUL and it is worth stopping by if you have anyone in your group that likes dessert and you are in the area (there are a few of them). I think for a meal you should go somewhere else but try the: Croissants, macaroons, and some of the other desserts. Do not recommend: Coffee is normal, ice cream, and tarts."}
{"text":"12/26/2015  All of the pastries and sweets look great and do taste delicious. However, the service was horrible. I think the fact that this place has long lines stresses the staff out.   We got the Pabana and scoop of ice cream. They were both good."}
{"text":"This place is known to have the world's largest chocolate fountain! However, it could be easily missed while walking along in Bellagio. So make sure you keep your eye out for those who are first-time comers to Vegas.   I tried the berry sorbet, the Lemon Meringue Pie (LMP) and the Triple Chocolate Cake (TCC). I took these goodies to the Bellagio Water Show to enjoy while I watched the water performance. Perfect way to enjoy your evening is to listen to some music, enjoy some great goodies and watch a great performance.  Berry Sorbet = 3.5 out of 5 stars. Very tasty but having been to Rome and Florence, your tastebuds are majorly spoiled to the first touch of gelato. This sorbet was much creamier than the other sorbets I eat in Vancouver Canada, which I originally thought I was eating a sherbet (which milk content is added and makes it creamier) but not.   LMP = this had marshmallow on the top that happened to be torched which I thought I'd like but that wasn't the case. I didn't end up finishing this as it didn't tickle my taste buds and I drove my spoon into my next dessert, the Triple Chocolate Cake.  TCC = Oh boy was this delicious. I had to scrape off the crumbs from the cardboard box. It was gooood! You MUST try!"}
{"text":"OMG, I had the banana & brownie crepe - YOU MUST TRY one. You'll need to hit the gym, the next day but worth it. So delicious."}
{"text":"Ok. So, I've been eyeing this place through Yelp for YEARS now and only recently got to experience how a real patisserie should be.   Located in the Bellagio, down the hall after you pass Guest Check-in on the left and the simply stunning Japanese Botanical Garden on the right.   The moment you walk inside the shop, you're overwhelmed by the massive multiple-tier chocolate fountains. If staring at that work of art isn't enough to get you stoked about trying one of their desserts, I don't know what else will. That is straight out of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory!   Once you can finally peel your eyes away from the fountains, good luck choosing just one of their incredible tarts or desserts. Each one is expertly handcrafted and is as beautiful as it is delicious."}
{"text":"Didnt realized this placed has closed down before I could finish my review. But guess I was right about how terrible it was:  I have a terrible case of the \"food swings.\"  Much like being hangry, though symptoms of the latter can be easily placated after being fed. Food swings, on the other hand, can strike after eating. More specifically, the consumption of bad food with the knowledge that there were better options nearby. And can have a lingering effect.   Just last weekend, I came down with an episode. After the BSB show, we wanted to grab a late night snack before heading out again. I was thinking either Eggslut or Momofuku at the Cosmo. My bf suggested this bakery since it was closer. I reluctantly obliged hoping that the pastries were as good as it looks.   When we got there, the service was rude. The turkey croissant was frozen. No QC on the fridge temps. The long walk back to our room wasn't enough time for the icy tomato and cheese slice to defrost which ruined the quality of the croissant...if it even had any. The blueberry danish wasn't flaky and probably sitting on the shelf for hours. I was enraged after my first bite. Shortly after, food swings came in strong. I was frustrated to have just consumed wasted calories but was too full to have anything better. It totally ruined the night. No amount of pork belly baos or ramen can now pacify the frustration.   Learn from my mistake. Avoid this over priced bakery and don't let it ruin your night."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it decadence at its finest as far as the desserts go. I am sure the savory foods are just as luscious. The chocolate fountains are awesome to look at and well you really just want to jump in and swim in it !!"}
{"text":"i love the nutella crepes and their macaroons...  the cakes that are on display are so beautiful!  the chocolate fountain was really nice.  the wait line was so long, we came here on thanksgiving day.  i still like max brenner better though..."}
{"text":"MADE MY 21st Birthday so special! As I walked by the bakery I noticed these 3 tower tall mini cakes that were the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, so we talked to the employee and she was able to order one 24 hours in advance for my birthday! The cake was PHENOMENAL. IT WAS absolutely beautiful everyone kept complementing it because it was soooo cute! and the taste was just phenomenal. The employees were all super sweet and patient!  After ordering the beautiful cake and loving it, I ate at Jean Philippe everyday for breakfast and it was sooooo amazing. The chocolate chip cookie was literally to die for and all there other pastries were exquisite. Not only is JEAN PHILIPPE able to master a work of art by the looks of the pastries but the taste doesn't fall any shorter.   THIS IS A REAL MASTER PIECE. WISH there could be one in NYC !"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town; I always go here and get crepes and sandwiches. The crepes are the best! And Christian you are the best!!! Love you girl! Lol"}
{"text":"Great like always, my favorite Vegas desert spot... all of the deserts are gourmet and home made, the stuff is always efficient and nice, it is a must wist place if you are in Vegas, very highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great pastries and food! All my friends LOVED what we ordered. I would give 5 stars on the food alone, but I didn't really like their order-taking system. It's a bit confusing and unorganized.  First, there are two lines. We figured out that if you want to buy cafe food and drinks, you line up on the left. The line begins around the back and lead you to the register at the front. While you wait in line, you will pass many salads, sandwiches, and pastries. TIP: Take this time to figure out what you want!! You will not be able to see a menu until you reach the register. The drinks menu display is also awkwardly placed, so that you can only see it when you're on the opposite side of the bar. Once your in line, it's darn near impossible to read.  I ordered a $9 berry smoothie. Yes, it was NINE dollars. I was very thirsty. It was pretty tasty, but I'm still having a hard time justifying paying $9 for it. I also ordered a $4 Almond Brioche. Oh man! Soooo delish! It tasted like vanilla custard. The bread was soft, but still had great texture. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!! My friends each got a panini, and they said that they were amazing. Better than Earl's even! ;)  I would definitely recommend making a trip here if you're near Bellagio!!"}
{"text":"Really fancy desserts. I had a strawberry croissant. It was okay."}
{"text":"Their claim to fame is award winning pastries. We got there at 3:30pm and picked out a croissant which looked average. The taste and texture was the below average and I'm almost sure they use shortening instead of butter.....it just tasted bland and a bit stale. Sadly the Starbucks pastries in SF taste way better........  Total for a croissant and ice coffee was $10."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go when in Vegas! Right next to Bellagio's garden so you could hit two spots at one location. Their chocolate is to die for!   Had some of their cakes. Each dessert has it's own unique taste to it - not too sweet and just perfect amount of moisture. If you ever need to get a gift for someone, make you to get the chocolate balls! They're awesome with a morning coffee!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick meal at the Aria.  The food is great for the speed. I had a salad this time but I've had the crepes before. I would have liked to have sampled so many of the deserts but did not have time.  They are beautiful!  It's a little on the pricey side but almost everything is when you're in the casino so it wasn't out of line."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and it was a bit late. They had a very limited amount of items as they had sold out from the day. I decided on the tripe chocolate dessert. Ive had a ton of desserts in my life and usually something like this is very dense and very heavy. To my pleasant surprise, this was neither. It had a creamy white chocolate center and some sort of peanut brittle even further in. Really high quality tasty pastries"}
{"text":"Long lines, but worth the wait. It's right by the conservatory (garden) and there's tables off to the side to eat. Tried the rose macaroon w/raspberries. The attention to detail is amazing. It had 3 tiny 'droplets' of sugar made to look like water and a sugared petal. The opera (coffee/choco) was also delicious. The crepes looked yummy and will try next time."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing pastries. Everything we had here was great. It's a must try if you're in the Aria."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe, my go-to spot for desserts. I have yet to be disappointed by any item I've tried, and I don't anticipate ever to be disappointed. They have a variety of delectables, from pastries to gelato to paninis."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Vegas I have to come here for either the crepes, ice cream or the smoothies. The shop is inside the Bellagio Hotel near the tram that goes from Bellagio to Monte Carlo. So you can enjoy this awesome pastry store even if your stayed at a different hotel.   This place is also known for having \"the world's largest chocolate fountain\" recorded my the Guinness Book of Records.    Jean Philippe Maury owner and pastry chef at this place has been awarded the \"Meilleur Ouvrier de France,\" the most prestigious pastry award in France. So you know this place is delicious and upscale if you are looking for that epic tasting pastry you been craving for after a long day on the Las Vegas Strip.  I have tried this place about over 20 times from the chocolate boxes which is quite pricey but worth it from $30-$50 a box. Some have different flavored ganaches and truffles. A ganache is a type of glaze, icing, sauce, or filling for pastries made from chocolate and cream.  They also have different crepes flavors, they have two types the savory and the sweet type. The savory for example is the turkey and cheese (which is also very yummy). I have tried the sweet crepes multiple times. I would recommend the Nutella one with bananas.  This time I went to the Bellagio I was interested to find something different so I tried the Summer Delight Smoothie and was it delicious. I came back the next day to try it again. It was a combination of lemon and raspberry sorbet mixed together in a smoothie and was it amazing.  The desert highlight of my trip!"}
{"text":"This place looks beautifully like fairy cake land. This place is way bigger than the one at Bellagio.  The queue is very long because of the slow service.  I don't know why the service is slow, because everything is already pre-made.   We had opera cake, Trio cheese cake, JPP cupcake, sweet trio, Berry macaron, key lime cake and mocha.   --+Macaron looks huge, but it tasted soggy.  -++Trio cheesecake and Opera cake were were excellent, you can taste every layer of it, but both were extremely sweet..   +++Jpp cupcake was fluffy and moist, it wasn't too sweet or chunky at all.   ---key lime cake wasn't special  --+The sweet trio looks way attractive than it taste.  ---The mocha is hard to drink, it was extremely sweet, thick and chunky.   We still highly recommend our friends to visit both Jean Philippe patisserie."}
{"text":"Their desserts and cakes are so pretty, you're afraid to eat it.  My husband even ordered a birthday cake from here because he knew how much I like their cakes. I've only tried their sweet desserts, cake and crepes. I have not tried their gelato (too busy with their other desserts)and I know nothing about their breads. Who looks at breads when they have such pretty looking treats? it makes you want to order one of each and eat them all.  After having crepes and 3 different dessert cakes, we ordered 1 more to bring back to the hotel! and yes my bday cake the next day too."}
{"text":"A little pricey but ice cream is worth it they also have pastries and candy. They also have the tallest chocolate fountain in the world! Its inside the Bellagio right near the flower botanical area really nice."}
{"text":"Love Love love-  mostly based on the ever changing displays, really fun and creative. I guess that's not a really fair review - the food is decent, just like to look at everything though, really"}
{"text":"I am so incredibly relieved that there is not one of this restaurant in my city because I would weigh 8,000 pounds. The Bananas Foster Crepe was to die for. Perfectly cooked, the caramelized bananas were sheer heaven, paired with the delicious whipped cream....oh my God it was worth every calorie.  We also ordered some of the granola yogurt parfait cups and they were delicious. Everything was kept in separate little cups so it was fresh when you mix it.  The best yogurt parfait cup I have ever had.  My friends ordered a couple of their pastries and they really enjoyed those, too. Everything we ate here we loved. I am currently salivating just thinking about my crepe and wishing I could have it one more time.  We went in fall so the chocolate sculptures and cakes were mostly Halloween themed and very impressive!"}
{"text":"Creme Brulee & Chocolate Variety tin.  The shop itself is a gorgeous display of their work. LOVED the cakes display. Definitely must stop by to see their chocolate fountain as well.  Creme Brulee was not that good. I've had much better in other restaurants. Chocolate Variety.. Dark was of quality, milk was alright, but white was a bit sweet. Ate it with potato chips to tone it down a bit."}
{"text":"The big chocolate fountain almost reminds me of the chocolate river in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. (The Gene Wilder version) But the place is an absolute treat for the eyes as well as for your mouth although most of the desserts there look too pretty to eat. Tall, beautiful, tiered cakes are used for decor and I believe the last time I was here there was a sculpture of a woman made in all chocolate. Yum!"}
{"text":"Where is the Cold Draft Latte? Hot coffee also disappointing. Some changes to this location and not for the good."}
{"text":"Foofy expensive treats?? yes....  Yummy..... Yes   Expensive???   BUT OF COURSE!!!   Worth what you pay??       Not so much   Great to look at.... Yeah!!"}
{"text":"So I had the ham and cheese with what I think was béchamel sauce. First few bites were really good, then it became to rich for me. I only ate 1/2. I also had an almond pastry which was good. I didn't think the prices were too bad to be inside Aria and the line was long but moves quickly. I almost went to emergency tho, attempting to sip my 300 degree coffee. Waay to hot."}
{"text":"Great for a quick breakfast bite! The ham and cheese croissant was excellent and the cinnamon bun had just enough sweetness to call it a dessert."}
{"text":"Pricey, but decent. A good place for a quick stop to refresh after soaking in second hand smoke and sunscreen. I had a quiche (okay, but kinda soggy) and a fresh squeezed orange juice. The cafe/store is really cool though, they had a few giant chocolate flowers in a display case and all sorts of cool things to look at/buy/drool at."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick little sugar snack!! We have ate at the one at the bellagio casino last time we were in Vegas, so thought we would Chang the scene up and try this one. I got the raspberry tart which was really good. Tart, sweet creamy and crunchy... My husband got the keylime tart. Also very good. Overall a great variety check it out you won't regret it.... Unless you don't like sweets... In that case... What is wrong with you!!!! Hahahah"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for dessert a couple weeks ago and it was delicious. The first thing I noticed when we walked up was the chocolate fountain. It's looks amazing! I've never had the urge to swim in chocolate before seeing this little display. Random, I know!   There are so many options to choose from, it would probably be hard to choose. For us, we came for gelato, so it was easy. I ordered chocolate and it was absolutely delicious. I was surprised by how inexpensive it was, compared to other gelato places on the strip.  They have a few tables inside, even though there isn't much room. Luckily, we got a spot at a high top table. We were seated next to a cake display, which was amazing. Everything is so pretty and well designed. It made me want to order a cake. haha!  I want to go again and try something different next time. They had a whole case of desserts that were so cute, I bet they are delicious! Luckily, I come here to check out the new conservatory displays when they change, so that's a good excuse to come back! :)"}
{"text":"All the pastries look amazing.  So many different kinds and they're all beautiful.  Cakes, cookies, croissants, crepes, oh my!  The line is kinda long and it's a little bit pricey.  I love the display cakes they always have up.  They're gorgeous."}
{"text":"OMFG!!!  The best croissant I ever had. After the croissant I've had here, I don't know how I am going to be able to eat any other croissants. They are $4.00 each which isn't cheap but I really wish we had discovered it before our last day so I could've had more.  We also got Brioche with dulce du lache. This was also good but I much preferred the croissant."}
{"text":"Well ..... what can I say, Phillip is from France , but we are from the states , to expensive for 2 small coffees and a Croissant 16 dollars , amazing thieves ! Even if their rent is so high, is not not fair we pay that price ! Go back to France ! We care for our People ! Bye"}
{"text":"The Matisse of chocolate, Pastry Chef Jean Phillippe Maury has a new gallery for his edible works of art  at the Aria.   Aesthetic enthusiasts will give high marks for the chocolate artworks and very pretty cakes; but foodies will find its cafe offerings (e.g. crepes) less than meeting expectations."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed by the selection of gorgeous cakes and appetizing baked goods, I finally decided to get the raspberry Tart, opera cream torte, Nutella brioche, chocolate almond croissant, palmier and chocolate covered palmier. All of the above are delicious!! It's worth the price and calories"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here at Jean Phillip Patisserie . Very nice young upbeat staff and  exceptional manager Mr Rick. He is  a good leader and is  hands on with the staff and makes sure that they are doing things the right way.   Thank you Ricky and the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"Yes, the imperial cake I tried was delicious and the chocolate fountain was cool...but my experience here was marred by the horrible staff members behind the counter.  I had trekked my butt miles across the strip to find this place and the 4-6 people working would stare at me annoyed, and carry on talking amongst themselves.  There was one person who had already ordered ahead of me so I don't know what the hold up was.  I used to be a pastry chef myself so I totally appreciate the beautiful art/desserts, but they need to hire people who actually care about what Jean Phillippe is all about and are excited to share his craft.  I'd love to go back but might be tempted to head towards Max Brenner or another patisserie."}
{"text":"In love with this place!! They have the best Crepes around! I had the Nutella Crepe as well as the Bananas foster Crepe. We ate every bite as it was so fresh and amazing!  I also tried their Perfect Red Velvet Cupcake. Beyond good!!   Pros: This place is great if you want a quick bite to eat and dont want a long sit down breakfast.  This is a must stop for all future Las Vegas trips for me :)"}
{"text":"The most expensive coffee and patisserie in Vegas! However the coffee is exquisite, the paninis  are tasty  and pastries are very delightful and chocolates Devine!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this review short and sweet just like JPP! If you're used to great baked goods, pastries, chocolates and sweets like I am... then this is your stop. Jean Philippe Patisserie is your single best friend in Vegas if you're a lover of all things sweet and sugary.  I was overwhelmed with choices in chocolates, pastries, cookies, etc. Their macarons are ridiculously complex and make any others I've seen or tried pale in comparison. I only had a small piece of my friend's macaron and it pretty much blew my mind. The chocolates were flavorful and delicious. There was just too much goodness here to fit into one stop. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll make sure to swing by at least twice to ensure I get to try as many of their goodies as possible.  Come here first and save yourself from wandering through other casinos looking for inferior shops.  I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"This location has the world famous chocolate fountain. Dark, milk, and white chocolate flows from top to bottom. 2 tons in all. The gelato and crepes were amazing."}
{"text":"Still one of the better pastry shop in this area of the Strip, comparing to Palio at bellagio. Yes, it is pricey but you are in Vegas, baby, everything is expensive even a bottle of water is $1 more than your hometown.  I had creme brulee and napoleon and both are very good! This is one of must-stop pastry shops for me when I visit Vegas. Cheers."}
{"text":"If you're craving something sweet while at Aria, Jean Philippe Patisserie is the place to go! They are open from 6am to 2am so you can satisfy your sweet tooth anytime of the day.  Everything at Jean Philippe Patisserie is great, but my personal favorite is the cinnamon roll. With a thousand reviews, there are barely any reviews for this delicious treat!! It definitely does not look like your typical cinnamon roll. Instead, they are a shaped like a perfect little cylinder with a circle of cream cheese frosting on top.   This cinnamon roll is what I would think of if a cinnamon roll and a croissant had a baby! A cinnasant? Or croissamon? Hmmm... not very catchy.... Anyways, it tastes like a cinnamon roll but the dough is very similar to a croissant. Light and buttery. Make sure to get it warmed so the frosting gets all melty and gooey :)"}
{"text":"Oh Jean Phillipe, if my countrymen could make pastries as well as you do, I too would be quick to surrender during wartime so I could get back to eating your delicious confections.  The first time I came here, I was paralyzed by all the choices - I wanted to try everything!  Unfortunately my tiny wallet could not keep up with my cavernous stomach so we opted for the Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, and Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My friend loved the Creme Brulee, I thought it was ok, with exception of the chocolate cracker within it which was divine.  You bite into something dark and rich and sweet and then all of a sudden you reach something that is thin, crunchy, and light.  It's amazing!  The raspberry cheesecake was good, except it might be cloyingly sweet for some, it was almost too much for me.  And finally the tiramisu, Jean Philippe takes this trite dessert to new heights.  It's creamy, light, velvety, sweet, and just bitter enough all in one bite.  If you don't get anything else here, get the tiramisu!  Jean Philippe Maury. Not only do you boast the largest chocolate fountain in the world at your Bellagio counterpart's patisserie, but you have the nerve to entice me with classic French pastries, crêpes, and gelato. Fils de pute!"}
{"text":"Everything looked so pretty!  Creme Brulee Ice cream - don't waste your taste buds. I LOVE creme brulee but the ice cream didn't have much brulee to the cream."}
{"text":"Since we stayed at the Aria, we came here on two separate occasions. First one, lady seemed none too pleased that we were disrupting the quietness. The second time, it was packed and received much better service. I'm giving 4 stars more based on the second visit. Got a croissant, coffee twice and salmon crepe. All very good. A little pricey for \"fast food\" but it's to be expected in LV and was really good quality food. If you're staying at the Aria like I did, good place to go. If you're not, not sure if it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"CliffsNotes: Simply put, one of the most amazing pastry shoppes in all of Vegas.  You'll find cakes, tarts, and other confectioneries that are visually and gastronomically appealing.  Forget about fancy restaurants and fancy plated desserts.  Enjoy the same experience for a fraction of the price here Jean Philippe Patiserrie.  [Original Visit: November 5, 2010]"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING at the Jean Philippe Patisserie always looks amazing. I don't know how they do it, but each and every treat looks like a work of art.   I love the tiramisu gelato - it's amazing in a white chocolate waffle cone. And don't even get me started on the cheesecakes, fruit tarts, etc. They look almost too pretty to eat! (But you will eat them, because they're absolutely delicious.)"}
{"text":"I asked for extra hot for my hot chocolate and it really wasn't that hot.  The bottom 5th of my cup was lumpy.  The Nutella Brioche was ok, not worth the calories.  Croissant was good (crispy, flaky but not warm...) and it's in typical monstrous American size (to justify the $4 price)."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh chocolate!  Their crepes are DELICIOUS - both the sweet and salty ones.  Highly recommend this place - though it is rather expensive for such small portions.  Their coffee is insanely expensive, and not that good, but everything else is superb!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the quality of their food. Took one star from the perfect score for the price. But again who goes to Vegas and count pennies?  Love love love their pastries and their espresso was good. Try their chocolate treats too. Just looking at the chocolate fountain is a dream.  The line can be a bit long in the morning when everyone's getting their pick me up but the line moves quickly. Unless you are in a rush this won't take you more than 5 minutes.  The staff here are very nice too."}
{"text":"Located close to the elevators at the aria casino. A nice place to relax with your favorite pastry, coffee, or crepe. Or just cool and people watch. The chicken crepe was on, the chicken was dry, but the filling made up for it. The menu is slightly over priced for the quality. I expected better, but probably crepe in not their specialty. I prefer the crepe at Paris casino."}
{"text":"We rushed to this place as our last stop in Vegas before heading to the airport. I am so sad that we didn't discover it sooner! This place is world class. On par with the best shops in France or Italy. What an amazing end to our trip!  Since we were in a hurry we all ordered ice cream. We had chocolate, peanut butter brittle, and hazelnut ice creams, and strawberry and coconut (no dairy, all coconut milk) for sorbets. All around we agreed that this is THE BEST Gelato/ICE CREAM AND SORBET that we have ever had, anywhere.   Each dish ($4.95) comes with 2 generous scoops (hallelujah!). The kids really liked the dark or white chocolate dipped cones.  I recommend that you sample all of their options- the crepes looked amazing, and the pastries were spectacularly beautiful. I think that I even saw some sandwich options around the back of the counter. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I come here for the tiramisu gelato and the croissants every time I come to stay at Bellagio. The gelato has chunks of what looks like coffee soaked sponge cake or lady fingers and a heavy taste of the creamy taste in gelato from the mascarpone cheese. Most of the pastrys are very good. The blueberry brioche is one of my favorites however nothing can beat the magnificently made croissant."}
{"text":"One of the best key lime tart I've ever had. Definitely high end $$$, environment is pretty nice as well. It is in the casino, so not the most private or romantic. But the sweets will win her heart"}
{"text":"J.P.P is an excellent way to start/end from the Bellagio exhibition hall!  Nothing like a great piece of chocolate croissant to start off the day...  It's as big as your hand... flaky but not too greasy and also has a decent chunk of milk chocolate. I'm not sure how I ate it as quickly as I did...almost went back for seconds.   Finished it off with some of their coffee blend... and I was set! Hubby said it's a darker roast.   I love their chocolate fountain... apparently it's the largest one in the world. So much stuff here (desserts, crepes, pastries, salads, sandwiches)...  Yes, all items are pricier - the croissant cost $3.95.  Also tried their forest crepe -- quite yummy!! loved the side salad too.   The rose macaron was okay.... probably should skip it. it's too sweet.   There's a line... but while you wait, you can stare at their beautiful cake designs and oogle at their desserts (I sure did). =)"}
{"text":"The best bakery in Las Vegas!  The Almond Croissant and Almond Brioche are a must. Also, not usually a fan quiche but that too was fantastic"}
{"text":"I love JPP. It's located inside of Bellagio, just past the conservatory on the left.   They have pre-made sandwiches, and breakfast foods and pre-made cakes made by the hotel's pastry department. You can order coffee and crepes as well as gelato. The gelato is my favorite. It's really creamy.  They also have chocolate covered strawberries that are amazing!   Best thing of course though is the chocolate fountain. Check it out!"}
{"text":"came twice!  situated inside bellagio, this is a great stop for some fast and (relatively cheap) lunch. We had the Forest Crepe; a savory ham, cheese and mushroom crepe with chipotle sauce. it's quite large, so i'd share this if you're not too hungry. I also had their chocolate muffin, mini sandwiches (it came in a pack of 3.. a apple brie, tuna, and ham and cheese), asian shrimp salad and tea. the stars were the crepe and shrimp salad. save room for gelato!"}
{"text":"Go here for the chocolate, crepes, and the fountain.  I will go back to try the cheesecake.  I'm attracted to the cakes and I've never bought the panini or sorbet.  If you want to people-watch, sit at the stuffed chairs past the patisserie.  My boyfriend and I always buy truffles, which are creamy, deliciously good, expensive, and rich."}
{"text":"I came here for an afternoon snack with my bf. We got a nutella crepe to go. SO good! We got an extra scoop of gelato on top, which complemented the crepe very well. The only gripe I have is that it's a bit pricey for what you get, but it's Vegas, so that's not totally unexpected.  -L."}
{"text":"This one's inside Aria and is a bit larger than the one at Bellagio.  It also has more seating to enjoy your tasty goodness.  The pastries are delicious.  The Key Lime Tart, Tirimisu, Lemon Tart are all fabulous.  Check-out the amazing chocolate display of Zarkana as well.  If you're a dessert person, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I came back a couple of times recently since we were enjoying a mini-vacay in Vegas.  This place continues to impress.  We enjoyed some late night geleato.  The mango and strawberry flavors were delish.  Stopped by another morning for a quick breakfast and enjoyed an apple brioche and almond croissant.  Everything here is fabulous."}
{"text":"Desserts are amazing! I had the pistachio gelato and tried one of the cheese cakes. Not only do they taste divine, they look great. The service was great and there was not a long wait. Everyone was friendly.   You can also order cakes there for different events. You do have to give them 24 hour notice though."}
{"text":"AHHHHHH this place is incredible!  I did quite a bit of exploring during my time in Vegas, and I must say that Jean Philippe is one of the only places I would say is a must stop location in this city. It got to the point where I was considering skipping some really wonderful meals and just eating here instead.   I'll keep it short and sweet. Every patisserie I tried was beautiful and delicious, wonderfully light and delicious, creamy and (in most cases) the perfect little crunch. This is the ONLY place you need to go to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Ugh, I would do anything to be back at Jean Philippe right now. I'm done with this review."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to review Jean Philippe, I'll have a hard time forgiving myself.   This place is magical. Beautiful glass crafted chocolate waterfalls (Willy Wonka style), pristine white tile, just gorgeous.   The desserts though, the desserts were just amazing. The cakes, fudges, chocolate...everything..everything was amazing. I kid you not I begged the group I was with to skip dessert at every restaurant we visited so that we could go back here, and it was the only place we visited twice during our trip."}
{"text":"Saw both locations of this. I have to say that the Chocolate Fountain in the one in the Bellagio is awesome. Who doesn't want to just stick their head in there? I only tried one thing from the location in the Aria and that was a Pain au Chocolate. It wasn't too bad. It was extremely crispy on the outside, like the kind that is so brittle that big pieces sort of shatter off, not the nice, light flaking you get with others. However, it was nice and buttery and had plenty of chocolate in it. I was pleasantly surprised. I am usually disappointed by most croissants, but this was pretty good."}
{"text":"OK so here's an update.  Because the almighty yelper Nelson Q is not allowed to post his own review for his employer (understandable due to the conflict of interest but... what a shame considering how passionate he is about his work!), I'm going to pass what I heard from him here.  The Nutella Napoleon and Opera Slice are his personal faves in the dessert case, and on the retail side, the World Champion cookies (Hazelnut and Gianduja cookies), and the Exotic Crepe for tropical flavors. in the gelato section, Pistachio and Hazelnut.  Also, the best time to go there is between 9-10am as they fill the dessert case around that time.  Next week, JPP will get two kinds of Christmas Logs (Buche De Noel) - they just finished assembling one which has orange confit, almond nougatine, exotic cremeux, and vanilla mousse inside. There is also a chocolate variation assembled over the new few days.  Sounds amazing, no??"}
{"text":"Ambiance This was a great place to stop and take a photo.  They had the largest chocolate fountain in the world.  Definitely enough to just go and take a picture of that.   Food That gelato is the bomb.  Again, I'm sad to see it go because it was worth the wait in line.  Service This place gets a pretty long line due to the fountain.  It was worth the wait if one wanted gelato."}
{"text":"Ambiance I am so sad that this place closed according before I could do a great review on Yelp.  The is right next to the craps table, slot machines, and to the hotel elevators.  It's a perfect location to go and grab something before heading up to the room.  Souvenirs such as chocolates, cups, mugs were available as well.  Food The gelato was so good.  It had so many good flavors.  The food itself was pretty good as well.  There was a good variety of items to try.    Service The customer service was pretty good.  The people were generally upbeat and gave the free gelato samples when asked."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious but the price was horrible lol. Anyway, worth a try if you've never had their dessert, but make sure you don't get them with the hot chocolate! (Although I have a sweet tooth, it turned out too sweet for me lol)"}
{"text":"Always walked by here when we are in Vegas and visiting the Garden in the Bellagio but never ordered anything. This time we did...  We got a crepe (Nutella with banana foster) and a scoop of gelato.  Gelato was okay...the crepe toppings were okay...but the crepe itself was delicious!!! it was worth the $18.00  I'm glad I finally got to try it...I'm thinking about that crepe right now...I want some...hmmmm"}
{"text":"Always stop here while staying at Bellagio.  I usually come during a holiday so it's usually fairly busy haha.  The decorations are usually what attracts people, I think, save for the chocolate fountain!  On my most recent venture, it was over Christmas so they had the Grinch as their main decoration which was really well done!  Every time I passed by here, though, the lines were outrageous.  After Christmas Eve dinner, however, we chose to brave it and grab a crepe for dessert.  Apparently it's changed a bit since I visited NYE 2017.  There were 2 lines, but neither one was clearly identified as which was for gelato, crepes, bakery, coffee, etc.  So my step-dad and I chose the line that started around back.  Luckily, we chose correctly.  It was a bit of a wait, but the staff seemed to be moving at a great pace considering the crowd.  It was Christmas Eve, after all, I'm sure they would rather be at home.  Now, I don't consider myself a crepe connoisseur in the slightest.  But I have found that there are two ways people make crepes:  one with all the yummies added on the inside and the other with all the yummies on top.  I prefer the former, but Jean Philippe prefers the latter.  No matter, it was delicious nonetheless, if not overly pricey (like everything else in Vegas).  I mean personally, I've had better crepes from an all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet than this place AND the entire meal cost the same as ONE crepe.  But hey, like I said, it's Vegas.  You pay for the experience.  WIll I return?  But of course!  I am eager to see what decoration they have next!"}
{"text":"Most owners of a 'sweet tooth' will forgive the culinary sin of adding too much sugar while suppressing every other flavor and texture.  That's why the recipe for a successful Patisserie is relatively simple.     Yet there is no excuse for making bad desserts.    We tried two desserts:   strawberry tart and opera cake.   Both were medicore at best.   The strawberry tart shell - subtracting the strawberries - was so sweet that even the tartness of strawberries could not offer any counter balance.   Too much sugar.   The opera cake (it's a French dessert but try one in Vienna ...) is distinguished by a delicate balance of bitterness and sweetness between dark chocolate ganache and coffee buttercream.   The sugar content in this version left us no choice but to just leave it after one bite.    Disappointing."}
{"text":"How do you have a highly rated French bakery and can't serve a crepe??  Would expect a place open until 2 am to serve or state that things close, not have you make a decision on yelp and get there and not be able to get what they are highly rated for!"}
{"text":"Maybe 4.5.  I'm just so in love with chocolate and sweets that I'm already biased. I could be reviewing the Target candy/chocolate section and writing about how much I love THAT.  The unfortunate part is that this is EXPENSIVE SHIT. The phrase, \"You get what you pay for,\" comes to mind. I mean, it's true.  But as we know, everyone trying to make money takes advantage of that.  The lines ARE annoying.  And I have a difficult time making a selection EVERY SINGLE TIME...it's so time consuming that I wish I could avoid the place entirely.  However, that's impossible - because my ass is already huge, so that's my excuse to SPLURGE. It's not getting any smaller, hun. Thanks, Jean Philippe!"}
{"text":"I love how this place is located by the guest elevator so every time you walk by, it just calls your name! I tried one of their delicious banana crepes with banana ice cream.  Mmmmm mmmmm it was so good, it just melted in my mouth.  I love how their plastic utensils mimic real ones.  I thought that was a cute touch."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype of this place was because it's pretty average to me. The place is definitely pretty but the quality of food is not that great for the price. I bought 2 macarons and 4 pieces of chocolate and they were just all right. It's definitely a good place to check out in Vegas and definitely picture worthy, but not really to eat on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Beautiful works of pastry art right in the Bellagio hotel. Jean Phillipe knew what he was doing. It was so hard to choose just one pastry to eat for breakfast. But, we managed to complete this arduous task. My friends and I chose the triple chocolate cheesecake, straight cheesecake, blueberry dessert, Intense (chocolate on chocolate upon more chocolate), and a fruit tart. In addition, we got milk chocolate and white chocolate covered strawberries. They were just too good not to order as well. Everything we chose was absolutely delicious, albeit a little on the sweeter side than I'd like it to be. Thank goodness we had lots to water to wash all the sugar down. But, the quality of the ingredients - down to the chocolate, the cheese, the fruit - was amazing. It was a shame we didn't have enough time (or room in our stomachs) for their other offerings, such as their gelato and their baked goods. I saw an almond croissant (with almond paste inside) that I really wanted to try. Sigh, next time...  The best thing was we were eating our pastries while enjoying the artwork there. A French woman sculpture in a summer gown towered over the bakery, and the famous chocolate fountain were sights to be seen. So, if you're staying in the Bellagio or just hotel hopping here, please give Jean Phillippe patisserie a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Visited Jean Philippe Patisserie for a quick breakfast treat  on my trip to Vegas. I ordered the Nutella Crepe and a Latte. The crepe was as close to a real French crepe I have ever tasted! They had an array of pastries and sandwiches that I will definitely be trying in the future."}
{"text":"To get a quick snack to satisfy my sweet tooth, this place does just that. This tiny food shop located in a huge casino/resort area is such a hidden gem. When i stay here or near Bellagio, it's always been such a treat to sample their items on the menu. The plating is so beautiful too. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"BEST. GELATO. MILKSHAKE. EVER!  I had my first taste of this mind-blowing foodgasm at the other Jean Philippe Patisserie location in the Bellagio on my first trip to Vegas.  I was SO EXCITED to discover they had opened another location in the Aria, where we were staying!  Can anyone say midnight gelato runs?  What a dream come true!  Beautifully presented gelatos - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=O6-5dA0dYS4rqyRAFVn6wQ#O6-5dA0dYS4rqyRAFVn6wQ (& that's showing only half the flavors)  Unfortunately I was only able to have one milkshake my whole stay here, mostly because it was SO filling and I wanted to make sure I had room in my stomach to try other awesome Vegas eats.  BUT that one milkshake was so heavenly!  I definitely would have gotten another if it hadn't been our last day in Vegas.  We got the hazelnut/cappuccino gelato shake to share between the two of us.  We saw the worker scoop two HUGE scoops of hazelnut gelato and thinking she forgot about the cappuccino part we reminded her \"oh, hazelnut and cappuccino, yeah?\".  \"Oh, yup!\" she answered as she had known all along.  Two more HUGE scoops of espresso gelato later, I realize that it takes 4 gigantic scoops of gelato to make this ultra-creamy, decadent slice of heaven!  The flavors mixed wonderfully, and we even experienced a slight crunch in the gelato from the hazelnuts--great texture!  Taste was perfect and so creamy that it almost felt like we were drinking straight gelato!  If you're a gelato lover, you must try this!!!  As we turned the corner, we saw that they also have a cafe side, where they sell paninis, sandwiches, and coffee.  Will have to try here next time for the gelato + panini one-two punch!!"}
{"text":"If your in Las Vegas and you are near the city center drop by this place and at least give it a try. I had the creme Brulee ice cream and man was it good. I usually will not eat ice cream, but this place seemed different. Don't expect the price to be cheap because they are a little pricy. But worth every bite!"}
{"text":"This bakery is located inside the Aria. We were staying at the Vdara and just wanted a quick coffee and bite before we started gambling. You get in line, order your pastry/food, pay...and then they call your name when it's ready. It's first come first served seating, so make sure to hover and get a seat. There's a lot of people who are sitting and eating, so try to have one person wait for a seat while the other waits for the food. The coffee is delicious, and our ham and cheese croissant was so savory, flaky, and steamy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fanrastic!   The chocolate milkshake is very rich and tasty, they also have an option of fat free milk that makes it just perfect."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, but then I absolutely love chocolate. They have the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted hands down. It has a rich chocolate flavor, but isn't really sweet...just sweet enough to not be overly bitter. I love it. I also love their cakes...everything is sooo good! Their pastries are delish too. My friend had one of their savory crepes, it looked very yummy as well, and she seemed to enjoy it a lot. A must go to every time you're in vegas!"}
{"text":"This location is better than the one in Bellagio. Better seating, more space to browse their goods, and they have heir different stations separated out more clearly. Basically it's not as congested in there. I can always count on them to have at least 10 different pastries I want to try and chocolates I want to buy!"}
{"text":"We visit vegas monthly and this place is ALWAYS a must stop! Delicious, subtly sweet desserts and pastries. The white mocha hot coffee is also great to pair with any pastry. I've tried almost every type they offer, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This pattisiere in Bellagio is great for breakfast! They have a great variety of savoury and desert crepes. Their pastries are amazing. Once in here, you'll pretty much want every single thing in their menu. Check out my pictures of some mouthwatering pastries!  We ordered vegetable omelette, yummy exotic desert crepe and pistachio milkshake. We wanted to order more  but resisted the temptation! The omelette was just okay ( hence 4 stars! ). The exotic desert crepe was amazing! This crepe has the perfect combination of passion fruit and mango served with coconut icecream on the side.. yumm.. Also, you must try one of their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"All I will say it was multiple O's in my mouth, one after another. Not cheap but worth every penny!!!! The only down thing is the seating area that it is a bit cramp, but very stylish..."}
{"text":"Probably the best gelato and crepes I've ever had and I've had crepes from London to Paris to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I did not get to fully indulge and sample everything that I wanted (probably for the best), but the treats I did try were good.I had a napoleon and a key-lime cookie tarte type thing. Both were very flavorful and appear pricey until you try one and find yourself unable to finish it. They are decently sized desserts raging from $5-8 each. My only complaint would be excessive amount of sugar in both of the desserts making them overly rich. The employees were very efficient and kept the long line moving. The chocolate fountain in front makes for a great spot for tourist to stop in the middle and gawk. The walls are filled with many (overpriced) sweet treats to take home as a memento."}

{"text":"Dear Macaron lovers,  I went on a search mission to find some real French Macarons in Vegas. After some research online, i came down to 3 places that have them (or should have them according to online reviews)- Jean Phillipe, Payard Patisserie, Bouchon Bakery. To my surprise, only Bouchon had the best deal, biggest macarons, and the cheapest price (when comparing sizes).. Jean Philippe should be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that they sell macarons. All they had was puny 6 tiny macarons in a bag (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise themselves, and as much aura as they create around them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for some puny little pre-packaged bags that was way overpriced..  All i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron. Jean Phillipe, i give you the lowest score for falsely advertising what you really don't have in your shop. Shame on you.."}
{"text":"The line takes a minute to figure out here; there are separate lines in the different areas, and one line to pay. The Raspberry tart was so good - loved the pistachio cream in it - but the lemon meringue tart was very standard and not too exciting. Just viewing the gorgeous pastries and desserts is fun, because they are so artistically made."}
{"text":"The prices are a little steep, but the quality and presentation of the desserts more than makes up for it. We ordered a raspberry intense cake and a chocolate croissant, and they were so good. They also have the world's largest chocolate fountain, which was awesome to see."}
{"text":"i ordered some pastries and crepes to go on a random wednesday morning, but this place was still a circus.  the system is not very well organized, and many customers were shaking their heads over how long their orders took for pastries that were already made and showcased under the glass counter just under your fingertips. i was thinking \" how long could it take?  they're not baking them to order or anything.  20 minutes it took for them to put the french doughnuts in a box and call your number, i kid u not. if-you-could-just-put-them-in-a-friggin-box i would appreciate it very much.    if you want crepes you have to order at one counter and then pick them up at a different counter, meaning you have to stand in two lines, rather odd and puzzling.  the d-bag making my crepes saw me waiting but kept talking on the phone for 10 minutes, then finally came over and made the crepes for me.  to be honest, i really didn't even feel like eating them after i saw him making them, touching my food with his chubby fingers.  but i still ate em anyways cuz i was starvin marvin.  and he was wearing gloves.  the whole ordeal took more than 40 minutes altogether.  the chocolate truffles are to die for, so rich and smooth.  pastries overall are very good, but i believe our own le delice is just as good or even better.  prices for pastries, believe it or not, are about the same, which goes to show you le delice was slightly generous? in its pricing."}
{"text":"This place really raises the bar for pastries and desserts.  I won't be able to eat at Panera anymore without making comparisons to JPP."}
{"text":"Oh my...the strawberry tart is love at first sight and falling in love all over again after first bite...and again and again. The shortbread base was moist and buttery, the cream was light and delicate on the palette and the strawberries were fresh and ripe just enough. We shared this dessert, but it was the kind of dessert you wished you got for yourself, so our advice, if you're with your SO...don't share lol.   We also shared the Chicken Crepe which was also perfectly flavored. I don't even like chicken (originally wanted the smoked salmon but it was gone) so I settled for chicken; but was pleasantly surprised because the wheat crepe gave it a nice nutty taste, the spinach and tomatoes were fresh and balanced out the chipotle sauce, and the chicken was juicy and well seasoned.  The hazelnut latte was also very light and a good complement to our crepe and dessert!"}
{"text":"You can find here sooo many good deserts that it is really hard to choose one. The staff was very helpful and willing to give some advice what to take. Surely worth to visit. It is though a bit expensive, but the taste recompensate it completely."}
{"text":"Forget about how much these desserts cost because they taste frickin fabulous! In my opinion under $10 for a piece of heaven is a bargain! We stopped by and picked up a Lemon Tart for Mr. B. and a triple chocolate thingy and a Rose Macaroon.  The mini sized desserts are deceiving. The triple chocolate dessert was so chocolaty rich I could only handle a few nibbles at one time. Same goes for the Rose Macaroon that was definitely different! A rose petal that's edible covered in sugar, macaroon filled with a light raspberry flavored mousse and surrounded by berrylious raspberries. A few little bites in one sitting was just enough. That's going to be an extra 2 hours to work that off in the gym for sure. ..but it's worth it!  Am I the only one that finds watching the chocolate waterfall flow from one dish to another while waiting in line therapeutic? Thinking I should install a fountain like that one day in our home. At least watching that is fat free right?  Shop was crowded but line was controlled and I eventually figured out where the line to pick/purchase goodies started by the \"line starts here\" sign. NOTE: There are two different lines, one for the baked good, ie croissants and such..and one for the decadent treats, ie cupcakes, macaroons. Wait time can be short or take awhile depending on how indecisive the person in front of you is. Cashier was nice and pretty patient considering all the inquisitive and indecisive customer after customer(including me) he had."}
{"text":"The patisserie is inside Aria, a beautiful casino on its own; Jean P. is a dessert and crepe wonderland. It appears that willy wonka designed the space and went extra-nutso.   The desserts are so attractive and varied that I was actually feeling possessive towards them while in line.  As in, please don't anyone take one of these, I just want to keep staring at it all lustfully. I had a chocolate eclair (insanity), and a cinnamon bun, iced (ludicrous). Great little dessert and/or morning coffee spot inside a beautiful casino.   People watching perch makes it a solid 5 stars, as if it needed that. I'd walk a half mile to visit this place if I weren't staying at the Aria, and with all the ridiculous food choices in Vegas, that's saying something..."}
{"text":"The one @ the Bellagio is smaller and not as pretty. We came here twice on our 5 day trip to Vegas during CES week. Our first time my friend shared a Blueberry Danish and a Pabana Smoothie.. The danishes are $3.95 and although pricey, it's worth it. There are a ton of blueberries in every bite. The crust is flaky and so buttery. The Pabana Smoothie was pretty good too but really expensive, but they do use a good amount of fruit and sorbet so it's somewhat worth the $9. I shared both with my friend and we were actually pretty full since we didn't have breakfast or lunch. It was just to tie us over because we were going to have a late dinner @ Craftsteak.  The next day we grabbed lunch at JP after CES. We got the Berry Smoothie & a Tropical one.. also decided to try the ham and cheese sandwich and one of the chocolate desserts.   They ran out of an ingredient for the Berry Smoothie so it was a bit sour and should've been slightly thicker. The tropical one was okay, but the best smoothie is the Pabana. The ham and cheese sandwich was still warm when I brought all the food/drinks back to my hotel room. I shared the sandwich with my friend; it's a pretty small sandwich to begin with. It was pretty good, but it could've used at least one more slice of ham. It was mostly cheese which was pretty tasty. I don't know which cheese it was, but it had a pretty strong smell. I guess I'm not used to eating cheese. =D Also, the sandwich could've been grilled instead because once it was warmed up, the white bread was pretty soggy. Other than that, it was good. The chocolate dessert, I don't know what it was called but it had a gold leaf on top. I didn't really like it, but it was pretty. I took a small bite and let my friend finish the rest. It wasn't as rich or sweet as I thought it should be.  Still this place has delicious pastries. My friend wants to go back and get the Ham & Cheese croissant as well as the chocolate one."}
{"text":"Crepes...abnormally good. Macaroons..to die for!  Let us not forget to mention the gigantic, vegas-typical, over the top chocolate fountain to get you in the mood! Plain and simple this is an incredibly place to satisfy your sweet tooth and indulge!"}
{"text":"Hmmm yeah, apparently  I never got the memo about why this place is so cool. Everything is overpriced and nothing tastes that special. The lines are long too... 20 minutes to get a coffee and a bagel? Come on, Starbucks doesn't even take that long and is half the price and they are considered expensive by a lot of people!!! The workers look like funny umpa lumpas with their outfits and hats which I guess is good for a little laugh. Anyways... I guess I just didn't get this place... Right? I'm confused, why do people rave about this place?"}
{"text":"Their gelato is SO. FREAKIN. GOOD.  The lines are ridiculous and so are the prices, but I hardly come to Vegas, so I had to get some. I shared a double scoop of pistachio and tiramisu gelato with my dad. Heavenly.   I'm not even sure how I chose those flavors because the other ones looked so amazing. It was so hard to choose. MMM MM MM. I love all the desserts they have on display, they're so pretty to look at.  And we can't forget the infamous, impossible to get a picture without someone photobombing it, chocolate waterfall.   Did I mention gelato is delish?"}
{"text":"We went to this place solely based on my friend's suggestion as she has been here before and loved it badly. Turned out we made the most wise decision, their chocolate fondue was amazing as it can automatically pour itself from one plate to a lower level and will get sucked back to the highest. We tried the blueberry and chocolate cupcake, not too sweet was so spongy and soft in mouth, we enjoyed our time to the best extent."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, however most employees belong at circus circus, not to the  Bellagio! Spending $90 for a breakfast of four which is worth it, it will be nice to crack a smile."}
{"text":"***Like the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria, this high-end patisserie features a wide variety of beautiful pastries and cakes; unfortunately, also like that location in Aria, the service is slow here***  I've been to the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria a few times and I've definitely had a lot of good things there.  I've had a few average things there too, which feel even worse than they probably are given the high prices.  Service tends to be slow there as well and it stems from a lack of an organized setup and an inefficient use of the staff.  This Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is the original Vegas location and it feels very similar.  Like the Aria location, they feature a wide variety of beautiful individual cakes and pastries.  There are also lunch options, crepes and many packaged goods for gifts and such.  I like the setup at this bakery more though.  It is located far from the casino while the Aria location is right in the casino.  I was only able to try the pain au chocolat, but it was good.  The pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery while the chocolate center was smooth and good.  There were many other nice looking items including a very appetizing looking brioche muffin-type pastry that might just rival the citrus pistachio brioche at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville.  Prices were high, but that is to be expected given that this bakery is located in Vegas and that it features very nicely presented pastries and desserts.  Like the Aria location, the service is very slow here.  Part of the slow service is caused by the long lines that this popular spot attracts.  Also, there seems to be a lot of indecisive customers, which is understandable given the wide variety of options you have here.  But the service does feel inefficient.  There seems to be a lot of staff, but the ordering and pickup process is not that smooth.  There were not enough registers open so even though they were taking orders quickly, the cashiers could not process the orders quick enough so the line really started to build.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a great spot for breakfast pastries and their individual cakes also look good.  It might be one of the best shops in this part of The Strip for a sweet treat.  Unfortunately, the service (while pleasant) is very slow.  If that does not bother you or if you can come here during non-peak times, this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is worth a visit.  Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking."}
{"text":"***I do not think the pastries and desserts at Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie are worth the high prices, but it still one to consider if you are on the hunt for fancy-looking desserts (I haven't loved anything here yet, but there are some good items)***  Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie has a very attractive display of pastries and individual desserts.  Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).  I had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.  I also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  The parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).  Service is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.  Prices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).  Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.  Aria has its own parking structure, which is free.  Valet parking is also available."}
{"text":"Go here, but not just for the most luscious looking chocolate fountain - that is the least impressive thing at Jeane Philipe.  I can say I am their number one fan and customer.  I go to Vegas about 3-4 times a year, and I never leave without eating their delicious crepes and getting dozens of pastries.  My last splurge was a grand total of $350.  I can honestly say it was worth every penny.  Okay, don't get scared - I bought a lot of pastries, chocolates, gifts, etc. Just to give you an estimate - prices are on average $3.50 for pastries, $10.00 paninis, $12.00 for clear packaged goodies, $30-70 for the very elegant boxed chocolates.   My most favorite thing to eat at JP is their chocolate crepe. You can see it in my \"profile pic\" I hope. I love how delightful it is.  Their whip cream is so light and refreshing.  They have this special chocolate sauce they put on top with pieces of brownie drizzled with some chocolate flakes. Perfectionnn! They make the crepes right in front of you, which is kind of cool.   One of my other favorite items is their tuna panini.  I've never had a better sandwich.  Their ciabatta bread is so fluffy inside and a little crispy outside.  Make sure you get them to toast it.   My other favorites are their french macaroons, chocolate croissants (to die for), cheese danish and bear claw.  I've also picked up many of their boxed chocolates (truffle box, square box and ballotin box) and different types of candies in clear containers (butterfinger sticks, caramelized peanuts, chocolate covered pretzels, florentins (my father's favorite), peanut brittle, and almond dragees, etc).  I've pretty much tried everything because I can't get enough of JP!  The last, but not least is their amazing display of cakes.  I'm posting a couple pictures so look for them! :)"}
{"text":"This probably my favorite place to eat In Vegas. Everything here is amazing from the crepes to the pastry the chocolates oh my if I lived near this place I'd gain a 100 pounds in a year. Can't wait to get back here for brioche and cheesecake. Love this place. Love."}
{"text":"We've stayed at Aria several times in the past but never tried Jean Philippe until now. What fools we were for never having tried it before!! This is place is AMAZING. Now I understand why the lines are always so long.  Luckily, the line wasn't too bad for us because we went late (around 11pm). However, because we went so late, they were out of a lot things. Boo. So I recommend coming earlier if you want to get their entire selection. (I hear the croissants are TDF!)  They offer a variety of things like gelato, crepes, chocolates, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pastries, coffee, etc.  We settled on a prosciutto panini and nutella crepe. The prosciutto panini was delicious and we especially liked the bread - so crispy and buttery. The melted buffalo mozzarella cheese and aioli mayo made it that much yummier, too. The nutella crepe didn't look very impressive at first because it was so simple (literally just a layer of nutella inside with some whip cream on the outside) but it was SO GOOD! The crepe was made well and had this amazing chewy consistency that made me want more. Of course, at $9 a pop, I had to hold back. (Thank goodness our resort credits covered it!)  So if you're ever in Aria and craving a snack or dessert, I definitely recommend checking this place out. Oh and don't forget to charge to your room if you're staying at any of the Mlife properties because you get points for every dollar you spend at the hotels. It adds up quickly, especially if you're buying $11 paninis and $9 crepes. LOL"}
{"text":"This is located on the first floor at Aria, right by the guest elevators. Came here for a some breakfast treats. Coffee Aulait, Bearclaw and Apfel Strudel. The pastries and coffee were very good. Total price for all three was roughly $13, so definitely not cheap but also not too expensive. Took about 5 minutes to get my treats and then walked back up to my room. They also have many other tasty pastries and treats. They have a pretty decent amount of seating which overlooks the casino floor."}
{"text":"Yummm what a fantastic chocolate shop in the Aria resort. They also have great grab and go lunch options, take home gifts and desserts to enjoy there or to take to your room. Staff is friendly, prices are competitive and the food quality is top notch. A great place to grab a meal and/ or dessert while in Vegas."}
{"text":"All I can say is I was in awe! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=rl2JGorNzU1Tv0xe1iZBmA  Located inside of the beautiful Bellagio Hotel, Jean Philippe Patisserie is a small bakery/ gelato bar/ coffee & tea house/ sandwich shop. Jean attracts lots of visitors because of its floor to ceiling, tri-chocolate fountain. It's really a sight to behold. All of their delicious looking pastries, cakes, tarts, cookies, cupcakes, gelato and sandwiches are on display for all to see.   I came here specifically because of my buddy, Michelle \"Addicted 2 Key Lime Pie\" T. I wanted to try their Key Lime Tart so I could let her know how it stacked up to others we've tried. I also wanted to try their Crème Brulee gelato she raved about in her review. Well, I went to Jean two times and sadly, they didn't offer the Crème Brulee gelato on either of my visits. I was bummed, but that didn't stop me from trying lots of there other tasty items. Here is what I tried;  Key Lime Tart (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=uRjFKrymgjFdvSpVWGqh0g Rose Macaron (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Okeoz6p_hXzhQNJkp7UEPw Coconut Gelato (5 stars-Best Coco gelato ever) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=CdlqoKs7fw1gWvtZzZSLfg White & Milk Chocolate Covered Strawberries (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=qcyB1tF3R-Lf8dO3mIVzdQ Nutella Brioche (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=XEVABDOk1fHwdNozXC-Pvw   As you can tell by what I rated each item individually, I loved everything I ate at Jean. My faves were the Key Lime and the coconut gelato. The Key Lime had an incredible, flaky crust and the key lime filling was both sweet and tangy. The coconut gelato was phenomenal, as was the white chocolate dipped waffle cone it was served on. The gelato was loaded with real coconut shavings.   Prices at Jean were not as high as I thought they would have been seeing that it's in the Bellagio, which was a nice surprise. The folks who work here are all friendly and the long line to get your treats moves quickly.   If you're in Vegas and looking for some great pastries and gelato, check out Jean.  Yo, Michelle, you better get to Vegas ASAP and get their Key Lime!"}
{"text":"World's Largest Chocolate Fountain! Vegas has everything!   Can I somehow recreate this fountain in my home?  It's very doubtful but it's a nice thought. There is a certificate on their wall from the Guinness World Records.  Pretty neat.    Besides admiring the fountain and all of their delectable fancy desserts, they have a crepe station, gelato and sandwiches made to order.  I've tried several of their desserts displayed ever so lovely in their case. Each have been as good as they look! I've also had the Dulce de Leche gelato which is always a winner in my book.  Great flavor!   I've always had great service here.  When you are located in a busy hotel, the line doesn't seem to end.  When the employees still have service with a smile, it says something great about this little place.    If you happen to be in the Bellagio, definitely stop by for a treat!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pretty good. I always pass by whenever I came to Vegas. Had to try this time. It is worth to try if you've got some time and appetites"}
{"text":"Had breakfast panini, banana nut muffin and ham & cheese croissant for breakfast. They were all so good. I went back the next day to try nutella crepe. It was DELICIOUS. I left Vegas a week ago and I still couldn't stop thinking about all the pastries, cakes and muffins from here, especially the ham & cheese croissant (think about this one every morning) :p"}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Stopped in on two occassions when I stayed at the Bellagio.  Their iced coffee was amazing!  The pastries were to die for!!!  We tried the chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee & tirmitsu.  Excellently crafted.  I felt the prices were reasonable and expected them to be higher.  Definately stop in!"}
{"text":"So we got brunch here one morning, and I was pleasantly surprised! The smoked salmon crepe was delicious! And when you think Vegas hotel restaurant, you think expensive. But this wasn't...The crepe was very filling, and cost less than I expected for the amount of salmon they give."}
{"text":"I've expected better.  Service: On Saturday morning only one register was open. We stood in line for about 30 minutes to order crepes. After we finally placed an order we waited another 20 minutes to get it done. If you want something quick, just pick from the pastries that are already made, so you don't have to wait.  Food:  We had savory and sweet crepes. Nothing special. I've had much tastier before."}
{"text":"Sometimes one just needs something worth every single calorie and this is the spot!  Located inside of the Bellagio which is still one of my favorite properties this place is all about high quality ingredients that are worth every penny! Let's begin with the crepe section. Warm crepes are made in front of you and the experience really begins as that batter gets poured onto the crepe maker. Choose between savory or sweet or both if you're really feeling hungry.  Then there are all the fresh baked goods like chocolate croissants (buttery flaky and filled with rich chocolate that melts in your hand) to the cinnamon rolls or the palmiers.  The chocolate selection! From bite size pieces filled with traditional or exotic flavors to artistic pieces that you would like to display before tearing into.  The pastries! So many choices! The gelato selections! The coffee & teas! The sandwiches & salads! Everything here is delicious and worth it!   I stop here every time I have visitors in town and sometimes just because it's time to reward myself."}
{"text":"Yes it's a gorgeous place to take selfies or snap like you have so much chocolate that you made a fountain out of it.  But that's pretty much it.  I was amazed by the amount of chocolate  just flowing into pretty glass showcase fountain like structure which is a great design.   But after the photo taking: Everything else was mediocre.  The employees looked exhausted (at 9 PM but I think they close at 11 so I don't think we were interfering with their closing procedures).  Also they were not happy to be answering questions about the crepes and pastries. I felt like I was talking to a brick wall. We were planning on coming the next day but decided not to come.  We did however try the chocolate cake which did not disappoint. Their chocolate is very decadent and a people pleaser for any mood about to occur in Vegas.  Not sure if I will go again if I am in Vegas since the service was so stand-offish and there are way too many places in Vegas in which they have amazing chocolate desserts. ~"}
{"text":"Food and  Services 3 stars the line to order is very disorganize and the people that work there should be more friendly and when you try to find a table to sit the chairs  are everywhere and the tables are not clean.  The crêpes are good, the tiramisu mouse is ok I had try better ones and the coffee is ok."}
{"text":"Oh how, I missed this place!!  Never fails, they have the most amazing eye-catching patisseries.  It's definitely our to-go place when we come to Vegas.   They offer breakfast sandwiches, salads, amazing French patisseries, espresso's of all sorts, gelato, and made to order crepes (sweet and savory).  You definitely can't go wrong here.   Prices are a bit more than your average cafe but the quality and presentation is worth it.   Now that Halloween is fast approaching, they have many Spooktacular cakes and a 150 pound chocolate zombie greeting you as you enter the sweet boutique.  Can't get any better than that!!   Downfall is always the service.  It's a hit or miss.  If you come during the morning or during an event the lines may be long."}
{"text":"There crepes are superb and do you see the pricey box of \"Jean Philippe\" chocolates on the back wall?, YES! You must buy a box of these wonderful treats!  Once you taste them you will never look at a Hershey bar in the same way again. Yes the lines can be a little over welling, and a tad pricey, but its worth your time and money, your taste buds will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"A piece of heaven!  I am so delighted to have found Jean Philip as my deafult dessert place in Vegas. Besides its eyeing popping decor (chocolate fountain and sculpture) in both locations, it has one of the largest dessert selections I have seen (pastries/gelato/chocolates).  I checked out both locations (Aria and Bellagio) and I tried the gelato on the first day and the cake on the second day. I had the Imperial cake and it was very intense chocolate but not too sweet. The prices are very reasonable as well, from $7 for a piece of cake to $5-6 for gelato.   This place is a must visit for any dessert lovers!"}
{"text":"Bought a nice cake for my wife -no way to cut it! I ask the manager to please cut for us.. She tells me she has no cutlery ! Two thumbs way down"}
{"text":"Yummy food and delicious desserts. The only bad thing about this place is the long line, long wait for the food, and some workers didn't seem too friendly and patient. Well I guess it's hard to deal with customers non stop during the day but hey it's your job. Anyway, my friends and I ordered three different sandwiches and they were all delicious. The salmon was fresh and tasted good. The chicken pesto was good as well. The only thing is that if you bring some of the sandwiches up to the room they tend to get cold and the bread gets a little hard. We also had the ham and cheese croissant; it wasn't very pretty but it was my favorite one. We got a side of fruit it was alright. A lemon raspberry muffin for dessert was nice and moist. It's hard to resist ordering everything on the menu when you're standing in line and passing all of the delicious desserts. It can get a bit pricey as well. For the three sandwiches, three coffee, one side of fruit, two juices, and a muffin was about $80. But I guess what do we expect when we order like little pigs. Oink."}
{"text":"there are few places where you just want to try EVERY SINGLE ITEM and Jean Philippe is that kind of store.  every item is carefully made with extreme professionalism. I've had a palmier, almond croissant, gelato and chocolate covered strawberry and can't think of a flaw in any of these items.  lines can be a bit long and prices aren't what you are used to for pastries but it's a must-stop visit while in Vegas.  Their chocolate fountain is cool (tallest fountain in the world) but not worth wasting time staring at it.  Just eat everything in the store and leave."}
{"text":"Once you accept fact that the lattes here are almost double the $ that you pay at the 'bucks, drown your sorrows in the deliciousness that is the most perfect croissant. The Nutella brioche isn't too bad, either..."}
{"text":"F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S Nutella brioche!  I've been to Jean Philippe each time I've visited Vegas, and intend on making my way through the pastry menu. Thank goodness Las Vegas resorts have amazing workout facilities... the treadmill beckons after a trip to Jean Philippe Patisserie!"}
{"text":"Every time I pass by Jean Philippe Patisserie on my way to my room at the Bellagio, I cannot help but to stop and stare at the pretty pastries, as well as the world's largest chocolate fountain!  Yes, this chocolate fountain contains 500 feet of stainless steel piping with dark, milk, and white chocolate floating through 27 feet of engineering. The kids and adults alike are attracted to it. I was attracted to it for sure.   My hubby and I picked up our daily coffee drip and chai latte here during our stay and not only was it convenient, but we also enjoyed their pastries and desserts.   They have good gelato and macarons and I can eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I purchased one dessert that caught my eye. It was the carrot cupcake filled with moist carrot cake, creamy vanilla and coconut mousse, and topped with a chocolate malt ball and stamped with a chocolate square of approval. It's approved by my eyes and my mouth.   My favorite breakfast here is the ham and cheese sandwich. The ham is thick and the cheese is pretty much bechamel sauce. The bread itself is crisp and cheesy. I've also had the blueberry brioche which was nice and buttery. The chocolate and almond croissant was flaky and had a rich almond paste in the center. They have good pastries.   There's plenty of seating surrounding the bakery in the lobby. It's nice that they are not located near the casino so it's more quiet in the mornings. It makes mornings nice as we can grab food and have a beautiful view of their pool and outdoor space through the windows."}
{"text":"Okay so I have seen Jean Philippe on TV with Anthony Bourdain had to check this place out. It is beautiful inside, so many colors and textures of tarts, pastries, gelato, chocolate sculptures, crepes, crisp salads. We purchased some pastries, we had the chocolate croissant it was fabulous, brioche was dry wasn't crazy about that.....and then came the best STICKY BUN! oh my goodness best damm sticky bun I have ever had. I would walk again another 10 miles in my stilettos for a Jean Philippe sticky absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't indulge in the rich chocolaty goodness that this patisserie has to offer - please, just go and take a peek.  From the beautiful chocolate fountain that just makes you want to stick your head in and drink, to the amazing art work of cakes they have displayed in the cases surrounding the back of the place... you have to see it to believe it.   It would be a sin for any chocolate lover to miss this place."}
{"text":"Gelato, just get the gelato.  Pistachio and Oreo cookie.  The other desserts look wonderful too.  Be sure to bring your camera for the chocolate art that surrounds you.  They have sandwiches and salads for those who want a quick meal at their little cafe, or if you want it to go."}
{"text":"Love the raspberry rose macaron ice cream!!! Everything they serve is amazing. Always a breakfast and dessert stop when staying at the Aria."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountains and waterfalls totally draw you into this place and makes you crave anything and everything they have!  I got a chocolate mousse cake and it was very rich and chocolatey but good.  The wedding cakes they had on display were also very beautiful and the other cakes as well."}
{"text":"Me and the wife absolutely loved this place. The one in Aria is open late and offers the whole gamut of cakes, gelato and chocolate stuff. We had the chocolate souffle crepe and gelato and it was very, very good!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is a great place to pick up a sweet treat before sitting poolside at the Bellagio or after a nice stroll through the conservatory. The crepes and croissants are top notch, the orange juice is fresh squeezed, and their iced chai latte is oh so good.   One pitfall to having such great food, is that everyone will want to try it so there's almost always a long line. Then again, this'll give you a chance to take a look at the world's largest chocolate fountain and ohhh & aahhh at the exquisite cakes they have on display.   In comparison to other bakeries found in Vegas hotels, the prices are roughly the same but they're a a bit pricier than Starbucks and rightfully so because their food and drinks are way way waaay yummier (expect to pay roughly $10 for an almond croissant and a chai latte).   Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Beautiful desserts that taste great. A little bit expensive but it's Vegas"}
{"text":"Their ice cream and pastries look so incredible in the window that you can't help but get something when you pass by! I was too enticed by the pretty displays.   Unfortunately, the pastries are quite expensive. $7 is the price for most of their super tiny pastries! I ordered a chocolate croissant which was pretty delicious. I loved that the crust was super flaky!"}
{"text":"In the mood for Gelato after strolling the shoppes at Bellagio?  Swing by this patisserie for a flavorful cold treat for the taste buds and a treat for the eyes. There is a floor to ceiling chocolate fountain and displays of intricate wedding cakes and whimsical special occasion cakes.  We sat for awhile, consuming tiny  spoonfuls of our pistachio,  coconut, and triple berry Gelato scoops and watched videos of how J-P artists  engineer their chocolate creations. There are sandwiches and salads, pastries, and other concoctions, too, in case you prefer a meal before dessert!"}
{"text":"Ahh, the first review!!  Surprisingly, for such a busy little nook inside of the Bellagio hotel!  There is a giant chocolate fountain trickling from ceiling to floor, a beautiful greeting to all guests.  We visited this quaint pastry shop each morning during our Vegas trip for breakfast.  The coffee was delicious and the muffins and pastries were baked fresh each morning; how can you go wrong?!?  Everything looked so good, I wanted to try one of each!  I tasted the plain croissant; flaky, soft and melted in your mouth!  I ate an entire banana nut muffin too; need I say more?!?"}
{"text":"The thing about having more than one location of something on the Vegas strip is that you don't know which location your review is going to.  As it states above the address to this venue, my review will be for the Patisserie in the ARIA.  This location of Jean Philippe offers pretty much everything the larger location at Bellagio offers but in a smaller area. They have the crepes and truffles on one side and the cafe/cakes on the other side.  I don't usually purchase from this location but I was in the mood for chocolates so I bought two to snack on while I gambled. I also got a Strawberry Lemon cupcake for dine in and it was DIVINE!  Definitely a cute place to stop at if you want a sandwich, crepe, or pastry to snack on between gambling ;)"}
{"text":"I had the truffle crepe and carrot cake desserts. They were phenomenal!! The store/shop is tiny but a great grab and go treat! A must try!"}
{"text":"This Aria branch of JP is much better than the Bellagio's cramped version.  Crepes and gelato in one station, pastries in another, and coffee drinks in another.  All stations have their own cashiers and staff, so service is quick and efficient.  We got the exotic crepes again and were delighted.  Coconut ice cream with the texture and sweetness of shredded coconut and mango compote covering a beautifully made crepe.  Even the aroma was amazing.  We washed it down with a soy latte that was surprisingly warm, smooth, and slightly sweet.  No need to add sugar - maybe it's vanilla soy or something special with how they made it."}
{"text":"The Exotic crepe is pretty good - crepe with mango and pineapple compote and a side of coconut ice cream to balance sweet and tart.  The berry crepe was less successful since it had more sauce than fruit for our liking.  This made a good crepe into a mediocre crepe that was soggy.  The coffee is pretty decent - the perfect roast has a smoky flavor to help balance the dessert.  We made the mistake and also got a caramel twist without the whipped cream - it was bland.  Note there can be long wait times for crepes - 30 min after ordering is possible since each is made fresh.  I would give more stars if more fresh fruit was used.   You can also get a pretty darn good crepe over at Paris near their buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"Very solid place for desserts and of course chocolate goodies by Jean Philippe. It looks like a snack bar but with a lot of chocolate, gelato, crepes and sandwiches.  There's two area one is for food and the other is for crepes and gelato. I know this is a top of the line name but 13 bucks for a crepe and a scoop of sorbet is a little much. I did enjoy my experience here everything is really nice and colorful. I just wish  I had more time to spend here. I probably should've bought some for family and friends."}
{"text":"Had an intense chocolate dessert and I was in chocolate heaven!!!!! Hubby had a muffin and it was equally impressive! Presentation of dessert was what drew us in!!!!!"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place, bad customer services.  They need to retrain their cashiers."}
{"text":"We ate from the Bellagio Store. We stayed at the Vdara hotel and picked up snacks and breakfast items. The Nuetella brioche is perfect for the fans that eat it from the jar by the heaping tablespoon. I enjoyed the apple strudel warmed for breakfast.   The red velvet cupcake got better and better as I dove layer by layer. It is very rich!"}
{"text":"Of course I had to make a gluttonous stop in the city of sin ;)   Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect spot for a cup of Joe & an almond croissant.  The only downside is that this place is super tiny with barely any seats! They also don't have any bold coffee, medium roast is as strong as they have so you may need to add a shot of espresso like the bf did.   Everyone gawks at the chocolate fountain drip as they walk in but my eyes fell in love with the gorgeous cakes on display! There are some very intricate cakes spinning in the cases along with the ready to purchase mini cakes. If I was about to get onto a flight, I would've brought one of each home!!!   We both shared an almond croissant and dulce de leche brioche. Wow, the almond croissant was a clear winner.. Crispy on the outside and perfectly balanced almond paste on the inside! The dulce de leche brioche was good too but really sweet with the gooey caramel oozing inside. ;)   We discovered another location in Aria so definitely check at least one of them out!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food. Egg and cheese sandwich was a hard boiled egg with nacho fake cheese. I'd rather go to Starbucks, which are everywhere in Aria."}
{"text":"A really good choice to get breakfast if you stay at the Bellagio. Staff is friendly and the food is quite good. I had the Italian Crepê and I was very pleased with my choice - what stood out was the prosciutto and pesto."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dessert spot on the strip. A bit over the top for decor and price, but this is Sin City.  I don't consider myself to be a big cake fan, but Jean Philippe packs each slice with so much flavor. Crepes, baked goods and gelato are my go-tos.  Drop by and be awed by the beautifully-presented treats!"}
{"text":"Excellent cafe offering lots of breakfast choices in this area. I've had breakfast here every day for a week because everything else around is quite bad. The coffee, smoothies, omelettes and croissants are awesome."}
{"text":"I love the soufflé crepe with nutella and fresh strawberries. The cons: expensive and far :("}
{"text":"This place is dessert heaven!! Seriously dangerous for people trying to watch their diet, like me! Everytime my bf and I stay at Aria, I always have to stop by here several times. Sometimes we grab lunch here, they offer pretty good sandwiches and pasta. I tried their tandoori chicken sandwich and lobster pasta. Pretty good!   And of course for sweets, plenty of desserts to choose from. They also have a section specifically for crepes too. I ordered their berry crepe once and omg... Devoured that thing in less than a min. So delicious!   It's always usually very crowded. Never really open seating. It's defInitely very  convenient esp if you're staying at Aria hotel. I'm addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts! Wish I had time to try more of their food. I tried the snickers cake, the intense, and the sweet trip. All were great. The snickers cake was my favorite. A little expensive, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"Fresh crepes made on the spot with a variety of toppings to choose from.   They have counter space with high chairs to eat. There are a few tables nearby on the outside as well. Went here after dinner and got the banana foster crepe. They sell fresh squeezed orange juices and other deli items. They're all very friendly here."}
{"text":"This place is open all hours of the night, which is really convenient - especially if it's late and you're looking for some higher quality food (i.e. not fast food). Service was quick and easy. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and one of their eclaires. Both were good. They have a large dessert menu, so I would go back and try some of these!"}
{"text":"I saw this place for the first time @ Aria and woo! Did I think I was in Paris. Everything looked so good I didn't even want to touch my dessert! I am a sucker for pastries and desserts and I have purchased quite a few fruit tarts in my day. So the price for my dessert here was worth it. I don't think it was expensive at all. It was quality and I don't mind that. I also tried one of their sandwiches and it's as pricey as airport food and tastes like quality restaurant food! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Gelatos are as good as the ones you find in Italy, I ordered the mango, though is tasted more like passion fruit and coconut. The deserts were delicious as well. Considering the number of people who frequent the location the staff seemed tired and not too friendly."}
{"text":"If you're a sweet tooth, Jean Philippe will surely have something for you. From gelato to crepes (both sweet and savory!), dessert pastries and chocolates, JP's got it all... plus breakfast and lunch dishes and coffee. You can even preorder a lunchbox to take on your trip home!  My favorite gelato flavor so far has been the butter pecan- it's indulgent without being too sweet. The Nutella Mille/Napoleon is pretty awesome too- but you really need someone to share it with. I haven't managed to try a crepe yet, but I hear they're the bomb.  Service is quick, there are plenty of tables to eat, and enough selection here to try something different every time you stop by."}
{"text":"Lovely little bakery hidden inside the Bellagio. I love taking my out of town friends to this place while we're on the strip. Glad to see that there is now a second one opened but I still like coming to the one inside Bellagio as that's the one I always go to. I've had their crepes, cakes, breads, and gelato so far. I've been eyeing that pretty macaron during my last few visits. That's next on my to eat list."}
{"text":"Best pastries in Las Vegas and our favorite patisserie in the USA.  In addition to pastries, the smoked salmon sandwich is excellent."}
{"text":"Sliced tomato chicken panini: grilled chicken, spiced tomato spread, Swiss cheese, tomatoes onions. $11.95. No words. So happy whiles was eating this. Delicious paired with my caramel latte. The bread is SO good. Warmed. Crunchy but not too hard.   Strawberry tart: almond biscuit, vanilla pastry cream, fresh strawberries. $7 So beautiful. Ate it with my eyes first, and my mouth found it just as wonderful.  Banana nut muffin $4.25. Excellent. Moist.   Small caramel latte $6.25. SO GOOD! Perfect level of sweet. But damn, expensive. Extra dollar for the caramel syrup.  Overpriced, but how often are you in Vegas? The food is art - presentation and taste. I bought a tea cake as a gift for my mother and ended up dropping a total of ~$50 at a patisserie."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  I had: - blueberry brioche ($3.95): oh-so-good... like a blueberry muffin but better - basil aioli chicken panini ($10.50): DROOLworthy. It was so delicious... has grilled onions and fontina cheese.  The bread was so crusty and crunchy.  MMMM. - gelato ($6.75 if you get a waffle cone): pricey, but super creamy & tasty. for the same price, you can choose to have 1 or 2 flavors. - hot chocolate (~$4): mediocre.  They also possess the Guinness world record for largest chocolate  fountain.  Check it out- it is truly enormous.  The only reason it's 4 stars and not 5: the price of the panini and gelato -- it wasn't even huge or anything... but it's in the Bellagio, so I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food and desserts are great...but I just needed some water. I was totally dehydrated. I think it's a bit much to charge $5.41 for water."}
{"text":"I'm always in for dessert. I have a huge sweet tooth and it needs to be satisfied constantly. So obviously the giant elaborate cakes drew me in like a dog to its vomit. The desserts here are great. I have to start there. They are fancier. If you are looking for classic desert, old fashioned, homemade cupcakes and cookies, this is not the place for you.   The cupcakes are FANTASTIC. they have these wonderful little layers of icing, a mousse and then super, moist cake. I tried the chocolate, red velvet and the raspberry lemon curd. So scrumptious.  I will definitely be returning for more desserts and be adding to this review."}
{"text":"Since we were staying at the Bellagio this became our go to place for breakfast, snacks and desserts. Each time I was more disappointed than the first. The only redeeming quality was their ginormous croissants and pastries. We had everything from the gelato to their crepes and even their pastry selection. (We were there for a week, I ate here a lot lol). Their crepe was horrible - I had the banana foster, and it was this gelatinous banana goo on top of a plain crepe. The gelato wasn't creamy and their chocolates were just bland. The lines were very long, the workers just seemed pissed off and it was very expensive. If I wasn't so lazy I would of walked over to the other gelato stand on the other side.  Just like everyone else, we were all blinded by the beautiful chocolate fountain and Multi colored marshmallow train lol."}
{"text":"eh. .. :/  + :  crepes, nicely made and filling. .. nice packaging for to-go stuff. .. super cool that one could watch one's crepe as it is being made. ..  -- :  disappointing, esp. for being a Patisserie. .. macarons were just sugary sweet - too sweet in fact - best one was the chocolate. .. the macarons were so bad, i felt sO JiPPed. ..  i'd do the crepes again but would think twice about the pre-packaged stuff. ..   ** *  for Macarons, i suggest Bouchon Bakery in the Venetian. .. :)  * **"}
{"text":"After Yellowtail, my date and I decided to head to Jean Philippe's to get a couple of pastries.  Drinks and dessert...a way to my heart.  In Bellagio, you can't miss it.  Store front has a fountain fall of chcolate in the front.  The lines are insane in the morning, so don't go then, but when we went, it was perfect.  No lines, but the selection was definitely minimal.  Definitely a great place to grab a dessert or warm drink.  Just expect to pay a little more than your Safeway types of cake."}
{"text":"If there was one of these close to my house, I would gain 40 lbs in a month.  Their almond croissants are to die for.  The dulce leche brioche is amazing also.  I don't ever come to vegas without stopping here at least once.  Considering the ridiculous prices you pay at movie theaters and amusement parks for food, these prices are a steal for the quality!!"}
{"text":"The Gelato is pretty much on point here. For basically $3 a giant scoop it's worth it. I ain't sayin' you should get this every day, but when you here and after a meal, and you got a sweet tooth....get the Hazelnut, Oreo, Tiramisu, and Creme brûlée mix. It's worth it."}
{"text":"As many others have stated, the layout is absolutely chaotic.  Nothing is labeled well and good luck finding the right cashier for what you want.  I bought the house dark chocolate.  $8 for a bar of chocolate.  Not a big bar, just a standard, Hershey's size bar.  It was horrible.  I have tried nearly 100 different brands and styles of chocolates that are 72%+ cocoa and this was one of the worst.    You might as well save your money and go to Whole Foods and buy two bars for the same amount of money."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I easily spend over $200 here every time I come to Vegas. I can't keep myself out of this place and buy a little here and there every single day.  Doesn't help that I see this place before going up to my room at Aria.  Berry crepe - marinated berries over their sweet crepe and served with whipped cream. The raspberries are added on fresh though. Berries are lightly sweet and tart. I don't like cooked strawberries so I will order it with fresh berries next time. As always, the crepe texture is perfect, slightly chewy, flavorful, and thin.  Smoke salmon sandwich - after reading on Yelp this is THE sandwich to get, I tried it and it lived up to its reputation. This is a cold sandwich (why wouldn't it be with the cold smoked salmon?). The bread is a dill infused bread; inside is a sliced boiled egg, smoked salmon of course, dill spread, red onions which I believe are marinated in some kind of vinegar mix. It's soooo good, the bread is so fresh, but beware and have gum or something after eating it - it's loaded with onions in a good way.  Chocolate nougat - my favorite candy from this place. I prefer it over their vanilla nougat as the texture of more chewy. He never skimps on the nuts. Surprisingly, it is not too sweet considering nougat is really just pure sugar.  Pistachio nougat - these are individually wrapped and has pistachio paste to bump up the pistachio flavor. They tasted really good, but I prefer the texture of their chocolate nougat.  Marshmallows - they taste like those valentine heart candies from back in elementary. I'm guessing the alcohol in the vanilla extract lent a hand in this. I liked the raspberry flavor best. They are rolled in powdered sugar which creates a little crust all around. It's softer than commercial marshmallows and moist. Nice to try, but won't buy it again.  I noticed this time they offer omelettes now, cooked on the crepe machine, but I didn't try it.  If there is one sweet thing you try from here, get a crepe. Savory - go for the smoked salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"HEAVENLY pastries!!!  Worth every penny!  My friends and I split a tuna melt, pecan croscant and a cheese cake.  All three were A+ amazing! Looking at the cakes and desserts was an experience too.  I plan to visit Jean Philipee's every time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very pretty too:) look forward to their salmon sandwich every time I go to Vegas:)"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!!  We got there and even tho very small the pastries are awesome. Everyone is cool."}
{"text":"Was misled to think that the soufflé was an actual soufflé when in fact it was a crepe sprinkled with soufflé bits on top. The crepe was prepared well and was spongey. It was a chocolate overload and really sweet."}
{"text":"When I'm craving something sweet and fancy this is the spot! Highly recommend the plain cheese cake and rose macaroon. The cheese cake I would have to say is one of the best cheese cakes that I have ever had, hands down for shure! The rose macaroon is simple but elegantly light and florally balanced with raspberries. They also have a chocolate case from bonbons to pralines to chocolate covered strawberries for those chocolate LOVERS. Yes the prices are a bit high but hey your in Vegas expect to pay a little more...."}
{"text":"This bakery shop has more selection than Payard and Bouchon and is a good place for a substantial after-dinner dessert. They serve delicious smelling crepes, have at least two dozen gelato flavors, and a medley of elegant desserts. I had the fruit tart (sugar free!), which was on par with the ones you get at Whole Foods.  I wish I got the gelato because they give you a very generous 2 scoops for $5 (best deal of all the gelato places I checked out in Vegas). The mint chip and peanut  brittle were delicious. Another plus: a large seating area."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?  Because you have to pick which things you want to see in Vegas and if you're in the area, this is worth it.  You will (A) See the world's largest chocolate fountain (B) See a huge selection of beautiful hand crafted desserts that are actually reasonably priced for the Bellagio (many around $7) (C) Grab a bite if you're looking for ice cream, coffee, or a variety of crepes that looked unique and delicious  Walk through the Bellagio on the left side to find it...just pass the big art garden thing."}
{"text":"JP does not disappoint for breakfast, lunch, and a late night snack!  Since we stayed at the Aria, we would walk by here every time we would go and leave our room. I probably stopped by here each time to grab a bite to eat. They have a lot to choose from here; crepes, sandwiches, paninis, pastries, gelato, coffee, salads, and so much more. This place is a bit expensive, but being in a 5 star hotel, I can't complain too much.   I got the Italian crepe, which had prosciutto and mozzarella in it. It was sooo good. On another occasion, I had the prosciutto panini which was also good. They put a little bit too much oil and vinegar on it, so while I was eating it, I had to be sure to eat over a plate so that the oil wouldn't drip onto my clothing. I did try the opera one night which was very rich. I was a big fan of the vanilla eclair! I think I ordered it twice if I recall.  This might be more credit to the hotel security/staff, but one person in my group left their designer jacket here when we left late at night. Didn't realize it was lost until the next morning. Pretty sure the jacket was long gone, but I called down to security to ask them about it. Long story short, someone had reported the jacket as missing and handed it to the lost and found. The jacket was returned to us immediately and all was good in the world once again!  Tip: If you have a breakfast crave, head to JP instead of waiting on that ridiculously long and slow line at Starbucks on the promenade level."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few days ago. Had to go back two days later!  It was delicious!  The breakfast sandwich was super good.  I'm not sure if this was my favorite sandwich or if it was the prosciutto panini. Both were incredible. The salmon panini was also top-notch.  Had a cheese Danish there last time too and it may have been the best I've had anywhere.  Everything looks so good and I'm looking forward to trying more from here."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is absolutely superb. The food is of the highest quality and the flavors are complex, varied, and most importantly delicious.  I've only ever had desserts at Jean Philippe but I would have to say that's what you should be getting when you go there. I've tried some of their chocolates which are very good, and a friend once had their creme brulee which he said was top notch as well and cooked well.  But my favorite thing at Jean Philippe has to be their gelatos/ice creams. They are some of the absolute best ice creams I've ever had as they are just so full of flavor that lingers just long enough in your mouth for you to truly savor the wonder. My friends and I agreed that their cookies and creme was one of the best ice creams we've had in our lives. I'm also a very big fan of their dulce de leche  I should point out that the Jean Philippe at Aria and the one at Bellagio do have slightly different options and some of their flavors presumably rotate.  Can't recommend Jean Philippe highly enough"}
{"text":"Went there after watching the \"O\". Had a palmiers and some short bread cookies....  Very good but too crownded for me. I wish I was hungry for desert.... will go back just to buy some deserts and take it to go....:)"}
{"text":"Best spot in Vegas to grab dessert, coffee, and crepes. Amazing chocolate fountain and wonderful friendly employees. I must say their gelato's are the best! They also have another location at the Aria!"}
{"text":"Every time my friends and I come to Vegas we have to make sure to stop by Jean Philippe Patisserie! This store is beautiful. Came by with friends ordered a Basil Chicken Panini and a Rose Macaron! Excellent taste and awesome employees who were very friendly and gave us great service! I can't wait to stop by on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best macarons I've ever had! Now I'm back home in Texas trying to figure out how to get these shipped to my house. Sadly, the online store doesn't sell them. I came home from my trip with three, and I should have bought more. They are light, airy, and extremely flavorful!"}
{"text":"First, it's hard to find this place. The address in Yelp states it's in Aria Casino and Resort, but do you know how big this resort is? Which floor is it even on?  So we ended up going round and round until this nice lady told us to go to casino level, by elevator for floor 16-24 entrance, then take a right.  Prepare to queue if you come in the morning because this place seems popular. The selection of pastries is modest at most, but they do look interesting. I had the pecan cinnamon roll, which is a tad too sweet, and the croissant, which is very light and flaky. The pastries are about 4 dollars a piece, which is alright considering the elegance of the place. Cafe Latte is small than i expected, despite ordering large, and at 6.25, seems a bit expensive.  Overall, respectable pastries albeit limited slightly expensive and crowded place to go to. They do serve crepes as well but you probably have to hunt for a plane to sit first.   3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Super yummy desserts but soooo rich! I wish I'd ordered milk lol"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a dessert, especially crepes or Nutella Donuts..look no further! This is the spot for both! Delicious! Just..whoa! Mind you guys, I got this right after lunch, maybe around 1pm when they still had stock of most desserts. Yes, they do sell out daily! I would know because the next day when I came much later in the evening there was practically nothing left! I wanted to take some Nutella Donuts home and it was impossible since they ran out. Please look at the picture of the crepe I took :D It was so wonderful!! I ate the donut too fast and forgot to take a picture :D But I've seriously tried donuts everywhere, yes, even NY, and this Nutella Donut is the best I've ever had!! I loved every part!!!"}
{"text":"This really is top notch, pure quality stuff, but I just can't stand how they have the lines set up around the counters... the place is always packed, but it gets a little hard to make your purchases. Other than the layout, this place has some pretty out of this world chocolates and desserts."}
{"text":"Late night sweet tooth craving satisfied! I joined my friend for dessert here and we both were blown away by their huge selection of desserts. We got a banana nutella crepe, and this was plenty to share between the two of us! I ordered cappuccino as well. This is definitely a place to check out if you want fine French baked treats. I will have to go again and try something new!"}
{"text":"Expensive but delicious. I'd recommend going for a flavor that you can't get anywhere else. I had the Raspberry Rose Macaron which was amazing. The texture was silky, creamy, rich, exactly how gelato should be. Not too sweet, not too fruity, not too flowery -- It was a delightful balance of flavors that I probably will now need to end every meal and night with. The bits of macaron swirled into the gelato made a surprise in every bite. Ugh. Just so good."}
{"text":"The presentation of the pastries is gorgeous, but as a French top pastry chef, I expect delicious French pastries. I have tried a few pastry items and none that wowed me, and they are too sweet to be French pastry.  I had a cappuccino and it was okay.   The corn soup was delicious, however it was a tad salty. I added some milk to it decrease the saltiness and the soup was better. The croutons came with the soup were light and crispy, perfect with the soup."}
{"text":"Before trying this place I was convinced crepes were overrated. My husband and I redeemed a free crepe thanks to myVEGAS so we thought we'd give it a try. We couldn't decide between the sweet or savory crepe so we decided to get one of each. We ordered the Bananas Foster Crepe and the Royal Crepe, both were very delicious. My husband also ordered a scoop of cappuccino gelato and I was in love. I definitely have a new view on crepes and can't wait to come back here.!"}
{"text":"Excellent perfectly brewed lattes without the insane lines."}
{"text":"This place is filled to the brim with the lustful eyes of women preying on their next dessert.  I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but this place, just has this delightful quality that makes you want to swallow pounds of sugar!    I love that they have workers with adorable French accents.    It's been almost a week since my visit and I'm still thinking about the decadent truffles."}
{"text":"Gelato is much too sweet. Also the hazelnut has pieces of nuts in it... that's the first time I've had it like that; and its much better without the nuts imo.   Overpriced"}
{"text":"Pricey but well worth it.  They have the most amazing mint chip gelatto ice cream.  There pastries and sandwhiches are made fresh and the only thing why I rated it a 4 was cause you have to wait a while to get your order. Good for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Located inside the Bellagio, this patisserie has really amazing tiramisu! Yes, I came here with one of my colleagues while we were out here for a conference. We wanted to check out the chocolate fountain, but it was temporarily out of order. However, we still got our dessert on. Many thanks to the friendly Bellagio staff who directed us here!"}
{"text":"It is with great regret that I issue 2 stars for this place.    I am tempted to place blame on myself for having an exceptionally dedicated taste for pastries but NO that is not the case.  As a prattle-some preamble [which qualities constitutes a preamble otherwise??] I must add that I went in with high expectations..... disappointment met me and geeze don't I wish it had let the door smack me on the ass on the way out, at least there would of been some pleasure derived from this two fold jaunt.    2 stars do not necessarily translate into a full on condemnation.  It was worth staggering tipsy through an Alice in Wonderland like lobby to find a standard eh eh pastry shop.  Presentation was fair but if you've been to Paris or some other magical  pastry shop in Western Europe then you will understand the quasi 'Americanized' little pastry shop they got going here.    At least for now I can say this one is checked of zList and iList.  Had a Napoleon, smoothie and a box of chocolates to go.    Standard pastry shop prices aka get over it .... pastry princes and princesses understand the quaint sacrifices in this realm."}
{"text":"Very tasty almond, chocolate, and almond chocolate croissants.  It's open late, like everything in Vegas.  Sometimes you need that sweet dessert to end your night.  It was not as expensive as I thought it was either.  Only $4.50 per croissant."}
{"text":"WOW that is all I can say. haha  not only is this place visually amazing, it makes your mouth happy too :D the chocolate fountain is like straight out of every kids dream. After walking past this always busy cafe, me and my family HAD to stop in and get some food. yes, food, not just desserts! We got a sashimi salad, yes we got a sashimi salad at a pastry cafe and it DID NOT dissappoint. just enough sashimi and it was freshh. I got a portabella panini which was so good .  and of course, we got a dessert too. I believe it was a chocolate mouse torte. it was small, but in that small cake, it packed a huge chocolate punch and boy did it hit the spot :D I will definately return here when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The desserts are really good. A tad too much sugar but good. We shared a triple chocolate round dessert. Really enough for 2.  The outside is this gooey chocolate layer and choc mousse inside with a vanilla center. It is costly for $8.  I wanted a dark choc bar but they were sold out. They need to keep it stocked. For a bar of Godiva or other high end chocolates a bar would be $6. They charge $8-$9 for theirs.  Pay the price for shopping on the strip."}
{"text":"I'll be the dissenter who does not sing praises of Jean Philippe.  First of all, croissants should not taste like they have been soaking in butter for the past 24 hours. They are supposed to be fresh and flaky, not stale and greasy... at 9am in the morning. Were they leftovers from yesterday? I think so, because all 3 of us felt uncomfortable and bloated after eating only a couple of bites. In case you are wondering, it is not a good feeling. There may be some people who like feeling bloated, but I am not one of those. You are an abomination to all my French friends. They wouldn't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.  Secondly, what kind of an idiot designed your store? You know all the tourists are going to swarm your place like cokeheads at a drag queen bingo event. Why would you design it in a way that does not make sense and backs up traffic into the lobby? Do I really want to knock the diva-acting bitch from Europe who is acting like she deserves to cut in front of the line? Don't make me a cut a bitch.  Yes, your cakes are visually appealing. Maybe I would be impressed if I am getting married at the Bellagio and ordered a wedding cake from you. But, I am not tacky enough to do that. I also hope your cakes do not taste like your croissants.  And, what's up with the coffee? Is burnt coffee the latest trend? Did I miss the memo? You know, I am not always up to date on the latest food/ drink trends. Hold on, I am getting a call (channeling Dave Letterman)... wait a minute, I am being told that burnt coffee is not the current trend. I've been cheated.  The only redeeming grace was the nutella brioche. It was very very good. Hence, the 2 stars.  Lesson learnt: just because something has a fancy French name does not mean it is good. Now you know. Aaaaand, you are welcome!"}
{"text":"Tried many things at this Patisserie when I was staying at the Aria hotel in Vegas recently.  The coffee, tea, and orange juice are good, as is the dulce de leche gelato.  The pastries are very rich and filling.  The tiramisu is not the best but it is good.  The cheese danish is big and tasty.  As for the salads, the Asian salad is good (comes with shrimp, not chicken and it is prepackaged).  The wrap sandwiches are pretty good as well.  The only thing is the line can get crowded with people merely wanting to take pictures of the pastries.  The prices are on the high end definitely, but for Vegas that is to be expected.  I would definitely come back here again next time I'm at the Aria hotel and I want to try the crepes."}
{"text":"The display of everything was soo amazing. The chocolate fountain i posted on instagram got lots of likes :) haha  The gelato was what i was able to taste and it was delicious. They also had cute little pastries and desserts that were presented beautifully. Definitely would come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've been here all morning- amazing crepes. Great coffee too!! Loves all the displays. Had half the meals there for our three day stay- amazing!!"}
{"text":"Flash back to Paris!!!  I'm a sucker for fresh savory crepes and crispy buttery croissants.  We were in Vegas for 3 days and we ate both breakfast and dessert here every day!  Service is a little slow in the mornings when everyone is trying to get in and out quickly.  So you need to leave 20 mins approx if you are going in the mornings.  I tried 6 different things here and all were DELISH! 1.  Plain Croissant:  Buttery. Flaky. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Paris worthy and huge! 2. Ham and Cheese Croissant:  Rich!  They used 2 kinds of cheese I think and it made it hard to eat the whole things without feeling a little sick.  I suggest splitting this with someone. 3. Spinach and Tomato Quiche: Large individual portion.  Heated to perfection.  Perfect amount of spinach and tomato. 4. Plain Crepe:  Hot off the grill.  Butter added.  Sweet and savory.  I ate this twice! 5. Strawberry Crepe: add strawberries and whipped cream to the plain!  We ordered this twice... be sure to ask for the strawberries on the inside.   I swear it tastes better!! haha 6. Strawberry tarte:  I have NO clue what all is in this delicious piece of heaven but it is amazing.    I really do not think there is anything you can get here and go wrong with pastry wise.  I can't wait to go back and try their sticky buns and a couple other pastries!  If you are in aria, for breakfast, lunch or dinner, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing cakes. Expensive cakes.  Quick coffee. Average Coffee.  The smoking is a bit blah.  Staff is meh, just serving you.  Sticky tables, grab-n-go."}
{"text":"This is about my favorite spot to go to in Vegas and has hands down some of the best desserts. What's even better than great desserts is the décor of this place! It's a shame it's tucked away in a corner at bellagio, but if you have the chance to hunt down this place, check out their beautiful chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"The One Where Sandy Drools Over the Chocolate Fountain.  Okay, that should not come as a surprise for people who knows me... like at all.  Anyway, I was recently in Vegas (my second home) and every morning and evening, I would walk past Jean Philippe.  Sugar junkie confession: I've tried most of his pastries and I've enjoyed every single one.  So when one of my local friends suggested breakfast here, I quickly said \"of course!\"    We shared the Banana Fosters Soufflé Crepes and the Prosciutto Pesto Sandwich.  Both were delish!  The sandwich was toasted and the baguette was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The crepes were AMAZING!  I love, love, love banana fosters and the crepes did not disappoint at all.    Now, the location with the chocolate fountain - well, that's inside the Bellagio hotel.  You can even buy the chocolate from the chocolate fountain (at least that's what the packaging says).  It's definitely a site to see if you're a chocolate junkie like me.    Oh, a must there... their cappuccino!  I did a taste test by having a cup of Jean Philippe and then a Starbucks... the Starbucks cup did not even come close.  So if you're going to spend about $5 on a cappuccino or latte and you're in the area... just spend it here and not waste it on Starbucks.  While in Rome, right?"}
{"text":"Still catching up on my long list of reviews and sorted though all the pics I've been posting on my Instagram. This place was a recommended on a trip advisor dessert list in hotels. This did not disappoint at all. If you love your sweets and desserts as I do than this is heaven for you....heaven with a chocolate fountain. I had a large cake that was actually a macaroon. I was literally overwhelmed with all the pastry. Myself and another person kept taking pictures everywhere obsessively like the tourists that we are. The mango mouse cake was nice, light and flavorful. Great service."}
{"text":"We had some time to walk around the Bellagio which is probably my all time favorite on the Strip as it is elegant and timeless.  We ran across Jean Philippe with its world largest nontraditional chocolate fountain.  If you are looking for a casual bite or to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is a nice option as they have sandwiches, paninis, crepes, baked goods and pastries like the nutella brioche."}
{"text":"Thanks to MyVegas my husband I scored a free crepe at Jean Philippe Patisserie. There are so many outstanding places to try on the strip I'm not sure when we might have got to this one if we hadn't seen it on MyVegas. This place has amazing gelato, crepes, smoothies and other items in there cafe area. The lines can get long but go fast.  After 5 minutes of trying to decide what to get we agreed on the Exotic Crepe. It was a freshly made crepe topped with mango and passion fruit and a side of coconut gelato. We watched the pastry chef pour the mix on the hot iron and form it into a perfect circle before folding it over. The mango and passion fruit were juicy, fresh, sweet and complimented the coconut gelato well. The whole thing tasted so good it was gone within minutes and left us both wanting more. Overall we had great service, beautiful presentation and a delicious crepe. I'm adding Jean Philippe Patisserie to our list of must visit places during our annual visit to Vegas!  Note: If you get the crepe to go. Don't forget it is hot so your gelato will start melting."}
{"text":"The pastries etc are really good.they look so good tho.you wonder if u should eat them or just stare at them"}
{"text":"The hubby and I always visit Bouchon Bakery when we are in Vegas so we thought we might try something different. Jean Philippe's looked like a promising alternative with their beautiful displays but alas the Croissants just weren't as amazing nor was the service. Most of the pastries here were overly sweet and oily; which was a shame since they are all so beautiful to look at."}
{"text":"I come here every time I come to Vegas.  Everything is good here - especially the crepes.  Not much to say except high quality and freaking awesome - go here if you're near the Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Terrific assortment of pastries and sweets. Had to stop in almost every evening for a second desert after dinner. Everything tasted just as good as it looked."}
{"text":"This is perhaps one of the best gelato places I have ever been to. It was everything gelato should be at an extremely reasonable price. You get two big scoops for gelato for $5 and it was extremely creamy and rich, not ice crystals at all which is in essence what gelato is. They let you try the flavors before you decide which to purchase so essentially you can never go wrong with the flavors you pick. I got the cheesecake gelato and I was pleasantly surprised that it had large chunks of cheesecake hidden in the middle. I also got the coconut gelato and it was divine. It was encrusted with chucks of real coconut so in every bite you get some creamy gelato with some chunky coconut, the perfect balance for me. I would go again and again and I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Sadly updating this review to a 3-star after my latest visit.   Asparagus quiche - was just \"ok\" Croque Monsier - also just \"ok\" and ended up being kind of soggy  Sad after having such great memories of this from my previous trip. Nothing really stood out the way it did last time. Also tried a bite of my friend's ham and cheese croissant and again nothing stood out.  They were out of the nutella brioche so that might've bumped it up to the 4-star but for now...."}
{"text":"Amazing snack place. Great breakfast options - their preparation is fantastic. Needless to say, there is always a wait considering that its a great tourist spot and they serve delicious food. Their dessert options are great too."}
{"text":"Chocolate Fountain! Chocolate Fountain!  Chocolate Fountain!  Ok, although there's more to this place than the Chocolate Fountain, the fountain really is a spectacle to behold.  The fountain is enclosed behind a glass case/barrier that stretches from floor to ceilling....yes you read that right, it's that big.  And so the liquid chocolate free-flowing goes from tray to tray and you can't help but want to just dip your finger and taste all the chocolate goodness....were it not for the glass separating you from the fountain.  And just for the record ladies and gentlemen, there is plaque of authenticity of some sort that informs onlookers that they are indeed in the presence of the world's largest chocolate fountain!  Alright enough about the chocolate fountain.  Now let's talk about one of my favorite food groups:  Dessert!  My friend and I had just come from a happy hour and were at the Bellagio to view the Conservatory Christmas display and Bellagio Fountain show.   We were craving a sweet treat, so thankfully Jean Philippe was open!  Jean Philippe offers a wide array of sweets for those with a sweet tooth:  Crepes, smoothies, gelato, and individual decorative desserts are just some of their offerings.  My friend and I didn't want anything too filling, so we both decided to each order our own individual cheesecake.  Well, for me it was either the carrot cake or cheesecake.  He chose the oreo flavor, while I chose the plain with a raspberry on the top.  I'm a huge fan of cheesecake, and thankfully Jean Philippe knows how to make a GOOD cheesecake!  The cheesecake itself was encased in what seemed like a thin solid layer of white chocolate, that only added more to the anticipation of that first bite.   And it was definitely love at first bite I would say.  Although I was slightly jealous of my friend, since his cheesecake had an oreo crust while mine just had the standard graham cracker, I would say we both enjoyed dessert because it was gone in a flash.     TIPS: 1)  There are seating areas within Jean Philippe or in the area adjacent to the Patisserie so you can sit down and enjoy your sweet treat. 2)  Make sure you know what you're ordering or at least ask the workers questions BEFORE placing an order.   Example:  These 2 ladies thought they were ordering crepes when they actually ordered smoothies.   3)  The line can get long so just make sure to bring some patience with you.  Bottom Line:   Chocolate Fountain!  Wonderful Desserts.  Chocolate Fountain!  Great Selection of sweet treats.  Chocolate Fountain!  NEXT VISIT:  I'm going to try their crepes."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Jean Philippe does not mess around. Everything is good. When you order it always feels like you are going through an amazing buffet and want to have one of everything. It's not a buffet though, so you will have to pay for each item, so be careful. This place is expensive, but it's really worth it. All of the food is high quality, fresh, and delicious.   Some of my favorite items: -The turkey croissant sandwich -The paninis (all of them) -The quiche with asparagus   Dessert -The chocolate eclair is hands down the best one I've ever had -The strawberry tart  Chocolate: -All of the chocolate is good  Nougat: -They are all good. Recently got some raspberry and pistachio   Crepe: -I have only had the sweet ones and they are great. I need to try the savory ones next time  Drinks: -Mocha and hot chocolate are awesome -Orange juice (so fresh)  You really can't go wrong with this place. If you are in Vegas, then you have to stop here."}
{"text":"I went to this place at the Aria and I got severe food poisoning. I was immobile for 24 hrs due to severe dehydration. I had the veggie crepe and 2 scoops of gelato."}
{"text":"The taste is very good. However, I only spend around 12 dollars and the staff asked me for ID. I don't think everyone should present their ID in this crowded store."}
{"text":"I've been to the locations in Bellagio and Aria. The gelato is by far the best gelato I've ever had. Coconut  gelato  is a must try and for that I give this place three thumbs up !"}
{"text":"A must on every trip to Vegas and with one in the aria, maybe we'll go more often."}
{"text":"This was a great spot for a quick and delicious breakfast. It is a little pricey but I felt it was worth it. The food was filling and you didn't feel as if you were eating fast food. They had a huge variety of foods as well, from breakfast sandwiches to muffins.  The other great thing was their desserts and candy they sold. It was beautiful and would make a wonderful gift for a loved one. The restart has a huge chocolate fountain to watch that kids would love."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious service organization.  It is the in the round and there are two registers.  It is completely confusing and there are long lines.  The sweets are very good though.  I ordered Creme Brulee, Rosewater Macaroon, and Red Velvet Cupcake.  The best of the bunch was the Macaroon.  Really beautiful flavors."}
{"text":"On the prowl for delicious pastries in Vegas we found Jean Philippe by accident in the Bellagio Hotel. Their big chocolate fountain attracted my attention - I wish I could take a bath there some day ;)  The blueberry cupcake and the chocolate pastry were more than yummy!"}
{"text":"The coconut gelato is the best I've ever had! Their decor is a piece of art all in itself. Great service, great product and very convenient location! Would recommend to anyone looking for a variety of gelato and truffles."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food of the chef doesn't necessarily live up to their reputation, but this is definitely not the case with Jean Philippe's pastries and gelato.   Last time, I enjoyed every morsel of the rich and moist opera cake. Its ganache is literally as smooth as a silk, and as chocolatey as it is in flavor, it is not overly sweet like most bakeries. If you get a chance, don't pass up the eclair either. It's the most perfect eclair I've ever tasted.  During today's visit, I was way too full to eat a cake so I opt for a straciatella gelato. The gelato was very creamy and full of vanilla beans, which you can see and taste, and embedded into the frozen treat were sheets of rich dark chocolate. Super delicious. I can't wait until my next visit...."}
{"text":"Best almond croissants known to man!  These bad boys taste amazing with ur morning coffee.  I always leave vegas with at least 4.  They serve crepes to order, chocolates and candies that are amazing as well.  Charging to room is an added plus.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place starting to show its age but a serviceable place for ice cream/sorbet for the family.  Nice photo op in front of the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon crepe on December 27th for lunch here. It would have been 5 stars given the quality of ingredients and the taste it WOULD HAVE been. However, the lady who made my crepe was failing and throwing away crepes while there were a lot of people waiting in line and she was the only one doing it. 1 star reduced for  he wait. Also she was preparing it really carelessly. She threw 2 large handful of cheese on the crepe and it ended up making me nauseous when having it. There was so much cheese spread out unevenly that some were melted on the crepe whole some still stood out hard and cold. Some ingredients were warm while some were cold because of bad preparation. I checked out the crepe preparation at the Bellagio location later on and it was done much better. Second star reduced from the bad preparation."}
{"text":"Their crepes are aways amazing.  It is reasonable to going to Bellagio or Aria hotel for taste their crepes. All the pastrys are pretty and tasty too  My favorite desserts are chocolate cake with macaron and fruit parfait!"}
{"text":"i LOVED this place for breakfast! now, I know what you're thinking... \"a cake shop? for breakfast?\" but hear me out... I had the ham and cheese croissant, which was incredibly tasty. The cheese was melty and to die for. The croissant itself was flaky and made me regret not getting it alone. The desserts at 7 am were such a tease so beware if you're hungry, hangry, or hungover because you will be tempted!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Looooong line around the circular preparation area. Very few menus scattered around circle and you can't see menu on the wall well from the line. You get to the cashier before you get to the pastries so you aren't fully educated on everything that is offered before you must order. You don't want to hold the line up so must order quickly. Then you pass the pastries and see something you wish you could have ordered. Very expensive $100 for 4 people. The pastries we got were great. Veggie crepe and chicken crepe were outstanding. Bonus points for the savory crepes being buckwheat. Coffee was delicious. The chocolate fountain and decorative cakes were fun to look at while In line. Overall, high quality food and good service. But please put the register after the pastries and have more menus available."}
{"text":"Too touristy for me-its in all the right locations and they have the beautiful chocolate fountain to draw you in but nothing I had here (chocolate or crepe) really impressed me too much. I'd have to say it's overrated!"}
{"text":"Dependable place for french desserts....nothing in the pastries or gelato really wowed me but everything was fine, although a tad bit too sweet.  Fun atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"We stopped by for an eclair. I found my eclair to be too cold to eat and the stuffing of the eclair to be not so creamy.  The place looks nice but I would try to stay away from the pastries!"}
{"text":"Went to JPP this morning for breakfast. Stood in line and ordered our food, then realized they had more baked goods (which I didn't see on the menu board) further down the line.   I had the ham/cheese croissant, which was flaky and cheesy, so very good. My wife had the spinach quiche which she found pretty bland. Had a freshly squeezed orange juice and a cappuccino as well, total ended up around $40 which is fairly steep for breakfast. I guess we pay for the convenience, being right beside the guest elevators.   Despite the cost I'll probably still stop by again before we leave to try another one of their croissants."}
{"text":"I decided that an update was appropriate because this time around, I tried EVERY SINGLE SWEETS that they had, with the exception of one. They were made extremely well and the taste and texture, as well as presentation was phenomenal.   The pastries, however, were still the same... hard, and not unlike any other pastry. Coffee was also not something to write home to mom about.  But yes, the sweets, such as the tarts, cupcakes, chocolate cakes, cheese cakes, etc. are definitely very yummy."}
{"text":"So here I was, showing my mom around the Western side of the South Strip, having just finished swimming with the sharks in Mandalay and gazing out over Las Vegas from atop The Delano's Skyfall Lounge, when mom said she was feeling like dessert! So, I searched for something unique that wasn't just a coffee stand or shaved ice parlor, and found Jean Philippe Patisserie. The confections and creams looked marvelous, the setting looked posh and very artsy-modern, and the Aria is always a good time. So off we adventured down the boulevard towards Aria, seeing the sights as we went. And upon arrival, we marveled at what might only be described as a chic cafe run by Mr Wonka himself. We perused the selection and delighted at the prospect of a Trio Chocolate Cheesecake, a French Flan, an almond brioche to go for mom, a hot chocolate for myself, and an iced latte for mom. Oh, and as I checked out, what the heck, a chocolate muffin to go for my man later (shh, he doesn't know yet ;-). We sat down a short time later with our desserts and drinks, and bon appetite! Well, sort of. Mom's coffee was good, my hot chocolate was quite decent, and the chocolate cheesecake was decadently delicious! The French Flan though? Dreadfully dry. Skip it altogether. If I were in the Aria craving a dessert, I would definitely return, but I'll think twice before I try a French Flan again anywhere after my trip to Jean Philippe Patisserie. Ciao!"}
{"text":"If I died and went to pastery heaven - I am assuming that I would end up here!!  While staying at the Aria for work, I was seduced by the beautiful look of the place, amazingly decorative cakes and treats, and the smell called to my belly.  I happily gave in and ordered a Nutella Brioche for breakfast.  It is amazing!! I have never been so amazed by deliciousness in my life for a pastery.  It was a flaky buttery croissant like outside with powdered sugar filled with a whole lotta nutella.  I got a spoon to enjoy every last delicious bite.  I was sad to see it go but so happy that it was in my belly.  I went back this morning and got another one - I may have to buy some to bring home!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the Berry crepe with the coconut gelato ice cream. Yummy! We also took home some of the desserts on display. Can't remember the names of them but the raspberry macaroon thing was delicious. Very pricey though!"}
{"text":"Very good pastries but at a steep price. I know it's Vegas but $10+ for a tiny sandwich and $7 for little pastries isn't worth it.   Got the \"intense\" which was described as a chocolate creme brûlée covered in chocolate and topped with a macaron shell. It was actually quite large and pretty good but I'm not sure why it's described as a creme brûlée when it tasted like something in between a flourless hocolate cake and chocolate ganache.   Nutella brioche was quite good. Thought I think nutella is always good by default :p"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Long ass lines and a beautiful array of decadents.   One line is for gelato and another line is for pastries, coffee, sandwiches, crepes, coffee, etc. If you get in the wrong line, you will be screwed / redirected to the right line. Service is as speedy as possible and nice.   My kids each got a scoop of gelato (rocky road and mango) and I got the Nutella pastry... the flaky layers tasted stale.. some bites were tough and some were soft. It was definitely rich but the attempt to make flaky layers failed flawlessly.   I'd give a 5 for the chocolate fountain though.  PASS."}
{"text":"If you are a chocoholic like I am then you might want to check this place out.  This chocolatier has every creation, desire and possible craving that you could have already satisfied and ready for you to purchase.  Ordering can seem a little overwhelming because there are so many choices to choose from but the staff are more than happy to help you are recommend things according to your taste.  I decided upon a chocolate cheesecake that was so beautifully designed I wasn't even sure that I wanted to eat it.  It was wrapped in a white chocolate casing that was smooth as satin and melted in my mouth like silk.  I am not a white chocolate fan but I am of Jean Philippe he has the perfect balance of white chocolate and cream so its not hurt your teeth sweet.  On the top was the perfect dark chocolate with the perfect melody of chocolate and some type of liquor, what ever it was it was good.  Now to the middle creamy milk chocolate so creamy and smooth if I closed my eyes I could imagine that I was floating in Willy Wonka's chocolate stream.  I also was able to try a breakfast sandwich (which they serve 24hrs a day) it consisted of 3 grilled slices of fresh baked sourdough bread, the perfect boiled egg (which seems to be hard to come by these days), prosciutto, cheese slices and a heavenly cheese fondue.  Check out the pictures and give it a try.  Perfect ending to a late night in Vegas.  Ladies, no guilt please remember what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."}
{"text":"lol- so I was craving... so I had a friend in Las Vegas...  twisted arms and less than 24 hours later I had a disassembled crepe... I requested everything in seperate containers so I wouldnt have crepe soup... Resassembled...warmed the crepe in the oven and YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! I MEAN thank god this in Vegas... I'd be Willie Wonka Blueberry Girl FAT if it wasn't."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive but it's pretty good desserts. Looks pretty as well and tastes good. $6.25 for coffee? Well this is Vegas after all."}
{"text":"OH! OH! OH!  The crepes are delicious!  I had the banana foster one and I can't find anything close to it in LA!!  The chocolate fountain was crazy looking!  When I come back to Vegas, this will definitely be a mandatory spot!  Kind of pricey but sooo worth it!  Their water is also good! (don't ask why I rated their water, it was just good!)"}
{"text":"It's not overpriced for such a delicious and beautiful cakes. I'll definitely come here next time"}
{"text":"Macarons. Chocolate croissants. Nutella pastries. Delicious. Wouldn't recommend the actual savory foods. Stick with the desserts."}
{"text":"As a passionate pastry chef in the making, I was so stoked at the sight of all these delicious looking confectionery. I was spending a great deal of time analyzing and finalizing my decision on what to get (since I can't have everything I want).   I ended up getting a Rose Macaroon (Raspberry Macaroon, rose infused cream, fresh raspberry) and a Grand Marnier truffle. I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. Really wish I got a crepe though. They smelled so good!   The Rose Macaroon was good! The slight hint of flower in the cream and the macaroon shell was so attractive. I loved the sugar coated rose on top of the macaroon too! Crunchy. Sugary. Floral-y.   The truffle, on the other hand, was alright. It was a pretty small piece (compared with Godiva's truffles). The inside wasn't as creamy as Godiva's either.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst coffee in Vegas! Tastes like burnt water, and to add insult to injury there was a 10 minute wait and it was $5."}
{"text":"Tried the Nutella as well as the powdered sugar crepes and with drip coffee. Neither was great but I guess I just expected more from the name. The glass decor and design was pretty unique with chocolate flowing down from the ceiling through a series of glass steps."}
{"text":"We ordered a chocolate crepe and it was really good. However, it looks like some other good options were available as well. It was pretty cool to watch them make the crepes.  Only one complaint: the line was not clearly marked. We ended up standing in a longer line, only to realize there was another one in the back that could also take orders.  It is a nice stop in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Gelato, gelato and more gelato!  When I was in Vegas in August, I came to Jean Philippe Patisserie almost every night.  Instead of doing a nightcap ritual at a bar, I did a gelato-cap at Jean Philippe!    I truly made it my goal to try almost every flavor of gelato.  But I ended up finding some favorites, including the stracciata (or something like that it's vanilla with their world famous chocolate) and the mint chocolate chip!    What's more, if you get just a scoop of it, it's actually reasonable for Vegas standards - $3 bucks and some change.  I made a mistake the first night and got a milkshake, since I'm a milkshake fan - that was nine bucks!    They have crepes and pastries too.  I might try those out, but I'm seriously in love with their gelato."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé en 1 jour deux fois dans cette patisserie, je m'en lèche encore les babine. Une fois un panini et une fois un trio de sandwiches. Incroyable. Une très bonne expérience."}
{"text":"I just had the blueberry cupcake.. Omg.. Divine! I was scared that it would taste fake crappy because of the bright color on top, but it's not fake tasting at all. When you dig a spoon in, there are layers of different kinds of mousses and creams.  I will post pics"}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe is a must visit when we come to Vegas! They have a lovely large dessert selection! Their crepes are super popular as well! I love their whipped cream dispenser! Fabulous presentation, service and quality of course!"}
{"text":"They have one at bellagio but definitely this one at aria is much better for the following reasons. 1: more selection of pastries, cakes and chocolate at aria 2: they make crape WAY better at aria. ( the crape maker at aria is more professional for some reason. )"}
{"text":"The design, location and line of hungry, excited people ready to dish out too much money for sugary treats pulls you in while strolling through the Bellagio.   Hmmm...I didn't realize I wanted a $13 crepe st 9pm...but I guess I did.  The line is confusing.  You think you're in it then a bunch of foreigners cut in front of you without any compunction and you realize you weren't in line...just mesmerized by the gal artfully swirling the crepe batter with her specialized crepe stick.    15 minutes later while stile in line you realize the Gelato is looking pretty good too.  Hmmm...I didn't realize I wanted a banana crepe with chocolate syrup,  and whip cream that shoots in puffs out of a funnel -as well as a cup of Stratiaccella Gelato, but I guess I did.  Then you notice the chocolate fountain. Such indulgence.  Now 20 minutes in line your eye wanders to a box of small individually wrapped caramels for $24.  Hmmmm...I didn't know I wanted a banana crepe, Gelato and exorbitantly over-priced caramels all at the same time, but I guess I did.  45 minutes and $45 later you are so thankful to Jean Philipe for providing what you had no idea you even wanted.   But crepe, Gelato and caramels were all very good."}
{"text":"What caught my eyes first was the amazing chocolate fountain they have on the side of the entrance. It's very very attractive. Walk around and select something to try. It's hard because everything looks delicious! There isn't really a place to sit/eat except in the hallway of Bellagio.   Giant raspberry macaroon and tiramisu are a must try!"}
{"text":"Another winner. If the Jean Philippe is overly crowded, come to the one in Aria. It easier to maneuver around. (may be just the way the store is designed too) I love the decor. They have cakes up on poles and a giant display near the gelato made of desserts! The first time I saw the display, it had giant chocolate flowers. Another time it was a dragon, tribute to Chinese New Year. I wish they had a video on the side or something that showed the production process!   Must try: Raspberry macaroon, eclair, tiramisu, cheesecake, croissants."}
{"text":"YELP REVIEW CHALLENGE --- 80/100  I literally walked blocks just to get to this place and boy was it worth it!  I was in chocolate heaven. This place is definitely not just all hype. Their chocolates were so good I didn't want to share with my kids. Laugh now, but wait til you try it. I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can splurge. This is definitely a must visit. Yes, it might be a little pricey for some people but you'll understand."}
{"text":"This is the best patisserie I've ever been. The esthetics of the place itself are amazing and every single treat I tried was delicious. I loved the gelato and the cupcakes."}
{"text":"6/28: Located in Aria. Beautiful design! I didn't really care much for the architecture throughout Aria and Crystals before, but now I do notice it and appreciate the hard work and effort put into everything, including this bakery.   I tried the Berry Danish and Fruit Tart. Awesome, tasty desserts! Friendly service. Lots of options to choose from. I enjoy pastries and sweets, but only eat them once in awhile. Though if that's what you love, this is the place to be. Worth a revisit!"}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of our concierge. I feel like it's overrated. Everything was pretty. Stunning visually. But taste was okay. We had coffee and 3 different brioches. The brioches (dulce de leche, blueberry, and Nutella) were too sweet for my taste. I did see savory crepes at a table next to me and wish I had gone that route. They looked amazing."}
{"text":"The line here is very confusing! People are constantly coming here to look at the chocolate fountain. There is one line for pastry and ice cream and another line for coffee and crepes. The desserts are pretty good here. I had the raspberry cheesecake and the snicker's cake. The cheesecake was really good but the snicker's one is a little bit too sweet. The carrot cupcake looks weird, but don't be fooled, it's good."}
{"text":"Yes, yes; crepes, crepes, crepes.  They're as good as the hype.  But try a raspberry jelly donut and it may just change your life ::swoon::"}
{"text":"Largest Chocolate Fountain... IN THE WORLD!   This is their claim to fame. It is a pretty cool sight to see! You can't miss it. Right around the corner from the Bellagio Conservatory.   Their crepes here are delicious! My bf and I also recently tried their tiramisu gelato which I thought was just okay. Nothing too special about it. They also have lots of different desserts and chocolatey treats and goodies you can take home as souvenirs... they don't last since you'll eat them but I guess you can still call it a souvenir since your taste buds will remember it. :)"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Going to stop by this place  every time I'm in the area and also for all holidays!"}
{"text":"Food, drinks and dessert selection are pretty decent, if not slightly overpriced for what it's worth, but having to wait there for 10 minute in front of the counter before placing an order while the clerk leisurely made a smoothie for someone who cut in line left little to desire.  Wait, lemme rephrase, there isn't any line system at all, very disorganized. Clerks merely call out \"who's next\" and proceed to randomly choose a customer they *felt* like was next, even if there were other customers standing in front of them idly waiting for ages.  Service:1, actual food:4"}
{"text":"Oh.my.gelato.... I'll be honest I never quite understood the difference between gelato and ice cream. But... I do now! And this place has the best tasting gelato. Wow. I had the cookies and cream and my hubby had the lemon. They even offer a free sample before you decide on your flavor. You can get it in a cone or a cup. Lots of other tasty chocolates and sweets here as well!"}
{"text":"Food is good, desserts are scrumptious but the person who helped me Karen who I presume is a manager because she wasn't wearing a uniform is extremely abrupt & rude. Needs help is customer service training. :("}
{"text":"If you need a sugar rush while gambling, this is your place. Right on the casino floor at aria, this place offers a variety of desserts, candy and baked good. Though a bit expensive, they're totally worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas local, so I used to come here pretty often for a treat. I'm saying \"I used to\" because as of today I'm pretty disappointed. Prices have gone up while quality is not as good as it used to be. I had a raspberry tart for $8.50, and the raspberries aren't even fresh. It makes me wondering if the pastries are the ones they didn't sell yesterday. Soaky and tasteless. What's going on guys??"}
{"text":"Sooooo this is their secondary shop. I discovered it as I passed by the Conservatory at the Bellagio, and of course I had to stop by, as the main shop at the Aria is my favorite. Well, this one is pretty cool too, and they have the biggest chocolate fountain in the world! Grab a bite, sit comfortably and enjoy your tasteful sweet or savory item(s) making your tastebuds understand French language for a moment. ;)"}
{"text":"I didn't give the place 5-stars because I reserve 5-stars for establishments that are perfect in what/who they cater to, and the excellence they do it in.  The desserts here are made by a chef who was crowned basically the world's best pastry chef in the 1990s, and took up residency with the MGM giant here in Vegas.  I saw someone post here about getting lunch.  Okay, you do NOT get lunch here.  You get desserts, small snacks, and other small things.  No wonder you rated it badly.  If you go to a Starbucks and expect steak and lobster, will you give it 2-stars?  Jeez, come to my Chinese restaurant and I swear if ask for foie gras, I will spit in your food.  The pastries are great.  Some of the tastes take some time getting accustomed to, probably because they are quite bold in flavor.  They also had vanilla flan which was pretty interesting.  Too bad though, my mom makes them better.  For a date, this may be a mediocre place to go to for desserts.  For a true epicurean, for whom Jean Philippe went to La Chambre de Métiers for, this is THE place for desserts.  If you want a cake, I know that you have to meet with their cake specialist ahead of time to order one.  They are MUCH more expensive than Freed's Bakery, but well worth the money.  Other than that, they have a great selection, so whatever you're feeling like, they should have something in store.  The pieces are somewhat pricey though, so restrain yourself ;)"}
{"text":"While on my most recent Vegas trip, I was on a gelato binge. So on the last day with some time to kill, I decided to check out the Patisserie. A rather fancy dessert shop, I went straight to the gelato section and overlooked the other desserts on display (something I have come to regret) Anyways I didn't have to wait long before someone behind the counter made her way over from the other side and greeted me to ask what I wanted. I went with the Dulce de Leche & complemented with some tang in the Mango. The Dulce de Leche was bomb diggity and 3 days later, the taste hasn't left my palette bank. It was amazing and the Mango was no joke either. In a few months, I will try to make my way back here and try some of the other offerings at the dessert shop."}
{"text":"It's been a tradition to visit here before heading back home for many years but recently the quality has fallen DRASTICALLY! The service has never been good, I guess when you work surrounded by beautiful scenery it makes you super grumpy, but I've always come back because you just couldn't beat the awesomeness of their pastry. Well that's over. Thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"I have a huge sweet tooth! On our vegas trip everywhere we went we got too full for dessert. So I was determined to have a decadent sweet before I went home and started diet number 233.   I yelped desserts and Jean Phillippe Patisserie showed high remarks. It took us a minute to find it at Bellagio. I could smell it before I could see it.   We opted 3 pastries, 1 each and 1 to share. Here is the tip, these little pastries look small in the case. They are so packed full of flavor with hidden layers and surprises... You only need one. I had the red velvet cake and Fred the intense, and we shared a choc cheesecake (Oreo)   The red velvet cake was so moist, the icing was a little to sugary for me, loved the hidden wheel of white chocolate, all in all delicious. I sampled the intense and it is what it claims too rich for me. I loved the white chocolate shell of the cheesecake. The crust was dull the cheesecake flavor was spot on.   Thank goodness this place is not in Indy as my diets would not survive all the things i would like to try. The decor boosts the world's largest chocolate fountain in true willy wonka fashion, I envision myself straddling  the chocolate fountain trying my own unique version of a keg stand ending up just as Augustus Gloop, dead by chocolate."}
{"text":"Welcome to the world of eccentric and novel desserts, coated with chocolate and all things sugary. That which will add many lbs to your hips and gut, but you won't regret it one bit because for that time that you relish it, you are in heaven!  This is my world for a chocolate croissant, for a plain old chai tea latte, for the world's most delicious crepes when I am in Vegas. And I urge you to make its your as well. Slurrrp.  The experience of walking around the kiosk and looking at beautiful creations using sugar in every form is totally worth it.   Pricewise, this won't even burn a tiny hole in your pocket.   Grab your food, grab a seat and enjoy your moment in heaven, is all I have to say~"}
{"text":"Overpriced and hyped but they has this pistachio nougat that I have only ever had in France.  It tasted sooooo good! Worth the $10.50."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable due to its location. The decorative pastries and desserts are wonderful. The ice coffee and mocha are exceptional!"}
{"text":"5 star: The bakery and the food selection are all yummy to the eyes, mouth, and nose.  The crepes are all good that it's so hard to have one bite from someone's plate.  It's so irresistible.  I'd recommend trying any crepes with fruits because it's all fresh. 3.5 star: The line is so long it'll take you half an hour from the time you step in line until the time you receive your purchase.  If you have patience and have the time, then by all means go here.  If you don't, then skip this place. 5 star: The atmosphere is like willy wonky the chocolate factory in reality.  They have this beautiful chocolate fountain that you have to take a picture in front of it.  This design is what attracts a lot of people to this bakery.  Without the chocolate fountain and the other intricate designs, the bakery wouldn't be so lovely THAT much."}
{"text":"OMG, one word: LATTE. On tap!!   This place is crazy cool, we came off the elevator from our room and saw the sign for the latte on tap. Now I'm intrigued. There is no line, I walk up to the counter and ask for a iced latte stat. The counterperson gets the process started. There are two types, a Nitro latte and the cold brew latte. I don't think I'm jonesin' for a nitro latte so cold brew it is!  There is no need to mix milk or sweeteners because coming out of the tap the drink is naturally sweet. While you're on line, walking to the cash register is a visual treat. You're able to see all of the yummy pastries on display at Jean Philippe Patisserie. My wife screams, there is a Nutella stuff pastry. Eeeek! I'll have one of those thankyouverymuch.  There is a little sitting area to relax and enjoy your coffee & dessert, 24 hours - 7 Days per week. Jean Philippe Patisserie, you complete me."}
{"text":"Crepes and gelato were good. Ordered vanilla gelato and two Nutella crepes. Crepe was too sweet! Lady at the cashier was kind of rude. :/ better customer service please."}
{"text":"Spent Memorial Day weekend at the Bellagio and I was much more than pleased to have my morning coffee here than at Starbucks.  On Sunday morning I picked up a White Chocolate Mocha and a raspberry donut.  Both were excellent.  The following day I returned for a another White Chocolate Mocha and a Basil Chicken Panini.  The sandwich was surprisingly well done.  There is a nice seating area next to the patisserie that overlooks the pool.  I had homework to do so I walked a little further towards the convention area and found a big comfy chair and table to work at that was much quieter."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is awesome. Located in the bellagio, I wake up and get a nice cup of coffee, a great selection of sweets from crepes, cinnamon rolls, and danishes. For lunch they have great sandwiches like the grilled chicken basil with sauteed onions and a basil pesto. WOW. The crepes are also great included fruit and dessert selections. And don't forget the gelato, homemade flavors like tiramisu, cocnut, and mango sorbet. I love this patisserie and always come back when im in vegas."}
{"text":"RIP OFF! DO NOT get the breakfast panini. It is made with that fake cheese and the egg is gross and hard according to my friends and boyfriend. I got the quiche which was edible I will give it that. I thought all the pasteries looked delicious and couldnt make up my mind. So I played it safe with a cinnamon roll. They outer ring of the roll was very dry and hard, so I peeled that part off and it was pretty good on the inside.   This place is WAY over priced. I have never paid $30 for a \"light\" breakfast. If anything was light, it was my wallet after paying."}
{"text":"5 Solid Stars!  Jean Philippe is always my first choice for desserts.  Everything looks so pretty absolutely pretty, professional and of course tastes excellent."}
{"text":"This place is so busy same as the Bellagio location.  However, i think they changed the selection and offered less individual cake.   Presentation is still very nice, just getting abit too sweet and expensive.  We ordered  salmon sandwich, trio cheesecake and vanillia napoleon.  The sandwich ingredients were very fresh, just very small portion, cheesecake was very tasty, napoleon was average.    For a self service place like this, $7 a slice of small desserts are quite overpriced same as $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the crepe we had here for breakfast.  I actually don't know how we did not come here every morning for breakfast.  There was a long line at the cafe area and no line here.  However they do serve coffee and crepes.  We went with a savory crepe with ham and it was delicious.  My only complaint was we asked for fried egg on top and got scrambled.  My husband and I both shared it and I thought it was enough for both of us and a reasonable price for a large crepe and 2 coffees.  The coffee was pretty standard but it was all I was looking for in the morning.  The pastries and gelato looked amazing and will make to make a point to try them next time."}
{"text":"The worst part about this place is having to decide what you want! So many delicious options to choose from. Everything tastes fresh made and delicious. Only thing that I regret not trying during my recent trip was the Nutella donuts!"}
{"text":"I miss this place a lot and I always want to come back whenever when I am in Vegas!!!!  And finally I did!    OMG the dessert are still as good as before!    I had the Cheesecake and Sugar free Strawberry gelato.  They were both YUMMY.  The cheesecake was so rich and creamy while the strawberry was fresh and refeshing .  Very good combination (I made the good selection..hehehe..)  Then we bought couple cakes back to our room.  I especially love the Raspberry Rose Macaron.  It looked pretty and tasted very good too.  The macaron was so chewy and not too sweet!  The raspberries were so fresh.......But make sure to eat it the same day; otherwise the macaron  will be too soft.  Don't wait till the next day!    The service was okay.  Sometimes slow and they always confuse of your order.  Like I wanted to get the Trio Chocolate Cheesecake but they gave me Tripe Chocolate Cheesecake...maybe my English.....Oh well, they both tasted very good anyway!  I will come back again for sure :-)    I miss their crepes!"}
{"text":"I turned the corner and BAM I saw a huge chocolate fountain! So, I thought why not buy some sweets here??  I had the crepes here and they were pretty amazing...I wish I had it them one more time before put I didn't have time.  The croissants here are so good too...I took some home with me I was pretty excited when I pulled them out for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Love Jean Philippe! This patisserie has something for just about any sweet tooth.  My first time at there Aria location. Though I've been to the one in Bellagio a few times, the lines here aren't as hectic and decoration of this place is amazing. Their tri chocolate fountain and desserts are absolutely divine and must see. Make you want to just dive right in.  After wonderful lunch at Todd English PUB, we came here for dessert and had some gelatos. The difficulty is choosing. They have an amazing selection and allow you to sample them before you buy. We ended up getting a double scoop of mango/hazelnut and pistachio. Both were fabulous! Flavor profile was on point. Definitely satisfied our sweet tooth for the day.   Now on to dinner!"}
{"text":"This desserts at the place are very good especially the triple layered chocolate cake. The baked goods are okay as they seemed to be sitting out for a long time. They were nice enough to heat up the Danish."}
{"text":"I could literally eat everything from here!!!  Slightly overpriced- but I guess you have to consider the fact that you're in Vegas.   The pastries and sandwhiches are amazing. Display and taste both live up to par.  SO delicious I had to buy stuff to take back home. I definitely want to try their salads- they were so pretty displayed in the clear balls with a salmon sashimi flower."}
{"text":"UGH every time to fiancé and I come to Vegas, we Can't leave without a sweet from this spot!! We both have crazy sweet tooths and jean's really hits the spot.   If you're not in the mood for something sweet, there's crepes, gelato (both sweet and savory), pastries.   Our favorite is the vegetarian crepe, which almost amazingly tastes like a combo pizza. Our go to!   All chocolate items are rich and delicious. You can't go wrong with anything from here, really!!"}
{"text":"This is where Willy Wonka cries and comes to sell his drugs because these treats are better than his crazy candy. You better watch out! You better not cry, pastries gonna make it to town. Some of the most realest desserts in where-do-you-think town of NV. Very bad for the people who want to diet. I know I want to swim in a pool of these desserts. Big, storming cakes the size of skyscrapers and the colors are bold. There are crazy amounts of long johns, cupcakes, swirls, key lime pies and much much more. They have ice cream, they even have sandwiches and muffins. It is lines and lines of the best pure black coffees, draft lattes, and pure black tans. There was a huge 66 highway sign chocolate fountain once spotted. They have tourist attraction corners where they sell packaged chocolates, hard candies, depending on the season as well. My favorite is Easter where they have the big chocolate bunnies. The Halloween season has wild popping cakes shaped like pumpkin heads with funny, silly faces. On Christmas, there was the evil, mean gringe and he was shaped like a cake. Delicious. Gotta say, this is one my favorite patisseries ever."}
{"text":"I am a self-confessed foodie and a food snob.  I super loved their Nutella Napoleon, it had the right sweetness and crunch. I tried their Intense too and it was great as well, rich but not sickeningly sweet like American desserts.  I am not a fan of sandwiches but your Prosciutto Panini was delightful.  I hope they consider opening a branch in South Orange County CA soon."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the sweets (they're right) but I love the coffee and savory croissants too. Seating shortage during peak hours."}
{"text":"Amazing little patisserie!! I spend way too long staring at all the deserts! So much detail and so beautifully created. And the white, milk and dark chocolate water fall thing... Droooools.   The little deserts are definitely affordable as well and tasty!"}
{"text":"Great pastries and croissants!!!"}
{"text":"\"Geez. Look at all those people standing in line at that place. Can it possibly be worth it?\"   The answer to that question is \"Yes. Yes it can.\"   We came to that conclusion when we joined the line about 11:00 one weekday morning during our last visit to LV. So, if you're wondering if it's worth it as you walk by, we'd encourage you to get in line too. A line that actually moves pretty quickly as it snakes around the display counters of pastries, all nicely labeled so you know exactly what to order when you get to the order counter. (And here's a tip:  the line seems shortest at this late morning hour.)  You know what you've heard about he Almond Brioche at Bouchon? Well, they're good there, for sure. But based on my personal research at both places, I vote that Jean Phillipe makes the best one. Ever.   Drawbacks are these:  If you're looking for a nice place to sit and enjoy your pastries, you're out of luck at this location. There are very few seats and you'll likely need to wander about outside and hope to snag one of the few tables that are in the Bellagio \"concourse\". Hubby and I were lucky to get one and happily offered to share our extra seat with another poor soul who was wondering about, as we had been, looking for a place to land. And if you or someone in your group uses a wheelchair, this is doable but awkward, the line and so on.   We're headed back to LV in a week or so and this time we'll check out Jean Philippe at City Center. We hear the options are the same and that seating and accessibility are better. But whichever Jean Phillippe location is best for you, be sure to stop in. It is \"worth it\"."}
{"text":"While relatives were chowing down at the $14.99 breakfast buffet at Flamingo, hubby and I were sharing a warn fresh mixed berry crepe ($8.50) and two big cups of really good coffee at Jean Phillippe with a total bill of just about $15.00  So, about half as much per person for cost as the buffet and we'd say ten times as much deliciousness in the food.  This Jean Phillippe location still has the stand in line to order, pick it up at the counter and carry it out or to your table format of its' older sibling location in Bellagio.  But this location just off thecasino floor at Aria  also has more tables at which to sit in the space and seemingly more savory food choices and a much bigger pre-packaged retail sweets area.  And a nod to Yelp friend Richard S for the heads up that this is a universally accessible location.   Crepes are not usually one of my favorite things, something about the texture,  but  I relied on other Yeeps' reviews to underscore that they were a good breakfast choice at Jean Philippe.  I thought fond thoughts about those Yeeps as we ate because the warm mixed berry crepe was really yummy and plenty for two smaller breakfast eaters to share.  On another day I might come back here to try gelato from the extensive selection in the sparkling case. Although perhaps not the quiche or other savories as the women sitting on each side of us left quiche and sandwich uneaten, saying each was a little soggy and that they wished they'd picked the crepe instead.    The drawback at this location is that while the process of where to stand to order what is crystal clear at the Bellagio store, it seemed a little unclear here on the first visit to the busy Aria location.  Next time we'll know that a) the entry on the right is for seating or exit from seating, b) the middle entry is for ordering food from the glass enclosed food and pastries counter or for making a right turn to walk to seating and c) the entry on the left is for the gelato, crepe and coffee bar as well as the packaged goodies retail display. (Footnote:  If the crepe counter is closed, order crepes at the coffee counter and go back to the crepe counter to pick them up.  At least that was the drill on the day of our visit.)  Now you know if you go.  And we recommend you go.  Almost anything is luscious, but we suggest the crepes of any kind.  ."}
{"text":"Clean place, plenty of seating...  Classic French patisserie.  Coffee, pastries, and a few other goodies.  Come on people!!  You came to Seattle to see something new.    Right across from the market with street music.  Cool eclectic area."}
{"text":"This place is incredible - really as good as it gets for French pastries, in Vegas at least. Not sure if this is something to be proud of, but we've dropped hundreds here. Everything is delicious but some of the standouts are the truffles, strawberry tart, and veggie sandwich. Yum, can't wait to go back! As a side note, my husband introduced himself to Jean Philippe and he was very kind and gracious. We're fans!"}
{"text":"They started to charge for a cup of ice water even when I spent 40 bucks on food btw I have a pearl mlife card.  The cashier said they are a business.  I was thankful he told me about the cost but, really.  No tip for expected service then; tips are for extra care not for doing their job ."}
{"text":"I ordered an exotic crepe, filled with creme I think, a rose macaroon, and a caramel coffee (I forget what the exact name was). Everything was exceptional! The crepe was full of flavor and the macaroon was delicate and had the perfect amount of sweetness.  The presentation is also pretty good. The person who made the crepes made sure she maintained cleanliness and there were  no spills or splatters on the counter top. Good attention to detail!  My only issue is how cramped the place was....it was tiny and there were a lot of people trying to order and take pictures of the chocolate fountain. I was almost afraid of turning around and knocking something off the shelves. Despite the crowds...the staff works efficiently and the wait time is minimal.   If you want to order and enjoy your food in a calmer environment, visit the Jean Philippe at  Aria."}
{"text":"This place is great with delicious pastries, sweets, gelato and yummy coffee, plus it has the largest chocolate fountain which is a must see. I loved that it was all decked out in Fall/Halloween decor."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this chocolate shop while in Las Vegas and couldn't have been more pleased.  Super beautiful displays of chocolate , cakes and sweet treats .  They even offer sandwiches and breakfast items .  There are maybe 2-3 tables and there is always s line .   Expect to pay $10 and up for anything in the store ."}
{"text":"Finally found the taste I crave. JP is the man to create the best pastry,chocolate, macaroons etc!!! I missed having those.... found in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"\"There's a party in my tummy, so yummy so yummy!!\"  Well Jean Philippe Patisserie was definitely a hit with my friends and I. This was the first stop on our trip to Vegas. As there are two locations we decided to stop at this one inside the Bellagio. Crowds of people walking by would stop and stare in awe as the fountain of different kinds of chocolate flows from the ceiling. Definitely a choco-aholic's dream come true! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=9wjqSN7dgLb4PLN-mLRn5g  Well as we were kinda hungry from our drive we decided to grab a bite as well as indulge in some sweet delights. Jean Philippe offers cold sandwiches, paninis, and crepes in addition to their sweet treats. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=uBOXzUbgCRejic87uMNGog I opted for the Spicy Chicken Panini which has swiss cheese, tomato, caramelized onions, spicy tomato spread on ciabatta bread. The bread was crisp and the spicy tomato spread made this sandwich for me. Each and every bite was heaven in my mouth.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=Icd_wAfn2agew-gYuS3gqQ For dessert I went with the Intense Chocolate Cake. This moist creamy chocolate cake was very rich and melted in my mouth. Foodgasm does not even describe how I felt after each and every bite. Definitely Intense, now I understand the name! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=Tw9UmjiTOydD-f-FeEdtlA  I did get to take a bite of my friend's Exotic Crepe (it was filled with mango and I love me some mango). Definitely sweet and savory! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=Yp_4wHEvrOjDJN9FUG5XEQ  Jean Philippe was such a delight and I will definitely be sure to come back each chance I get."}
{"text":"Follow up The Goods 1. They don't have my favorite shrimp salad anymore with ginger vinaigrette...no hard feelings though   MoJo 1. Still love them for the amazing sweets: like a dream and feast for all senses"}
{"text":"So, I need to try some of the deserts here, I realize, but this time, I was feeling savory, so I had one of their savory crepes (Forest- $11.95). It was okay... not my favorite crepe, but not terrible either. It had lots of ham and mushrooms and is topped with scrambled eggs. Something about the actual crepe itself was a little odd, the texture was a bit spongy. I think that I prefer the savory crepes at Paris, but I would certainly give it another shot and try some of the sweets!"}
{"text":"Everything here looks to die for!!  Love the open storefront & LOVE the chocolate fountain!!  They have many display cakes that are humungous, like 7 layer wedding cake size!  Love all the lil cakes and desserts, I want all of them!  This place has the Guinness world record for largest chocolate fountain.  White, Dark chocolate and Milk chocolate.   All the chocolate is confectionery grade.  That means we can jump in the chocolate waterfall!!  :)  We've been here a few times and have been able to try different desserts.  The crepes are so yummy!!  They make them to order so you get to watch them!  I love nutella!!!!!!!!!!!!  :D  There's always a line, but that means more time to decide what to get.  Come, eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"When you walk past one of these bakeries, you are overwhelmed by the endless amounts of goodies they have to offer...ice cream, chocolate, muffins, baked goods, cookies, pastries, etc etc. You honestly go on sugar overload just looking at the endless options. You don't know which way to turn or frankly to order. It makes you wish you had an endless amount of money (in which some do) to order one of everything and do a tasting.   After what seems like an hour long decision, I order a snickers pastry. It's a dark chocolate shell with chocolate moose, caramel, and nuts inside. Phenomenal. A perfect blend of all four flavors. Now that I am thinking about this decant dessert, it makes me wonder if they ship. Ummmm????"}
{"text":"Yes, it's  a bit pricey for what it is, but for a Vegas establishment, this is consider cheap eats!  I always come here whenever I stay on the strip.  I just love looking at the dessert display while my super hearty chicken crepe is getting made (by the same girl every time!).  The key lime pie dessert was so good, I finished it before my crepe was done cooking.  The sandwiches on the other hand are a bit pricey for what it is, I'd rather go across to Earl's.  Oh I almost forgot about the coconut gelato....just...get it."}
{"text":"Oh mylanta. I think I just got dia-beetuz!!! The crepes were delish, just what I needed on a 105 degree day. Well... kind of."}
{"text":"While our stay at the ARIA was wonderful, I left on a sour note. We had THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE at Jean Philippe Patisserie. The display at Jean Philippe was spectacular..... The pastries and the gelato had our mouths watering.  We asked the gelato server for a sample of a few of the gelatos, as I had my two children with me and their palates are very picky. Joselito M was hostil and rude! I was not sure hot to take this hostility, maybe he had a bad day. We we're polite and cordial and proceeded to make our selections. We ordered 4- 2 scoops of gelato, 1-scoop of gelato and a nutella crepe for a total of $42.43. Thinking that Mr. Joselito M had a had day, I handed him $45 and told him to keep the change.   We sat among the beautiful displays and enjoyed our DELICIOUS desserts. The pistachio was excellent, as was the Leche (can't remember exact name), can't remember what other gelato we ordered but the Pistachio and Leche were the best as was the crepe.  Since it was my daughters 18th birthday, I sneaked over to Joselito M and asked him what the price of the birthday cakes were. Again annoyed with me he didn't answer, but I could clearly see he was attending to other customers. I patiently waited until he was free, then again asked him the price of the Birthday cakes. He told me he didn't know and walked away! OMG it was so rude, I followed him over to the next counter and asked again politely, annoyed he turned to me and said \"Thats not my department... ask someone else\" then turned and walked away!  I was so shocked with his behavior, I walked away and left Jean Philippe.  It wasn't until I returned home that I realized his behavior was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  If a manager is reading this review..... You MUST talk to your employees. They are the face of your business and must put on a pleasant face at all times, your reputation is on the line. Mr. Joselito M. must be talked to immediately!"}
{"text":"YUM, you simply MUST have a taste...  the chocolate fountains display is so cute and the pastries and chocolates are YUUUUUUMMMMMY...  I always take one home when I stay at this hotel..."}
{"text":"The famous chocolate fountain was a feast for my eyes. I got the chocolate crepe ($10.50) and I dug in while it was still hot and fresh. While the first bite was blissful, the crepe was just too sweet with chocolate on the inside and out and covered with brownie chunks. The boyfriend called it quits after a couple bites. We also got crossaints (2 for the price of 1) and a strawberry gelato. Indeed we indulged our sweet tooth but nothing was particularly memorable. When we do come back, we will be trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Super good dessert. Clearly work went into the fresh pastries and other desserts. The cheese cake I had was light and tasteful. At $8 a pop we did feel it was worth it. sometimes in Vegas you pay a lot and it's not that great. Totally worth it here."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars because of the service! We go to Vegas at least 4 times a year and we stop by JP every single time and stock up on pastries for the road... Etc. well today, we purchased about 7 different pastries and desserts. Pastries, Nutella brioche, almond croissant and sticky bun. Desserts: lemon tart, rose macaron, trio and raspberry tart. Ok, so more like an assortment of 8... :)   So off we go, happy as can be. Load and behold! Our trio dessert is destroyed!   Why?   Because they crowded 3 desserts in one box and the rose macaron plastered the mini macaron and the chocolate lollipop. Mind you, each dessert is no less than $7. Which you would think they would package everything accordingly.   Well, now we are sad as the trio is what we buy for our children as a thank you for being good at grandmas... :-/ this seemed like the attendant \"Fabiola\" was either over-whelmed by the crowd and opted shoving the desserts together in order to speed up the process and move to the next party or simply did not care and was lazy...   Note to self:  open the boxes next time to make sure everything is packaged neatly."}
{"text":"After I spent a few hours at the blackjack table, I decided to go look for my friend. He texted me saying he was by the \"Walking Dead\" slot machines. So I went and tried to go find him.  While looking for him, I had a craving for some gelato and at Jean Phillppe they had a very good selection.  The first time I got a waffle cone with two scoops of lemon gelato. It was really good. Wonderful lemon flavor. The second time I got a waffle cone but with one scoop of cheesecake and one scoop of lemon. OMG that was so yummy! Both of those flavors along with the waffle cone went very well together. Try out that combo, I am sure its a winner winner chicken dinner! LOL"}
{"text":"On one of my many lone walks down the strip, I found myself inside Bellagio taking refuge from the 100+ degree weather.  I pulled out my phone and yelped for the nearest, most easily accessible treats and ended up st JP.    Wow all their goodies, from sammies to crepes to gelato to pastries-- everything looked so appetizing. Now I was already anticipating a large meal within the next hour so I couldn't go crazy.   I got the popular nutella brioche, vanilla eclair and peanut brittle.   I quite enjoyed the latter two treats but was disappointed in their nutella brioche. I suppose it would have been much better warm but it wasn't given to me that way. The brioche itself was tough and slightly stale unfortunately. At least they were more than generous with the nutella.   Pretty sure I'll be making a comeback. This time, with no other dining plans."}
{"text":"This is a must!!!!!!!!!! The must delicious desserts abc sandwiches ever!!!! I ordered a tiramisu delicious!!! I ordered turkey and salmon sandwich both were great. Pricey but worth it. I wish they had a shop in LA."}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand how this place doesn't have a 5 star rating.  I'm a HUGE dessert aficionado and every time I've ordered from their pastry case I've been transported.  Honestly-if you like sweets, you will never be disappointed.  The gelato was good, but the \"Snickers\" dessert was other-worldly delicious.  Something about the quality of the flavor and textures of each of the components making up their desserts just elevates their desserts above anything else on the Strip (except maybe the PBCs or Lemon Tart at Bouchon!).  Highly recommended - grab a couple with some friends and sit at the tables to the left of the shop along the windows for a quiet moment of sugary euphoria!"}
{"text":"The gelato was great. My gf and I had the coconut flavor which is a must. With every bite you can taste fresh coconut. Rocky road was really good as well. The lady had the pistachio flavor which was pretty tasty as well. Perfect stop on the way back from the Bellagio pool."}
{"text":"While on our almost 2 week stay in Vegas me and my boyfriend went here twice. The first time we got the bananas foster crepe. The crepe itself was really good but the bananas were on the mushy side. With bananas foster usually the bananas are just caramelized. I guess these had been sitting for a while, were premade way beforehand, or the lady that prepared it for us overdid them. It still had a good flavor. The second time I went by myself while my boyfriend was in a poker tournament. I got a white chocolate cheesecake dessert. It was beautiful with a little Oreo truffle on top. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously tho. What is that?! The textures. The flavors. The options. The customer service. Everything in this place is awesome.  Was cruising along the Bellagio's and stumbled across it and had to try. The desserts are small for $7 but you are paying for the novelty. They are all so beautiful, truly pieces of art.   I tried the tiramisu and the chocolate/caramel/peanut one I forgot the name. Goodness gracious, that was one the best desserts I've ever tried. If you're in Vegas, you MUST stop there."}
{"text":"CREPES!!!  The crepes are amazing, both savory and sweet - I would kill for one right now!!  Fabulous quality chocolates and the deserts are stunning.  I was hoping for a larger selections of French macarons - but they few they had were among the best that I've had!   This place was always a buzz - hardly an empty seat any time of the day.  Go!"}
{"text":"My family had a great experience here--surprised on the previous review! Yes, it's pricey, but would splurge again for the croissants!!! The last trip we came they had been sold out, this time we arrived on a weekday and were able to try them. They were PERFECTION! The outside was flaky with a bit of crunch because of the light (very light-just enough) glaze, so it crunched when you bit it, the inside was soft and melted in your mouth--OMG!! And I had this Rose flavored macaroon--it was absolutely exquisite! It had the most delicate taste of rose, the almond inside was soft in the middle, crunchy meringue outside..WOW. The nutella crepe wasn't oozing with too much nutella, just enough..We've had those nutella brioches, honestly, they aren't that good, but the plain one is..It's definitely worth going to--it is pricey & there usually is a wait, but we think it's worth it! Get the croissants!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious desserts.  We ordered the chocolate chocolate cheesecake.  Our only criticism was the price - $8.50 for take-out."}
{"text":"In observance of Macaron Day 2012 (http://jourdumacaron.com/ or http://macarondaynyc.com/index.html , catch up, Vegas!), I would like to compose a love letter to my favorite macaron (and patisserie) in town. Jean Phillipe Patisserie at the Bellagio is the first place that attracted me to Las Vegas. The Rose Macaron in the dessert case had caught my attention ever since my first visit, but it was a number of trips before I actually ever tried it. The selection of tasty treats--gelatos, danishes, crepes, chocolate confections-- can be overwhelming!   The Rose Macaron is more dessert than your standard macaron: two perfect, bright pink shells separated by fresh raspberries with a pastry cream filling, garnished with a crystallized rose petal. It's creamy, floral, fruity, and slightly chewy with a bit of crunch all at the same time. My husband could have saved money on an engagement ring by proposing to me with a Rose Macaron in a box from Jean Phillipe Patisserie. (Not recommended if your significant other doesn't LOVE the flavor of rosewater ;)"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is fairly tasty, but expensive.   I stopped here for a cheese danish, which was pretty good. I also ordered one of their croissant sandwiches (turkey and cheese) and their famous opera cake - the turkey croissant was ok, but the opera cake was awesome. If you're a chocolate lover, I would give the opera cake a try. Service was good."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I'm always sure to stop here. I originally fell in love with the Jean Philippe crepes in the Bellagio, but as soon as the Aria opened a Jean Philippe this has become my go to spot for a quick coffee, breakfast or even lunch. In my opinion the one in the Bellagio tends to be over crowded anyway. And minus the amazing chocolate fountain the Bellagio has, as far as everything else goes it's the same.  They have two different sections. One side is for the crepes where you can order sweet or savory and order coffee and different types of iced drinks. On the other side is a counter filled with different fruit tarts, pastries, cakes, and desserts. They have sandwich options as well that you can customize to your liking. You can have it to stay or go. There's a small seating area as well if you wish to stay and have a view of all the lobby goers place their bets at the slots and tables right across.   I can't attest for their pastries much, since every time I come I have their crepes. But having said that if you are at the Aria do try their crepes! With fruit, ice cream, Nutella, etc. Eat your heart out!  I'm knocking one star off this review because I find the staff to be a little short and rude every time I've been. Not sure what that deal is, but general observation I've made."}
{"text":"Funny how I've brought numerous friends and family members here to ogle the chocolate fountain, but have never eaten anything here.  I met a friend here for breakfast and was utterly satisfied.  My salmon bagel -- while nothing fancy or extremely decadent -- was toasted and served to me with a smile.  The salmon was mainly raw and very lightly smoked, I believe, and tasty while the accompanying dill sauce was light,savoury, and delightful with the grape tomatoes.  My friend easily consumed her Quiche Lorraine without any complaints.  Great service, great food, and beautiful pastries all beckon me to come again.  Next time I'll try the crêpes and/or a chocolate goodie."}
{"text":"Excellent! If you want gourmet pastry this is it. The flavors explode in your mouth and leaves a lovely after taste. Soooo good. I would recommend this place to everyone I can. Must go place for sweet tooths that appreciates finer deserts. Seriously you must go. The key lime tart is delish. Awesome. Yummy"}
{"text":"Awesome display of chocolate fountain as well as slight better average banana crepe. Will have it if lines are not too long but no problem of passing up if its too busy. Give it a try if you are staying at the hotel. Gelato ain't too bad either."}
{"text":"I had heard that the \"World's Largest Chocolate Fountain\" was located somewhere around the Bellagio. The husband and I decided to wander off and little did we know we bumped into Jean Philippe's. I have had their pastries before at a different location in Las Vegas but I hadn't had the chance to the see cool fountain. Saturday night was pretty busy and pretty crowded. Plenty of tourist in front of it taking their pictures and not being very kind as far as who's turn it was to get in front of it. You just gotta budge your way in and not care. Unfortunately I did care and wasn't ready to start pushing people around to get a picture in front of it but I must say, it is pretty cool! Its def really neat for kids to look at and for anyone to imagine what it would be like to get under neath it and just open your mouth and let that warm, delicious, fresh chocolate stream pour into your mouth and make your belly have a happy dance. Make sure you help yourself to one of their many desserts... whether it maybe a small cake, gelato or even a milkshake.. that will be the closest you will get to getting some sweet love in your belly since you aren't able to really touch or even taste the fountain (sorry! It's behind a glass window. It would be kinda gross if they just allowed people to dip random fruits and stuff in there. You know there would be that one person that will be smart to dip their finger in there hahaha-- back to the subject though). The place is a bit on the busy side though so make sure you have some time and take a seat near it and enjoy your sweets."}
{"text":"My first time here! I loved it. It's a cute boutique dessert cafe! I was focused on the desserts but they did have fruits and sandwiches!   I had the key lime tart and birthday cake macaroon! I sampled the mango gelato as well. It was delicious like heaven in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Crepes crepes crepes!   Souffle crepe: I like this one the most out of all of the dessert crepes because it has a lighter, flufflier custard filling. I had also tried the dulche de leche and nutella ones before, but they were a little too sweet, a little too heavy for me.   Savory crepes: I highly recommend the Royal one. It has a nice creamy sauce that reminds me of chicken pot pie, and mushrooms and some kind of poultry (I forget).  Each crepe is about $10 Each pastry is about $6  I like the nutella brioche... but the real winner amongst cakes is the Opera (OMG)!!!  There's usually a pretty long line... so be patient. You would love this place if you like to take pictures of food because everything is sooooooo incredibly beautiful!!  The location in Bellagio has a chocolate fountain, while the location in Aria does not. Both of them look amazing and serve the same amazing items. I have been to both and I am not partial to one or the other."}
{"text":"You hear this name and you think awesome, beautiful pastries.  So my visit was a bit disappointing. We ordered crepes and they didn't look beautiful or even taste amazing. They were pretty plain and definitely nothing that stands out. So sad! Especially for the bellagio location."}
{"text":"I just stood and stared at the amazing chocolate fountain until my panties got wet!  Then I thought, \"hey, I'm just ogling chocolate when I could be eating chocolate!\"  Duh.  Didn't get the chance to try the gelato (next time!) but the pastries are tres magnificent.  The pain au chocolat and a house coffee are the perfect things to have at the Bellagio to start your day of gambling, shopping, people watching, etc.  I will return!"}
{"text":"This place was my Las Vegas savior.  All I sought was a decent breakfast....   At my mid-level accommodations, connected to low-priced dining and shopping, a good breakfast was HARD to find. Imagine my joy when I happened upon Jean Philippe Patisserie while wandering hungrily through the Aria. The aromas of fresh coffee and hot breakfast sandwiches, the visual of pastries, sweets and chocolates.... All flavors of danish were fabulous.  As were the apple blintzes.  It only offers counter service, but the quality of fare atones for it.  Sitting aside the casino, you can pass some time watching those few stragglers at the tables who never quite made it to bed the night before as you sip your morning latte. Nice to have a favorite breakfast spot in the City of Sin. (named for its sinfully good desserts, maybe?)"}
{"text":"The prices are pretty high for desserts but oh well as long as its good.   The cherry cheesecake is my favorite not toooo sweet and just right. Not to thick either. the gram cracker on the bottem is very good too. And the chocolate shell around the cheesecake is so good as well.   The service is whatever, the workers seems so bleh being there. LOL"}
{"text":"Once again, our last stop in our Aria foodie crawl.  We couldn't come up with another place for dessert and I thought we'd give this place another try.  This time it was much more crowded.    We opted for crepes and I got in the very long crepe line.  My husband wandered off and then came back to tell me that he already ordered our crepes at the cashier.  Ok.  So basically order whatever you want anywhere.  Good to know.  I got the bananas fosters crepe, which was ok.  Not as much caramel as I like.  I also got more of their fancy herbal tea.  I think the brand is Tea Leaves.  The chamomile tea is very good.  I'm smelling the package it came in right now... so good.  Once again, slightly disappointed.  Maybe I'm just too full by the time I make it here.  Plus the haphazard ordering system stresses me out. Next time, gelato!"}
{"text":"$19 for 2 cups of ice cream and berry crepe. I wish they had coconut and smaller portions."}
{"text":"Wow! Best espresso gelato i have had in my life! Cool chocolate fountain and i would really like to try there crepes! Whenever i come to Bellagio this place is a must!"}
{"text":"The crepes and pastries here are sooo delicious but I must take one star off for very rude service.   Cashier at the crepe ordering area was very. Rude and unfriendly and when I asked if the vegetarian crepe had onions he said no! Of course at the station where another employee makes it it turned out the veggie mix they use is like 75% onion ugh wtf! Luckily that employee was nice enough to substitute something else for me but really?"}
{"text":"Vegas is about excess. Since gambling and drinking aren't my thing, I think I've done well for myself with a superior vice. Sometimes this causes concern.   Take, for example, the following exchange, which I vaguely recall. him: I think I've just witnessed the peak of your sugar addiction. me: Babe... him: I've never seen someone eat so much sugar at once. me: Well, honey... him: I'm worried you might need an insulin shot after this.  And so my concerned trauma-nurse darling began to monitor my health following a take-no-prisoners sugar episode. Hazelnut gelato paired with a chocolate crepe left my hands shaky, sticky and guilty.   I quietly whipped out my hand sanitizer following the massacre. him: There's nothing that can wash this off your hands. me:  :( him: Nothing.  It was wise for them to have put the chocolate fountain behind glass. I could have easily sat in it facing upwards, thereby pronouncing the chocolate in the fountain inedible by all others. The boy got a cheesecake pastry, which I later lit candles around in worship.   Eventually it all became clear. him: I'm dating a junkie. me: Yeah."}
{"text":"Excellent desserts here. Unless you get something truly exotic, you will not be disappointed. They do everything very well.  During our last visit to Las Vegas, Super Bowl weekend, the wife went and picked out four desserts. I enjoyed all of them. There was a key lime tart, and an assortment of other chocolate-based options. Because I was not at the counter with her, I can't tell you exactly what they were. I can tell you, though, that my palate was extremely happy with the items she brought back to the table.   Win."}
{"text":"Wow..This place is so cool!! That chocolate fountain was huge and the inside was really beautiful! The dessert was really really good!! Minus 1 star for the rude girl who was working."}
{"text":"Anytime of the year I visit, Jean Philippe Patiserie never ceases to amaze me!  They are brilliant at what they do, and their ideas are so exciting and new..they are constantly \"wowing\" people taking pictures with their cake designs, and scrumptious desserts.   I always find myself strolling in here \"just to look\" at what they have to offer, but end up leaving with bag fulls..they look too good to pass up!  Below are a list of things I've gotten from here (Some multiple times.. too irresistible!)  Medium Box of Chocolates $56.25 without tax included (25 pieces)   It's assorted, so \"Flavors may include: Anise, amaretto, banana, caramel, cinnamon, coconut, coffee praline, crispy chocolate, dark chocolate, gianduya, lemon, mint, orange, peanut orange, pistachio, praline, and vanilla rum.\"  Honestly, do yourself a favor and get a box of chocolates! They come in a nice package so it'll also make for a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one!   -Raspberry Candies $15 (6.3 oz.)  \"These hard candies are as refreshing as they are tasty. The bright, slightly tart flavor of raspberry is blended with sugar to create a candy that is delicate yet tangy. These raspberry candies are the perfect balance of tart and sweet.\"   Artisan Jam -Strawberry $12 (8 oz.) \"Each one of these flavorful jams are handmade in small batches ensuring the ultimate in freshness.... Using a high-ratio of fruit, and a low amount of sugar results in a jam that is high in flavor and low on fillers.\"  Pure Wild Flower Honey $12 (8.5 oz.) \"These honeys' are carefully hand-packed to ensure the utmost in flavor preservation. Aromatic wild flower hone is a delightful addition to any baked good or cup of tea.\"  Caramel Popcorn $9.95 (7 oz.) \"This classic American snack is the perfect compliment of sweet and salty. Light, fluffy kernels of popcorn are covered with a thin caramelized sugar coating...\"  -Key Lime $7.57 w. tax included Key Lime Emulsion, Almond Dough, Whipped Cream   -Rose Macaroon Raspberry Macaroon, Rose Infused Cream, Fresh Raspberries $7.57 w. tax included  -Raspberry Tart Raspberry, Pistachio Cream  $7.57 w. tax included  -Strawberry Tart  Mousseline Cream, Almond Macaroon, Almond Biscuit  $7.57 w. tax included  -Raspberry Napoleon  Fresh Raspberries, Vanilla Cream, Puff Pastry Dough  $7.57 w. tax included  *We've also gotten a box of French Macaron's to enjoy when we got back home... but they were quite brittle so I'm not sure if maybe we waited too long? I don't recall the price but I believe it was roughly $16 for the box if my memory serves me right.   On a side note, the JPP at the Bellagio has a floor-to-ceiling chocolate fountain that's been certified by the Guiness World Records as the worlds largest chocolate fountain! (But sorry, before you bring your own strawberries... it's glass enclosed!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a light breakfast, and were pleasantly surprised!  We shared a mushroom omelette, which was excellent. It came with a small skewer of fruit, which we unfortunately had to throw out, as a fruit fly landed on it after we sat down.  I had a caffe latte, which was good.  The cheese danish we shared was also good.  We will definitely return if we we stay in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"We stopped here for gelato, and were very happy!  We ordered the mixed berry and the chocolate in a two-scoop cup, and it was a great place to take a break to sit and people watch."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Bellagio, my husband has to have his gelato!  He says there is no better than the Jean Philippe Patisserie (Bellagio and Aria).  Since we stayed here 3 days, he must have come for gelato at least twice a day!  As I don't really have a sweet tooth, I didn't make as many trips down as he did.    At times, I don't feel like going to a restaurant.  So we came here for snacks or late night bite.  Over our stay, we had purchased, the Trio Mini Sandwiches which were all delicious.  Chocolate Croissant was incredible!  We had several sandwiches with coffee/tea and every single time was fresh and delicious!   Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Since we were staying at Aria, we came here every day for my roasted hazelnut gellato.  I love that the flavor never changes and it's pure perfection!  If you ask for water when you place an order, they give you the bottle for free!  I also had gotten croissant ham & cheese sandwich and chocolate chip croissant which were also perfection!  The coffee is incredible as well.  LOVE this place and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Note - This review is for their crepe.  Not their pastries or deserts.  I stumbled across Jean Philippe while searching for breakfast.  I was staying at Vdara, but found that their quick breakfast place had a really long line.  Since I was in a bit of a hurry, I decided to cross the walkway over to the Bellagio and search out some food next door.  Jean Philippe was the first place open and the line wasn't too long.  Since it was around 8:30 AM, I didn't get a chance to try any of their deserts.  And since I prefer savory breakfast to sweet breakfast, I went with their turkey and cheese crepe.  As far a crepes go it was good but nothing mind blowing.  In other words, it got the job done but I don't need to go out of my way to come back anytime soon.  I actually had a much better crepe back at the Paris Hotel and Casino several years back, who knows if that place is even open anymore."}
{"text":"I have such a big sweet tooth so I was glad this was downstairs from my hotel room.   The display of this establishment is beautiful! There are intricately decorated cakes and chocolates everywhere. They have a broad selection of pastries, gelato and crepes. I most recently tried their Apple Sensation crepe with Creme Brulee ice cream and it is to die for."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Pricey too. Crepes (sweet and savoury), various cakes and desserts and surprisingly decent coffee too. Oh and the world's biggest chocolate fountain too.   Very limited seating, and the queue system is confusing as a result it can take a while to get served.  Had stayed in the Bellagio and ended up visiting multiple times. The snickers cake was particularly interesting!"}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful dessert place! Every dessert is so intricately decorated--it's almost too pretty to eat!! I ordered the rose macaroon and chocolate mousse. Both were SOOOOOOO perfect and delicious!! The rose macaroon even had a sugar rose petal on it! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Long line in morning but food was good. I especially liked their yogurt parfait and quiche. They also have amazing desserts and pastries. More reasonable grab and go option for breakfast than a sit down. Free cover in tower suites helped keep breakfast under $30."}
{"text":"+ Sweet Crepe +/- Tiramisu - Wait/line/ordering system   Their sweet crepes here are delicious, a good balance in flavor and not cloyingly sweet to the point of cavity inducing. We got the chocolate crepe with the brownies on top and it was delicious! The crepe batter was made just right to make it fluffy and smooth.   Feeling rather ambitious and also hankering for sweets we ordered the Tiramisu. I'm a little torn on it. It doesn't have the strong rum or coffee flavoring Tiramisu is known for. But it felt more like a chocolate based Tiramisu so I was a little disappointed. It was a good little treat. However I think I would turn to other shops for their Tiramisu if you're looking for something less chocolate and more coffee/rum based.   One thing I wish they could change is how they have their lines or ordering system. We didn't realize there were actually two lines the outer closest to the walkway is more for gelato, the inner one is primarily other sweets and can include gelato orders. When we first walked up it looked like one large line that wrapped around. Until someone pointed out two lines and another register. I think signs or even ropes would help keep the line from going down the hallway. It can get crowded here with the foot traffic, in addition to the line, and those waiting for crepes to be made it is confusing.   I would definitely come again for their sweet crepes, and I'll update my review once I get to try a savory. Until next time Bellagio!"}
{"text":"The best dessert I have had. I had the caramelized banana crepe and it was perfection. The flavours were bold and well balanced. I also added nutella to it and so it tasted even yummier. the crepe were soft and fuffy and very tasty. If you are in Vegas and are in a mood to indulge your sweet tooth, then this is the place you should eat at."}
{"text":"Of course they have an awesome chocolate fountain! That's Vegas for ya! Every luxury on steroids.  I've had a cookie or a truffle everyday this week and everything was delicious.  The Madeline cookie was big in size but a little dry. The coconut macaroon was chewy goodness and not too sweet. I like that it was not tooth achingly sweet. The cognac truffles are the winner. I love cognac and the flavor really carries through the dark chocolate. Take more than a box to go or you'll regret it."}
{"text":"I have a serious sugar tooth! So bad that I have to go on sugar detox to stop myself from eating chocolate all the time  Was around Bellagio's indoor Chinese gardens and saw this place on yelp. The ratings and a sudden craving for crepes tempted me to try it out. I should have gone with my initial choice and ordered chocolate but I decided to venture out and try the 'exotic' crepes which includes mango purée topping and coconut gelato. The gelato was really delish but the crepe lacked the ZING factor and as soon as I bit into it I wanted chocolate. What can I say?! The place is super tempting though with displays of baked goods and chocolates. Oh and the cappuccino was pretty good but again, nothing to write home about. And yes all this and a glass of coke cost me $20 so pretty expensive. Then again, it's the Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Super yummy, super busy, super pricey! What can you say you are paying for the name, but it is worth every penny! We ordered the Nutella muffin and sticky bun, which you'll need a bib for. The coffee was ok, I'll still go back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this branch and the one at the Bellagio. The treats here are very delicious. The only thing that really stops me from getting more is the prices. I've never tried their sandwiches and things like that. Just desserts and sweets. It can get crowded here so don't be surprised."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the vege omelet (with mushrooms and wheat bread) and chocolate French crepe for breakfast. Both of those two are delicious. Also, the chocolate lava fountain is really amazing. However, the service is a little slow, especially in the morning, as there are too many people waiting in the line. What's more, the food is a little expensive and not enough to eat, but we did not care that too much, considering that people usually don't eat a lot in breakfast."}
{"text":"Don't get anything other than the displayed baked goods/pastries. Really nice croissants and cakes but the hot food/breakfast is just gross. The coffee is also pretty weak.   Line up is very long around 7am as well so come early or later!   I had their breakfast sandwich, which was 3 slices of square bread (why?!) and a weirdly shaped cylinder of egg in the very middle."}
{"text":"Saw this place while exploring the Aria resort with some friends/family and some people in my party decided to go ahead and try their crepes. I tried my sister's strawberry w/ nutella crepe and it was great! It really tasted fresh and rich in flavor.  You can even see them making everything from scratch right in front of you. The bakery is well decorated and extremely clean, with a good amount of seats. However, for a Saturday morning, it was extremely crowded. The servers were kind though, and managed to serve the customers in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"This review is for the gelato. One scoop $3.75, two scoops $5.75, additional scoops $2 each. However each scoop was about the equivalent of two scoops, so at least we experienced a generously portioned two scoop order that we could barely finish. Not only that but the per scoop price was 50 cents less than what we'd seen at the Bellagio.  We tried the hazelnut and the pistachio. I would recommend the hazelnut and the chocolate! None were the best gelato we'd ever had, but it hit the spot after hoofing it for a few hours. Seating can be a bit tight given they have so many things to offer there but once seated it was comfortable.   Very recommended! We'll be back."}
{"text":"You can't walk by Jean Philippe and not get drawn in by the gorgeous display of pastries. While this location may not have the world's largest chocolate fountain like at the Bellagio, I kinda like it better because it's less crowded - which means a shorter wait and they're less likely to be sold out of anything! Plus, the menu and selections at both locations are identical.  During our last day in Vegas, my friends and I decided to get some pastries at JP. We went to the original location at the Bellagio first and I got a bunch of pastries there. However, they were out of croissants! Fortunately, when we went to check out Aria I saw that this location still had plenty. While my friends went to gamble, I went to get (more) pastries. Hey, you risk losing when you gamble; with pastries, you always win!  I totally got suckered by the irresistible displays and ended up buying a lot more pastries than I could finish, even with the help of my friends. (Food seems to have some type of mystical power over me.) I got a palmier, apple brioche, croissant (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=2KjxGRE16UT4LSBsq5lSsA), apple turnover, nutella brioche, and almond brioche (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5bmpGbzPd-gfcUl6o5j7FQ&select=_5qyR-nH5KbGQOnvAYxuNg). They were on the pricey side - I'd never spent so much money on pastries! All were delicious, but my favourites were the apple turnover and almond brioche.   We didn't finish it all so I took the leftovers to go in a box, which I carried around with me all day long. Unfortunately, I left the box in the cab to the airport. Epic FAIL on my part :( I got really pouty and my friend said she'd never seen me look so sad..."}
{"text":"I don't mind being charged $11 for a TINY tuna panini sandwich here.  First, allow me to describe what it looks like.  The entire sandwich is less than a foot long and is very light in weight, it's cut in half prior to serving, so it looks even smaller.  It isn't overflowing with meats or veggies.  One glance, and you'd think for $11, that I was a sucker.  But I'm not a sucker.  The flavors.  MAN OH MAN.  The FLAVORS.  TASTY MUCH?  Why all the sudden weird looks from passerby's?  Is there a piece of basil on my chin?  Sauce on my cheek?  Or is it because of the way my facial expression morphs into a kinky \"O-face\" every time I bite into that sandwich?  And the way my body slumps into the chair as I groan and writhe from culinary pleasure?  My think my head is GOING TO EXPLODE.  Their tuna panini was so good that this is where I'd go EVERYTIME I had hunger pangs during my most recent stay at Bellagio.  Good thing they don't close shop until midnight (although I'd prefer it open 24/hours!).  It's funny because I was so enamored with this little sandwich during my stay that I failed to order anything else here.  Next time, I'll be trying out one of their pastry desserts, breakfast items, and gelato.  By the looks of satisfaction on all the other paying customers who were snapping up the sweets, I could tell I'm in for more awkward orgasm-faces during future visits to Jean Philippe Patisserie.  Anyway, a little bit more about the place itself:  Jean Philippe Patisserie is tucked into a small esplanade that connects the Conservatory Gardens greenhouse to the resort's convention areas.  Walking up to it is a treat in itself...its main focal point is what Bellagio bills the \"world's tallest chocolate fountain.\"  It's a sight to behold...a massive floor-to-ceiling high fountain system enclosed in glass featuring  flowing white and dark chocolate from multiple dripping points.  Then of course, there are all the elaborately created desserts showcased  behind glass that look more like conversation art pieces than sweets meant to be eaten.  The pair of cartoonish looking giant 4-foot tall rabbits adorning the central work counter in their \"kitchen\"?  Yeah.  Both completely made out of chocolate.  So if you're passing through Bellagio or are staying as a guest, please, I urge you to stop by and pick yourself up one of their many choice gourmet sandwiches (along with some gelato or dessert too).  For $11, you get $75 worth of flavor."}
{"text":"I was actually in search for a restroom when I found this place by mistake, it has been the best decision of my life. Every now and then when I am looking for restroom i'm over joyed with the possibility of finding more delicious bakeries!  I personally had the creme bruhlee, the napoleon, as well as the fruit tart and they were all delicious. The price is a bit high but this dessert will taste good even after a few hours of travel if you are planning to it bring someone who won't believe how good it is."}
{"text":"A must go EVERY time I'm in Vegas! My favorite is the Nutella crepe! I had the savory Italian crepe before and got it this trip and it was a disappointment  didn't taste how I remembered but still 5 stars because you can't go wrong with the sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"Me and my gf were walking all over LV needed to take a break really badly.  After passing other Jean Philippe Patisserie's and seeing all the long lines.  We stopped and saw that this line wasn't as long, we asked the person that was putting in more pastries out and asked for her recommendations, it was the creme brule with dark chocolate and we also had one of the gelato.  It was dam good!!! Now I know why so many people had to wait in line."}
{"text":"Their desserts , pastries & sandwiches are to die for. So decadent & rich high quality ingredients used. Always come here for a quick bite or dessert! Pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing largest chocolate fountain in the world. Sculpted desserts-beautiful"}
{"text":"This is a fancy, pricey bakery located in the Bellagio. They have a huge chocolate fountain on display and entombed in a glass case. They told me they change the chocolate every 6 months to a year (clearly it's not for eating) and it's pretty neat to look at. They have gelato, pastries, and chocolate. I ordered 2 cheese danishes and an almond chocolate croissant and both were pretty amazing. The cheese danishes tasted better heated so ask them to heat it for you and enjoy! Parking is free under 60 minutes in the parking garage so be quick with it."}
{"text":"Review: 3.5 stars  I read great reviews about this bakery on Yelp, so I had to try it. The line is always busy and a bit unorganized. The desserts and pastries looked delicious! My hubby and I had a snack around 4pm. We tried two pastries: sugar and apple brioche. The pastries weren't bad, but you could tell that they were sitting out all day. It was a bit sweet, and I don't know if they are worth $4 each.  If I come back, I'll try the crepes since everyone raves about them.   This place opens late, so you can definitely come back for a late snack."}
{"text":"That dessert was good but all the tables where dirty and I had to clean it my self before sitting down but if you are looking for a quick snack stop by."}
{"text":"I ordered the souffle crepe. Nothing special about the SOUFFLE crepe. They just add some vanilla creme to make it puff up a little. I had the berries one and my cousin had the exotic fruit. If you wanna try something tropical go for the exotic one, but it's very sweet. The berries were just okay. I added a scoop of gelato which just melted onto the side of the crepe. When I picked up my order, it didn't look thattttttttttttttttt yummy. Although my friends who saw my pictures thought it looked realllly good. My crepe came out to be 12 dollars or so. The extra scoop of gelato was an extra 2 dollars or something. Not really worth it, filling though. I want to go back and try the cakes!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, you come across a dish that was so good, you almost want to change your dining plans for the rest of the day so that you can go back and eat it again.  I had that moment on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  I had walked through the Aria hotel and casino many times before.  And everytime, I had walked by the Jean Philippe Patisserie and admired its lavish cakes on display.  But I had never eaten there until a couple weekends ago when I went to Vegas for a bachelor party.  On one of the fateful mornings of the trip, we decided to go to the Aria to have breakfast, and at the recommendation of my friends, I ordered the Smoked Salmon Sandwich.  It was hands down, one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever eaten.  The smoked salmon almost melted in my mouth.  The dills and and mayonnaise gave the sandwich an excting and flavorful profile.  The egg on the sandwich added a protein balance to the salmon while making it a delicious brunch entree.  And the sweet bun was one of the greatest breads I've ever tasted.  I kid you not, when I say that later that day, I almost wanted to cancel my other dining plans to go back and eat this sandwich again.  I plan to eat this sandwich at least once a day from now on, anytime I'm in sin city."}
{"text":"Tonight I had a lovely experience:)  My family was visiting from out of town and they wanted to see The fountains at the Bellagio and the Botanical gardens. It was a little after 11pm when we rushed into the Bellagio to only find out that they were taking down the gardens and we had just missed the fountain show, so we had to wait a little bit for the next one.   I literally booked it over to check the deserts because they have one of my favorite key lime tarts. As I went and scurried around the glass case to only see almost all the pastries gone.  ***insert sad face here,lol*** I pick my head up and the gentleman standing by the door saw that I was frantically looking for something. He asked me if I needed help and I told him that I was looking for key lime tarts. He smiled and said that he had it and also suggested the strawberry lemon eclair. I got 2 tarts and the eclair. He smiled again said, I'll pack that for you.   The cashier was great! She rang me up and I was on my way to catch the next show!   The tarts were perfect! This time around it had teardrop shaped key lime cream on top as well as a passion fruit flavor and slivers of white chocolate on top. The tart crust was perfection. Make sure you get a little bit of every flavor in your bite for a explosion of delicious-ness in your mouth! Haha  The eclair was delicious as well. Different from the normal chocolate & Bavarian cream I'm used to. The eclair is topped with white chocolate pieces which I took off and It tastes even better without all that extra stuff. You're able to taste the strawberry & lemon flavor. Yum!  I will say it is a little on the pricer side but we are in a strip hotel, so be ready to fork out a little more than usual. For me, definitely worth it. Definitely my treat to myself when I do make my way down there.   Thank you to the gentleman who made my night by helping me!"}
{"text":"Coffee here was aiiite! about 3 bucks for a small cup.  The macarons and lil dessert pieces were delicious! I recommend the hazelnut square."}
{"text":"I'm a local Las Vegan and Jean Philippe is my favorite place to get breakfast.  I love their sticky buns which none can ever compare to.  You have to get there early, like before 9am to beat long lines and get one before they've run out."}
{"text":"mouth watering desserts displayed nicely as you wait in line... everything looked sooo delicious! if i can i would get everything!!  the savory turkey crepe never fails. it's warm, fresh, cheesy, and soft as you take in each bite. wash it down with a warm cup of flavorful coffee. top it off with a dessert pastry.   i recently tried the BIG sized rose flavored macarron. it was huge, i didn't really know if i wanted to tackle it with a fork or with my hands! the middle was  creamed filled with raspberries all around. mouth watering.  i never miss this when i'm in vegas..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Especially this one at the Aria, mostly because of the arrangement of the place. It has a cute sitting area that allows for casual talks and people watching. Unlike other locations, you don't have to search for a place to snack on your delicious treat.  They have everything here. And I mean everything. Sandwiches, desserts, coffee, etc. I've had one of their paninis, the banana foster crepe, dulce de leche gellato, coffee and I don't have a single negative thing to say.  If you like sweets and desserts (and taking photographs of desserts, like me) then you'll love it here. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No..just no..no no no  Let me count the ways.  Service..not friendly..not Vegas like..not righr..theae people need to smile once  Lines. .long long long..very long Prices. .expected ly highy..7 dollars for pastry.. Seating..tight..rushed..exposed... Now Flavir...poor..these gorgious deliciously decorated little pieces of eye candy need to taste more than the promise they offer..

Ok...but..I am a pastry snob"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous to the waistline. Yuuuuuummmmmmmmy. Too much to choose from and almost too pretty to eat."}
{"text":"Indulge in the best chocolate flavors, surrounded by extravagant cakes and over the top pastries.   Everything at Jean Philip looks out of magazine spread or a tv show. From macarons to personal cakes, sandwiches to crepes, hot chocolates or a simple cupcake. If you are in Vegas you have to take time and check out the place.   The variety of chocolate is huge. There's almost anything you can think of and the prices are not bad.   The flavors are strong though and if you get a few pastries you won't be able to finish them unless you have something salty to neutralize your taste buds from the sweet."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Aria and definitely enjoyed having this inside the hotel (especially open 24/7). The ham and cheese croissant was delicious! Only complaint was the middle wasn't hot. However they heat it up didn't get all of it. Even so, it was amazing and I would have eaten another the same way. Haha"}
{"text":"From all the reviews and hype I somehow expected this place to be really big, but it's not. It's the size of a thumb!  The first night, I tried the carrot cake because it looked absolutely beautiful and a Yelper below raved about it. Really, Courtney E? Maybe the quality control isn't great here, but this cake was not even *good*. I mean, it tasted like my 8th grade [public school] cafeteria. The carrot figurine was made with something nasty like fondant, or oh maybe cardboard. The white chocolate was sickeningly sweet, and the carrot cake center was way too rich. Cheesecake frosting was all right.   I went back the next night (some people go to Vegas to party, I go to eat whatever not-disgusting things I can find, OKAY?) and got the gelato. Now we're talking! It feels so wrong for gelato to be that good. The dulce de leche is truly amazing, perfect balance of creamy and caramel-y, and the mango sorbet is fantastically bursting with mango flavor.  Bought a small box of truffles to take home (to the boyfriend who hates me. After falling off my bike and getting scraped up, I received not sympathy but \"Why are you such a pussy?\") Now I understand where Jean Philippe earns his reputation. Such chocolate, with perfect flavors like rich pistachio and smooth coconut. My only ask is that they make them with dark chocolate (although I suppose you have to sell to stupid tourists, because why would anyone truly cool spend their free time & money going to Vegas?)"}
{"text":"Presentation of this store is excellent! I always love coming here and watching the chocolate fountain.  Excellent customer service is offered by the staff and LOVE their tiramisu gelato."}
{"text":"Gotta love the beautiful and mesmerizing chocolate fountain at the entrance! The staff were very helpful and accommodating. Our cashier was cool, talked story with us, and let me order a crepe in the gelato line which saved me time. The crepe was delicious and light and the mint chocolate chip ice cream was just sweet enough and very creamy. Loved that I got chocolate in every bite."}
{"text":"Desserts are too damn pretty to eat!  Take a picture and enjoy."}
{"text":"Not great at all. Expect better from a French patisserie! I was in Vegas for 4 days for work and tried all kinds of pastries and a dessert. The coffee is barely as mediocre as Starbucks, the pastries range from bad to ok. The chocolate raspberry dessert was not bad, but not wow either."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place. The dessert display is spectacular - I only wish I had a chance to try one of their desserts, but I came here both mornings while staying at the Bellagio and had the most amazing chocolate and almond croissants and a cheese danish. Coffee was very good too.  The line was a little long in the morning, as only one register was open, but it is definitely worth the wait.  All other food looked great too."}
{"text":"This place is magical.. the boyfriend and I visited on our trip last weekend, and were very delighted.   Obviously this shop has many over priced packaged candies and chocolates, but the freshly made tarts and treats are only about $6.50, and they're definitely filling! They also have a wide variety of tasty, creamy gelato to choose from too (also reasonably priced.)  The boyfriend got \"Intense\" which was a dark chocolate mousse covered in a dark chocolate ganache. Oooh divine! There's nothing bad to say about this. At all. Ever.   I got the Key Lime Tart. It had a white chocolate top, with some kind of lime flavored whipped cream, and tangy/sweet lime curd, and at the bottom was a shortbread cookie.   I strongly suggest if you have a sweet tooth, and are looking for something exquisite, try and stop by here on your trip to Vegas.  (Did i mention the gigantic waterfall of chocolates? It's beautiful!)"}
{"text":"I give this place a 4.5 star based on service and food.  One night after watching the show at Aria my friends and I decided lets go get a crepe cause it looks so good. Of course, I shared mine with my friend because it was really big and with lots of fruits (we ordered a berry one). We had our whip substituted with lemon sorbet. It was so good and it went great with the berry crepe. We watch them make it right in front of our eyes.   The place was really nice looking. Made me want everything there but I know I have my limits on sweets and food. hehe. I would probably be a fatty if I eat everything there.   Reason to why I didn't give my full 5 star rating because their service didn't wow me. A smile makes a huge difference to me. Saying thank you and not mean it means nothing to me. So ya.   I would totally come back if I'm in Vegas to try out their other stuff and I would totally suggest others to come. It's really good. The crepe alone doesn't taste like much but with the fillings on top it's awesome."}
{"text":"Arriving at 10:00 AM meant about a 20 minute wait. The patisserie has two sides, and we selected the side with crepes (always a good choice ). Our order was to go, which, at a time with peak traffic, seemed like the only option, since tables were few and far between. Overall ambience-(clean and well-lit, but few tables). Our service was great-quick and helpful. I ordered the berry crepe, and we split a blueberry muffin. The berry crepe was good-tart and tasty berries and a well-made crepe. The muffin was good, not great. The prices are exorbitant, and the quality was good but not worth the price. If the line were shorter and the prices were lower, I could give this a higher star count."}
{"text":"Vil took me around the corner from the gardens to see the World Largest Chocolate Waterfall. I didn't believe it but it was there. Milk Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, and White Chocolate all flowing. It was gorgeous! It made me want to shower in chocolate. It also a cute little bakery and with all different cakes and breads too. Overall out of all the cakes I love the cupcake ones with different characters. They had a Hello Kitty one with all her friends on each cupcake. Its so cute! Would love to come back and eat one of the desserts or sammies here."}
{"text":"What to say about Jean Philipe?   This place know how to do it. From the croissant to the cheesecake it's all delicious. This place is a little expensive but you will have a great experience.  Bon appétit !"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there, the service is inefficient, the setup is done in such a way that you have to wait forever at one cashier while others are empty, but since you can't see it, you just wait (it took me 20 Minutes to get my order or a few pastries and coffee). The staff is so unwelcoming, they have to be trained to be rude, even by French standards. The croissant, chocolate croissant and almond croissant were good but nothing out of this world. The americano was ok and the hot chocolate was bad (mostly hot water with a slight taste of chocolate). If you're looking for a pleasant experience, go somewhere else. If you're motivated you can stay for the pastries."}
{"text":"The huge chocolate fountain caught my eye. I came here and got banana gelato which was creamy and tasty. I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ate a two scoop gelato. Delicious after meal dessert if you are not satisfied with expensive five dining restaurant desserts. Also, won't break the bank too much.   One should learn to sample a few before making your selection. My combo of coconut/cappuccino turned out better than I expected."}
{"text":"It's beyond me how any reviewer can give this place anything less than five stars. Everything from their chocolates, cakes, crepes, and ice cream to their sandwiches and coffee is simply incredible. You'd be hard pressed to find an equivalent or better of it's kind anywhere."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is perfection."}
{"text":"As someone who hardly ever desires crepes, I figured Jean could be the one to persuade me. They offer both sweet and savory options with a huge pastry and gelato section. My bf and I decided to order two savory crepes and gelato for dessert.  Smoked Salmon -- Their most popular option that's stuffed with pico de gallo, asparagus, spinach, and smoked salmon with a caper aioli. The savory crepe batter is a little different and tastes like it contains wheat. We thought the first few bites were yummy but quickly got over it. The pico de gallo was also too spicy for me :(  Chicken -- Tasted like one of my deconstructed chicken wraps except they're chipotle sauce is note. Simple option and chicken wasn't dry.  Their pastry selection was beautiful yet expensive! We also thought the gelato was only okay but at least they offer white chocolate cones. We probably won't come back because the crepes aren't worth $13 each. Maybe they're dessert crepes are better.."}
{"text":"Ordered an Omlette and my coffee was cold by the time it was ready. Don't bother, wasn't worth the wait"}
{"text":"I visited twice during my stay in Las Vegas, and I must say how much I love the desserts!   I tried the gelato In cookies and cream, tiramisu, chocolate, dulce de leche and all were delicious! I also had the creme brûlée which the custard was soooo good!"}
{"text":"Excellent panini! I recommend the prosciutto and tuna melt- delicious and super satisfying. There's usually a line, but it goes through quickly. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the blueberry cupcake. Beautiful and delicious. Time stopped as I ate it.  For the nondairy folks out there, they will also put soy milk in your latte for no extra charge. Considering how expensive their lattes are, this is good. they use Pacific Soy Blenders.   we also had the raspberry macaron sandwich thing. Beautiful but a macarons are way too sweet for me and this was no exception.  The Jean Phillippe at the Aria is better than the one at the Bellagio because it has more seating and seems to have more selection."}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with JPP. They serve the best Gelato I've ever had outside of Europe, but I hate the fact I can't stop myself from making multiple trips (sometimes twice a day!) there whenever I'm in Vegas.    It's a great place to grab a snack whenever. Good variety of pastries, Crepes and of course, Gelato. They also offer a large variety of pre-packaged goods should you choose to take some with you when you leave (the peanut butter chocolate spread is exceptional!). There's always a line but it moves pretty quickly.   Pastries are $5-$8, Gelatos are $5 per cup (very generous portion). Favorite flavors are Mango and Pistachio.   As expected, I am now craving for their Gelato."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place the last couple of times that I have been to the Aria Hotel, but I just did not have the time to stop and get a few things.   So, today was the day I decided to check this place out.  As I walked in, the deserts were so beautifully presented that I just had to stop and drool.  So, finally after 10 minutes of carefully checking out each item, I decided to get the vanilla flan, tutti fruiti, chocolate intense, coconut macaroon and chocolate, coconut macaroon.  The vanilla flan was awesome, the vanilla flavor was intense and delicious.  The tutti fruitti is fiiled with a lemon mousse and topped with strawberries......very light and super tasty.  The chocolate intense is a chocoate covered chocolate mousse, topped with a chocolate macaroon....sooooo yummy.  Bottom line, if you enjoy awesome sweets, you must check this place out."}
{"text":"Five starts for the best tiramisu gelato I have ever tasted, and I've had a lot. Creamy, decadent bliss. The place is beautiful with stunning cakes and of course the huge chocolate fountain. I would eat every meal here if I weren't concerned about fitting into my britches."}
{"text":"It's cool to see the chocolate fountain. I had a key lime tart, which was pretty and tasty, but also a bit difficult to eat due to the soft mousse and hard crust and garnish.   It is pretty expensive though"}
{"text":"It has decent stuff but overpriced in my mind. I know its Vegas and its in a hotel and it's famous but still."}
{"text":"I come here just for the macaroons. Due to my lack of ability to make these at home (and god have I tried). I come here for my fix. I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't so freaking expensive.  So until I master the art of macaroons in my kitchen, I'll save up for these little gems here!"}
{"text":"High quality latte. I had the hot mocha latte and it was a such a delicious drink from the first drink! It was rich in flavor but not overwhelming. The cafe seating is plentiful. The only problem with the location with me is that it is inside the casino without windows to the outside but it is actually still quite the scene, even on this Monday afternoon."}
{"text":"So they serve super hot crepes/omelettes straight on plastic plates!!!! No paper or any kind of protection between the hot food that goes straight into your body and that plastic plate that's about to melt and hence releases all sorts of toxins (Phthalates , BPA, to name a few) into your food. That's a big no no Jean Philippe and you know it. Also, ironically, they are decorated with all these fresh colorful fruits including oranges around their serving counter yet they do not serve fresh squeezed orange juice! Haha. Pretentious? I say yes. Who serves sugary O.J. from concentrate nowadays.. besides McDonalds that is? These guys do. And to make matters worse, they ony have 2 people preparing all the omlettes and crepes on a busy Sunday morning. Our order took 45 minutes to get ready. Good luck."}
{"text":"Delicious paninis!   We tried a prosciutto/mozzarella and the tandoori chicken. The sandwiches could have been a tad lighter on sauce but overall had a good ratio of fillings to bread. The top layer of bread was crispy but the bottom was kind of soggy due to the heavy saucing.  The desserts looked yummy but we were too stuffed. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My quintessential \"Happy Place\". Quite unfortunate that this is NOT my neighborhood bakery! :-("}
{"text":"This is probably, by far, the best feature Aria has had. This is also right next to the guest elevators, why HELLO THERE!   I don't know too much of their candy and pastries, and although this place does not boast the awe-inspiring chocolate fountains like the one in Bellagio does, it certainly has a large lounge area with interesting and bizarre but very attractive designs and architecture inlays.   I need not speak more for their crepes but they're so. good. I can't stress this enough. Yes you're probably over paying by a few bucks but you probably shouldn't have this all the time anyway for your cholesterol sake and ... it's Vegas!  Delicious crepes, friendly staffers, lots of room to chill. Perfect in the vastly improvement needed Aria."}
{"text":"the little cakes looked amazing.  they were so pretty i didn't want to eat it.  It pains me when that plastic knife first made contact with the cakes.  We had 3 cakes: -CHOCOBANA -MERINGUE -CARROT CAKE   Taste is ... well, SUGARY!  the carrot cake and chocobana were so sweet that i didn't notice texture and such of the cake.  i had two bites each and they were enough for me. This place would be heaven for those who loves overly sweet goodies.  The only one i was able to enjoy was the lemon meringue. It's the only cake that we were able to finish."}
{"text":"When we were in Vegas this past May I finally got to try this place and I have to say I was a bit disappointed :(  I mean, the prices were higher than normal pastry places because it is in Vegas so I can't really fault them for that. However the pastry and coffee was so mediocre. I had a chocolate cake thing and it was dry as heck!   The only upside to this place was that it is open 24 hours so you can get your sugar fix anytime."}
{"text":"Oh man, we went for the macaroons but stayed for the crepes.   The macaroons are probably some of the best I have ever had, and the crepes are right up there in delishness. I suggest coming here.   Down side, the price and the lines and lack of seating."}
{"text":"I always reward myself after a long run so after a short rest in my hotel room following the half marathon this was the first place I headed to.    Located on the main level of the Bellagio Resort & Casino the little bakery is difficult to miss with scores of interested passers-by stopped in front admiring the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Fwze61auOtWIO7qqZftfoA and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NNY_w4GCH3S7XDDwwT6EMw) as confirmed by the Guinness people.  Many people seemed to focus in on the delicious Santa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=vrgekS99XPXpSALLiAv8hA) too as the bakery is all decked out for the holidays.  Decorations are nice, but my focus of attention went straight to the bakery case because all of the little desserts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=cUvmX9TR0T-SsadcR6CXCw and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=xd8x-dTVzmXltk3mMp2Bow) on display looked fabulous.  They even had sugar-free selections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=OliyqIlWdwkr3ssI_z--Vw)!  Everything looked great, but something else I had glanced at earlier caught my attention first.  At the very front of the bakery behind a sheet of curved plexiglass is a crepe station where you can watch as freshly made crepes are prepared on a hot griddle.  They had two crepes on display, a mixed berries crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Y23VBoGim8Vl8JSUTUQM5w) and a chocolate decadence crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NHqifygfOqSomQpVOprLyQ).  I ordered one of the chocolate ones.  It took a bit of time to be prepared, but the overall product was worth the wait.  The display crepe actually looked better and had a bit more chocolate and a lot more powdered chocolate, but I'm thankful because the crepe I was served was sweet enough.  The chocolate pieces, shavings and glazes were decadent alright and the crepe was nice and chewy.  I didn't eat all the cream as I felt pretty bloated after this dessert.  I didn't stop with the crepe either.  I returned to the counter and ordered a single chocolate-covered strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=S4rtxwJXeLP4BGi5lakoYA) to take with me to eat at a later time.  My strawberry was a bit squished by the time I returned to the hotel, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I had fun licking the chocolate off the side of the bag.  The bakery serves gelato also and has a nice assortment of boxed confections on display.  There are other crepe selections also other than the two that were on display.  Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect reward to an excellent race."}
{"text":"Their extravagant looking confections and pastries have a tendency to draw visitors in.  That was certainly the case several years ago when I visited their location inside the Bellagio.  This was the second time I've stopped at their newer location inside Aria, but this was the first time I purchased something.  While my buddies were losing their hard earned wages on gaming devices and eye-candy dealers I decided to indulge in another sort of eye-candy taking a mid-day break here snapping photos of Christmas themed confections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q) and sitting down with an iced mocha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg) and a slice of cake.  I chose the Opera cake slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA) made up of liqueur-soaked sponge cake, coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache because it seemed like a safer selection than any of the other 20+ varieties of individual cakes, tarts, napoleons and mousses, and I really needed a shot of caffeine from staying up late the previous night and not catching up on my z's in the hours that passed.  I'm normally not a coffee drinker, but I do turn to it rather than to instant energy products.  Maybe because my choice was safe, but the cake slice did not wow me at all.  The flavors all meshed together quite well, but there was no particular component to the dessert that gave it any \"oomph.\"  This was just a sweet slice of cake with, really, nothing special to it.  The cocoa covered truffle that sat atop the cake had an unusually thick shell and the center wasn't as smooth and sensuous as some mass-produced truffles I've sampled.  I actually enjoyed the bitterness and cold from my iced mocha more than I did the cake.  Maybe it was better this way.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas and I walk past their beautiful desserts I know to treat it like I treat other eye candy.  It's better not to sample no matter how delicious or tantalizing they seem to be!"}
{"text":"\"Google Now\" on my phone showed me a 4-star Yelp review, so I went. And I was disappointed. I will try to be specific and not cranky because I see lots of high marks.   Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich for $10 was a bust-- Velveeta? On three slices of Wonder Bread? Gross.  Chocolate croissant-- stale with almost no chocolate.  The ultimate insult-- espresso in a cardboard cup.  Granted, the display cases look magnificent, and maybe the made-to-order crepes are better. But $30 for brekkie for two at what amounts to a school lunch line is a serious no-no."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is full of candy, both for the eyes as well as the stomach.  Equipped with a Crepe station and a glass counter overflowing with what looks to be art more so than food the patisseries are complex and rightly so.  Patisserie is Jean's claim to fame.   I gave JP's 5 stars.  Based not on the crepes, which are great by all accounts, and neither did i give the pastries consideration. These 5 stars are for making what may be the finest Croissant available in France or otherwise AND for selling the finest prosciutto panini I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  Here's the Skinny:  The Croissant : I have had many in my life, most have been pretty good.  I mean it seems a simple item right?  The croissants from JP reminded me that simple is sublime.  The crust was golden, sweet, & crisp.  The inside soft, warm, simple. If JP's was the Matrix the Croissant would named \"Neo\".  The Panini : JP does not make the prosciutto panini that is so, so, worthy of these 5 stars. Truth be told they just throw it on the panini press.  The sandwiches themselves arrive each day from somewhere presumably in the Las Vegas area.  Should I ever find out their origin said companies delivery boy will have an additional stop on his route."}
{"text":"Apple tart. Light, lightly sweet & big! It would have been better heated. Staff very nice. There so many pastries I wish I could try."}
{"text":"Way overrated. Sure our sundae looked cool, but it didn't taste good nor was it worth it's price tag. Employees were very unenthusiastic and slow. Tables were not cleared of trays/trash/peoples leftovers.   Disappointed is all I can really say."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for just dessert and pastries, but hey everything is expensive in Vegas. This location is better than the one at the Bellagio, that one is hard to find and hidden near where all the conference rooms are at. This one is bigger and much easier to find.  Love how they have different stations for everything. I have to admit the pastries, Macarons and other treats are to die for, you can get a crazy sugar rush from just standing in this sugar store. Will definitely be back for more deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is if Augustus Gloop and Willy Wonka's wildest dreams came true.   They have a beautiful chocolate waterfall display with white, milk and dark chocolate.   The desserts are so unique and perfectly done. I had the trio of desserts with the chocolate peanut lollipop, raspberry french macaroon, and a creme brûlée. It was all situated in a block of chocolate. All three were so amazing! Nothing was overly sweet and the chocolate was done to perfection.  Before that though, I had ordered a mocha latte which was yummy.   I also split the vegetable quiche and spinach quiche with my date. They were perfect. Not to salty like some places make it.   This is an amazing spot to hit up if you're in Vegas. At least get a dessert! You'll be thankful you did!  Just warning though, they're a bit steep ($10.50 for the dessert, $6.75 for the large coffee, and about $9 for each quiche). Our breakfast was about $45! Then again, we ordered a lot!   Also, be prepared for it to be VERY popular and for there to be a line.  But trust me, it goes pretty quickly and the staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in line a few minutes if you're getting anything from here.   All the pastries, chocolates, well everything you see looks amazing! I just wanted a quick coffee and almond croissant, the coffee was a bit too hot, if you drink it black like I do you'll have to let it cool off a little before you can drink it. The almond croissant was delicious! If you want anything heated you have to ask, they don't automatically heat them. Everything is premade from what I could tell, and the salads looked really good."}
{"text":"expensive   but   awesome  you   must   try!!! :)"}
{"text":"The quality of the pastry and food here is AH-MAZING for a strip hotel. Everything is great, I especially recommend anything on a croissant and the Nutella donut."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth? Or sweet jaw? Don't forget to stop by  Monsieur Jean's to try at least one feat... or take a pic of the chocolate fountain.   It's a totally casual patisserie you go in and out with pastry in hand and maybe gelato in the other.   I tried their creme brûlée and it made my tummy happy. It was smooth and the caramel at the bottom just ties everything. My only wish is that the vanilla bean would be all through out instead of just the top.   The verdict? Will come back to try some more nomnoms!"}
{"text":"Attention all parents, bring your kids here! Not only is it right next to the botanical garden, but it has a fantastic decor. The ice cream is rich and creamy and the sorbets are tangy and fresh! Given that it's a resort in Vegas, the price is pretty reasonable given the size of the scoop. Plus there are three cones to choose from."}
{"text":"We arrived just as the store was closing and Julius the manager let us through the gate so that we wouldn't walk away disappointed. Even though it was the end of the night, all of the employees were still in good spirits, helpful & patient. It was after closing but they still took the time to describe each dessert. We were fortunate to try the pistachio and chocolate gelato & chocolate cheesecake. The gelato was fresh and flavorful. The chocolate cheesecake was silky and smooth. Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"i couldnt count on how many times have i passed this bakery but never actually give it a visit.. so i decided that i must try some of their stuffs the next time im in vegas.. and i actually did get their creme brule the last time i was in vegas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?select=wvnSdxHYdQxL5zKiInl4Kg#wvnSdxHYdQxL5zKiInl4Kg). i paid about $7.20 including tax for this little dessert.. yes expensive but i wanted to see how good their dessert it.. but to my disappointment, the creme brule taste just average and nothing really special.. i could get the same exact one for half the price and maybe less.. have yet to try their gelato and might get it next time."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because it's a must every time I'm in Vegas! I go to Vegas often, 5-6 times a year with friends and family and I always make sure to come to Jean Philippe! Sometimes their line is a bit backed up or slow, but it's really not their fault as they have a few people making crepes and people ordering 2-5 crepes per person holding up the line. I love their lemon sugar crepe, very plain but just the perfect amount of sweetness and you really get to taste the quality and art of the crepe itself rather than overpowering it with nutella (which is also good, don't get me wrong). I love their Italian crepe on the savory side, absolutely delicious! Every time I come I also always get a few jars of their hard candy. Violette (lavender), Orange & Lemon slices and Raspberry. Delish! Must try."}
{"text":"What a beautiful, little place in the corner! World's biggest chocolate fountain? COool! $10 for a delicious nutella crepe? Sure, why not? How could I resist...  So posh. So pretty. They have cakes on display, crepe making in your face, rows of pastries and chocolates.. I wanted everything!   My banana nutella crepe was pretty damn amazing. It definitely hit the g spot. My friend who also attacked it would say the same.   I will go back and embrace my inner fat kid."}
{"text":"Same jean philipe... Different location.. Yet service and attitude was quite different.  definitely liked the one in the bellagio more. 2 different lines apparently..one for pastries, food, coffee...and another for smoothies and drinks. smoothies were $9.50 and tasted the same as jamba juice.... yogurt parfait was also $$. yogurt was watery, but granola had plump pieces of golden and red raisins.    pastries looked very pretty, but really sweet.  they display things well."}
{"text":"Wow! Pastries. Yes, pricy.. But it's Vegas.. and in the bellagio..  a small regular coffee was $3.50 and pastries range from $3 and up...i spent around $9 for coffee and pastries... pastries definitely looked appealing and rustic.  got the dulce de leche brioche and it was tasty.  soft fluffy bread with a thick piping of dulce de leche.  goes so well with the black coffee!  line gets long, but service was quick and organized.  someone wrote down the order, others help get the drinks and/or food ready, and another was the cashier.  you will be tempted by packaged sweets, chocolates, cookies, etc around you while youre in line..."}
{"text":"Great to see all the colors/selection...and everything we chose, was delicious.  Really nice...would go back (if eating cakes would magically not make you heavier!).  Love it."}
{"text":"Insane.  Amazing pastries 'nough said.  The wife and I had no choice but to stop and taste some items upon walking by this little gem and spotting the visually stunning eye/tummy candy.  My wife and I shared a Sugar Crepe with lemon which we got to see prepared in front of us.  The woman who prepared our crepe clearly had been doing this for a while and it was clear that she took great pride in her work with the skill and joy in which she prepared it.  Not over or under cooked, it was perfect.  Fluffy yet tender crisp edges and the fresh lemon along with the powdered sugar was perfect.  We also shared a Rose Macaroon and a Key Lime pie.  Both were divine.    The Rose Macaroon was actually a raspberry macaroon with rose infused cream and fresh raspberries topped with a sugar coated rose petal.  The freshness of the raspberries worked wonders with the texture of the macaroons outer layers and the hint of rose flavor added another level.  The Key Lime Pie was stunning as well and topped with a lime green streaked candied top over the whipped cream and almond dough.  Again, perfect flavor and textures working together like in the macaroon.  We'll definitely be coming back to sample more of what this amazing place has to offer."}
{"text":"It's in the strip and it's inside the aria so expect the price to be above modest. The desserts are visually pleasing. I had the Creme brûlée and I wasn't really blown away. The cold cut roast beef sandwich was more of my liking. There are a lot of people so don't expect to find an empty table immediately."}
{"text":"I love sweets and more so if they are Parisian.  This patisserie offers pastries as close as you can get to actual Parisian treats.  I have a high standard for pastries as I have feasted on the best of the best.  We ended up ordering the flan cheesecake and the strawberry tarte.  Both of the pastries had the same elements of the pastries that can be found in the streets of Paris.  I really enjoyed this little pastry shop that offers not only pastries but also sandwiches.  You can grab a pastry and sit and enjoy the great flavors.  The staff is also very friendly and attentive, you will certainly satisfy your sweet tooth here."}
{"text":"Chicken tandoori panini!   Right before watching Cirque du Soleil's show Zarakana, my cousins and I stopped by for a quick bite at Jean Philippe Patisserie. On a normal foodie occasion, I would've gotten some of their beauiful looking pretty sweets but we hadn't eaten anything solid yet so we all chose to get sandwiches. My sandwich of choice was the chicken tandoori panini!  They make their paninis fresh to order and my panini came out fresh and hot! I was in love at first bite. This was one tasty sandwich! It had tender chicken breast, curry mayo and veggies. The curry flavor was so good. It wasn't too overwheming but just had the right kind of kick. The panini itself was pretty big and definitely fulfilling.  The chicken tandoori panini here is deifnitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best pain au chocolat I had in Vegas!! The display and variety of pastries is amazing and mouth watering. I wish I have a bottomless stomach to fit all the pastries."}
{"text":"Hands down they are the best in town!! The only one I had pastry's is the Bellagio and they were always great!! I really get some to go since I live here in Las Vegas. The line thing was a little off though as I had to go around a bunch of people to point out what I wanted. It's worth the $7 a dessert for sure!!"}
{"text":"I had the berry gelato. It was sooooo good!! Very fresh and perfect for a hot day outside! It taste very fresh and i can tell they use quality ingredients. My niece had the mango gelatto and for me not liking mango, hers was also VERY good and tasted surprisingly just like biting into a real mango. would definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"$11 for a crispy taco shell of a crepe?! During a mini Staycation at the Aria, I opted out on dessert at Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio just to have dessert at Jean Philippe. I love crepes. I get dessert crepes from a couple places near my neighborhood in town for less than $6.  Understanding the $11+ price at Jean Philippe because it is in a high end location, I didn't mind paying it. I ordered the bananas fosters dessert crepe. It looked so good, I even found a seat and took pictures of it for my snapchat.   After showing off my dessert to all my followers I begin to dig in. You couldn't even cut through it with the fork. I thought, \"what the? Maybe it's rubbery?\" But then when I take a bite, it was crunchy AF!! I gave it the benefit of the doubt and cut through the middle, and it was the same prob. Crunchy taco shell crepe!   Okay so I also get that this can happen. So I kindly go back to the lady who curated my crepe asking her if she can remake it because it was crunchy. All she said was, \"it may have over cooked a little.\" That's it!! I was standing there waiting for anything else she had to say or if she was going to take my plate to remake it. I don't know! All I know is I was standing there for a hot a minute or two before I asked again, \"could you please remake it? I like my crepe soft just like the $5 ones I can get elsewhere.\"  She rolled her eyes, grabbed the plate of crunchy taco crepes from where I placed it and slammed it into the trash bin. Then she started sloppily making a new one for me. Wow! When I finally got to eat it, it was softer but honestly, the flavor wasn't even worth it for me. Not the money, the asstitude, and the time wasted in line and having to get it remade. the bananas fosters was so dang sweet, I couldn't even enjoy the crepe I had to complain about."}
{"text":"I just found a dark chocolate peanut bar in my handbag...sweet surprise!  The peanut filling was delicious, more salty than sweet, which was the perfect complement to JP's melt-in-your-mouth dark chocolate.  I have been spoiled, and will never be able to touch a regular old Reese's peanut butter cup again."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love a place with a chocolate fountain display? This place ups the ante with a white, milk, and dark chocolate waterfall-type display...very cool.  The crepes were pretty good, but I've had better..however the presentation is excellent.  The thing to get here? How about the pastries? By far the best croissant ever! Definitely worth a stop next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio is located steps away from the indoor garden.  The chocolate fountain display is very impressive, but the display of beautifully crafted sweets are even more impressive.  It 's like looking at art.   I had a hard time decided what to order, and finally decided to try the nutella brioche.  It was FABULOUS!!!!  I enjoyed every morsel of it and had to fight the temptation to go back and get a second one."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Best sticky buns ever.  Everything we ate there was delicious.  I cant wait to come back.  The oatmeal cookie was really yummy too.  Next time I want to get some chocolate.  King Sugar Showcase Supreme!!!"}
{"text":"The treats here are more structurally astounding & visually appealing than they are tasty. I had a gorgeous rosewater & fresh raspberry macaron (the size of my palm, filled with rose cream & topped with a candied rose petal) as well as a blueberry cupcake. Taste-wise, they were more than passable, but when you're ponying up ~$7 for a single dessert, you expect it to be mindblowing. Textbook. An art form. As for my desserts, the texture of the macaron was rather brittle, and the blueberry cupcake was very springy & gelatinous (I assume, to preserve the genius of its architectural design).  Still, I'm sure I got my money's worth standing around, gawking at the world's largest chocolate fountain & various chocolate sculptures on display. :) And it doesn't hurt to be able to cross \"Eat MOF/Jean-Phillipe pastries\" off the foodie bucket list.   Bottom Line: Would be awesome if Jean-Phillipe was actually in the Bellagio kitchen baking these goodies, but I guess this works too."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Jean Phillippe Patisserie offers a huge selection of delectable pastries and crepes.  I recommend visiting more than once during your stay in Vegas in order to taste many of the options, as they are all so good!  My favorites would be the cheese danish, the nutella beignet, and the crepes.  However, you really can't go wrong with anything!  In regards to the prices.  It is Vegas.  Nothing is cheap!  And, $11 for a crepe is very reasonable in my opinion (a few dollars more for a scoop of gelato on it ;-) ).  The pastries are all between $6-$9, as far as I know.  But, it is all worth it!"}
{"text":"I love all things breakfast and all things sweet so I am severely biased.   Things you have to try!  -Almond croissant  -Ham & cheese croissant  -forest crepe  Things you can skip... -Chocolate croissant (very very little chocolate) -the coffee (very meh)   Overall delicious and I visited this place 4 times over 3 days :)"}
{"text":"Based in my check ins you can see that I obviously love this place. They have a wide array of savory treats like gelato, crepes, breakfast croissants, pastries and more!   During my last stay at the Aria hotel in Las Vegas, I had the CHICKEN CREPE a couple of times. This definitely was enough to keep me up for half of the day. They poured the buck wheat into the crepe maker and then they added fresh toppings, spinach, roasted red peppers, cheese and chicken. They topped it off with chipotle. Delish! Crepes will run you about $10.75.  What I also like about this place is that they have a SUGAR FREE blueberry muffin which actually tastes as if it has sugar in it. The coffee is also outstanding here.   I could totally survive just off this place if nothing else was open in vegas! Lol   Just note that during breakfast peak times they get super busy so if you are with a group  I suggest one person grabs a seat while the other orders!   On the weekends they are open til 2 am!"}
{"text":"The pastries are good, but the line is long and not organized well.  People that already ordered and are waiting for their orders stand in line blocking the views of the pastry cases.  Strange set up."}
{"text":"Service was RIDICULOUSLY slow and unorganized but gelato was still amazing! I got the cookies and cream (Oreo?) like always which was sooo good and then I tried the crime brûlée which honestly might be my new favorite. It even had cracked pieces of the hard sugar in it. I got a cone with two scoops and noticed my portion size was much bigger than my husband's who got two scoops but in a cup. Since this gelato is pricey, I'd highly  recommend getting the cone to get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"This is still one if my favorite dessert places in Vegas! I love their gelato, it is THE best! This time I had Oreo and pistachio and they were excellent as usual. It may be pricey...but it sure is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good but slow and poorly organized (or poorly trained employees). Watched it take them 30m to make 3 crepes."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late breakfast on Saturday. Ordering is a bit confusing, since there are multiple lines. Lines did move quickly, however, since they were so behind, they were no longer accepting omelette or crepe orders. Too bad, since the crepes sounded delicious.  We ended up getting a smoked salmon sandwich ($11.50). The bread was brioche-like, clearly house-made and delicious. Loved the sauce, which tasted like a hollandaise. It had slices of hard boiled eggs, slivers of onion, microgreens. Smoked salmon was darn One of the better parts of the meal.  The coffee drinks were weak, though. Given the prices, the expectations were high. I got my regular soy latte...sadly, there wasn't a whole lot of coffee flavor! DH got a cappuccino and he said, \"It was not that smooth. Not as good as Starbucks.\" $5.25 for the large cappuccino and $4.25 + $1 for soy milk for the small latte.  The chocolate almond croissant was great, but really heavy. There's almost too much filling, if that's such a thing! The filling is a marzipan-like sweet almond paste and delicious chocolate. It is a gorgeous pastry and a good size for $5. The plain chocolate croissants were already sold out. DH said it couldn't compare to croissants in France. Can we say picky eater? Lol!  The chocolate fountain is lovely and definitely worth a look (and a photo).  Overall, good place for pastries, sandwiches, but not coffee. Pricey and busy. Don't count on getting what you want during peak hours."}
{"text":"It's like one of those really cute coffee and dessert shops you would find in downtown Santa Monica or San Diego, except everything felt high-end considering its location in the Aria.  I came here for some breakfast, had a cream cheese danish with some white chocolate-flavored espresso (Sorry, forgot the specific name of the drink!) My order came out to be a total of 10.54. The pastry was about 5 and the drink was about the same price. I would like to say that the coffee was a tad bit expensive and seemed like your average local Starbucks espresso. The danish on the other hand was really good. You wouldn't be able to escape the crunchy, flaky, sweetness.  I shall return on my next trip to Vegas to better enjoy their other assortment."}
{"text":"Everything is good here, the pastries, the crepes (sweet & savory), the coffees... What don't I love about this place? The price! Otherwise they would get 5 stars. I know it's vegas and it's inside Aria but $2.75 for a macaron? Maybe next time I'll bite the bullet and get some. Haha My must haves before Sunday checkouts? Butter croissant and iced mocha!"}
{"text":"If anyone has ever told you that you have eaten a crepe before eating one here, you were lied to.  We made a stop at this pastry shop every single night we were in town.  The cheesecake, the tarts, the crepes, and every other pastry that we tried were all off the charts.  My only complaint is that I can't get these things at home!"}
{"text":"On my recent stay at the Aria, I ate here for both breakfast and lunch.  -Chocolate Croissant: 3/5 This was the first thing I have ever ordered from here. I had high hopes for it since it seem to come highly recommended from all the reviews on Yelp. It was nice and flaky. However the layer of chocolate was very minimal. I mean I didn't expect it to be drowning in chocolate, but I felt that there wasn't enough chocolate to justify it being called chocolate.  -Almond Croissant: 3/5 This was super sweet! It had a sweet center which I wasn't expecting. Ordered it for breakfast and honestly had to eat it in two servings because it was too sweet.    -Chicken Pesto Panini: 5/5 This was by far the best thing I ate from here. I love hot sandwiches. The bread was nice and toasty. The cheese was melted perfectly. Plenty of pesto. You can't go wrong when ordering this!  -Chai Tea: 2/5 I'm a lover of chai lattes and this was terrible. It was the most water downed chai I have ever had. Definitely skip this.   -Iced Mocha Coffee: 5/5 I am not a coffee drinker and even this drink won me over. Excellent for a hot day.  Overall, I don't think this is a must for me when I am in Vegas. Certain items are great but the prices are too steep for me."}
{"text":"Oh I really love this place. Every time I'm in Vegas, we go multiple times. The pastries are still incredible. This visit I tried the raspberry cheesecake, the key lime tart, the raspberry tart, and of course my all time favorite vanilla Napoleon. We always get dessert to go after dinner and eat it in our hotel room. For me, the one in Aria isn't as good. Maybe it's the atmosphere with the chocolate fountain?"}
{"text":"The revolving cakes were very nice and the displays  were pretty good. Prices are on par with other high end pastries shops."}
{"text":"Jean Phillippe Patisserie is like setting into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Such a cute environment and packed with people. Come early to ensure a great scoop of ice cream on your crepe. Your crepe is made fresh in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on Friday w/ a couple of friends. They specialize in desserts, but serve gourmet sandwiches & salads as well.  Ham & Cheese Croissant: 4/5 - It wasn't any different than a ham & cheese sandwich made w/ a George Foreman Grill, but it was good. Service: 3/5 - The service was fine, but lines can get really long here in the mornings. Ambience: 4/5"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes and chocolates.  We had to pay a visit to Jean Philippe Patisserie on our trip. If the chocolate fountain doesn't catch your attention, all their baked goods, chocolates, and crepes may. So much deliciousness wrapped up in one place. Employees are friendly and helpful. Prices are high, but you pay for quality ingredients. Seating can be found beside the cafe. Their crepes are well prepared, with the perfect chew and not overly sweet. Their chocolate are also made with quality ingredients and decorated beautifully.   Overall, an great place to visit if you're looking for dessert."}
{"text":"Great cupcakes, clean area, live music (next door) and enough seating make this a fun place to chill early before going somewhere else.  They do offer milk to drink if you like that instead of fancier drinks and make sure to grab a fork - these desserts are not for eating with your hands.  Be aware that it's not cheap, but it is Vegas!"}
{"text":"\"WOW.\" Was the thought that went through my head after seeing the displays here. Even though some of them look fake (and maybe they are), but the fact that everything is visually spectacular is something to take note of. Take a peek at a few of the pictures and it'll give you an idea of what I'm talking about. The giant chocolate flowers are awesome and the ladies will love the chocolate high heels.  I chose to get a very sweet strawberry tart. Although, the crust was too hard and sticky (I like mine more crumbly in fashion) it was good and sweet. The strawberries were very fresh and had a light honey drizzle with chopped pistachios on top. Inside was a creamy custard. If it weren't for the crust, I'd have given this place 5 stars, but that's just my preference I guess. Now thinking back it was a more jamm'um in your mouth dessert, than a fork and knife dessert. It was tasty none the less.  Anyone who's a fan of desserts has to try at least one (or a few) of their baked confections. He has several other locations scattered throughout the hotels on The Strip. One I hear has a magnificent chocolate fountain. So you can be like Ponce De Leon and look for the mythical Fountain of Chocolate (disclaimer: youth not guaranteed)."}
{"text":"Had my first pastry of the trip today and the almond brioche didn't disappoint.  Likewise with my mocha.   Lunch will be a wonderful pannini sandwich."}
{"text":"Ordered a beautiful looking roast beef sandwich, and was aghast at seeing they only have yellow mustard packets.  ???? (Who uses that stuff anymore....whatever happened to Dijon, grained, etc etc) So, I grab a few mayo packets and after one bite of my sandwich, I am equally aghast at seeing they only have fat free mayo.  It goes from bad to worse!  Why would they have that awful stuff only offered?  It totally ruined a beautiful sandwich.  Condiments are very important!"}
{"text":"I think by the sheer number of different pastries, I can see why people get excited here.  Presentation is unmatched other dessert places on the strip.  But presentation is half the story.  Even though it is good, it doesn't leave me with that must come back attitude.  My group all order different cool looking pastries, so I had a chance to try a little of each.  Nothing to write home about.  Great photograph moments, but the taste is what will make me come back.  No home runs.  If I\"m in the Aria and want a pastry, I would come back.  But I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  Go get a Red Velvet Cake at the Grand Lux or a Coconut Cream Pie at Carnegie Deli for a go out of my way dessert."}
{"text":"Cheesecake was okay but not the best. I had the dessert trio and the raspberry macaroon was my favorite out of the three."}
{"text":"To start...the woman behind the pastry counter was extremely rude and impatient...and simply looked bored and unhappy to be there.   I got a Chocolate covered praline nougat...it was very pricey and way too sweet. The nougat isn't particularily nutty and definitely way too much and way too sweet.   I also got a opera cake, napoleon, and creme brulee. The woman who packed the creme brulee didn't bother taping it down and so it spilled everywhere in the box(liquid sugar covering everything). It was just okay, nothing spectacular.   The napoleon was also alright, nothing spectacular. I did like the opera cake but only get it if you REALLY like rich chocolate things (it can be kind of heavy towards the second half). I also ordered a cinnamon roll which was not bad; it was more of a danish flaky pastry than the typical fluffy cinnamon roll texture.   On the side with gelato, we did order a coconut flavored one. It was very coconut-y and actually not bad. The guy behind the counter was much nicer and much more patient than the lady behind the pastries.  Overall, extremeley disappointed with quality of service and disappointed that the pastries weren't as spectacular as expected."}
{"text":"Unless you like stale baked goods or have total anosmia and/or dysgeusia avoid this overpriced disguise of a french patisserie.   Where do i start.....  (+1) For being everywhere. I mean i guess if you can't do something well - do it big so people can't avoid you.  (-1) For being out of macarons......at 3pm. Maybe i'm being vendictive here but what patisserie is out of macarons when they are being advertised left and right? (Probably a blessing in disguise though) (-1) For charging for a cup of water. Seriously....... (-1) For having pastries that are clearly stale. We got a mousse cake and a flan and both were borderline plasticized when we dug in.    Overall: Enjoy with your eyeballs and save the calories for booze."}
{"text":"German made wonderful, fantastic, tasty, crepes for us and provided extremely great customer service !"}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU!! Jean if you are not happily married please let me know :) Kidding!!  I've dine here a few times and was never disappointed. I have to remind myself when I'm standing in line that my stomach is only so big and I can't walk away with a dozen desserts!! Everything that I had was super good!! From sandwiches, salads and to the awesome desserts! Make sure you swing by and sample some of Jean's yummy creations."}
{"text":"Ugh so good. But they ran out of the salmon and egg sandwich :( i must try that next time! Got the prosciutto sandwich, roast beef sandwich and italian. All were really tasty. Got orange juice and coffee and all cane out to be around $48 ish. They have wonderful pastries too but didnt have enough time to try it. Definitely a place to stop by if youre in vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place for pastry and for crepes, but they have changed the way they make the crepes. Previously they folded them 4 ways and served them square. Now they fold them triangularly. I guess for most options there is little difference but the Forrest with sunny side egg, a previous beauty, now just has the egg plopped onto of the crepe. Not beautiful. We were also longing for the Dulce de Leche Brioche which I was told was no longer available."}
{"text":"I found their assortment of pastries and sweets highly satisfying! Tried a variety of items here over a few days and whether it was the soft buttery flakiness of the croissants or the soft sweet texture of the eclairs, I was not disappointed. The only exception was the coffee which I found lacking in taste and quality to that of the Starbucks located upstairs."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Everything here is delicious and immaculate. The prices are expensive but that's to be expected for it being in a hotel. The prosciutto panini is SO addicting. Get it and you won't be sorry--you'll be tempted to buy 3 more. That sauce they add just takes it to a whole new level (sorry for the cliche superlatives--I'm a little tired).  The desserts are great too but one thing I don't like is the amount of sugar in them. Now they are not the sweetest desserts I've ever had but they are borderline too sweet. From a restaurant that sounds French, that's kind of disturbing. France is all about butter and don't put that much sugar in desserts. Generally speaking a lot of desserts in the US are way too sweet."}
{"text":"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Rose Macaron - Not the greatest, but probably because I'm not a huge fan of rose.  I think there was a drop too much of rose flavoring as it was overpowering on my palette. The macaron itself was fantastic without being too sweet as most tend to be.  Peanut Lollipop - A total different take on a cake pop, which is amazing!  I love the genoise paired with the mousse.  Creme Brûlée - If you're looking for a typical creme brûlée taste, look elsewhere.  This creme brulee is very deep in vanilla flavor with almost a deep caramel flavor.  Dulce de Leche Brioche - The brioche itself flakey, sweet, and buttery.  The top was nice and flakey.  What made this heavy was the dulce de leche otherwise the brioche was rich, but light.  In my opinion however, I've had greater tasting dulce de leche.  Key Lime Tart - WOW.  Probably one of my favorites.  Just enough lime flavor without making your face squish up.  The lime curd was nice a smooth and the lime whipped cream was so fluffy and airy which helped to lighten the overall product.  OVERALL: I absolutely adore Jean Phillipe because all of the pastries I've had are somehow full of flavor, yet always light and not heavy.  This is dangerous because that just means you can eat more!  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lunch we picked up from here and ate at the tables overlooking the pool area of Bellagio.  I had a vegetarian crepe and a nutella brioche.  Both were good but not something I would go out of my way for again.  I was shocked at how expensive the iced tea was.  My husband is gluten free and he had a southwestern salad.  It was a pre-made, packaged sandwich.  He said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Spare no calories in Vegas!   This patisserie is sooooooo good.  The almond croissants are fantastic.   Try the nutella crepe and add bananas. The nutella brioche was great too.   Their chocolates are amazing.  I love caramel and the coconut chocolates were tasty too.   Also, the fruit yogurt is a great snack.    I stayed at the Aria and every morning I tried something.   The soy cappuccinos were okay.   I prefer Peets but the pastries were crazy good!"}
{"text":"What do I have to say about this place? I came here directly after an already amazing dinner at Blue Ribbon Sushi.  Gotta have a separate stomach for dessert,  you know.  Let me just start off by saying this is a foodie photographers dream.  Everything was presented so beautifully,  it made you almost not want to eat it.  Long story short, my date and I shared the trio with the creme brulee, cake lollipop and macaron,  along with a cheesecake.  Our favorite was the creme brulee. It was just so smooth and creamy and way too tiny. I left this place happy as can be and worked my way towards Blue Man Group at the Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Girls love crepes. It's true. So a crepe stop at the esteemed Jean Philippe Patisserie is a requirement on an all-girls Vegas trip. I was surprised by the lack of seating. There's 3-4 small tables wedged into the walls and some very small tables further down the corridor, but it's very much a take-and-go cafe. The curvy, bending mounted wall menu is hard to read when it's over your head while in line, so decide what you want beforehand. The lady taking the orders was pretty rude to me as well. I must've not heard her when she asked me what I wanted and she skipped to the person behind me. \"Excuse me, did you take my order yet?\" I asked politely. \"No.\" She glared at me. Whoa, alright, sorry. She left for a little bit, came back, sighed, and begrudgingly told me, \"Okay NOW I can take your order.\" Jeez, I'll buy some hearing aids next time. All other staff were pretty nice.   I feel like I've listed a lot of cons, but it's not a bad place! It's a beautiful, unique, tasty cafe. The chocolate fountain is awe-worthy. It's hard to resist the urge to break through the glass and just drown yourself in the chocolaty waterfall. Lots of amazing, quirky, gorgeous cakes lining the walls so you have some eyecandy when in line or eating.   On to food! NUTELLA BRIOCHE // Simple and delicious. Soft, tender bread with Nutella injected right in the middle.  BERRY SOUFFLE CREPE // The crepe itself was fine, syrup too sweet for my taste, strawberries weren't fresh, but OH-DEAR-LORD I just have to give the 4th star for the souffle filling. I think I've found something I love more than Nutella. There! I said it. If only they sold that vanilla creme in a double-pack from Costco. Only an inkling of public decency kept me from licking that plate clean. Would've been absolutely perfect if I had the souffle crepe sans syrup with fresh berries and dollop of whipped cream.  SUGAR CREPE // My friend ordered this plain crepe and...it was no good. She hated it and she grew up in France, she knows what a real crepe should be like. It was filled with granulated sugar and sickeningly sweet. Skip!"}
{"text":"Didn't try their cakes, but their pastry was just okay. Nothing special but somewhat pricey. Hot chocolate was good quality and authentic, but I've definitely had better. Spent $10+ on a pastry and hot chocolate."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain.  The beautifully crafted pastries.  The gelato.  The crepes.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is Heaven.  I ordered a Nutella crepe.  It was approx. $9 and delicious.  Seating in the patisserie is sparse."}
{"text":"The pastries are delicious. The coffee was pretty good. The service was terrible and rude. We were over charged. Now this doesn't bother me so much. Things happen, places get busy and mistakes are made. What bothers me is how they handled it. When I came back and pointed it out the woman grabbed my ticket and walked off leaving me standing there for a good 5 minutes. Then another woman returns takes a look at me and the leaves for another 5 minutes. Finally she came back with someone who I assume is the manager. They fiddled around with the register for a few minutes and put the difference on the counter and walked away. The manager never looked at me and neither of them said a single word to me. No apology, no hello, nothing. When you have a service economy like vegas, especially in a place as \"nice\" as the Aria I expect to get some level of good service. I didn't want anything for free from them just an apology for making a mistake and taking my time to get it back. I wasn't rude about it, but they were."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Nutella crepe. This is a must stop for me everytime i come to Vegas and it is the only thing  I get so cant speak to anything else. So good and so worth the money and calories. Do go."}
{"text":"When in Vegas I have VERY VERY HIGH expectations for all restaurants/shops and this place to no surprise located in the Bellagio Hotel delivers and meets all my expectations!   I don't think I have had anything that I didn't love here. The quality of the food, the luxury and style of the chocolates and pastries are clearly visible.   My favorites are the pesto prosciutto mozzarella panini, vanilla shake, really any of the crepes and pastries because they are all heavenly.  This is definitely a great place to stop for a quick inexpensive (compared to other options) lunch or a snack before you gamble the night away!!!  PS - Their chocolate fountain thing is soooo cool makes you just wanna open your mouth and stick your face underneath : )"}
{"text":"Wonderful, and to all those people one floor above in line at Starbucks .... Wake up!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is a famous French name for pastry but too bad so sad, for the price they charged, the quality was lacking.   Chocolate croissant for breakfast oh hell yeah! That's my thing. But it was just a big surprising joke that this chocolate croissant from this place wasn't right compare with the price that I paid for. $4.50 for chocolate croissant sure if the filling was full. But this one wasn't at all. The chocolate filling was very skimpy. For the price, this croissant was supposed to be full of deliciousness. But the croissant itself just fell apart when I was eating it, very crumbled. What I can says is the Starbucks chocolate croissant much better compare this one.   My husband ordered the veggie omelette with fruit & wheat bread but he got the white bread instead. He was just too lazy to deal with the line just to tell them about the wrong bread. The taste of the omelette was just bland. Didn't look tempting at all, it was looked like a cheap grocery store. It was just a egg pancake rolled up with vegetables skattered on top. It cost almost $11 for that and nothing special about it. Even Denny's makes a better Omelete than that. I can make the omelette much much better than that!   So I won't be back here next time for the breakfast or the croissant but I might try other sweet treats just for the heck of it.  This place is just definitely a tourist trap from one famous name, but not worth the pennies that you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins and im glad i did! Very delicious and fresh crepes. Walking up the place looks cute with glass shelves filled with unique chocolates and treats. I chose the exotic crepe. It came with fruit topping-mango, pineapple, and passion fruit. It also included a scoop of coconut sorbet. THE BEST sorbet I've had! Filled with fresh shredded coconut. I would go back and get that same crepe or just that sorbet. I also ordered to go a fresh fruit tart I are the next day. It was also fresh and tasty. Good fruit: pastry ratio. My one cousin enjoyed her crepe and my other his cookies n cream gelato We all said we would come back. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was the service from the cashier"}
{"text":"Over rated and expensive. I has the tiramisu wasn't very good. I've had much better for less. Seeing the chocolate fountains and beautiful cakes was neat but if you came for a good dessert go somewhere else.   Service was super slow and for the price you should be served not cafeteria style. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"6/100 Yelp 2018 Review Challenge  Meh, overpriced and ove rhyped crepes. It was later in the evening so they didn't have as many of the pastries I wanted to try so my boyfriend and I settled for crepes. We got the berries one and added bananas (which was another $1 or $2). After they called us to pick up our order, I asked them if they could drizzle chocolate over it and they said it was another $1. Like what? We paid almost $15 for that crepe and it just made me cringe because back in my college dorm days of unlimited meal swipes, I definitely ate better quality crepes for a fraction of that price. It wasn't the best crepe - way too sweet and I wish the fruits were fresh. The dough of the crepe itself was also on the dough-y side and not as thin and crispy as I would've liked it to be. Left pretty disappointed and in search of another restaurant to get our dessert needs satisfied."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich spot in Vegas! Have not tried the one in Bellagio but I always end up at this one at Aria. It's like a little sandwich shop that serves their paninis and sandwiches on clear plastic plates but it still feels fancy in here lol  Their smoked salmon sammich is a MUST TRY! Honestly I never ever thought that sliced onion and smoked salmon could go so well together! Well, they smack your palate like no other. OMG. It is the epitome of savory.  Basil chicken panini is also a good choice! Everything was sooo flavorful and their sub/panini is perfectly heated and chewy and not overly dry or crunchy.  One thing I didn't order myself that I had a bite of was the caprese panini. It was nothing out of ordinary, can't remember much of it but I recommend that you get a caprese sandwich at Earl's rather than here. Til next time :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the manager this morning (no name tag, but she's the only person wearing glasses).  Basically  customers where quite disappointed when we were told that crepes and omelette orders would take 40 minutes (told only once we were ordering) A customer in front of me suggested that she tell the people lined up that she should forewarn the long wait.  Instead of taking this suggestion,  she gave this customer (and me) an attitude unbecoming of a manager.  Needless to say,  while having our breakfast,  all we heard from the other customers \"what?  40 minutes for a crepe?\""}
{"text":"Came here the other day to by a box of chocolates as I have done in the past many times. Sergio and his coworker rather talk and giggle at each other rather than helping the customers in front of him.    The box i bought was incomplete. They don`t have all the supplies for the boxes.   I will not be back.  For the price you need to have better customer service!! Try the chocolatier in the ceasers forum shops, which is where I will be buying chocolate for now on.."}
{"text":"Was it double or triple chocolate? I dont recall but it was heaven in a small circular shape dessert! I only wish it was in Pennsylvania somewhere. I guess i will have to come back for my lil heaven in a box!"}
{"text":"Their rapsberry rose macaroons gelato is so good!!! My second fav is the pistachio! The gelato is so smooth. For $6ish 2 scoops, these gelato are so good! The store is so pretty :)"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a big fan even though I hate sweets.    I've tried cakes, crepes, and croissants.   They were all good!   Expect huge lines everytime you go.  It's located inside the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Review is for macarons only.  Fancy bakery with macaron topped cakes, chocolates, gelato, and any sweet you can possibly imagine! I came here for one thing and one thing only - macarons!!!!!!  The kicker - they didn't come fresh. Macarons were already pre-packaged in the cold section for $16 for 8. For the size it came in, it was expensive and only carried 4 flavors.  But I'm impressed with how much flavor it packed for a tiny sandwich cookie. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe, oh how I love thee!  You'll be blown away with their beautiful display of chocolate flowing through their fountains made out of glass. I mean that alone is a show stopper right there! Once you've tried their gelato and crepe, you'll be an avid fan just like moi!   Their crepe is delightful! The batter they use here has just the right concoction. It is perfect in every way. Texture, taste, smell, and appearance! I always get it with bananas, nutella, and a scoop of vanilla bean gelato. HmmHmm..heavenly!   I've been here lots of times. Despite the efforts in wanting to try something else, I always get pulled back to getting my favorites, the crepe and gelato! I promise to try something new next time I visit =)"}
{"text":"Love it but hate waiting in line for it.  Amazing gelato, crepes, and once upon a time, chocolate covered strawberries, Jean Philippe has everything to satisfy the inner dessert lover inside all of us.  Not only do the desserts look beautiful, but they taste delicious too.  Bellagio's is the prettiest, but there are other locations as well including in Aria if you want to attempt to go to a less busy one (but mind you, they both are pretty poppin').  One gripe I have is about the service.  We tried to order the apple crepe with vanilla gelato instead of the whipped cream.  Let me just tell you, these crepes are made-to-order... in front of your face.  We got a quick and abrupt, NO, when we asked.  OK then... never mind.  Super delicious but what you see is what you get... no deviations."}
{"text":"Hit me with a Red Eye please.  Nothing better than a Coffee w/ a shot of Espresso before a long night of drinking. If that's not your \"cup of tea\" then you must try their respective pastries. Variety alone will get you hungry even if you just finished a 4 course meal. JPP crushes the dessert market.  Visited February 2013"}
{"text":"A little pricey...but if youre looking for coffee the morning after a vegas night and dont want to go to far from your hotel room, this will do it! We did have to wait in a long line however. Came back day 2 for desserts/snacks. Very good (but again a little $$$)."}
{"text":"Worlds Largest Chocolate Fountain! Tres impressive.   This place is the potential location of a got milk ad!"}
{"text":"5 stars speaks for itself...The one in Aria is definitely better than the one in Bellagio."}
{"text":"The desserts are okay tasting so I would give it a 3. However as the prices are outrageous I would have to lower my rating to a 2."}
{"text":"Everything here is too cute to eat. Thank God for the glass window keeping the food safe or else I'd def. drool and contaminate everything. If you don't believe me just look at the 700+ pictures uploaded on Yelp. As far as the taste, meeh nothing spectacular. If anything after paying about 10 bucks for a small croissant turkey sandwich I made myself believe it was better than it tasted. I believe this place is more for the desserts, like I said nothing special about the sandwiches.  Long lines feel like forever, especially when you are buzzed! Which I hope you would be, after-all it is Sin city!  Basically, it's a cute place to take some pictures, order a quick bite to eat and go about your sinning."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep getting slow or bad experience here from the workers.  Pros Store is very clean and beautiful.  I like eating here while I people watch and watch people win/lose on the slot machines.  The snacks are really pretty and it makes you want to buy them for gifts.  Cons First time I came here during the soft opening was a disaster.  Each customer must've taken 5 mins.  Now that it's been 2 years, it's better, but still slow.  The workers seem so unhappy.  Order with a smile, get a reply from a tired worker.  I ordered a chinese chicken salad and the lady gave me a paper that said \"asian\" on it to go pay for it."}
{"text":"Amazing! I pass by this place every time I'm in Aria and stare at the beautiful whimsical cakes and pastries. This time I decided to finally try some. I ended up getting something all three days I was there and everything was delicious! On day 1 I decided to skip dinner and use the calories for dessert. I had the blueberry cupcake and the milk chocolate mousse. I got myself a latte as well. All three items were delicious. On the second day I got the cheesecake, carrot cupcake, and dark chocolate mousse to share with my mom. Amazing. My favorite was the carrot cupcake. On day 3 I got the breakfast sandwich with fresh squeezed orange juice before hitting the road back to LA. So good! A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wanted to get dessert after seeing a show so I checked Yelp and Jean Philippe showed up as the number 2 place to get dessert on the strip. We arrived there and the lines to the counter were a mess, people standing all across the counter with no order. Once someone did try to take our order we had to tell them twice because they forgot and once we went to pay we had to tell the cashier what we ordered again, no organization. The wait wasn't long to get the crepes and eclair. I ordered the Exotic which was a $14 crepe covered in canned sugary syrup mango, took two bites and couldn't eat anymore not fresh at all, the coconut ice cream was the only redeeming part. We also ordered a chocolate crepe which we did enjoy, chunks of brownie were great. Also had a chocolate eclair which was pretty good but not as high quality as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Vegas, we HAVE to stop by to get desserts from here. Everything we've gotten has been fantastic! My family and I are the toughest critics when it comes to desserts, so trust me when I say this place is amazing. You won't find quality like this at your local bakery."}
{"text":"The cappuccino was smooth and creamy  + red velvet cupcake melt in your mouth. A little noisy if you want to just chill + relax because of where it was in the casino, but great for people watching if you got some time to spare + are bored."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a pastry shop in the middle of Vegas. The raspberry tart was to die for. All the layers of texture and flavor were perfection. I was expecting to have to pay an arm and a leg but the pricing is super reasonable. The staff was also extremely friendly and it was really cool that you could watch the crepe station while they made the crepes to order. Probably one of the more interesting kid friendly things to do on the strip, with the chocolate fountain, gelato and crepe station. I will make sure to take a trip here every time I go to Vegas from here on out."}
{"text":"My favorite crepe place in Vegas.  We stayed next door in Cosmo and decided to walk over for a quick breakfast.  Even though it was only 10am, there was already a long line wrapped around the counter.  Service was quick and efficient.  The line moved very fast, and I was too busy gawking at the rotating cake displays to even notice the wait time.  We ordered a smoked salmon crepe and a strawberry nutella crepe.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The crepe itself was the perfect amount of chewiness and tenderness.  The sizes were extremely generous, the two of us struggled to finish the two crepe.  My only complaint is the fact that they use this giant plastic container to hold the crepes.  I understand that seating is limited and most people are probably getting the crepes to go, however, it is hard to eat from the container and it is unwieldy.    The workers were bringing out the pastries and desserts when we were leaving, all of them looked delicious and I wish we had room in our stomach to try them all.  This is definitely a place I would go back to when I go to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Pesto panini everrrrrrr. I've been to both locations at Aria and Bellagio. I always make sure to go here every time I go to Vegas. It's worth the walk from wherever I'm staying at. When I first came, I thought the portions looked small, but man, that thing fills you up! I've never had anything else, but I always am in awe of their chocolate fountain and sculptures. So cool! The one in Bellagio is also near the garden area, so you can try to walk off what you ate there.  Nomnomnomzzzz. :)"}
{"text":"You've GOT to \"stop and smell the roses\" when you see 3 different kinds of liquid chocolate flowing from the ceiling down onto the floor at a lovely French patisserie.   And that's exactly what we did - except, we also tasted the darn good metaphorical \"roses.\"  YO (my attempt at attracting a massive public attention as I rarely use such, um, form of greeting).  Get this: this place isn't cheap (a simple cup of t-bag tea is $3.50 and most of their pastries run $8-15 per piece).  But it's OH-SO-GOOD, almost to the point where you just wish you owned the place.  The chocolates are rich and smooth (and, yes, expensive - costing over $6 for a tiny piece of rocher), the hot chocolate being a one-way express ticket to heaven, and the pastries.... OH THE PASTRIES!!!  If you like fresh crepes... this is the place to be.  They offer a variety of crepes that they make right then and there (see picture) - bam!   They also have some (albeit limited) seating areas where you can sit, sip, and savor away the delicate chocolates.  It does get a bit crowded, but I suppose that's all part of the Vegas fun."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here about 3 times. They have anything from crepes, to sandwiches, to ice cream! My favorite crepe is their chocolate one. They let you pick a side of ice cream to go with it. Mmmm. They make the crepes in front of you and it's just a fun experience. Their smoothies are very good as well! It's a gorgeous place to even look at. It has an amazing chocolate fountain in it and it's very bright all around! There are a few places to sit inside but mostly at the end of the hall, there's a little sit down area with many tables and chairs. Most of the time, it's hard finding a decently clean table but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I am not much of a sweets person, but I had a hard time not freaking out over everything in the case at JPP. Nutella brioche? Tiny tarts and macaroons? Fabulous. The almond croissant was a wonderful start to each day we stayed at the Aria.   The thing that really sealed my never ending love of JPP was the Gourmet to Go takeaway option. For $19.99, you get a delish salad (cobb rocks, fyi), a giant sandwich (veggie is fab) and a desert of your choice, all packed in a travel, headed-to-the-airport friendly box, complete with utensils and napkins. I am so very thankful to have been able to skip the nasty over price options at the airport or on the airplane.   JPP loses one star for lack of adequate seating and on our last visit, the eating area had overflowing trash receptacles and table tops and counters that could have used a good wipe down."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts.. Service wasn't all that. The desserts are beautiful and tastes so good. The store is right in the casino.. We got a bit confused and thought it was in the shopping center next door. The selection was slim but we didn't get there till after 9pm. Totally worth the walk. Was looking forward to some French macaroon but they didn't have any."}
{"text":"Outrageous quality, outrageous prices.  I had a Napoleon  ($8.50) it tasted nothing like a real French mille-feuilles, Almost $10 for something you can get at a frozen section in a gas station in France!  If Jean Phiphi is really french, he should be stripped of his french citizenship just for selling those things!   I also had an apple brioche, seriously Jean Phiphi, almonds in all your pastries? Why?  The staff was clueless about the ingredients, at $10 buck a pop they should know what's inside those things they call french patisseries!  Jean Phillipe you should be spanked for such \"patisseries\"!"}
{"text":"Only in Vegas can I eat croque monsieurs everyday for 4 days for breakfast. Actually that is a lie as I also ate the croissants and paninis. Thank god I had my mother with me to share in them so there was minimal caloric guilt. Yes it was convenient that it was in our hotel and we didn't want to crawl too far in the morning for coffee. It was made better by the fact that everything was awesome.   The looks of the line can be intimidating, you think you may have to wait 15-20 to place and pick up you order but they were much faster than that. We also never had a problem finding seating as people wouldn't really linger after they were done.   When checking in on Yelp I confused this location with the one at the Bellaigo. The Aria location has much more seating and a full sweet/savory pasty menu.   If you don't eat there everyday at least try it once."}
{"text":"I LOVE Italian Gelato and have to have one nearly every single time I come across a shop. While living in Austria (Europe) for 10 years, I have always loved Gelato over American icecream (no offense meant. They are good too!)  The shop was very professionally displayed with all sorts of baked goods and chocolates, but I went straight to the Gelato line.  Between a friend and I, we ordered Coconut, Pistachio, Glazed Hazelnut, and Lemon.  The (1) Coconut was one of the BEST I have ever tasted from any Gelato shop -- it was full of Coconut flavor and texture. (2) Glazed Hazelnut was also excellent: it contained glazed pieces of hazelnut, adding a nice, crunchy texture. (3) Pistachio was acceptable, and contained pistachio nuts for additional texture as well.  I was disappointed with the (4) Lemon, however. Don't get me wrong. Lemon is one of my favorite Gelato flavors, but this one didn't taste right. And here's why: my friend wanted Lemon Gelato. The server gave her Lemon Sorbet. I told him that we wanted GELATO. He said, \"they are both the same.\" Huh? I knew from the consistency that it was, in fact, NOT Gelato. Gelato and Sorbet are NOT the same. *Minus 1 star for that.*  All in all, this is perhaps one of my most favorite Gelato places. Two scoops for $5. Excellent.  In contrast, the Gelato stand at the Venetian, Cocolini's, was a complete JOKE! It tasted nowhere near Gelato, and was extremely creamy. Gelato is supposed to be light and flavorful. Two scoops for $8. My friend, who never had Gelato before, found it to be \"blah\" too. I felt so bad, I just had to take her to Jean Philippe (after a friend raved about it). Jean Philippe helped win her back. She now enjoys Gelato.  EDIT 3/31/2011: I was in Vegas last week and stumbled upon another Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. So, we paid them a visit thinking it would be as good as the one at the Aria. No. Go to the Aria for GOOD gelato.  EDIT 5/14/2012: I love my icecream to have texture. For example, Hazelnut gelato having pieces of the nut, Strawberry having seeds, Coconut having coconut shavings, and the such. They make the gelato taste more natural and provide a welcome break to the same taste after you have licked the flavor over and over again. This place has that."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe's Patisserie is a place where passionate art meets fine, sweet delicacies. I love sweets... I love chocolate. I love macarons. Every time I step into the patisserie I stand in awe in front of the glass shelf of desserts. Suddenly the camera zooms out.. everyone's gone. The desserts and I are in an infinitely white room and suddenly I'm tiny compared to the delicious macarons, fruit tarts, and cheesecakes.. THEY'RE ALL MINE! Then reality hits.. \"that'd be $7.95 please\". At least I can take my ginormous macaron and dream on again in my room... They look so finely put together that it hurts to eat them, but once the taste buds get a slight taste.. it's heaven on Earth! Then I'm stuck in this dilemma where it hurts to cut up my delicious sweets but it tastes so good.. WHY!?!"}
{"text":"Such a large selection of good snacks and lunch stuff and friendly staff. I've been here a few times and am a big fan."}
{"text":"Three words: Nitro Cold Brew. Easy to access, decent prices for Vegas, and solid cold brew. The kind we're quick and staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Try anything and you're likely to leave happy. If I have to recommend something, it's the cute little chocolate treats that are almost too pretty to eat. ALMOST.  The crepes are fantastic too."}
{"text":"OMG. I had the hardest time choosing which dessert I wanted after dinner! Everything in the case looks exquisite and the layout is beautiful (despite being a bit confusing).   I ended up getting the key lime tart and I was very happy with my purchase. All the components worked well together and it was so pretty to look at. I can't wait for my next Vegas trip so I can try out their other offerings!"}
{"text":"The perfect ending to dinner and gambling.. The Gelato was sooooooo delicious!! Haven't had anything else there, but the Gelato was perfection. The cost wasn't too bad either.. Being in Aria I'd expect it to be way more. But not too bad.  Always ask for the chocolate flakes, yum!!"}
{"text":"As much as I enjoyed the food, it was just extremely expensive! My husband and I ordered the breakfast sandwich & quiche Loraine & a few other goodies and our total was so high! Don't get me wrong, the food we ordered was delicious! But I don't think I would pay that much again. Also, I got the 8-piece Macaron box. They were small & pricey as well. I've had better to be honest."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries, especially the dulce de leche brioche and the almond croissant. Unique cinnamon roll with puff pastry instead of traditional dough. Beautiful chocolate display. Location inside the Aria casino next to live music is a highlight. It's a much better location and layout than the JPP in the Bellagio. Doesn't merit 5 stars because of occasional slow, spotty service (especially when trying to order crêpes) and $1.09 for hot water. Yes; it's the Vegas strip, where the prices are exorbitant, but still!"}
{"text":"Desserts were great! But the coffee for some reason put my friends and I to sleep. I don't know if the switched the regular coffee for decaf but it definitely wasn't strong! I got the blueberry dessert and coffee draft which is supposed to be the first of its kind. It was mostly foam and a little coffee."}
{"text":"Gelato is just average. The chocolates are good, but you can get better if you are willing to pay that much"}
{"text":"My bf is a fan of their creme brulee. He had like 3 of them in a day, haha! We had their sandwiches/paninis, pastries, crepes the last trip and they were all yummy.   I bought my son all flavors (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, pistachio) of their rice crispy balls but haven't yet tried them.  Will be back here!"}
{"text":"Their basil panini sandwich was small but good. Ordered it to share with my boyfriend. The following evening he had a creme brulee and i had the chocolate cheesecake. They were too cute to eat and tasted yummy.   We plan on coming back to try their crepe and gelato. Check out their chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just got married at the Aria and in our wedding package, we were given a mini wedding cake from Jean Philippe Patisserie.  We were given pictures of about fifteen different cakes and had to pick one. They were adorable. It was the hardest decision of our entire wedding, because we wanted them all! They were like mini-works of art.  We arrived in Vegas and saw all of the cakes in the store/restaurant. We got even more excited. They were just as amazing in person.  On our wedding day, we were given our mini cake (could feed 6-8 maybe) in a plastic case. We took lots of pictures and kept it in our Sky Suite to have for breakfast the next morning.  The next morning it had melted a bit and the top tier was sliding. It didn't matter, we just wanted to eat it. We went to the concierge lounge to get cutlery and dove in.  As beautiful as our cake looked, it did not taste very good. The exterior coating was thick and sickly sweet. It was awful. The interior cake and creme was okay, but not great. We took a few bites and dumped it.   It was a huge let down.  I would definitely not recommend the cakes. Look at them ( they are so, so cute), but don't buy one. However, what we saw of the restaurant looked good and we might give it a try on our next trip."}
{"text":"Wanna pay $6 for something that tastes like yesterday's drip coffee with \"caramel\"? Well, look no further folks, Jean Philippe will help you out.  Truck stops made better coffee than that. Had my husbands white chocolate and it was great. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason that this is not 5 stars is because I have a budget. I took my 8 year old here for fall break and he said, \"I want to spend the night\".  He was completely ok with not being able to purchase  anything he was just mesmerized. So was I. Just as I have been everytime I have everytime I have stared into the fountains of chocolate before. It's enough to completely hypnotize a person. In my prechild days, I was able to afford some of the wonderful sandwiches and gelato. If money is not an issue then enjoy, it is well worth it. As a lover of all things beautiful then go and admire."}
{"text":"Oh Jean Philippe Patisserie (I hope that I have been pronouncing your name correctly), your desserts are visually appealing and equally delicious! Located in ARIA Resort & Casino, this dessert/bakery/chocolate shop is bright, beautifully decorated and definitely hard to miss; even if you're not in the mood for something sweet, your eyes will be drawn to the assortment of mini desserts or you will somehow convince yourself that standing in a long line for gelato will be worth it.   I walked back and fourth in front of the glass cases filled with desserts for about 10 minutes, debating which was worthy to be my first. I had the hardest time choosing only one because every single dessert looked and according to their description card, sounded delicious. How do you decide between Tiramisu, Nutella Napoleon, Cream Brûlée, Snickers, etc.? I ended up choosing the white chocolate cheesecake, and oh my, it was amazingly rich and decadent. Once you cracked the outer shell, the cheesecake was very creamy and sweet; although somewhat pricey, it was satisfying and tasted exactly as I had hoped it would.  I was in the mood for a sandwich but did not feel like making my way down to the usual Earl of Sandwich, so I decided to try the Basil Chicken from here. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was filling and hit the spot. Aside from the large selection of desserts, there were a variety of sandwiches, salads and other items that would cater to those without the sweet tooth.      I would often pass by here when walking back to my room and no matter what time of day, that gelato line was ridiculously long. I assume that there is a good reason for the constant line, so I hope that I will be able to try the gelato during my next trip to Vegas. The workers were friendly, efficient, and offered great recommendations to those unsure of what to order. I am glad that I was finally able to check this place off of my bookmarked list, you did not let me down Jean Philippe Patisserie!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Aria. These stars are for coffee only. Ordered their caramel swirl and white mocha. You could barely taste the coffee. Watered down with milk. They over heated the steamed milk. Better off going to SB for a personalized pour over coffee."}
{"text":"Stopped by today while at the Bellagio to show my boyfriend the chocolate fountain.  Decided I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a macaron.  The woman behind the counter was super nice. I tried the birthday cake and the raspberry macaron and they were amazing!  Definitely worth the  $4 each.  I got 2 of each and I have no regrets!  The Gelato looked really good too.  I will have to try that next time because I will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for quick dessert after eating pizza at Five50 at Aria. I had a coffee and vanilla eclair and my wife had a tiramisu. Both were very good. Her tiramisu looked too good to eat as it was extremely artistically prepared. The vanilla eclair was good, but it had been sitting a little while. I noticed this due to the outer portion of the piped in vanilla cream having that dried and hard 'skin' texture to it. It tasted great so I quickly got over it."}
{"text":"Ok, like really.....$5.00 for a small cafe latte and $5 or so for a nutella muffin. Too bad the stars have no categories because i will give it 5 stars for presentation and image and 2 stars for price and 1.5 stars for taste. The nutella muffin you would think is moist and ooeey gooey. Turns out to be hard, cold, and minimal ooeey gooeines.  Bouchon in Venetian serves better pastries for a \"cheaper\" price. The latte is watered down, not strong at all.    I was mighty impressed by the silverwares and the uniforms of the servers. They all look like white chocolates to me in the cute hats and aprons.    If you want to just OOO and AAA, i say come here!! You will be impressed by the selections. But if looking for good tasting items, i think there are better places.  But then again, Las Vegas is a place where image is everything and not really true substance so I guess JP serves up well. Money is nothing in this city of fun."}

{"text":"Great place to get dessert very delicious.  Coffee Pastries  Tarts Gelato's Chocolates"}
{"text":"The place was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, they had some beautiful cakes in display. I went here for lunch im a huge fan of great savory crepes. They didn't have that huge of a selection of savory I chose a turkey, spinach and cheese crepe it came with a small side salad of mixed greens with a few cherry tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette. The crepe was too thick which made it pancake like.   I did get a chocolate cheesecake to go and although by the time I got back to my condo and around to tasting it, it had partially melted I could tell it was really good. I would definitely return here for a decadent desert but not lunch."}
{"text":"We went for crepes. Ended up being tempted by the pastries instead. Chocolate eclairs sticky buns and blueberry muffins. All were delicious but bring your wallet."}
{"text":"My favorite Jean Phillippe is in the Bellagio. However, this just as good.   I was staying at the Aria, and needed some coffee! I had a cappuccino, and it was just fine. I didn't try any food here, but I have at the one at the Bellagio. So, I would imagine it was just as good!"}
{"text":"The choices at Jean Philippe Patisserie are very overwhelming making for freeze-brain and therefore no choice at all when trying to figure out what to snack on.  This is a good problem to have.  Their coffee is wonderful!  This was my morning staple on my past visit to Vegas since I was staying at Aria.  At $4 you will pay about what you are paying at your local Starbucks which is sad but still tasty.  They literally have everything from cookies, pastries, gelato, chocolate, nuts and even hot food.    The prices are high but if you sample small you will watch calories and your wallet."}
{"text":"Everything looks pretty good but I don't have much of a sweet tooth. $6.90 for one little piece of cake is steep and I just wasn't feeling it. The ice cream side was pretty crowded, long line. Crepe side was empty. I know that crepes aren't going to be that special anywhere, and they aren't that hard to make at home, so we ended up skipping this place altogether in favor of finding another pastry shop or \"patisserie\" on the strip. Glad we didn't get gouged. =D"}
{"text":"6/12/10 with my GF  Breakfast::   My GF: Blueberry Borodin $4 Hot coco  Me: Breakfast Panini $9.50 Coffee   Total:$25  Pro: full complete breakfast in one place.  Con: long line need to wake up early."}
{"text":"Great little bakery inside the Aria hotel. All the pastries are made fresh daily. The Napoleon was DELICIOUS! Highly recommend! Macaroons are tiny but also really good (expensive for such a tiny cookie)."}
{"text":"As an incorrigible sugar addict, you'd think I'd automatically give this patisserie five stars, but I found their goodies looked better than they tasted. I find it difficult to forgive & forget when a dedicated dessert spot disappoints me, so I won't be giving Jean Phillipe another chance.   - hot chocolate: dark chocolate flavor was overpowering. Not smooth & creamy, more like melted dark chocolate. Too much of a good thing.  - chocolate croissant: Not enough chocolate. I've had better from no-name bakeries. - chocolate-dipped rice Krispy treats: though the shiny, sexy chocolate glistened beautifully, the flavor was dull & chalky.   Everything was so, so average. I expected more from a place where chocolate fountains flow freely."}
{"text":"What's Great:  Everything looks really pretty here and the gelato was really good.  I tried the mango passion and it was super flavorful.  Nothing was bad, but the pastries were just ok, not super impressive.  I had the Royal (creme brulee with chocolate mousse) and it tasted fine.  Same with the nutella and sugar brioche.  I like the brioche at Satura much better.    The crepe was flat, really flat, as if it was ironed down...skip it.  Logistics was lacking.  There are really 2 lines, but no signs.  Most people got in one line while the other line was empty..."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough that Jean Philippe Patisserie was located at the Bellagio. We visited this place three times during our stay and loved all of their gelato selections. We've tried their cookies & creme, wild berry, mango, tiramisu, chocolate, and creme brulee. I noticed several people were complaining about the long wait line, but please be patient! There's a lot of great flavors to choose from!   Overall, I think if you are in Vegas you should definitely check this place out. The desserts are pricey, but you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Used to be worth it, but not sure anymore. yeah, it's famous and next to the Conservatory. It's also crowded, slow, and pricey. However, it's a billion times better than any buffet, so up to you if it's worth it. I might stop in again if the line isn't too long."}
{"text":"Curiosity at it's best.  This place is always packed.  Located in the Bellagio, I walked by this place in the morning and late at night and the line is always long.  Gelato, tortes, muffins, crepes, chocolate boxes, etc you can find a sweet something for anyone.   I caved in and got in line for a nutella souffle crepe.  It was actually meh.  I guess it's my own fault for ordering something so generic but I wasn't impressed with how thick the crepe was.    I mean, I still ate it all but I wish I tried something else.  I still recommend for you to try this place though, I mean...you have to!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I ordered the mixed berry crepe and it was delicious with fresh raspberries and whipped cream, the negative was the 20 min wait but it was worth it, yummmy!"}
{"text":"I just returned from staying at the Aria Hotel in Vegas and what a experience it was browsing through the Jean Phillippe Patisserie.  The man is brilliant.  I just couldn't believe the array of desserts, chocolates and fascinating cakes. Boy would I love to be in this guys mind when he creates these exotic treats. Not only desserts, but delicious sandwiches and different salads.  My boyfriend and I shared a chicken ceasar salad and it  was so delicious.  Generous portions of chicken and just very tasty.  I did try a chocolate mousse with marshmallows on top and a hint of banana.  I would have bought the chocolate eclair, but I knew once I started I would not stop.  I bought my all time favorite which was the coconut macaroons and devoured 3 and saved one for my boyfriend.  It was just too much, Willy Wonka probably couldn't keep up with all the deliciouus chocolates and goodies.  I am coming back for sure, but very disappointed that the website does not seem to be working.  I was looking forward to browsing, but it is not working at this time."}
{"text":"This is the #1 bakery in the Business Insider article for NV. (Inside the Bellagio) While their pastries were very good (and a tad expensive) it was the most impersonal from all the other bakeries we've tried on BS's list. I understand they are busy but the cashier didn't even look up at us. He was told the pasties we bought, told us our total, had us sign the receipt, and promptly moved on. They would have gotten the 4th star had they had all their pastries out when we went back the next morning."}
{"text":"Very tasty bakery. I tried several of their baked items and had a savory crepe.  It was all top notch albeit a bit overpriced.  The pastries were incredible."}
{"text":"Negatives:  1. Nearby seating is very limited and there are no highchairs available for children 2. Servers are not very aware of ingredients for allergies (if your allergy is severe you may need to be ask a lot of questions)  My Experience: When I first went by on a Tuesday around 2:30pm there was a very long line. I decided to come back before we left. I came back at 4:35ish just when live music was starting in the conservatory and the fountains were playing. There was a small line for the gelato and pastries and no line for the crepes. There were lots of pastries available and all of the gelato containers had some in them with a few less than 20% left.  The crepe took about 10 minutes to be prepared. I got a savory crepe that I customized (because of an allergy to tomatoes and peppers) to include chicken, basil, pesto sauce, mushrooms. (I also mentioned that I wanted mozzarella but I didn't receive any) The servers went over my order and the two of them seemed to be discussing whether or not to charge me for an extra ingredient... one seemed to say no that would be the same as a regular order and the total was $12.95 with tax. I added a $1 tip to make it $13.95.  My buckwheat crepe was delicious and had a creamy pesto sauce (that I want to try to recreate), the chicken was spiced and my crepe was filled with chicken, tons of basil, and lots of mushrooms. The only downside was that I could tell that there were red spices in the pesto and on the chicken... which normally indicates red peppers of some kind, which I did tell the preparer I was allergic to, but wasn't pushy about. (I am not deathly allergic it just causes my eczema the flare significantly which causes me a lot of pain. And the pesto was soo good it is kinda worth it...)  All of the small tables were in use but there was a large table and I asked a man for a chair he wasn't using, my 14 month old stood on the chair next to me and ate pieces I cut off for her, she thoroughly-enjoyed the crepe too. We left very satisfied... and had no room left for a pastry... which I decided to save for our next trip but I am regretting.... I want one very badly right now...."}
{"text":"I may have walked by this place literally a hundred times without trying it. Well a friend really wanted to try it so after some consideration I choose the exotic dessert crepe for my first experience. I've had crepes in France as well as several places in the US and one of the biggest differences between France and here is the sweetness of the crepe. Here in the US the dessert crepes are very sweet but in France the crepes as well as most other pastries are much more subtle with less overpowering sweetness so you can savor the more subtle richness of the butter, the tart flavor of the berries and fruits, and all the other flavors in the dish. The crepe I had here at Jean Philippe Patisserie reminded me of those French pastries and that has been quite a rare accomplishment here in the states. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"v4ery expensive, very delicious and very original deserts and pastries... As you enter there is a massive chocolate fountain enclosed within glass, that pours, white, brown and dark chocolate, it took seven years to buid this fountain...located in one of the best hotels in vegas the bellagio -----$$$$$$$$$....you know this place is 5 starrrrs all the way...try at least once, you make your decision..."}
{"text":"Sinfully delicious.  This was my first time, and I wished I would've discovered this earlier on my previous trips to Vegas.  Oh please, please open a location on the east coast!  Crepes are expensive at around $9, but totally worth every dime.  The flavors are fresh and intense.  I had the exotic crepe, which had mango, pineapples, and cocount.  To die for!  They just opened another location in the Aria hotel, and it's less crowded than the one in the Bellagio.  I highly recommend making this stop when you're in Vegas.  One of the best bakeries I've been to in my life.  Oh yes, and they also have the world's largest chocolate fountain inside.  Worth the stop as well, even if you aren't planning to get any sweets."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off! $6 coffee served in to go paper cups and $10 desserts are unbearable to eat. We tried an Opera cake & slice of Flan. Both were gross and we did not finish even 1/3 of it. Don't waste your money. Total tourist trap!"}
{"text":"Their pastries were awesome! However, I hated the line and their management. No place to sit, but even if you found a spot it's so uncomfortable because it's crowded. Just grabbed your goodies and walk out to the right you will see lots of tables in the open space and enjoy. Whoever design this bakery didn't think about walking room. But it was cool to see the largest chocolate fountain. I wasn't impressed, but it's the largest. Their almond croissant is a must get! Crepes were okay, nothing special. Stick with the pastries! Can't go wrong with pastries... yum!"}
{"text":"I don't have much of a sweet tooth but this place deff changes that.  Well at least for me.  This is located about 5 mins into the Bellagio.  Its a very small place with a few seats for you to enjoy you bundle of sweetness.  We had just eaten lunch so we were already full which was probably a good idea or else it could have been dangerous.  We ordered some gelato which is made in house and also a pastry.   Absolutely amazing !!! and on top of that while we were eating it we were looking at the worlds largest chocolate fountain.  Incredible.  No matter how full you are if you are any where near the Bellagio you MUST visit this place."}
{"text":"I wandered in because of the giant chocolate fountain, and stayed because of all the yummy treats they showcased in their glass counters. I got one of the larger pink macarons which was stuffed with raspberries and some sort of butter cream. It was heavenly! Difficult to eat, but worth it. The line was short, the cashiers friendly and quick, and I walked out of there a happy fat kid at heart, holding a beautifully boxed snack.  They also had some interesting sandwiches and paninis - I definitely want to try the curry chicken one.   I hope to return next time I'm ever in Vegas! Stop by and grab a sweet."}
{"text":"JPP is the place to go if you love pastries. You'll be literally like a kid in a candy store. The decadent desserts are really an art form, so pleasing to the eyes and senses.  They attract a lot of tourist with their Chocolate fountain which has been certified to be the largest in the world. It's a must see and you must take an obligatory picture with it to post on your Yelp, Urbanspoon, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or whatever social networking you currently are addicted.  I had the raspberry and lime tarts, they were exquisite. I love the perfect balance of sweet and tangy in the lime tart. They also serve cakes, cookies, croissants, gelato, crepes, and other bakery goods. The only thing that disappointed me was the Americano as it was way watered down, similar to the old McDonald's coffee. Being an expensive high end Patisserie, I expected everything to be the best.  The layout needs to be redone. There is not enough space for more then one person to move about the store. You are constantly bumping into others who are taking pictures of goodies but may not be buying anything.   Sorry, one star deducted for expensive watered down Americano."}
{"text":"A must stop for me while gallivanting around Aria. I love me some mango gelato and macaroons...nomnomnom."}
{"text":"We'll first off I know this place is known for the desserts, their dessert was A+ but man their savory crepes were horrible. Very dry and not good what so ever. Unfortuanately this was the first place I passed that had food so I thought why not, it has to be good it's in the Bellagio, I wish I would have eaten somewhere else for lunch instead of the first food place I passed by, lol. The desserts are great though, that def. makes up for the food! ;-)"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about those French bakery/pastry shops, every time I step foot into one the kid in me comes out. So many beautiful, decadent displays of goodness all over. It's hard to decide what to try. On this particular occasion I was tired from walking around and needed a pick me up so I ordered an espresso and chocolate almond croissant to go and some truffles. It wasn't cheap but you get what you pay. Everything was tasty, my croissant was moist, buttery, flaky, delish, Prob one of the best I've had! The chocolate truffle was smooth and velvety, melt in your mouth goodness. The French definitely know how to create some good chocolate, I've never been disappointed by any French chocolate I've purchased, it's always lived up to it's hype. Def. try out this place if you get a chance. I visited the one in the Bellagio in the past but  I think the one in Aria is my favorite between the two. They also have crepes and other casual food items if you're hungry, but def. get yourself a dessert to go along with that, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, but since there's no option :/ Fancy decor, a bit pricey but understandable since it's in strip. When I first saw the dessert it looked so cute but when I actually tasted it it wasn't that great. I tried their cheesecake, which is decorated with white chocolate, and I was not really impressed by flavor. Their gelato was just so-so as well.  I think I will give another try if I'm in that area as I'm just dessert holic."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is not the real Ispahan from Pierre Herme but I still enjoyed it none the less.  I believe the real Ispahan is consisted of rose, raspberry, and lychee flavors but Jean Philippe's \"Rose Macaron\" (as it is called) consisted of raspberry macarons, lime infused cream, and fresh raspberries.  The filling of the Rose Macaron was different than the macarons you typically get from a pastry shop.  The texture was close to a custard filling.  The cookies were chewy with a hint of almond flavor.  The combination of the custard, fresh raspberries, and cookies blend in very well without being overly sweet.  It's definitely an afternoon treat after all the shopping!   4-star for JP's version of Ispahan."}
{"text":"Not a person hung up on sweets, but this place, oh my had amazing things! Yum!   The chocolates & pastries were amazing! The nice thing is if you need something to offset the sugar rush they have some amazing sandwiches & salads as well.    This place is definitely a grab and go place. We couldn't find anywhere to sit & eat our desserts so we had to opt to take it to a lounge. That was the downfall. We weren't thrilled about eating some yummy treats in a smoke filled lounge. No good, but no choice. :(   If you have a sweet tooth this is the place for you! If you stay in a nearby hotel they serve breakfast items as well."}
{"text":"Hello!?! It's JEAN PHILLIPE!!! My eyes were just going bonkers looking at all the different chocolates that were available. The desserts were so eye catching and tons of souvenirs!!! They have food such as salads, sandwiches, etc. Along with coffee and tea selections. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and so kind. I had the Opera (chocolate mousse type cake) and a vanilla eclair. THE VANILLA ECLAIR IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! The cream is on the thicker side and it's the perfect size for your buck! The cafe latte is very good too, smooth and creamy and perfect with the sweet desserts.   Souvenir wise I got the coconut and chocolate macaroons, white chocolate covered pistachios, and coconut tuilles. Every single one of them was so good! The chocolate is such high quality and not too sweet. Gotta stop by whether you buy something or not!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and we got the espresso with whip cream and cinnamon on top. The pastries looked amazing I will definitely go back and try them."}
{"text":"Waiting in line for 45-60 minutes, you tell yourself that this had better be one hell of a crepe. It's pretty fair, but a poor value for the time and money."}
{"text":"I came here while I was staying at the Aria for couple of days. I have tried the chocolate croissant and the Nutella brioche. Both of them were delicious the brioche was too much for one person to finish on their own but it's amazing. This place has some of the most beautiful looking pastries I have ever seen. It is a little expensive but I will recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Yeah, this patisserie in Bellagio has the world's tallest chocolate fountain and attracts a lot of Vegas visitors. During our most recent visit to Vegas, we tried cafe latte, Napoleon cake and dulce de leche ice cream.  Coffee was good; ice cream and the cake were okay at best. Somehow this place has failed to impress me. Don't get me wrong, the ambience is classy, and they know for sure how to wrap the cakes in beautiful boxes, they how to decorate and present desserts. But not too impressed with how they taste."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is the bomb! I watched a youtube of him talking about his vision and his shops and just by the way he talks, you know he's legit. Just by the way he talks, it sounds like he is drooling himself.   Ordered 4 items from here and boy was every piece sooo delicious!   1) Royal crepe - consisted of chicken and bacon with sauce and mushrooms drizzled with alfredo sauce  This was the savoury crepe and boy was it sooo good. Definitely recommend for all those alfredo lovers. You will not be left disappointed!  2) Souffle Berry crepe  This was the sweet crepe and this was also very good. The custard inside that bad boy was sooo good. Not too sweet and full of flavor. The crepe was cooked perfectly. Definitely recommend this as well!  3) Opera signature pastry  If you love hazelnut and Nutella, you'll love this dessert! hazelnut galore!! There a nice big dark chocolate truffle to enjoy that's on top of the slice. Definitely recommend!  4) Nutella Brioche  Very fresh brioche bread stuffed with Nutella powdered with sugar. Very simple but sooo delicious! This is more carb heavy but I'd still recommend this!"}
{"text":"I must say the whole look of the place is impressive.  Larger, and more choices then the Bellagio location.  My husband and I went walking the strip just see the new digs since we had been there 10 years ago. We walked into Aria and saw Jean Philippe. Our eyes went big with excitement.  Walk around the entire spot. Your will be captivated by all the different delights.  Whatever you may be craving they have a dessert for that.  We decided on the gelatto which was reasonably price considering some other spots on the strip. We had the strawberry and lemon. It was totally refreshing!  Just what you need during a midnight walk in 100 degree heat.  I am coming back to try the crepes which looked amazing  from my neighbors plate.  Staff served us quickly. Prices were fare for what you get. I liked watching the video on how they make their desserts.  So many good choices to pick from.  Prices range from inexpensive to moderate based on what you pick."}
{"text":"Had a delicious Nutella strawberry crepe here. They made the crepe on the griddle in front of you, which made it feel even more fresh. At $13.50 ($10-11 for many others) it was a bit pricy, though.   They also have pre-packaged chocolates, sundaes, ice cream, and savory (aka meal-like) crepes for sale.  Note that for the crepes, there is not clear signage, but you must pay at the register first and then they will make the crepe for you."}
{"text":"This place is a must-visit for foodies and lovers of sweets who visit LV.  I stayed at the ARIA the last time I was in town for MAGIC and as soon as I saw this place, I knew where all my money would end up!  First off, the place is adorable -- they have cakes and macaron towers on pedestal as decor.  On one side they have all of the \"opera\" style desserts, and these mini desserts are works of art.  They taste just as good as they look.  Of course, the raspberry macaron is a must, but the tutti frutti is divine as well.  They also have salads and sandwhiches, which are quite yummy as well.  In the middle is a coffee bar and a candy gift shop, with chocolates, marshmellows, etc.  And on the other side of that they have a gelato and crepe bar.  It doesn't get anymore perfect than that!  The only thing that didn't impress me was the service at one point.  I asked for a macaron and they gave me a fruit tart (and I HATE fruit tarts), and the manager was pretty rude when I went back and asked to exchange it.  However, I'm giving them 5-stars anyways because I'd be lying if I said I would never go back!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie at The Bellagio hotel is a dessert lovers dream come true! Glorious displays of flowing chocolate, exquisite 'couture' cakes, and meticulously decorated treats adorn this lovely place. The chocolates and pastries are consistently delicious and beautifully executed!   I am a huge fan of the raspberry accented rose water macaron--I have had this wonderful confection several times over the years and it always looks and tastes as perfect as the previous visit! Nerd alert: I am so enamored by the beauty of this macaron that I photograph it every time I get it! Haha as if 10+ photos of the same thing is not enough ;)!  The strawberry and lemon gelato are very refreshing and I would recommend pairing them together!  Be prepared to wait in line for at least ten minutes--it's worth every mouthwatering second!  À bientôt Jean Philippe! I will be back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was delightful.  Minus one star because it is expensive, very expensive.  that said, it was a treat.  Great way to get started in Vegas. Their crapes are absolutely delicious. I had the nutella and banana. so. freakin. good."}
{"text":"My husband came home from a business trip and brought me a Hazelnut Chocolate Bouchee'.  I am still dreaming about it.  If you see this little nugget of chocolate sorcery don't think about it, just get it and shove it in your pie-hole. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  If you have kids with you, then you should take them here.  The kids will love the chocolate waterfall, and all of the cute cakes and desserts that they have on display (I took a ton of pictures- my daughter really liked the Belle and Hello Kitty ones).  My husband and I ordered crepes and coffee.  I had a white chocolate mocha and it was awesome- the syrup was yummy, and I'm very picky about my coffee.  My husband had the banana foster crepe and I had the mixed berry crepe.  We were both happy with portions to taste to value.  The crepes were a little pricey- but I thought well worth it for the presentation and quality.     Only downside?  This place can get crowded, so get here early, or come during off hours.  We came between 10 and 11 AM and it was still busy.  While they were making our food we went to check out the indoor gardens inside Bellagio.  It took about 15- 20 minutes for our crepes to be ready.  Next time I'm here I wan to try some of the desserts.  :)"}
{"text":"I didn't know they had one in the Aria hotel. I was actually on my way to have breakfast at the Silk Road in the Vdara, but stopped when I saw the array of pastries and the crepes being served.  I got the exotic crepe - mango and passionfruit sauce with coconut sorbet - for breakfast and stopped for a nutella brioche to take home. Everything looked so good and as I expected, everything was delicious.  They were quick, clean, fancy, and the dining area was gorgeous and modern. I was surprised by its affordability."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their mocha latte, especially after a long night of poker.  :)  I haven't tried their food, but I will the next time I get."}
{"text":"This place is truly a model of inefficiency. I came in looking to just buy a couple pastries, a nutella brioche and almond croissant, and it ended up taking over 20 minutes. I had to wait for them to make a handful of hot sandwiches before they could make the effort to hand over the pastries that they had already bagged for me. They didn't even heat them up, so that certainly wasn't the cause of the hold up. When we finally got the pastries, it took another 5 minutes to pour us the cup of milk we had ordered when we paid (again, 20 minutes ago).  As for the food, the almond croissant was tasty, but the nutella brioche was so over the top decadent. I needed a full cup of milk to get it down.  Lots of seating. Maybe I'd come back if there was no line, but I find that doubtful considering how slowly they get their food out. I normally think that the star rating should be weighted much more heavily on food than service, but when it's this bad, it dampens the whole experience."}
{"text":"A few days before I had some chocolate (omg yummy) and now I decided to try some food. I got the Salmon sandwich and some iced tea. The price of course was super expensive (like every other place in Vegas). The people were kind of rude but honestly I think that is all of Vegas too. The food was ok, it was good for a quick grab and go pick me up. But nothing to write home about. Def something to try at least once."}
{"text":"Prices are on the high side, but I was expecting this of any store in the Cosmopolitan. This bakery is booming with business, as it should be. Their display items are pieces of art and their store is decorated very beautifully. It was so hard to decide what to get because I literally wanted everything and their selection is huge."}
{"text":"And I'm back again! I was craving it for two years since my last visit to Vegas!  Eclairs are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Very pretty desserts, albeit way overpriced. I bought two items and the total came out to over $20. That being said, they were good, and not too sweet. I wish there was more seating, but since it is in a casino, it seems to be more than usual. We ordered the strawberry tart, which came with a toasted marshmellowy topping and a creme brulee, which came in a little jar. Being from NYC, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary to me, but good enough for dessert."}
{"text":"i got both the chocolate croissant and the sticky bun on separate mornings and thought they were both phenomenal. if i had another chance id just get a regular croissant to see how that was executed. the hype is real  orange juice was fresh squeezed and not acidic at all  its a little pricey but so is 95% of vegas  JEANS: OK by far ORDER: counter"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of pastries and other breakfast treats. Pricey but in line with most places in Vegas. The first time I came here two years ago the yogurt parfait was Vanilla bean and in a shallow bowl; the new version does not even compare, it's too bad they changed it."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas you have to stop by here and try some of the great desserts!  There are two locations to choose from; one at the Bellagio and another one at the Aria. I prefer the location in the Aria. This location is nicely spread out and there are a lot of seats to enjoy your dessert. All of the items are beautifully displayed, the time put into each item is apparent. Everything I have tried here has been great. However, expect to wait a little while in line. It does get pretty crowded."}
{"text":"After eating at Social House I wanted to get a dessert so I used my handy dandy yelp app and proceeded to check what was around me. Jean Philippe came up and had great reviews so I had to check this place out.   Upon finding this place you will first see the huge chocolate fountain which is the world's largest. Didn't care to take any pictures like the rest of the tourist because I'm a man on a mission when I want some sweets. So I ordered the snicker cake and the red velvet cupcake.   The snicker cake was amazing. Moist and it was exactly like eating a snickers just in a moist cake form but the Red Velvet cupcake was the BEST! I've never had anything like this before because it doesn't look like a traditional cupcake. The cupcake is actually at the bottom. I'll be back because I want to try the crepes and gelatos as well."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the 15 min line. Their gelato was very good. I recommend their mango flavor. They also had a wide selection of chocolates and pastries as well. Not sure about the price but it's Vegas, everything is expensive."}
{"text":"This particular location is extremely poorly managed and organized, making the overall experience very poor. Lines for different stations open without rhyme or reason, and also without announcement from the staff. After waiting at the gelato station for quite a while, we finally inquired and found that only one line was open for all items. Then, after waiting in that line for 20 minutes, the woman taking orders recommended that we go back to the gelato counter instead of waiting where we were. After this huge ordeal, we finally got our overpriced gelato which was already melted and dripping everywhere. I'd try the Aria location; it couldn't possibly be worse. The manager of this place should be made to walk the plank."}
{"text":"We were on our way out of Aria when I just happened to spot this place. So glad I decided to stop but, it took me awhile to figure out what I wanted. I ended getting the Tiramisu, it was delicious. Will have to try some more items next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Love love love their desserts! I can eat their desserts everyday if they weren't that pricey. I've tried their raspberry macaroon and carrot cake. They were absolutely TO DIE FOR. They were tasty yet still light. I'd definitely go back every now and then when I need a treat! Their coffee/latte are pretty pricey too, expect at least 4 bucks for a cup of hot latte. The only negative thing about this place is the staff aren't that friendly and for the price you pay for the desserts, I expect full service than self-serve."}
{"text":"had a pricey cheesecake it was rich and sweet the oreo crust was good ordered a white chocolate mocha as well, used too much syrup way too sweet..  service was slow, they had my order ready sitting on a tray on their counter and i couldn't get it because not one employee has enough initiative to hand it to me so i stood there for a few minutes food paid for just waiting for nothing...."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place. I'm still giving it 4 stars because it was good, but it wasn't that good. I had expectations that the baked goods and chocolates would absolutely blow my mind. It didn't.  I'd definitely go back if I were nearby and wanted good chocolate or baked goods, but I wouldn't make it a destination to visit."}
{"text":"I went here twice. Once, to try a savory crepe late at night, and once in the morning for some breakfast.   I got the forest crepe that had scrambled egg, ham and cheese... - bleh.  They put ONE tiny egg in there, and it's not scrambled at all. it just heats up in the crepe.. they use this wheat mix that I am not fond of. It's kind of stiff and it really tastes like wheat or barley... it has a slide resemblance to ethiopian injera except it's not fermented...either way it's no go for me. flavor's off, it's bland... no.   Breakfast: I got a few different things to try for breakfast and on the road croque monsieur- do not get this. It's not tasty, it's pre made and it's ...sad. cheese danish- REALLY tasty. nutella brioche- YUMMMM..but a LOT of nutella inside SMALL white chocolate mocha  So that breakfast that I got all ended up being 24 bucks. Holy hell, that's expensive. I didn't realize the small mocha would be 5 bucks. I would pay 5 dollars for a good mocha but it just wasn't that good either.  If you're getting a small sweet pastry like a danish or a croissant or something like that, by all means, but as far as food goes, skip, skip, SKIP! They are super over priced for a place that has pre-made EVERYTHING.  I think i'd only go here for their sweets like gelato or their pastries. Other than that, DO NOT WANT."}
{"text":"IT'S A SWEET HAVEN FOR DESSERT LOVERS!  The gelato and chocolate treats are delicious. Some of the pastries are hit-or-miss. With all the \"eye-candy\" that's in front of you, I say try something and don't look back!"}
{"text":"Tons of options!!!! Love it and what a great dessert display! Like the fact that they had a mini dessert sampler too! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Its very pretty and tasty looking place but i prefer Laduree eclairs and tarts over Jean Philippe. Will i go back ? Yes i will give it another try."}
{"text":"The coffee was fine. Not great, just fine.  The pastries, on the other hand, were a revelation. Some of the best croissants ever (chocolate--yum! almond--thank you!).   The line is sloppy, it's all a bit overpriced (but it's in the Bellagio, so what do you expect?) but if you like pastry, for God's sake, don't miss it."}
{"text":"Finally decided to eat here after walking by the chocolate fountain for the bajillionth time everytime im in vegas. Now I can finally check this off my bookmarks.   Decided to play it safe and get a classic: nutella and banana crepe. A bit pricey at around $13 but it was delicious. Not sure you can really go wrong with it though. Presentation was very nice though and of course they have some drinks that looked pretty good. Maybe next time if I win any extra money from the casinos."}
{"text":"This place is like a dried up watering hole in the oasis that is Aria, like a cold sore on the mouth of a beautiful woman, like a....you get the point.   The food and drinks are ehhhhh. Expensive and subpar is never a good start but here's the biggest issue: this place is *always* understaffed. This leads to both unnecessarily long waits for the aforementioned subpar expensive eats/drinks AND a forever scrambling staff that doesn't have time to be friendly.  Aria, I love you (Vegas love, not real love, just trashy temporary love) please put some Abreva on the cold sore that is this place and hire some more people. Oh and improving the quality of the food and drink wouldn't hurt either."}
{"text":"If you love desserts this is the place to come - from ice creams, crepes, milk shakes and specialty pastries and cakes. My husband loves ice cream and he loved his gelato - I order a sweet trio that had a cake pop, creme brûlée and a macroon. It was beautiful."}
{"text":"Your eyes will be marveled by all the decadent desserts perfectly presented to you.  You will def have to walk by all the display cases before making your selection.  The gelato and crepes are to die for and are the best I have ever had.  If you have a sweet tooth, like me, you def need to check out Jean Philippe at Arai or next doors at Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  But not bad.  We were at Bellagio, so it sounds about right.  Basically Starbucks and yogurt land, but twice as much.  Try elsewhere unless nowhere else to go."}
{"text":"The Pastries used to be amazing. Jean Philippe is a multi award winning pastry chef. He actually won a Meilleur Ourier de France Award (best pastry chef in France) Jean Philippe is no longer associated with the Aria or the Bellagio.  I knew that as soon as I looked at the pastries. We purchased two just to try and they just are pretty desserts that aren't as amazing as what I used to get here. These new Aria Pastries don't have the same details or flavors that they used to have......I used to enjoy the chocolate cupcake, blueberry cupcake and especially the lemon meringue pie and others. I used to try about three every time I was in Vegas and my husband used to purchase some to bring home when he has conferences here. I miss the artistry and the delicious pastries. This is a MIGHTY BIG LOSS to Foodies in Las Vegas.  There's no big Grand Chocolate Display in the Aria anymore either.....I am very saddened by the changes but mostly the changes to the pastry. It was something I always looked forward too. I hope in time Aria Patisserie will improve as time moves on."}
{"text":"As soon as I looked at the Pastries I knew this wasn't Jean Philippe anymore. Jean Philippe is a multi award winning Pastry Chef. He's won the Meilleur Ourier de France Award (best Pastry Chef in France) After that he became the executive Pastry Chef for the Bellagio and later Aria Hotel Casino....(they made the pastries for both locations in one kitchen) I've posted many photos for both these places because I enjoyed these places so much over the years. All that remains of Jean Phillippe in the Bellagio is his Biggest Chocolate Fountain in the world. I thought maybe one is his students might be making the pastries now so we tried a Hazelnut Pastry and a Key Lime. They weren't detailed and delicious like they used to be....Each pastry seemed to have a unique surprise that you didn't expect. I used to LOVE the Lemon Meringue and the Blue berry Cupcake....They were like no other.  These new Bellagio desserts are not the same. Not even close to what was sold here under Jean Phillippe. The change is a Great Big LOSS for Foodies in Las Vegas. So saddened over the change."}
{"text":"I am here only for their desserts. I am not a dessert person but am definitely impressed by its cute decorations! After passing by it one time, I decided to give it a try. I ordered a scoop of coconut gelato and love it very much. I want to go back and try other flavors of gelato and cakes next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"My love affair with Jean Phillipe first started almost five years ago when I discovered the quaint little eatery in the back of the Bellagio.  My love affair with Aria began the minute I saw his name and plunged into obsession when I frequented this location.  Some of the most delicious desserts out there as well as the most visually appealing, (you almost cry eating them).  My favorite is the sugar free fruit tart.  I also love the crepes and gelato.    My family and I bought several desserts one night and had a tasting feast.  I heard no complaints."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, a very popular brunch spot. The kiosk is beautiful, resplendent even. The food however, is not necessarily worth the wait. While there are paninis for sale, they're far from anything special. Cheesecake and tiramisu were nothing to write home about either. However, we did have a raspberry torte which was excellent. Overall, neat to drop by and take pictures if you're at the Belaggio, but not worth a special trip. The taste does not live up to the presentation, as with many things in Vegas."}
{"text":"Croque Monseur was delicious....perfectly balanced with smoky ham and toasted bread with melted cheese and lightly sauced.   Also loved their blueberry muffin!  Must come back for dessert & coffee."}
{"text":"I had always walked past this place at Bellagio and thought \"tourist trap\" with the huge chocolate fountain.  It wasn't until one night after a show I came here and had a crepe did I discover it was much more than that!  They have a nice selection of chocolates, crepes (sweet and savory) and gelato in addition to hot drinks.  My first visit I got a banana foster-like crepe and it was very good, especially the fresh whipped cream which melted into the crepe!  On my second visit I had gelato which I was shocked was priced at a competitive level to a Baskin Robbins ice cream for much higher quality!   I think that if you are at \"The B\" this is totally a place to satisfy any sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Small little patisserie off to the side in the Aria Hotel. A great place to grab a dessert and coffee and people watch for a moment.  Went after a show, and was thrilled to see they were open late!  Even at 11PM they were still busy! Really busy!  At the end of the day, the selection was pretty picked over, with only 3-4 different items in the case. I understand, you do not want to have leftovers. We picked from that selection and had a flan dessert and a little chocolate nipple looking thing. Both were pretty good. At 11PM after a show, they were perfect. To be honest, they tasted like they had been there in the case all day, and they probably had.   The seating area was very comfortable, and sits slightly above a busy casino walkway. SO people watching, while enjoying your dessert may very well be the best part of relaxing here for a moment!"}
{"text":"We have been at the Aria for 4 days.  This place is positioned perfectly in that it's next to elevators.  We've had macaroons, gelato, croissants, and a hazelnut tart.  All have been very good."}
{"text":"Sometimes things just fail so completely. We are long time fans of Jean Philippe. It is usually the first place we go when we land and usually the last place we go before we leave. Often I take home treats for my family from here, but if this were the first time I tried JP I would never return. I don't blame the gentleman that took our order using one of those mobile ordering pads but it was the first problem. While he was trying to get this marvel of technology and convenience to take our order at least 8-10 people passed us in line and were served before we even had our order placed. They took our name but never called our name and our order sat on the counter getting cold before my husband finally asked if it was ours. The real disappointment came with the salmon on the salmon crepe (my go to order). The smell alone was off putting and it was so fatty and fishy I pushed aside and just ate what I could of the now cold crepe. The palmier was still wonderful and the coffee was good just too cold. I haven't given up on this place by any means but they need to keep a closer eye on quality. Even yesterday the brioche was stale at the Jean Philippe in Aria (though the rest was good)."}
{"text":"I'm a regular! Yes indeed... every time I go to Vegas, I make a stop or two or three at Jean Philippe. And now I have 2 locations to choose from!   I always order a berry crepe. Most of the time I order one of their fancy schmancy pastries as well. Those pastries are so pretty sometimes, I feel bad for eating them!!! Good thing that feeling only lasts for a second, because the second I take a bite, I forget how pretty they are and focus on how yummy they are.  Definitely worth the trip here. Minus one star for the prices. Yes, I get that their leases are astronomical, but my paycheck is not."}
{"text":"Read as 3.75  The layout of the shop/food is very pretty with lots to look at. The service is hit or miss and the prices are high. The plain croissant took me back to the first introduction I ever had to a croissant at a bakery whose name I can't remember that was on College Ave. that Toni took me to as a kid. Anything that brings back a visceral memory is rare and awesome.   The lattes were decent and my sweet husband went downstairs to get one for me every day of our stay. We were also treated to a box of what I think are JPP chocolates by The Aria as a gift for my birthday. My husband hogged the entire 8(or 10) pieces so I can't attest to how they taste, but the fact he didn't share spoke volumes.   Aside from the price and hit or miss service, this place is probably in the top 3 of positives of the Aria Hotel experience."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming here. You can order a crepe either sweet or savory. Either choice is delicious. The pastries are out of this world. My personal favorite is the fruit tart. Simple, deliciously. Simply delicious!  Their displays are always amazing and the food is fresh. Whether you order a ready made sandwich, salad, pastry, crepe, coffee or anything in between, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Solid gelato place to chill and satisfy your sweet tooth!  I decided to bypass the \"eye candy\" during my trip and go for good ole' fashioned gelato. I had the pistachio and dulce de leche - both were soft, creamy and veryyy rich.   I will be more adventerous the next time I come back :P"}
{"text":"Ok first off this place is just way too foo foo for me as a guy, but for the women it's bright colorful and cheery, you'll love it.  The pastries are simply superb and the cakes are artistic masterpieces, with prices to match, but if that's your thing and price is no object... go for it.  Ok so we ordered three croissants, one was original (plain) and the other was an almond covered and finally a chocolate chip filled.  The flakiness on all three were excellent and I must say that it lived up to what we were told about them, for me they were the best tasting croissants I have ever tasted.  We were told about this place because of the worlds largest chocolate fountain and that in itself was well worth seeing, a very dazzling display. It had glass bowls shaped and made to look like large ice chip shaped bowls.   There are three different types of chocolate flowed from three separate chrome rectangular spouts, White, Dark, and Milk Chocolate.  Ok, so the croissants were excellent, they had just the right flakiness and they were very fresh tasting, the glaze on them was perfect and not to thick and sticky. The almonds were slivered and not to many, just the right amount to have flavor in every bite. The chocolate chips were also evenly distributed and did not overwhelm the flavor of the croissant  at all.  We also ordered the coffee, it was great, smooth and full flavored, seconds were in order for sure.  I took back to the hotel (for my after dinner dessert snack) a Chocolate/Coconut Macaroon. It was about the size of a golf ball.  I'm glad it wasn't bigger because it would have been a shame to throw it all away, Sorry to say the flavor combo here just didn't work for me. Not that I like it very sweet, but the something was missing, maybe the flavor of the chocolate was too bitter, but I'll have to say personally I would not get this again.  When we go back to Vegas we will definitely return here, there are so many more things to try. They also have Gelato, bottled chocolate from the fountain, Macaroons, custom cakes (large and small of all styles and ideas imaginable). It was all decked out in fall decor, the staff was helpful but a bit on the rude side. It's a small shop so it get's really over crowded very fast, not much seating inside but there are small tables outside of it down the hall, but I think they are for the restaurant patrons?   So all in all it's a must try.  TC"}
{"text":"The location at Bellagio is far superior, although sin e this one is larger, it has more options. Coffee is not the worst served in a casino, but it's not good. Gelato is good, lots of flavors, and food quality. Oreo is probably the best. Service isn't consistent, sometimes we've been ignored for 10 - 15 minutes while employees clean or make more gelato. Those things are important, but making the gelato is pointless if you aren't going to bother selling it. Bellagio location serves noticably larger portions, so you feel less ripped-off after dropping $10 on a scoop for each child."}
{"text":"Love this little pastry shop in Aria.   Had a couple of myvegas vouchers, one for crepes and another for pastries.    Came during mid morning, was pretty busy with many people ordering coffee and breakfast items.    Ordered a berry crepe with a side of coconut Gelato.  They put a lot of berries including blueberry, raspberry and strawberries.  With a bit of whipped cream and coconut ice cream, each bite was like heaven.  The Gelato has little bits of coconut shavings, and was really strong in coconut taste.   For pastries we got a rose macaron and blueberry brioche.  The macaron had a nice flavour of rose, paired with the fresh raspberries. It was a little difficult to eat since it was so big, kinda didn't know where to start.  The blueberry brioche was moist with lots of blueberries.    Would definitely recommend the crepes if you come here.  I've tried both the savoury and dessert before and definitely love the dessert one more.  Maybe because I have a sweet tooth! :)"}
{"text":"I have probably eaten at Jean Philippe over 20 times while playing poker at the Aria.  They deliver to the poker room so its the most affordable food in the casino by far.    I usually get the Cobb salad or chicken pesto sandwich.  The food is mediocre at best but the real beauty of Jean Philippe is the dessert section.   The dessert display is a 10/10 and it is extremely tempting to grab every time I walk by.   They have an amazing chocolate, pastry, and ice cream selection.   Some of my favorites are the chocolate scone, Canelle chocolate, chocolate cheesecake, and chocolate macaroons.  All of the desserts are pretty expensive.  It can add up to $30 quick if you are grabbing a few for you and some one else.    The food is pretty reasonable at around 10 dollars a meal but as I previously mentioned, it isn't too tasty in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my parents one morning and these were the best crepes we have ever had.   The place itself is really nice--chocolate decorations everywhere, huge cupcakes, etc. I really liked the decor and ambiance.   My dad got the veggie omelette and my mom got the mushroom crepe. The mushroom crepe was absolutely phenomenal. I would definitely get it again. The veggie omelette was alright. For myself, I got the chocolate crepe. It comes with whipped cream and chocolate drizzled on top along with brownie pieces. I must say, this was the best sweet crepe I have ever had. It was so good, I did not even care about how many calories it was. I would eat it again and again and again.   I also got a chocolate cupcake. It had chocolate mousse on the inside which melted into the cake itself. It was aesthetically pleasing to look at as well.   The downside to this place is that the crepes cost a lot. It was $12-$14 each. The cupcake was $6 or $7, don't remember. But definitely, DEFINITELY, check this place out if you have a sweet tooth. It will make all your sugar dreams come true!"}
{"text":"Beautiful desserts.  I wish that I enjoyed sweets.  I actually consider myself lucky that I only like looking at them.  My husband on the other hand, likes sweets.  So we waited in the long line for a scoop of ice cream.  I only had a taste of his ice cream.  I thought it was a bit grainy.   I love the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"This place is great, the service is fast and have a wide selection of gelato. The best part of this is the experience of seeing the pâtissière make the crepes in front of you. Highly recommend this place for those with a sweet tooth after a nice hearty dinner."}
{"text":"Avoid the cheesecake. Was a little too soft and not very much like regular cheesecake.  Plus it is quite expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Such a darling place with cute little desserts! My husband and I got the cheesecake and cinnamon bun. They were definitely a speciality dessert which you pay for. They were both yummy, but not anything that blew us away."}
{"text":"Delicious. So many things to choose from. I wanted one of everything. I ended up ordering the blueberry cupcake and a tiramisu.  The cupcake was amazing. Everything about it was perfect. I haven't tried the tiramisu, but when I do - I'll edit my review. The display was beautiful and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Anyone with a sweet tooth should come here! We loved the food here. We came here for breakfast and had:  Chocolate croissant Chocolate crepe Hazelnut crepe Dulce de leche crepe  They were all wonderful. Just know that everything is really rich and filling, so you won't feel like eating anything sweet for the rest of the day, lol. The staff are really nice and keep the long line moving along pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Since we visited for the coffee, I'll start with that first.  The 16 oz latte with almond milk I ordered was too hot to touch and to garner the full coffee flavor.  The coffee was definitely burned.   On the other hand, the key lime was (delightfully) light - not overbearingly sweet - and delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to stop when in Vegas!  Desserts are incredibly good, fresh, and pretty.  Just be prepared to spend $20 on a mocha and two pastries.  Well worth it when you're on vacation.  I especially liked their ham and cheese croissant.  It was amazingly moist, fluffy and flavorful - the best ham and cheese croissant I've ever had, also the most expensive!  The nutella brioche was OK.  I thought it could have been more moist and more nutella-filled.  I wish I got to try their crepes and gelato!"}
{"text":"I went there while I was in Vegas last week and the atmosphere was great, but the pastries and cakes were very overpriced. I got the \"flan\" and it didn't even taste like flan. It was very dry and the cream tasted like creme brulee almost. I don't know if the other pastries are good, but from my experience, I do NOT recommend the flan."}
{"text":"This patisserie (that also has a branch at the Bellagio) is my favorite in Vegas. The nutella crêpes are the best. I can also recommend the chocolate strawberries and coconut macaroons."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the little treat I purchased for myself. I was sad when the fountain wasn't on. It was out of order due to cleaning.  The staff seemed a bit frustrated with the lines and there isn't much organization with how you order and which line you stand in.   Regardless...The pastry was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! We got breakfast here everyday while staying at Aria in Vegas. Their vanilla sugar crepe us delicious. Add a scoop of gelato and it's perfect!"}
{"text":"The pistachio tart and vanilla eclair were absolutely phenomenal. i absolutely adore this place. Their creative desserts have not disappointed my past two visits."}
{"text":"Super delicious! A bit pricey but worth the experience. The crepes are oh-so-yummy. And even the gelato! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!  There are crazy art pieces made of chocolate decorating the place along with goodies for sale to make your mouth water!  Its pretty much like being inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory :)  We sampled several baked goods and a mocha and everything looks and tastes as good as it looks!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Three of us had played our way to a MyVegas free pastry reward (I ended up with 48,500 LP by the end of our trip), so we stopped by to pick up our free pastry on our last day in Vegas. You have to stop by the MLife Rewards desk in the Aria before getting your free pastry, which wasn't a huge deal as they're actually very close to each other.   The reward gives you 1 signature pastry or 2 croissants/muffins. We all went with 1 signature pastry and shared them all. My favorite was definitely the strawberry tart. It's sweet, light, and very refreshing. I love berry tarts!   Would I pay $8 for a pastry here if I didn't have the deal? Definitely not. But since it was free, I enjoyed definitely enjoyed it. Or maybe I'm just a jaded New Yorker??"}
{"text":"My brother was nice enough to bring me back some goodies from Vegas. A box of assorted macaroons and rice krispies. They weren't your ordinary sweets.. OHEMGEE.. they were bomb dotcom! The rice krispies were partly covered in sweet ,dark chocolate and yummy melted marshmallow. Surprisingly they weren't too sweet compared to regular rice krispies. Then there were the macaroons... ohsogood.. they came in 4 different flavors: pistachio, coffee, raspberry, and chocolate. All four were absolutely delectable, but my faves had to be pistachio and raspberry.   Btw, macaroons are my current guilty pleasures! S'more pleeease???  =)"}
{"text":"Review #093 - 2017  I was actually really disappointed when I showed up with my girlfriend and her husband on Monday, May 1st, around 9:30 PM to grab some gelato because it was so hot outside.   I waited in line to ask if I could taste the hazelnut gelato and it was warm.  I asked the girl if they knew that the ice cream was half melted and she replied, \"yeah, our freezer's not working very well.\"    Ok, I'm sorry, but this is the Bellagio and this is some pretty dang expensive gelato.  How can they just expect their customers to pay for some half ass excuse of a gelato??    If the freezers aren't functioning properly, then they shouldn't be selling the gelato.  Why try to sell poor quality stuff and end up losing customers because of it?  The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because I ended up buying my daughter a 16-ounce cup of whole milk for $3 and the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"Doubt you will find a patisserie of this caliber in all of the United States. Reason why Aria tapped Jean Philippe. Simply the BEST. Anything you order will be of pure perfection. I really would love to write a review of at least one item you should order. But it's difficult to say .. everything here is that amazing. MUST VISIT in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten something that blew your mind to the point where you repeat \"Oh my God\" several times in a minute?  I just had that experience at Jean Philippe's.  The best way to express my feelings at this moment is to describe it--I feel like I've taken a bite of heaven, and the sugar Gods are dancing on my tongue.  I know.  You're wondering if I'm over exaggerating.  I believe that this place has the best brioche I've ever eaten.  The rest of the stuff is great, don't get me wrong.  The chocolates are lovely and creamy with the right bitterness to the chocolate, and their pastries are light, creamy, and made with love.  Their gelatos are perfect and to add a scoop into a white chocolate-dipped cone is pure heaven.  But this review is given with thanks to that beautiful, lovely, edible cloud of bread known as their sugar brioche.  What blows my mind about this brioche is the sugar crystals on the bread.  I cannot believe the texture on this thing.  First, you pull apart the brioche and you see how soft it is inside.  There are these beautiful crystals of sugar all around it that compliment the yeasty flavor.  The sugar isn't hard crystallized sugar, but some sort of cooked down and dried sugar that's broken up again and the brioche is rolled around in it.  The texture of the sugar with the soft interior is wonderful.  The cinnamon rolls are very popular and fortunately I bought the last one.  Their cream cheese is nice, and the roll looks pretty big.  Nice flavor, flaky outside, and sticky.  I love it.  Overall, great patisserie and one I'll return to time and again.  If you aren't into the flaky croissants or fancy chocolates, steer clear.  Otherwise I suggest a sugar brioche, croissant, gelato, a few truffles and a cinnamon roll for a huge, sweet indulgence."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery in the already stunning hotel/casino. The world's largest fountain of chocolate is as pretty as people makes it out to be and is worth a walk to come by and look. All the pastries and sandwiches are also crafted very artfully. The price is exactly what you would expect in the Bellagio (High).  (1) Never again --- (10) Always anytime  - Strawberry n Cream Tart (8) - Turkey Club Croissant (8) - Smoked Salmon with Dill/Chives cheese on Brioche (9) - Choco-banana Tart (7)  Expensive, but very tasty. After a long walk in the hot Nevada sun, a stop by this bakery for a light lunch is perfect. The crepes look yummy. I would visit this place again and reccomend it to friends."}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate lover this is your domain. Very ornate and decadent desserts.  I certainly do appreciate the hard work and artistry that go into these desserts but for me, they are just too rich.  I did try the actual food here too, a turkey sandwich on a croissant which was topped with cranberry sauce. Very fresh and delicious but the price seemed to be too high for what was received.  Overall its a great place for desserts and crepes if you have a sweet tooth. It also has some great sandwich options... but be prepared to pay."}
{"text":"Love the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. This location is much smaller than the one at Aria, but has a constant line for a reason: the pastries, desserts, crepes, coffees, and chocolates are divine.  Hordes of people crowd around to take pictures of the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (according to the strange folks at Guiness), but I was more mesmerized by the fresh crepes, croissants, and cupcakes. We enjoyed a late breakfast 2 days in a row featuring pastries from Jean Philippe and wish we had stayed at the Bellagio longer just to have more.   * Palmier - Flaky, crisp cookie covered with caramelized sugar 5/5  * Croissant - Light and airy with a butter flavor to melt in your mouth 4/5  * Almond Croissant - Filling Crème D'amandes; sprinkled with sugar & almonds 5/5  * Chocolate Croissant - Jean Philippe chocolate + croissant = yum 3.5/5  * Blueberry Brioche - Surprisingly addictive slice of bread with blueberries 3/5  * Blueberry Danish - Light shell and heavy fruit jam heaven 4/5  * Latte - Pick me up of espresso & steamed milk to start the day 4/5  * White Cafe Mocha - Sweet mocha (espresso & chocolate) with White Chocolate 5/5  There are two locations and both on Yelp list Aria as the address when in fact the one with the chocolate fountain is in the Bellagio.  Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio was perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio and EVERY SINGLE MORNING for a 4 days I went down the Jean Philippe and picked up coffee and breakfast for us and we enjoyed our treats by the pool.   I fell in LOVE with the sugar brioche.  I had it the 1st day I went there and every day since!!  My husband enjoyed the bfast sandwich type thing.  I think it was ham and something else but it was buttery and rich.  The iced coffees were fabulous.  On our last day I purchased chocolates to take home for presents.  I would come back here again just for the pastries.    Since I was going there super early in the morning, the lines weren't that long but there still was a crowd and for good reason."}
{"text":"Is this the cutest little spot ever or what?!  I drank a whole cup of their coffee, & I don't even drink coffee...  It's so good I just bought a whole bag of goods."}
{"text":"I wish I was able to try out their patisserie and croissants if I stayed at Aria.   Instead, we did a pit stop at Aria while gambling, and I decided to get dinner there.  I ordered the Basil Aioli Chicken Panini for $9.99. Expensive but hey it's Vegas!  The panini came with caramelized onions and was really good.  I like the presentation in the boxes and the bread was nice and warm.  Tender and flavorful.    Plenty of seats are available around the bakery.  Plenty of yummy goodies, chocolates, ice cream, cold sandwiches, and paninis are available for any time of the day!  I wonder how good their chocolates are?"}
{"text":"The strawberry nutella crepe is serious. Normally, the strawberries are an afterthought, nothing more than small slices of flavor that break up the homogeny of the nutella. At Jean Philippe, they shove so many strawberries into the crepe that it's basically bursting at the seams like that movie where the Alien burst through the guy's chest and the Alien started killing people. I don't remember the name of the movie but it definitely had an Alien in it. I liked this crepe a lot.  I've also got to give props to the nutella brioche and the ham/cheese breakfast egg sandwich on a croissant."}
{"text":"To simply say that these are the best pastries that I have ever eaten is a bit of an understatement. I should say these are REALLY REALLY REALLY the BEST. I am talking serious sugar goodness here. Try the lemon meringue pie or cheesecake. Also, you won't go wrong with anything chocolate.   The place is pretty cool - traditional counter service patisserie and retail store - but accented by a large decorative chocolate fountain.   The coffee is really good as well!   If you are on the strip and looking for a Lil somethin' sweet this is worth the trip!  October 2011 - Made it back to JPP on my recent Vegas trip - yep, still THAT GOOD.  Try the carrot cake thing - really, it can make you happy till your death..."}
{"text":"i've followed some of the pastry chefs from jean philippe's on instagram for several months now and been obsessed with how beautiful all of the creations here are. (if you're curious, follow @amauryguichon on instagram to watch how some of these are made. it's mesmerizing).  once i booked a trip to vegas, i KNEW i had to visit this place and see if it tasted as pretty as it looked.   it's tucked away inside aria and pretty well hidden (especially if you've consumed 24 inches of a hurricane yard stick heh), but we foundt it!  i got this little lemon meringue creation. it was light and tangy and refreshing and so pretty. it was overwhelming trying to pick just 1 little pastry.   i wanted to bring back some for friends/family, but didn't trust myself post-yardstick to carry such delicate little things back with me.   would def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was a heaven. I think this was one of the best patisserie in the strip. I just wanted to have everything that was on their display but ended up trying Red Velvet cupcake. I was just speechless. It was so soft and melting in my mouth. It had little cream in it which was not overly sweet. It was probably one of the best I had. It is a bit on a pricier side but trust me its worth it. may be pricey but worth the try. They do have other savory food options as well. For ice cream and chocolate lovers there are so many options. If I had more time I could have gone there more than once. But definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"It was pretty funny, as I Yelped JPP to figure out what type of dessert to get, I read this one chick's review about the opera cake and then I was sold. And then I realized it was my own review from a few years ago. Self-convinced! Anyway, I decided on the opera cake (~$7) and hubby went for the cheesecake (~$7). The line was really long on a Sat. morning and the servers were kind of attitudinal (for reals!), so we decided to cancel our order and come back when things piped down a bit. I think that the 'tudes brought my review down a star because when you're in a magical sugary fantasyland like JPP you sort of expect happy servers and rainbows and glitter spewing from the sky.  It doesn't mean I won't be back 'cuz it's still my fav Patisserie in Vegas."}
{"text":"came on my birthday at like 10. everything was sold out. ordered a sandwich which they never gave me. a lot of stuff in the box got smushed. check it out if u want but come in the day when they have more stuff"}
{"text":"Counter service, then find your own seat somewhere in the area. Little pricey for counter service."}
{"text":"Most delicious crepe I've ever tried!! I decided to get the Nutella crepe and I couldn't believe how delicious it was! This will be my first stop when I'm in Vegas. Their pastries look delicious too!"}
{"text":"I like everything about Jean Philippe but the price.  It's one thing sometimes to pay a boatload of money for out of this world amazing food; however, at times, you also wonder when it feels like highway robbery or getting a speeding ticket just to make a cop's night not boring.   Okay, it didn't really apply but the whole Vegas' premise is about taking your money. They can argue they will give you some too. For the most part though they're in the business in taking your money. Jean Philippe is just trying to fit in.  $4.95 for almond croissant or unbelievably delicious cheese danish? Okay.., I was totally down with that. The almond croissant was so good. It was flaky buttery delicious with thick filling of almond paste and crunchy sprinkles of sliced almonds. To die for!! The cheese danish was also as delicious. The sweet cheese filling in the middle was thick surrounded by a fatty laminated danish dough that tasted like heaven and made you run to the gym instantly after.  What got me were the  coffees and breakfast sandwiches. I paid $18 for a cup of latte plus a ham and egg sandwich. The sandwich was three slices of white bread, toasted with melted cheese, and a ready to put on a sandwich mass produced food service egg. What the...?   It tasted ok but it wasn't any better than anything else that was half the price. $18 for coffee and a damn breakfast sandwich was blatant misuse of free market trading. Laissez faire my ass.  They are so used to taking people's big bucks for minuscule items, that the cashier told me this while I was buying one almond croissant and gave him my cash with my Mlife card at hand.  \"It's just $4.95, miss. That's it. It's just $4.95.\"  Embarrassed, I put my card away as I felt so not worthy trying to get points for my just $4.95 purchase. I felt so horrible in making that guy had to push buttons, printed a receipt, move his hand to hand me my purchase for just $4.95. Je suis désolé, monsieur!!   However, that almond croissant.. C'est le doudoune. That meant the tits in french."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is named after Philippe Maury who is an award-winning Pastry Chef.  Located in Aria, the place is classy, modern, and decorated with creative sculptures of sweets.  They serve freshly made crepes, sandwiches, salads, gourmet chocolates, gelato, pastries, and candies.  There are two sections, one is where you order sandwiches, coffee, teas, and desserts.  Second, is for gelato, crepes, and chocolates.  All the treats are displayed in glass cases and some are neatly showcased around the area.   There were so many choices, I wanted to taste everything! I stood in line and my final decision was to get the Sweet Trio.  They gave me a piece of paper then I walked towards the register to pay. The cashier took the paper then presented my dessert on a tray.  After eating, I went back to purchase more items, Nutella Brioche, chocolate Earl Grey, Dark and Milk Chocolate), Madeleines and Coconut Macaroons.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G9xCjFxbWa2VxTgHS6XdXA&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mxqKFzxRuqhf7Q3AUt49Yg&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PGAxMrxKhjo5yvdAHTvRww&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nrXOCccf6F1N_YbzqX-M9w&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6xC0L6gdE2-4-HxaXw91hQ&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  ::Desserts:: Sweet Trio came with Vanilla Creme Brûlée, Caramel Peanut Lollipop, and Rose Raspberry Macaroon. It was carefully displayed on a Milk Chocolate Tray.  Creme brûlée was smooth and creamy, on top was a hard round sugar shell with white chocolate (I think).  The lollipop was coated with milk chocolate and white chocolate swirls; inside was sweet and spongy. The last one is the macaroon, it was small with tangy Raspberries inside.  I would get this dessert again!  Nutella Brioche tasted like a croissant filled with Nutella.  The flavor of the Madeleine was a combination of butter and a hint of lemon zest.  It was also spongy and soft.  The coconut macrons were the best I've tasted, it was chewy, sweet, and the coconut was fresh.  The gourmet chocolate was rich with a light Earl Grey flavor.  ::Highlight:: It's official, this is one of my \"go to\" dessert place in Vegas! I was so EXCITED to be surrounded by different kinds of impressive desserts! There were several desserts I wanted to try, I saw Rose Macaroon, Tiramisu, Creme Brûlée, Chocolate Cheesecake, Lemon Tart, Raspberry Tart, Chocolate Cupcake, Strawberry Lemon Cupcake, Blueberry Cupcake, Snickers, Chocolate Covered Strawberries and more! I look forward to my next Vegas trip, this is where I'll be!!!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain was mesmerizing. Pastries were delicious, but the cashier shoved my Raspberry Tart in a box and handed it to me very quickly. My tart was completely disassembled and smooshed. It was so pretty before the box incident.   Everything is gorgeous. Coffee is decent. The \"perfect roast\" was a bit weak to me. :\   Despite the smooshed tart, we will definitely be back. Yumz!"}
{"text":"The place is visually stunning, the chocolate fountain, cakes on display, not to mention the scrumptious desert.  The food is not bad.  I had the Exotic Crepe.  I found it too sweet, & it cost over $11.  Mom had a savory crepe, which was quite delicious.  If you've never been, go check it out, but for the price..."}
{"text":"if there's ever such thing as TOO MANY CHOICES FOR DESSERT, you'll find it at Jean Phillipe Patisserie @ the Aria!!  they have eeeeeverything from cookies to pastries to ice cream to candy to chocolate to cake to coffee .... just go overload your eyes for yourself!!  with NO SURPRISE, i couldn't decide & asked a worker for the ONE dessert  i had to try & she suggested the dark chocolate mousse because you can finish it w/o it becoming too sweet!  it was definitely a good dessert but ten bucks for such a small dessert is just outrageous!!! which brings me to give jean 3.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"The chocolates and pastries are unbelievably good.  The service there is unbelievably terrible. For the price we paid, we expect a much better experiences. So this review was about their services, not the products. I just spent 220 dollars, bought a bunch of cookies and chocolates.  The manager gave me a huge bag for all of them.  I asked if they have smaller bags as gift bags, the manager rudely reply, we ran out of small bags and we don't know whey we will get them. The other staff tried to help and told me to come back tomorrow (as we will be in town for a couple of days), yet the manager again insist - don't know when we will get bags (imply don't come back).  Wow, this is the service for a 16 dollar box cookies?  Kind of remind me of the services in France - oh crab, they were from France.  My bad, my expectation was too unrealistic then, sorry!"}
{"text":"I have been here two times. The first time I tried a savory crepe with ham and eggs and I regretted not getting a sweet crepe. My boyfriend had a chocolate crepe. The second time I got a banana fosters crepe with a creme custard filling and it was delicious. Their sweet crepes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Yay! More sweets!  I was looking forward to this place when my parents told me we were going to Vegas.  You have to really look for it if you don't know where it exactly is.  Like everyone who reviewed this place, I was AMAZED (to say the least) by the chocolate fountains.  So tempted to break into there.  Store is beautifully decorated.  Merchandise: A decent variety.  Their cake displays were breath-taking. Very handy crafts man ships.  Pricey though.  Pastries:  loved the nutella cake.  That's the only one that made me lose it.  Apple cinnamon muffin was moist and crunchy just how a perfect muffin should be.  All of them were a piece of edible art.  Nothing looked bland nor does it taste bland.    -1 for the snooty attitude from that girl.  I know you're mad about working on Black Friday but c'mon!  And those lines are so confusing.  I think there was 3 lines: gelato, crepes, and pastries? I'm not sure but I don't care as long as I get my sweets.  If it was bigger, nicer staff, more organized with the staff than we'll talk about that 5 stars."}
{"text":"Assuming you can secure a seat at the Jean Philippe Patisserie, do people-watch, since staring at fellow customers and casino-goers is always fun, right? Like the rest of the Bellagio, the patisserie itself is beautiful, full of works of art (most can be purchased), which their desserts could also be described as.  I love ice cream, so I went for a cup of cookies and creme. From the first bite, it was orgasmic bliss, deliciously smooth and creamy, cooling, and not terribly sweet - just enough. It's pricey dessert goodness, but worth it for those with sweet tooths. (I tried a bite of one of their other desserts, but I'm purely an ice cream man.)"}
{"text":"What a beautiful display of white and dark chocolate flowing from carefully engineered platters of glass. Seeing this was truly intriguing. I mean, the way the platters were shaped caused the chocolate to flow down in a curved manner. So cool. Anyways, as I walked around the small shop, I pondered about what I might like to try besides everything. They had beautiful displays of everything. Seeing all those artfully designed cakes was like watching the completion of a food network competition. Okay, so I didn't try any of the delectable looking desserts, but I did have gelato. I love gelato and while I thought this gelato would be different, it wasn't. I ordered a mint chocolate chip gelato and it tasted really creamy and still delicious so I was still satisfied. My sister ordered the berry gelato and said it tasted like fruit roll up; brings back child-like memories. Now that I think about it, I wish I'd tried at least one of those chocolate desserts. Oh well, there's always next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue and beautiful pastries but pretty expensive for just a sweet snack. Stopped in during a girls night and we enjoyed comparing the different \"art\"!"}
{"text":"Whimsical chocolate fountains. Tall tiered floating cakes. Fresh crepes made right in front of you. And gelato, gelato, gelato.... heaven? Not quite... but for me, pretty close.  I have done the tourist thing and simply walked by to see the magic happening, but I had never had the desire to hop in line and experience the sugar rush. Luckily during my last foray, my boyfriend's little sister really wanted some gelato and we happened to be walking around the Bellagio. Luckily for her and my constant Yelping, I knew where to direct our group.  As I was sharing my gelato with the love, I decided to let him have some input. The pistachio was calling my name, but damnit, we just HAD to get the cookies and cream... I admit, I pouted a bit. We both enjoyed it... but yes, I am already planning my next descent into Vegas just so I can get to that pistachio! The dulce de leche sounded good as well. But back to our actual choice, it was thick and creamy and as strange as it sounds... not overly sweet. One scoop was not enough (should have gotten the second scoop!). I will know for next time... definitely a place I shall return."}
{"text":"So disappointed ! Do not even think stopping here ! I used to drive here once a month for the Finest patisseries made by the world champion chef Jean-philippe.. (i guess the famous chef is no longer with aria as his name disappeared ?!) What a surprise ! it seems aria and Mgm resorts have decided to go back 25 years and sacrifice quality over profit !!! Jean-philippe pastries were from the highest quality and at the top of the French recipe standards. Today, i thought i would try the Aria patisserie \"millefeuille \" or i should say \"mille sugar\" !!!! Where in the world a millefeuille comes with horrible caramel and cream on top and of it !!!! Sorry, i would not be so angry if each of the desert we have tried (4 different ones) were not so disappointing ! My wife had to ask for a refund on one of them (thats how bad it is...)Hey Aria, the chef and the quality of the ingredients do make the difference  ! No more Aria for me !!!!!"}
{"text":"Modern patisserie that serves up some serious gelato (my faves: stracciatella & pistachio) and other delectable pastries. Savory food items are also quite good including their vegetable quiche. I always make a pit stop here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service: I wanted to try the pastry, the service behind the counter were very willing to help.  They answered all my questions with a big smile and also gave me their personal recommendations.  Food: The pastry was delightful...it was light, flavorful, and very flaky.  It wasn't too sweet, it wasn't doughy, it was just right.  Definitely recommend this place along with Payard.  Also recommend the Gelato..very good as well.  Ambiance: It looks like a jewelry store with pastry."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little pricey but worth it if you don't buy stuff here all the time. Had the crepe and breakfast pastries and breads. Didn't try the desserts but they looked gorgeous!"}
{"text":"An amazing spot to grab delicious pastries and great crepes! Everything is fresh and amazing.   The place itself is beautiful and amazingly decorated.   The prices is what you expect to pay in The Bellagio, but with the amazing taste and service makes it worth every penny.  The staff is wonderful and efficient! (Especially when you have a line that can be fairly long most of time; great sign of a good business).   Make sure to stop by and grab something on the go before you go out and enjoy the rest of your day!  P.S the white mocha is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great crepe desert i got chocolate crepe and a few more dessert. Fruit tart was good but napoleons was ok . Good service ."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Aria because my friend had her bachelorette in Vegas and was excited to see that there was a Jean Philippe Patisserie! This location is not the one with the chocolate fountain (that one is at the Bellagio) but it is larger and has a nice seating area.   Jean-Philippe Maury is amazing with desserts. He had a mentorship with Chef Gérard Bertin (recipient of the \"Meilleur Ouvrier de France,\" the most prestigious pastry award in France), won the Best Pastry Chef of France in 1997, won the Gold Medal in the 2002 World Pastry Team Championship as a member of Team USA, and many other awards. He also worked with Chef Francois Paillard as a pastry chef for his restaurant and shop.  Our Order: Croque Monsieur: Baked Ham & cheese topped w/ Parmesan White Cafe Mocha Pistachio Macron Chocolates: Earl Grey, Lemon Tart, Pistachio, Dark Chocolate w/Hazelnut  I typically don't order croque monsier because they're so easy to make but my friend didn't eat breakfast so I wanted to get him something. What's unique is that on the outside of the bread, Parmesan is baked onto it so it had so much more flavor. It was surprisingly good!  The White Cafe Mocha was on the sweet side but very yummy. There were bits of white chocolate inside as well!  The pistachio macron didn't have an overpowering flavor. The cookie itself was very soft and slightly chewy.  The chocolates were all very creamy and smooth. Highly suggest eating right away as they do no hold up in heat at all. The layer in the caramel inside the Darke Chocolate w/ Hazelnut was amazing. EXTREMELY soft and not too sticky or chewy. Made me wish I had bought the mix of caramels (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really like caramels much!)  Will definitely come back as they also sell gelato and crepes! Plus they're open late! :D"}
{"text":"Heavenly.    So you come here and have great expectations due to yelp.   Plus it's beautiful.    Things I loved  Potatoe gratin with bacon.   Amazing  Raspberry tart.   Vanilla cream stick/puff.  Thought it would be too sweet but they do a good job of making the it very balanced   Ok  Napleon. Was a tad over cooked on the crust.   Never liked the fact that they charge me for a cup to heat up my babies food. But what do I expect in Vegas I suppose."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is amazing and the fat kid in me wanted to eat allllll the things here, but settled on just an almond croissant, which was crispy on the outside, and filled with buttery almond paste on the inside. This location is within the Bellagio, and you can smell the chocolate waterfalls before you even realize they're there. The desserts are beautiful to look at too!"}
{"text":"I had a serious foodgasm when I had a piece of the Nutella Mille-feuille. The layers of puff pastry and nutella/cream goodness was mind numbing. Wow... Thanks to the server for recommending this since it was waaay to hard to choose between all the tempting treats on display.  Everything here looks - and I'm sure tastes - ridiculously good! I wish my bf and I weren't so full from brunch so we could try more but there's always next time.  Also, there are tons of food eye candy at JPP.  The cakes on display looked like they came straight out from those cake challenges in the Foodnet Work.  I wanted to take a mini wedding cake home to my sister for her anniversary but I didn't think it would survive the crazy Vegas heat."}
{"text":"Service was spotty and disorganized. A 20 minute wait, after ordering, for a coffee and pastry. Really?! Coffee was mediocre at best. Third star based on the quality of the pastries alone."}
{"text":"I am sorry to have to write this review about such an amazing dessert chef, but it is not the food quality that I have to review; it is unfortunately the management and the service.  Jean Philippe is probably one of the best dessert chefs in the country if not the world and his pastries are definitely beautiful, tasty and superb, but the management and system need vast improvement.  Over the weekend, we had ordered an 8 inch carrot cake for my friend's surprise birthday party and we had even confirmed the reservation the day of the event.  We went to pick up the cake at the Aria branch and they \"could not find the cake\" and furthermore \"could not find the order.\" Then they accused us of placing the order at the bellagio store and when they called the store there was no record of the order either.  Basically they were accusing us of not placing the order which is ridiculous!! Luckily my friend emailed me a copy of his credit card statement which showed the shop had already CHARGED us for the cake even before we had received the product!! A manager then scurried out looked red in the face and apologized and gave us two boxes of pastries which was appreciated, but the damage was done.  The dinner was delayed, the surprise was delayed, and the rest of the nights festivities were delayed due to a poor management system at one of the elite bakeries in vegas.  I am writing this review not out of spite, but to help your established company not make the same mistake again as this will cause your company to lose great customers not because of the food, but because of the management and system.  This is easily fixable and I hope your team works on it."}
{"text":"Not a bakery. So much more. It is art that you eat...if you can stop admiring it. Crepes made right in front of you. Pastries. Tarts. Muffins. Sandwiches. Fruit cups. Coffee. So much more! Right when you walk up to the store make sure you stop and look at the chocolate fountain. Wow! If I could put my fingers, tongue in it I would! Haha We stop here on every Vegas trip. Eventually I will try everything! I love when my food looks amazing AND tastes amazing!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the Margarita Sorbet, because it contained alcohol and he is an alcoholic but also because he likes sorbet more than ice cream. I tried a bit of his sorbet, but it was more of a slushy. Even when the were scooping it in, it was really shapeless. Still, my boyfriend enjoyed it.... but after awhile he waited for it to melt and just downed it....   I had the hazelnut gelato. It was pretty good, but I thought it would be a bit more cold. It felt like the gelato was just a little bit below room temperature. Maybe it was just way too hot that day.... dont know.  The gelato here is good, it is one of the creamiest gelato I ever had. But for some reason I just did not love it."}
{"text":"Do you like chocolate? If so you'll love this intimate chocolate delicatessen experience. Great people watching and I enjoyed the vanilla éclair and hot chocolate. This week the had a life sized Grinch made of chocolate. Amazing culinary feat in its own."}
{"text":"The desserts are great, but we just received very poor service from two young ladies at the gelato counter. They didn't inform us of an additional charge and were very rude when we asked a simple question about our total.   Sweets are supposed to make you smile, but our experience turned unexpectedly sour."}
{"text":"I much prefer their location at the Aria but the location at the Bellagio is where I go to when I'm staying at this hotel. The pastries at the Aria location seem to taste better than the ones here, I'm not sure why.  I do enjoy the crepes here which I tend to get everyday during my stay with no guilt.  The set up for the line is also very unintuitive. The store is set up such that you walk in a circle. The cashiers, pastry and gelato displays are in the center so you walk around it. There is one cashier just for the crepes and another cashier for gelato. But this is not intuitive. We ended up standing in line for crepes at the gelato cashier only to be directed to the other cashier when we got to the front of the gelato cashier. When we got to the correct cash register, the manager happened to take our order and we let him know the confusion. He agreed that the store layout was confusing and promised that they were working on it!"}
{"text":"During my 5-day stay at the Aria, it was only the time when I allowed myself to go all out and indulge in pastries and desserts twice a day, e-v-e-r-y-d-a-y. Located right next to the hotel elevators, I walked by it everyday and it's almost a crime not to indulge. Among the items tried: almond croissant, nutella brioche, sugar doughnut, vanille eclaire, macaron, crepe. There's a crepe stand on the side of the patisserie. The ready-packaged biscotti are also very good. My weight may have tipped the weighing scale over a little in the wrong direction, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Loved the Birthday Macaroon!! Great French inspired place for breakfast and or dessert. I ordered the veggie omelette which was so incredibly good! I was tried the macaroons bc I have such a sweet tooth and loved them! They do not serve any alcohol so not a good place for a morning mimosa but s great place for a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"Get the crepes!! I love the nutella crepe with fresh strawberries!!I really like how this JPP is open 24/7, so you can satisfy your sweet tooth any time of the day!!"}
{"text":"Love me some crepes. But not this crepe or maybe because I don't like buckwheat crepe. Mine had arugula that tasted so bitter and overcooked zucchini that had no taste. The prosciutto was equally bad. Very chewy, very salty and very thick. Avoid this crepe at all cost. My partner's crepe, Forest crepe was better. Still nothing to rave about. Houston has a local crepe without a fancy name that tastes 10 times better than this one. Slow service and not friendly either. Maybe I'll try the dessert next time. But I am worried they look better than they taste. Like their crepes."}
{"text":"Oh God the CREPES!   The crepe itself is paper thin - skinny as a French model swaying down the sidewalks of Paris. It's slightly sweet, just like her personality but mostly just there. A perfect vehicle for clothing, or in this case, Nutella and a garden of strawberries.  There's no skimping on the fillings at Jean Phillippe - this is 'Merca, and we like our crepes fat, hefty and full of whatever chocolate, sugar or spread we've decided to allot our morning's (or day's) calories for.   And for an extra treat, try a sprinkle of sugar...vanilla, cinnamon or whatever else is advertised."}
{"text":"u must see this shop for their awesome displays when u are in las vegas!!  i bought a box of chocolate here.  the packaging was exquisite, but the chocolates were quite disappointing.  the flavoring seems genuine, but there is quite a bit of artificial coloring and the taste was not outstanding...  and EWWW!!!! there were dust on the chocolates, which is not only gross, but it makes me wonder how long the chocolates have been sitting there!!!!"}
{"text":"My go to dessert place when I am in Vegas!!  This place has the most delicious and pretty desserts. From their small cakes and chocolates to their gelatos and crepes. Everything is just so decadent and sweet.   The world's largest chocolate fountain looks cool and is a nice photo op.  They only strive for the best, there were a couple of times the crepes would tear and the workers would immediately start over.   It is definitely pricey but, it is worth trying out some of the best desserts ever =]  The seating area is very limited so you kinda have to get lucky or walk around to find a seat.  Overall, a must go when you are in Vegas. There is also a Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria which also looks really cool too."}
{"text":"Overpriced but everything looks so damn pretty & the things that I have tried were pretty good..  Don't waste your money here, maybe only on super last minute presents. Spend your money elsewhere or just use it at the blackjack tables.."}
{"text":"This place has the best pastries. ALL their Crepes and desserts are amazing, too.   I love the ambience too. Granted, I expected nothing less from Bellagio.  If I was made of money, I would come here everyday for my sweets."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Just plain fabulous. Who doesn't love this place? Good breakfast crepes too. Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing... Worth every penny!!! This is the first time I've been here and I gotta say I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Adorable pastries! This is our second trip in one month and we went both times. Good photo opportunities or a nice treat to bring to a friend."}
{"text":"Great place for anything that has sweet in it. They are perfect at making desserts in all shapes and types. But never never try their paninis., it's tasteless and not worth the $$.   Thanks"}
{"text":"This is the best quick breakfast place in Aria, but is a bit expensive just like everything else here.  If you want a breakfast sandwich and cappucino, be ready to drop a twenty.  The display of desserts is impressive, colorful, and beautiful - you will probably want to take a picture.  Willa Wonka would be proud.  Their ordering line system seems a bit inefficient and you are never quite sure if you are actually going to get what you ordered when it makes its way past the cashier, but you do.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the inflated price and the ordering process."}
{"text":"A must stop for any dessert lovers anywhere near the Bellagio.  I only wish I had made a special effort to leave room for a second round of dessert after our nightly dinners out.    We were lucky enough to be staying at the Bellagio on our recent Vegas trip.  So we got our daily morning caffeine fix at Jean Philippe -- their perfect roast coffee really was (better than Starbucks IMO).  Their chocolate croissants were the perfect flakiness - too little chocolate inside but the buttery croissant made up for it.  The Nutella crepe was heaven -- the next time I'll get some ice cream to go with it!  The only thing I wish I'd tried was their gelato -- guess I had to save something to look forward to on our next trip!    Their cakes on display were also amazing - reminded me of Cake Boss and Ultimate Cake Challenge on a smaller scale.  If you're getting married in Vegas and want a beautiful cake, I would definitely check them out."}
{"text":"The gelato was excellent!  I've had both the hazelnut and the coconut and they were both amazing. I will definitely revisit my next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice selection of high end deserts. Even at 9 PM the items were being freshly stocked from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was so jealous that I was not staying at the Aria when I saw this place as I walked through the hotel lobby.  I was so enthralled with the displays of chocolates, treats and the huge glass display of pastries and other delights that I had to stop by.  Even though I didn't purchase any breakfast pastries or muffins, I just know they were probably the best around.  The size of the blueberry breakfast tart with cascading berries put anything to shame that I ate at the Wynn's 24-hour coffee shop.  Since we were there at mid-day we purchased some chocolate and toffee covered bread sticks and coffee.  At first I was skeptical thinking that break sticks would not be as good as chocolate covered pretzels, however, I was proven wrong.  Those treats were so good that I rationed them the entire trip and was seen eating them on the airplane ride back home - I even managed to save 1 for my sister back home, which was a feat of willpower.  The coffee was divine and I was able to bring Jean Philippe's signature blend home in whole roasted bean form.  I will definitely be going back there again just to visit this patisserie next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place Is amazing...amazing expensive! Haha! I always happen to land some great food and beverage comps through the hotel so when that happens I spend it up here! The deserts and pastries are out of this world! If you are into perfectly executed crepes then this is your place! They offer some of the best variety of crepes to offer!i love all the milkshakes and gelato ice cream they offer as well!  I recommend getting there early if you are wanting to partake in breakfast because the lines can get worse than magic mountain or six flags when the newest roller coaster is launched.. Okay maybe I exaggerated a little but in all seriousness its a long line but very well worth the wait to receive not only some great customer service but fantastic eats and treats to go with it! Can't beat that! I will Return on each visit like always!"}
{"text":"This location is much larger and nicer than the one found in the Bellagio.  I had the mint chocolate gelato and it was amazing.  Very refreshing on a hot day and it reminds me of Baskin Robins but better!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jean Philippe on several occasions and think they have some of the best croissants in town. On this occasion, I came in for a crepe. The crepe area was a complete mess. The ingredients were spilled all over the place, mint was browning, and raspberries appeared mushy. I brought this to the attention of the \"manager\" Duke and he said that it was not up to standard but he did not try to right his wrong by offering a solution. I left empty handed. For how empty Jean Philippe was I could not believe how untidy and unappetizing the crepe station was."}
{"text":"WOW!!! What a treat this was.   Cool ambiance. You go in, and pick your pastry. My wife and I agreed - best we have ever had!!   Definitely go check this place out! See you next time we're in Vegas Jean Philippe :)"}
{"text":"Visually, this place is absolutely stunning and hard to pass by as you're meandering through the casino.  When actually needed for your coffee and morning customer service smiles, it's a whole different story!  The food is great...more than great...sincerely exquisite.  However, when you're up at 7:00 a.m., ready to head to your business for the day (not a tourist on vacay), don't expect fast service and friendly smiles.  You jump in line as #20 just to grab coffee and the snappy servers attempt to shove you down to some alternate cashier that is nowhere in site - nor is that coffee you ordered.  Oh...and that V8 that you need to cure the night before and forgot to order prior to approaching the cashier?...don't be surprised if they hurl it at you.    They're pretty much down right rude.  The line is confusing and chaotic. The coffee is mediocre at best.  But hey...the croissants are seriously decadent!"}
{"text":"Decent pastries and breakfast dishes at a high price. The food would be much better if they heated it up beforehand. The ham and cheese croissant was disgusting. Wet, cold, and depressing, something I'd expect at a gas station. If you like paying $6 for an orange juice, around $10 for a pastrie, and only go to restaurants with famous people's names attached, then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"This is a cute pastry shop that has a location in the Aria and another on the way to the Bellagio (there may be more in Vegas, but these are the only ones I saw during my visit). I swung into the one near the Bellagio on my way back over to the Aria. They had an AMAZING selection of pastries, tarts, cakes, and other delicious confections, along with fresh crepes that are made right before your eyes. It was really hard for me to choose just one dessert for me and another for my man! I decided to go with the lemon meringue tart and I ordered him a fresh crepe that was loaded with strawberries and topped with fresh cream. Both desserts were excellent! I will definitely be hitting this place up again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place. When I stayed at the Aria in 2013 with my girlfriend, we went here for a quick bite to eat and the deli sandwiches were delicious. The single chocolate macaroon was one of the best I've ever had.   In 2015, stayed at the Elara with my Fiancé (same girl) and we made a trip to Aria as we loved the hotel. We definitely made a trip back here and had another deli sandwich and... you guessed it, another chocolate coconut macaroon.   In 2017, I will be staying at the Elara again with my wife (same girl again lol). We'll definitely be making a trip back to eat here again. It's the only place to eat we have been to more than once. It's basically our favorite quick/relatively cheap/relatively healthy place to get something to eat. I have a feeling every Vegas trip we make, we'll be coming here to have a meal."}
{"text":"Really cute setup of their store, though smaller than I expected! All the desserts looked delicious and fresh. Even the prepared salads and sandwiches looked excellent, which is rare for a place that doesn't necessarily specialize in them. It was entertaining to watch the woman making the fresh and quite delicious looking crepes filled with lots of sweet stuff! Those seemed to be a popular item but I came for the gelato! I got two scoops- one pistachio and one hazelnut. In one word... Amazing! Super creamy, not icy at all. There was a really nice variety of flavors as well. Would definitely come back here for the gelato!"}
{"text":"Why are pretty cakes so expensive? Paid $7 for a Triple Chocolate Cheesecake and was kind of disappointed because the bottom chocolate layer was too hard that I couldn't eat it.  Also ordered Napoleon Vanilla (?) and it was good. My mom tried the chocolate eclair and she said it was alright. I also bought a Hazelnut chocolate bar and it was $9. Hmm, tried the tiramisu gelato and it was okay--it was lacking flavor."}
{"text":"The lines for Jean Phiippe are ridiculous in the morning, but it's a great place for a light breakfast or dessert.  The pastry and desserts are beautiful, but not the best you'll have in your life.  My croissant while flaky, was lacking the buttery richness I expected.  Still very good, but not the best ever.  We also had a chocolate cupcake which was incredibly rich, almost too much so if that's even possible, and a delicious fruit tart of sorts.  It's also a bit difficult to figure out the lines.  In the morning there was one that wrapped around the entire store.  Later, there were two, but no indication if they were for separate types of orders or where they started.  Maybe one was for omelets?  We just got in the one closest to the dessert case to window shop before ordering."}
{"text":"I had a rose water macroon. It was nothin outta this world i made better ones in culinary school. The pastry cream didnt have much flavor. Its definately over priced i dont think its cause its vegas more like you put a french name on it and it magically doubles in price. Its a pretty cute place to just hang out have a coffee or somethin. Maybe other things are delish i just wouldnt recommend the macroon. Hopefully you get somethin delicious.  Shouldve tried there muffins they were size of jupiter n looked scruptious. But im too fluffy to have more then one dessert. :/"}
{"text":"The Raspberry Tart was so good! Great combination of crunchy, pistachio, raspberries and cheesecake flavors without being too sweet. Can't wait to try something else next time I visit the gardens at Bellagio!"}
{"text":"At the Bellagio, you can see the beautiful water fountains dancing outside, and the chocolate fountain of Jean Philippe inside. Dark, milk, and white chocolate flows from top to bottom. It a good thing it's covered, otherwise there would be too many happy drownings or baptisms!  Jean Philippe Patisserie is primarily a French Cafe. All of their delicious looking pastries, cakes, tarts, cookies, cupcakes, gelato and sandwiches are also on display for all to see. For what I enjoyed, it tastes at least as good as it looks and there's a good reason why so many people are in line."}
{"text":"We had just gotten to Vegas and I was somewhat hungry, but not famished.  I went here, because I was too damn lazy to go anywhere to eat, but I knew I HAD to eat...or else blackout Joel was going to happen later.   Smoked salmon sandwich. I told all my friends to try it too, in which they all did and all agreed with me that it was awesome.  Now its your turn.  I still blacked out."}
{"text":"The baked goods are outstanding! We had a cinnamon roll warmed up.  Went there both mornings we were at the aria! A little pricey, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"You can't walk past this place without taking a glance. The desserts are amazing to look at, and the different edible art in the restaurant is nothing short of amazing. They had a whole scene of polar bears that was made of edible components. rediculous! Falls a little short on the taste in comparison to the visuals. I can only compare to Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego, where the taste matches the look, but although the desserts looked beautiful, I thought the taste was just OK. Everything was a little on the super sweet side for us, but really made for great pictures. And did i talk about the sugar bears!! I would still recommend taking a look at the desserts and trying a couple of the ones that I didn't."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years but the service was lacking.  My crepe was also less than spectacular.  My wife said her triple chocolate dessert was tasty though."}
{"text":"Great place for sure. Had the \"Intense\" pastry and the \"Blueberry\" cupcake and they were both delicious."}
{"text":"Try the chocolate almond croissant and the raspberry beignet. The croissant was flaky, buttery, and had smooth chocolate between each layer. The raspberry filling in the beignet was not overly sweet and tasted fresh. Both are life changing and will keep you coming back for more! I wish there was a Jean Philippe Patisserie where I reside :(."}
{"text":"If you want to have coffee in the morning after you wake up in the Aria Hotel, you have a few choices, one of them is the Jean Philippe Patisserie in the lobby downstairs. Coffee typically costs $4-$5 and is generally just OK in my book (I drink coffee black); it tasted like generic stuff you get at a truck stop. I would have thought the coffee would be top-notch given their fancy desserts behind glass.  The dessert presentation was FANTABULOUS. Too bad it tasted just...OK. My friend chose some kind of raspberry pastry and it was flaky and good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Prior to the raspberry pastry, it was a breakfast crepe with berries which tasted just....OK. Sour and a bit overpriced. The following day, we had a vegetarian crepe that cost $11 that we split. It was about one mouthful for the each of us. Maybe one egg went into making it.   The souveniers are $$$$$. A tube of jordan almonds cost about $20 and was less than a handful. I wanted to buy something for my son, but it was too costly so I waited til I got to the airport.   This would be a good place to come if you are a photography student or want to take pics of fancy pastries and cakes, otherwise, get your coffee from any fast food joint and a pastry from Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"The BEST bakery on the strip!   Be prepared for a lineup and to wait after you have paid.   The store is gorgeous. Reminded me of patisseries I visited during a recent visit to Paris. There is Gelato, crepe, and chocolate counters. As you walk further along the shop, you will get to the patisserie counter.  We came around 4pm and ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a slice of Napoleon cake as pre-dinner appetizers from the patisserie section. The croissant was fresh and hot. There was also a slice of melted cheese which added to the deliciousness!  Highly recommend a visit to this patisserie. Items are a bit pricy but you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is located in Bellagio. It serves dessert and savory crepes, gelato, and a variety of pastries. I only tried the gelato but it was DAMN good. It was so creamy and smooth. They have a good selection of flavors. I ordered a cup of hazelnut and pistachio. There were fresh hazelnuts and pistachios in the gelato and it was simply DELICIOUUUS. It was also 104 degrees outside so that might've helped too. Next time I will try the crepes and their delicious looking pastries!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars based on two visits A solid choice for a quick breakfast or nibbles for your room. Pastries, crepes, and omelets are all very nice - even the coffee was decent. Also a nice spot to choose some gifts for the folks back home."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas to get your sweet tooth fix, indulge or just come by and watch the chocolate flow. Yeah, who are you kissing, you are going to buy a truckload of stuff, because they all look great and appetizing and just posting a million pictures of them won't do it!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas to get your sweet tooth fix, indulge or just come by and get a coffee and get amazed at how good everything looks here! Yeah, who are you kissing, you are going to buy a truckload of stuff, because they all look great and appetizing and just posting a million pictures of them won't do it!"}
{"text":"I had the Forest Crepe, which was generously filled with lots of ham, cheese, mushrooms, fried onions and scrambled eggs on top.  I would have given them five stars except for their policy of charging customers for a cup of water.  If you bring your own cup, they'll fill it for you, but if you want their cheap small plastic cup, they'll charge!!!  I told them I understand that policy if it's someone who walked up asking for a cup of water but didn't purchase anything, but to charge a customer who just paid a lot of money for a meal, it is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We went to Jean Philippe's for lunch and had crepes, coffee and tiramisu .  It was exceptional.  The girl who helped us (her name was Kendall) was one of the friendliest, most knowledgeable and helpful servers we have ever experienced.  She always had a smile and made excellent recommendations.  We wish we had employees like her.  We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Not a big buffet fan.  This little store near the Conservatory and the Spa is awesome.  Croissants, chocolate croissants, crepes both savory and sweet.  A great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"It's hard to put into words how amazing this place is.. the best I can do is SHOW you, by means of interpretive dance.  I tried the coffee and dessert trio, ate it, and then ran my butt back into that ridiculously long line to um.. bring back $40 worth of desserts for .... my.. mom..? (i'm sorry only 1/5 of the desserts made it home, mom)  Here's a tip: DON'T get the rose macaron because they're all mine and I refuse to share."}
{"text":"There is something about the chocolate fountain that originally made me skeptical about the food at the patisserie.  They put so much attention on the damn fountain that I assumed they would slack on food quality.  Not the case at all.  The strawberry crepe I had here was very good (my mom's goat cheese version was also tasty).  They also sell a good selection of candies and other treats to take back to your hotel room for late night chocolate snacks."}
{"text":"Cute and whimsical, the Jean Phiippe Patisserie is a great place to take a break for coffee, dessert, or gelato.  The praline truffle and the coconut truffle were phenomenal and worth the $2 a pop.  We also ate the hazelnut gelato and oreo gelato, both of which were pretty good.  We took home the coconut macaroons, and these were mediocre and overpriced.  Take my advice and skip the cookies and go straight to the chocolate and gelato."}
{"text":"Absolute chaos, no direction the workers are so vague, they don't even look up to look at you. Super rude employees!!"}
{"text":"OMG, where do I begin? As I walked toward the guest room entrance of Aria, I was drawn by the bright and artistic decors of Jean Philippe Patisserie! As I was walking toward it, oh my, I started having the \"kid in a candy store\" feeling, and the next thing I know, I was lured toward the food and pastry display.   Finally a day later, my boyfriend and I shared a coffee and a Rose Macaron with Raspberry and Vanilla Cream Filling. Honestly, I wanted to try everything but since I couldn't just choose one, I went with my friend's suggestion. Luckily I bought the very last one in the display.   The macaron was beautiful and delicious. I couldn't help myself but admire it 360 degree before I decided to take my first bite. I love how it's not super sweet! I also love how they use pastry cream and not buttercream. The coffee was just okay. Oh man, must stop by again and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"When you pass by through here, what is the first thing you will notice? The pastries, cakes and sandwiches? Perhaps. But what about the....wait for it........lovely chocolate fountain that sits right in a glass enclosure in the front of the business? Yes! Well for me, that was the first thing I noticed. Just a thing of beauty. One of the 7 natural sweet wonders of the world!  Jean Philippe Patisserie is your go to sweet stop which is located right in the Bellagio Hotel in beautiful Las Vegas right on the Strip. Yes, they do have I believe 2 more locations in Vegas. This one just stands out to me because it was the first one I tried whenever I come to Vegas. You will find here many a tourist snapping pictures away from their cameras or phones, and for good reason. Just the sight of so much they have here to offer. From cakes, pies, brioches, sandwiches, ice cream, gelato, chocolate strawberries and so much more, you will get magnetized here and want to stay and try just about everything. For myself, I almost did that!  I managed to arrive here with my foodie +1 date approximately an hour before they closed. I figured that was about enough time for us to try what we wanted. She had her eye on the strawberry tart and caramel brulee gelato. I had my eye on a triple chocolate tiramisu liked cake with a small macaron on top drenched in chocolate. Delicious, tantalizing and all around lovely I say. I have not had quite the treat since the last time I went to Milk back in Los Angeles! Inside there is only a small table with a few high stools. Try to grab one or two if you are lucky. We were actually lucky enough to do so. They also have a display of gorgeous cakes that they have designed. All are in glass enclosures that rotate about. Right on top of the register counter you will find such a gorgeous sculpture as well that is sure to please the wandering eye.   For all that we purchased, it came out to around $19. Not bad in price. You will get hit with the sweet odor of chocolate upon arrival as well as the lovely view of all they have to offer. By far, I have been to many a dessert stop in my life. Jean Philippe Patisserie, in all honesty, ranks in my Top 5 all time. If you don't believe me, the next time you are in Vegas, come and have a look see. Maybe you will want to try some of their cold tasty gelato. Or their soft tasty subs. Or even some of the tastiest pastries you ill ever have on the Strip. Bon Appetit, Yelp!"}
{"text":"Step right up and witness the world's largest chocolate fountain! Seriously, they have a Guinness World Records plaque right outside of the shop. Very impressive fountain of chocolate goodness!  I ended up buying a couple of chocolates for presents for my dad (he loves dark chocolate) and my fiance (he prefers milk). I decided to treat myself and chose the \"Snicker\" pastry which was totally AH-MAZING!! I ended up eating it over the course of two days as I found it super rich and large for one person.  The pastry was enrobed in chocolate and filled with a smooth chocolate mousse with a hidden surprise in the middle of crunchy whole peanuts covered in caramel - DIVINE!!  Would highly recommend a stop in if you are a chocolate lover!"}
{"text":"EYE CANDY LITERALLY!   Everything in this open spaced dessert store inside Aria looks delicious & way too pretty to eat! Walling around after the YEE @Bardot Brasserie I needed a little more sweets in me! The decor of this place is bright & beautiful w/ all the displays of their sweet treats.  The staff is nice & seems to always be smiling  SWEET TRIO $10.50 - mini creme brulee... mini raspberry macaroons... & Berry coconut lollipop. Everything was so cute & also a combo of my favorites that I had to choose this one.   CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE $7 - Would have never thought it was a cheesecake as it is wrapped up in chocolate shell with chocolate cheesecake inside & oreo crust."}
{"text":"Came to Jean Philippe the other day and had a wild berry smoothie. The smoothie was really good. Wish I didn't pay $10 for it, but hey what are you going to do?   Saw some crepes cooking while I waited for the smoothie and they looked delicious. Might be my go to the next time I stop by."}
{"text":"The service is SLOW if you order a crepe or omelette. We ordered a salmon omelette and it took 30 mins. There were only 4 people ahead of us and they served other people who ordered after us. Very disappointed in the service. I heard the major chef left recently. Probably made a difference. Won't come back. Wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"When I first saw this place I knew I had to eat here. The decor itself is gorgeous. The rotating layer cakes around the store and special Zarkana display, which are decorated extravagantly, are simply works of art. I was only able to try the Triple Chocolate dessert which is a chocolate mousse with dark chocolate ganache-like coating, white chocolate cremeux inside, and a chocolate filled macaron on top. Needles to say I was in chocolate heaven! The chocolate is so light and smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. If I lived in Las Vegas I would probably come every day. Sadly I will have to wait until next time I visit to try more of Jean Phillipe's creations."}
{"text":"OMG this place is like heaven! I have had their little carrot cake, their cheese cake and I've had sandwiches from this place as well. This place is a desitnation for me EVERY vegas trip!! I am in the process of ordering a cake form my friend's birthday as I type (on hold). Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"We stopped for dessert and were blown away! We had the trio (peanut butter pop, crème brulee, macaroon on a thick chocolate bar slab), the nutella crème cake, and the snickers cake. So rich and decadent that we both were dying for water at the end and a toothbrush!"}
{"text":"Not only is this one of the cutest shops ever, but they make the best desserts ever at a very reasonable price. It was packed when I was there, but the line went really quick even though everyone was really confused where the line was. I will defiantly be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"I am from Las Vegas and have always recommended this to anyone that came into town when I lived there. Now that I live out of state, no trip home is complete without a visit here for a delicious savory crepe. You won't find anything else like it, and even the Aria location is a far cry from the experience here."}
{"text":"the best crepes on the planet.  an incredible selection of sweet and savory options, all incredibly delicious and fresh.  plus, fabulous desserts."}
{"text":"A cute little pastry shop, for a cute little night out. It's not a big place, it's quite small actually. But the treats are good! Try it out, and sit outside on the tables. I got their ice cream, it was good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Fantastic crepes, and an eye dropping dessert line up.  Great quality!  It is on the pricey side for the amount, but it doesn't disappoint in taste."}
{"text":"Left line is for gelato, sorbe, coffee, and crepe. Right line is for sandwiches. Ordered the Royal Crepe, Berry Crepe, Panini Ham and Smoked Salmon sandwiches. Berry Crepe is great as expected, fresh and tasty. Royal Crepe is made with a prepackaged contents nukes by microwave, quite nasty. Panini and Smoked Salmon are both good but doesn't have that 'omg' factor that justified for the price and the long line."}
{"text":"Hello? Hello!!!! Fatass here. Yeah I stayed at the Aria and ate this everyday. And although I love sweets and croissants, the brioche is my favorite french pastry. I tried the nutella, the caramel... everything else was good too and the hot chocolate too. The parties and chocolates were all beautiful and the displays change and are seasonal.  But nobody puts brioche in a corner."}
{"text":"Gelato museum. See... Easy fix for a sweet treat. Around the corner from the Botanical Conservatory at Bellagio. Kind lady, Sawitree, from Thailand - props for my gelato scoop! The old man who also got pistachio with mint chocolate chip   :-D  bless you for crossing my path that day fellow gelato splurger! A chocolate fountains display???  Choc-awesome-ness!!! Just go already!"}
{"text":"Aaah, who doesn't like a good dessert? Jean Philippe is a must stop for any visitor to Las Vegas with a sweet tooth! The desserts are as tasty as they are pretty-- macarons, petit fours, bonbons, mousse, cake, caramels... Aargh-- it's tough to choose a favorite!  I like this location a little bit better than the Aria one. It's a little smaller and it doesn't have the gelato or cafe shop, but it's much more quiet and away from the smoke and casinos so you can focus on your scrumptious dessert. Lines can get pretty long, but it moves quickly. You can always admire the famous chocolate fountain while waiting.   There's a lot of fancy places on the strip, but this one truly lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Right after we checked in, we made a bee line over to Jean Philippe! Who needs dinner when you can have LV's best macaron, gelato and truffles?!  The Aria branch is bigger and has better selection-- it's got a gelato shop, a cafe and a pastry shop all rolled into 1 corner. However, it is right in the middle of everything-- the casino, foot traffic, bars, smoke and noise-- that it's tough to focus on my pretty pastry. That of course didn't stop me from coming here three times (and another three at the Bellagio branch)!   My faves:  smoked salmon and bagels  Chocolate croissant Nutella and banana crepe Caramel nougat Dark chocolate cheesecake Triple chocolate mousse Macarons, truffles and gelato!   Seriously, skip room service and head here instead!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at Aria in their penthouse suite for a couple days and had credit we had to use, so we came here for their breakfast and their croissants are very buttery and fluffy and their dessert are amazing! I decided to get their mini wedding cakes and couldn't decide on which type of chocolate (milk, white or dark) so I bought all of them and turns out these little delights had a hazelnut filling with some type of wafer that gives it a little crunch. Really awesome stuff!! If you ever get a chance, you should definitely stop by and grab a bite to eat or take dessert to go!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Super nice bakery/cafe in the middle of Aria.  We ordered 2 types of cheesecake and it was top notch.  A bit pricey IMO beyond the tiny desserts since I am not a big fan of Cheesecake, but it was totally worth it"}
{"text":"Tried their ice cream, it was good, but I thought it could be better, kind of expensive, but we are in Vegas so everything is expensive."}
{"text":"Pastries are very good. Plain old coffee is way overpriced. The service needs improvement."}
{"text":"The pastries here are delicious. Croissants, Brioches, and the Palmiers were are outstanding.  The staff do a good job of fulfilling customer orders, and thereby keeping the line moving.  There are a fair number of tables if you want to dine here. But it's located deep in the Casino area. If you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere, the other location in the Bellagio may be a better choice."}
{"text":"I've only tried their gelato and I thought the flavors I tried were all very sweet and artificially flavored.  The strawberry gelato tasted like candy and had the texture of a really soft laffy taffy.  I was not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Located in the beautiful Aria hotel, Jean Philippe Patisserie offers an array of desserts, pastries, chocolates, gelato and so much more. Everything is so beautiful to look at, each little treat looks like a piece or art, and the gelato is amazing. Definitely make sure you stop in for a treat if you are passing the Aria hotel."}
{"text":"Some of the most unique creations! The cupcakes were unlike anything I've ever seen before! Anyone with a sweet tooth HAS to make it out here!"}
{"text":"Had their wonderful crepes for breakfast this morning and yummy gelato yesterday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great crepes, Gelato, and creme brûlée. I liked the savory crepes over the sweet. My fiancé was entranced by the chocolate fountain while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"While the desserts are tasty and well made. The prices and service is not.   You could tell everyone working their just WISHED they were somewhere else at the moment. They could care less about actually serving you unless you asked for help.   We ordered the sweet trio and my friend told the worker if we could get the second one as the first one was damaged. For some reason she told another worker to do it instead and did not relay the message at all. It was only after we paid and were seated that we noticed that the dessert was damaged and had to bring it back for them to give us another.   Though not very difficult, we shouldn't have had to deal with that to begin with."}
{"text":"i think i found my new pastry shop on the vegas strip!.... All The pastry are beautifully put together, the presentation of each one of them is gorgeous, they also have gelato and breads with looked very very good. Yes, they might be a little more expensive than most places but i think theyre well worth it....and they have a variety of different ones to choose from....  This place is so beautiful, even if you dont want to buy anything it would be fun to just go in and look around.....they have a giant chocolate fondue fountain, three tier cakes around the store, and the huge display eagel made with chocolate...  i had to take everyone from home one of these suckers....the rose macaroon had a floral taste to it, the flan was thick and flavorful, and my fav was prob the nutella Napolean.....so rich, perfect for my sweettooth."}
{"text":"One of the best patisserie in Vegas. We had chocolate croissant, basil chicken panini and roasted beef sandwich. I do recommend them all."}
{"text":"The glass cases are mighty pretty, but the sweets disappoint.  A case of style over substance and again, Aria is geeking vegetarian clientele at yet another eatery.  We ordered 5 cake desserts to bring to our room and we sampled all of them.  Key lime, 2 Snickers cake, carrot cupcake and cheesecake.  This cost about $30.  Surprise!  The \"cakes\" are really mousses.  Even the cheesecake.  Uh, not what we were expecting.  The snickers cake was just a lot of chocolate mousse too.  Ok, just warn me, will ya?  We tried coming again - for breakfast.  Guess what?  Jean Philippe wants to punish vegetarians too, like Sage and the Aria buffet do.  There are NO hot vegetarian food options for breakfast.  All the breakfast sandwiches and pannini have ham on them and the servers told me they were forbidden to remove the ham.  That leaves Aria vegetarian guests who want breakfast food to either go to the $30 buffet to get some eggs without ham or wait 30 minutes in line for the worse than Denny's quality food at Cafe Vettro.  Ah well, I guess we'll have to try Wynn next time, where vegetarians are actually welcomed."}
{"text":"Very cute place to go! I ordered a delicious sandwich that I wish I could remember the name of, but the alcohol made this difficult to do... Anyway, delicious! Great late night snack."}
{"text":"thisssssssssss place is my favorite. im a vegas local and work on the strip. i tell all my guests to get dessert here. they have soooooo much deliciousness to choose from. i have seriously tried almost everything and not one complaint. i suggest going here if you are visiting or simply on a staycation.   service is very mellow but for quick service its good.  they have cappucinnos and espresso drinks that pair perfectly with your sweet to end your meal. please take my advice nd go here."}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe at aria rocks.working 24/7 with amazing location between main tower and sky suites and providing fresh baguettes and sandwiches especially salmon a must try one. quiche with asparagus was soso but place is definitely perfect spot to get a tea or coffee"}
{"text":"This review is for SERVICE only and based on our last experience this past Saturday.  Being Vegas residents and this being my husbands favourite chocolatier in the world, we visit it about once a month. In the past decade we have probably tried everything on the menu! Needless to say the only reason we keep going back is because we love their creations. On Saturday we were there with our 5 yr old son who is highly allergic to nuts. As precaution and matter of habit, every time we are in a restaurant we ask if his food contains nuts. We did the same at JPP (and this is not the first time we've taken him there). We got him a chocolate mousse looking thing (the patisserie shelves were almost empty and some items did not have any name-tags on them) and while placing the order asked if it had any nuts. The supervisor says, \"we don't guarantee anything\". That's the strangest answer I've ever heard. Well, no one one this planet can guarantee anything, but since the pastry doesn't have a name-tag and since you guys have made it can you perhaps tell me if it has nuts? Now the guy gets extremely irritated and tells us in a curt tone, \"no, it has no nuts, but we cant guarantee anything\". Needless to say we were very upset by his attitude but not wanting to disappoint a 5yr old we got him the mousse and left. This has to be the first time in 10 yrs my husband left without getting a crepe or some chocolate dessert for himself."}
{"text":"Gelato flavors below expectations. Very neutral, lack of flavors, disappointing. Baskin Robins has tastier selection!"}
{"text":"This place is just so inviting with all the sweets, it just calls you, \"come here!  eat some sweets!\"    Long overdue review from Vegas trip in January 2012.    Tried the Caramel twist, good.   Turkey croissant - bread was flaky and yummy stuff inside was okay.   Dessert was yummm, just went sugar crazy!    Love seeing the cake designs too!"}
{"text":"The JP location in Aria was beautiful and inviting.   I was impressed on the elegance even though it's suppose to be a cafe style type of dining.  Everything on the menu looks good.  But looks are deceiving.  We ordered the black forest crepes $13.25 and tiramisu.  The crepe was okay.  It was a huge portion.  But was disappointing that the cheese, ham, and mushroom was not cooked enough so that the crepe was served hot!  The tiramisu was good.   It wasn't too sweet and rich and goes well with coffee.      Overall, this place was overrated. In addition, the price is high for cafe style dining.   I would give JP another try but this time at Bellagio.   I hope i won't be disappointed again."}
{"text":"Yet another awesome establishment inside the Aria.  I didn't try the food, but I did indulge in the pastries and coffee.  Be prepared to pay tourist prices here... it's not cheap by any means. The quality is very high and the service is great.  I particularly enjoyed this place because they allowed me to grab and go without me having to worry about how I'm dressed.    Their cheesecake and gelatos are a no brainer."}
{"text":"Ordered a crêpe with Nutella and berries. SOOOO delicious. Made super quick and still piping hot in the box (though the whipped cream melted a little bit from the heat, naturally) when I walked back to the attached Vdara. We split it and loved it. The next day, I had a latte and a plain croissant for breakfast and those were very good. I've been to Paris and had my share of fare, and this is probably the closest to it that I've had in North America thus far. LOVE this place for continental-style breakfast & also for the dessert, of course. Hope to try more of the menu when I return to Vegas. :-)"}
{"text":"The pastry here was really good! Every time we visit here we have to visit this place. The ice cream was good but not WOW! Overall it is our spot to eat for pastry in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on one of Rachael Ray's traveling shows...embarassing to admit ,but she actually suggested a great place for once (unlike the Bellagio buffet....another review for another time).  Thank goodness the Bellagio has proper signage, I probably wouldn't have found it as fast as I did! Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is located almost directly behind the Conservatory. The chocolate \"waterfall\" is amazing! Seeing it in person makes you want to jump right in and take a swim - pictures don't do it justice! The shop is decently small, but with a little squeezing around the other customers my husband and I were able to look at everything - it was a busy night! They have an assortment of decorated cakes on display, my favorites were the glittery toucan and the 'Ratatouille' movie themed cakes. Once we got all of our looking out of the way, my husband and I got in line and ordered a couple of items. I got the carrot cake (omg....BEST carrot cake of my life!!!) and my husband got the tutti-frutti (this was really great also, not too sweet, just perfect). This is now a permanent stop on our Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Very very very long line and absolutely no tables or chairs to sit. However it's to be expected because of the ambiance and the fact that they have the largest chocolate fountain in the world. Their deserts are delicious also. We just had biscotti but they were more than enough to go with our coffees. Excellent!"}
{"text":"PATISSERIE GALORE !! When walking through the Aria casino, the beautiful and dreamy decor of Jean Philippe Patisserie catches everyone's eyes.  JPP sells prepackaged goodies, gelato, paninis, dessert pastries and savory pastries.  They're also a cafe selling teas and coffees.  I tried the ham and cheese panini and the chicken pesto panini, both which were absolutely delicious.  I also picked out four dessert pastries, all which were amazing (and I don't even like sweets).  Though the paninis were $10 each and the pastries $6.90 each, I'm definitely coming back here to try the rest of the items that they have !"}
{"text":"Great CHOCOLATE CROISSANT and ALMOND CROISSANT!  I was a little nervous getting it but it was all for nothing.  They were both fantastic, great flaky texture on the exterior and nice soft chew towards the center.  For me, the almond croissant had the perfect amount of almond paste too.  We also got their STICKY BUN and although it was good, I think I prefer the ones that use more of a brioche dough rather than a danish dough."}
{"text":"After having lunch, my BF and I decided to get some dessert on the strip. Of course Jean Philippe Patisserie came up to my mind right away as there are so many pastry options. Located in Bellagio hotel, this place is hard to miss because you will see a line waiting as well as a chocolate fountain in the front of the shop. I was originally thinking just to get one dessert but then everything looked so tempting, I end up getting flan cake and nutella napoleon. The flan cake was way too heavy for me. The dough tasted super raw and thick. I was expecting it to be a little spongy but it was totally the opposite. I did enjoy the nutella napoleon. I love how the hazelnut flavor popping out of the pastry flavor. The pastry was also crunchy. Be ready with the sugar crush afterward. I would say if you don't know where to go for breakfast, lunch or dessert, you could come here as they have varieties of food/drink/dessert options. I probably would not come back again since the quality of dessert was just average for me."}
{"text":"Must stop place in Vegas! Great spot to grab a deliciously fresh salad and quick bite sandwiches.  Also, binge on cute, colorful desserts.  Wish we could have tried more pastries, but couldn't be too greedy. Will stop by next time, in vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the Snickers Cake and the Key Lime Tart. Delicious! Beautiful Shop :)"}
{"text":"I found it a bit difficult to find since I had to go into the Bellagio. It's pretty great the assortment of desserts (gelato, eclairs, napoleon, fruit tarts, etc) they have and they also have crepes! However, it's a little confusing how to go about ordering since there are two different places to form a line. At one line you can buy crepes. There is a chocolate fountain on display which is pretty cool. It does feel a bit cramped. The desserts were good."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great selections but I have to say it overpriced. I order fruit tart, Tutti fruity, tiramisu and Creme brûlée, all are $7 each. I like all but the fruiti tuiti is a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I waited in line for a long time, but was later told it was not the line for crepes. It was very confusing when there are two different lines in the same general area with no sign or display for customers. What was worse was the fact the lack of customer service and apparently, they, too, don't know which line is for what. I asked the lady making the crepes in the morning where should I line up for crepes? She pointed at the coffee line which was extremely long. I waited for 20 mins and finally got to the register, the cashier made a face and told me I was in the wrong line. I try to explain, but she snapped at me and said, we never accept crepe orders. I felt bad holding up the line trying to explain the mix up. At the end, they took my order, but scolded me for it. It was extremely unpleasant experience being scolded for their incompetence."}
{"text":"We had $50 daily worth of resort credit at Aria, which we really had a hard time using up, as we had already made dinner reservations elsewhere for the remainder of our stay... so we did what any foodie worthy person would do... head to Jean Phillipe and start pointing to pastries that look good, until you've covered your allowed $50 for the day...  Likes: the almond croissant is just fabulous, very well done, crunchy, not gummy as many others I've tried, with a delicious almond paste filling. Also on the top of the list are both Brioches' (the Nutella & Dulce de Leche) with a nice amount of filling... no skimping here. The cinnamon roll was very good, but nothing extraordinary.  Dislikes: The desserts.  Both cheesecakes we tried, pumpkin & original were not really proper cheesecakes, but rather a lighter version made with mouse.  Too much air, too light for a cheesecake ... When inquiring I was told that most if not all of their cakes and desserts are made with mouse. A proper cheesecake should be a bit dense, not too sweet, with a bit of cream cheese taste still identifiable... and these just weren't."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna put it out there... I don't discriminate when it comes to desserts but this place was amazing! I couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful desserts in the window.   Just a little tip... take a look at the entire window before you get in line to order because you won't be able to make up your mind once you are on the spot. Everything looked amazing and I had the hardest time deciding what to get.   They have desserts, gelatos and pastries. I ended up getting a scoop of the mango gelato and the hubby got a chocolate imperial. Both were delicious. The mango sorbet was very vibrant, tart and flavorful. The chocolate imperial was rich, decadent and had a hint of hazelnut essence."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast one morning while in Vegas and my senses were on total overload! There's bound to be a line, but that's ok. It will give you time to check out the amazing cakes on display around the shop. I only wish I could afford a wedding cake like these! Check out the rice krispy treat balls, the truffles and the mini wedding cakes. There's the chocolate fountain that looks like something even Willy Wonka would have been proud of. Four different types of chocolate flow out of pipes in the ceiling, streaming over glass platforms into the floor. You can even buy bottles of chocolate from the fountain.   My partner got a basic bagel with cream cheese. I figured I'd try my hand at a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant. The bagel wasn't anything special, I guess, but both of my croissants were just about perfect! Flaky and soft, not dry at all. The next time I go back I'd probably get the same thing, but i'd probably indulge in some of the amazing chocolate and other goodies there too."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Las Vegas. We had the most amazing almond croissant here. The nutella brioche was also very good. The cappuccino was wonderful. Cafe au lait was ok and so were the gelato."}
{"text":"After seeing pictures on Yelp about this place, I decided to have breakfast here.  When we arrived at Bellagio, we had a hard time figuring out where the store was.  Well, it turns out that this place looks more like a fast food joint, rather than an upscale restaurant.  Anyways, the menu on the wall only states the selection of crepes and drinks they had.  It did not mention anything about their sandwiches or breads.  Well, since we're here, might as well buy something to eat.  The line was pretty long.  By the time we got to the front of the line, we saw sandwiches and breads so we ended up ordering 2 sandwiches.  Both sandwiches were pretty good but it's nothing to rave about.  I couldn't even remember the name...I'll skip this place the next we're here."}
{"text":"Pricey but exceptional.  Every dessert is fantastic and if looking for a quick breakfast (if you're lucky enough to get there with no lines) this is the best in town.  Coffee is exceptional, and while there are long lines, service is surprisingly fast.  Definitely a must try if staying at Aria and want to the start the day on a high note.  And the display out front by itself is worth a journey to Jean Philippe."}
{"text":"Great spot for an afternoon snack. From crepes to pastries and gelato, it's a cute place to try. I got an omelette after my workout in the hotel gym. Fast and convenient right next to each other. I've also tried the savory crepes and Nutella crepe. Pretty good but Nutella was too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Annoying service, stupid amount of plastic you have to throw out....  BUT don't go anywhere else for pastries or desserts.  Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Having just spent a week at the Bellagio, Jean Philippe became a breakfast/lunch/snack/late-snack/just because staple.  I can't even believe how much food my fiancé and I ate from this place!  Turkey crêpes  Nutella crêpes Coconut Macaroons Gelato Madelines Chocolate Hazelnut spread Cheesecake Nutella Napoleon Proscuitto, Basil, Mozarella Panini (good served both hot and cold) Turkey croissant sandwiches Meringues Nutella Brioche Dulce de Leche Brioche Plain Croissants Chocolate Croissants Umm...  Yeah  Kinda went a little overboard, but I have no guilt.  I agree that the service can be hit-or-miss but generally, we did pretty well. Try to avoid ordering just before closing, or risk being crushed in the gate by the employees as they try to close for the night."}
{"text":"I visit Vegas 6-7 times a year and JPP has become a must-stop every time I'm here. Every single thing I have tried here has been amazing from the ice cream to the crépes to the croissant sandwiches to the chocolate bars.  Not only are the offerings delicious, they are beautiful, each hand designed by hard work, making the experience even greater.  My favorites? Try the dulce de leche crepe with a side of the dulce de leche ice cream. If you want something savory, try the turkey croissant sandwich. For a delicious dessert, try the exquisite cheesecake.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Chocolate! Fancy chocolate! This place is great for an after dinner sweet bite. We went at Christmas and they have a lot of great candy Santa's."}
{"text":"I really do wish I tried one of their phenomenal looking desserts, but I couldn't quite justify paying $6+ for their small, but beautifully designed, desserts.  But still I'm rather saddened I didn't get to try something...  =[  However, I did dine here for lunch on two separate occasions. $10 for a designer sandwich is justifiable in my book and all of the sandwiches were satisfying.  Roast Beef Sandwich - Fat stack of soft, rare slices of roast beef.  My favorite of the four sandwiches I tried. It was served in a challah bread that was the best challah bread I've had to date: soft, moist, and not overly egg-y. Turkey Croissant - The croissant was extremely flakey, so that was a plus. The turkey was good, but there was not enough cranberry sauce (not that it needed it).  Prosciutto Panini - Tasted good but ultra buttery. My hands were covered in butter from holding the sandwich and a pool of butter collected beneath my hands as well.   Smoked Salmon Sandwich - It was like eating lox and bagels but on a roll instead. Nothing more, nothing less.   This is a good stop for people on the go and in need of a quick meal before they head off to their next destination. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"I love the hot chocolate and mochas here! I look forward to visiting for the Christmas display every year so I can get this drink."}
{"text":"The have the world's largest chocolate fountain, which is worth a picture but I'm not sure what else you would do with that information. There are some great pastries which seem to be fresh (although I only tried them early in the morning before the place got packed). They also have a variety of cakes and desserts which are fun to look at. Cupcakes at $10, I think I will pass. If you are walking in or around the Bellagio, it is worth a stop in here."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! I was craving a crepe and found the perfect spot! The chocolate fountain was beautiful! Great friendly service! So many elegant desserts. I enjoyed the best Nutella with fresh strawberry crepe and will definitely go back every time I visit Las Vegas! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"The service here was just awful. Their whole setup is a mess. This establishment needs to rethink their location and operations scheme."}
{"text":"The aura and quality of baked goods is just not the same as with Jean Philippe Patisserie once housed here!  Limited are the selection of pastries!  Service was average at best with no smiles!  The quality of napkins, yes napkins has declined!  Being nostalgic, I went over to Bellagio for probably the last time of JP being there also!  Here's in finding a new patisserie for my treat each and every morning of my stay in Vegas this coming year!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Although both JPP's in Vegas are huge, Aria edges out the one at Bellagio for selection and service.  There were also at least twice the amount of employees at this location so the line moved a lot faster.  I was able to buy some truffles and other chocolate treats to bring back home!  Quick tip: be sure to refrigerate your chocolate ASAP otherwise it'll melt in the Vegas sun!  We were lucky to have an extra mini fridge in our room so it wasn't a problem but our cousins who came along were devastated when theirs melted before they had a chance to bring them back to their hotel.  I am also noticing the reviews for the food at JPP so I'll have to add that to my list of must-eats next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love chocolate so it was a must-do on our Vegas list to visit JPP's famous chocolate fountain.  It was incredible to say the least and I was able to buy a \"piece\" of the fountain to bring back home as souvenirs for my sisters.  I noticed that the chocolate was coming from the ceiling my noted this to my husband who didn't miss a beat and replied that JPP's chocolate must be coming from heaven. :)  Although I'm sure that this isn't the case, JPP's chocolate truffles really were heavenly.  However, the selection at JPP Bellagio is a lot smaller than the JPP Aria so I'll give this one 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Very beautiful and taste as good as it looks. Lovely flavors . I love this place. Loved the key lime tart. You can taste the love in these delectables . I was in heaven. A must try place. You will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Seriously however long the line may be- wait.  It is sooooo worth it.  I use to live in Paris and their palmiers tasted just like ones I use to buy there.    Don't make our mistake and split a vanilla eclair.  Buy one each- they are heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday around 7pm with my family. It was a little difficult to find, but we found it soon enough. I thought the place would be bigger and the lines were long. I was sort of confused of what line was for what. The gelato (I got dulce de leche) was yummy and I might have dreamt about it. Some of my family members got the crepes and they found them to be \"okay\" and not really worth the $10 price."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a Bachelorette Party this weekend. We stayed at the Aria and this Patisserie was located right by the elevators so it became our go-to spot if we wanted to grab a bite to eat.  They have Salads, Sandwiches, Coffee/Tea, Pastries, etc. I had their Ham and Cheese sandwich for dinner one evening as well as their Chocolate Croissant for breakfast one morning. The Sandwich had very fresh ingredients and I loved the bread, it wasn't your typical sandwich bread. They were small, long rolls. My cousin and I were able to finally try the Chocolate Croissant on our last day there; she had been eyeing it from the first day we checked in. The Croissant was fluffy and buttery and the chocolate was decadent.  They have lots of seating but we always brought back our food to our rooms.   Minus 2 stars for their expensive prices and staff; they weren't very friendly."}
{"text":"Aside from Juice Farm at The Palazzo, Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria has gotta be the healthiest place to eat on The Strip.  Take, for example, their blueberry danish. Upon eating the fruit, my abs instantly firmed up. Some of their tarts have fruit as well, so it's basically the equivalent of the produce section at Whole Foods.  Not to be outdone, every time I eat their gelato, I drop weight in my thighs and hips, whether it's their cookies and cream or hazelnut flavor. Perhaps it's because the portion isn't substantial (it's $5.75 for 2 scoops).  I've felt my pecks expand just from looking at nutritious crepes being prepared - that's done far more for me than bench pressing ever has.  Beware though, not everything here is super-healthly, as they also offer salads and a veggie sandwich.  The decor is stunningly spectacular. I don't know if I've ever entered a dessert establishment that's more enticing - it's like paradise for those with a sweet tooth. However, i think that leads to some viewing Jean Philippe more favorably than warranted. Since I stay near Aria often, this is an easy dessert stop for me, but I wouldn't go out of my way if I'm at another part of The Strip. I prefer Art of Flavors, Holsteins, and Bouchon Bakery, but Jean Philippe is a spot that you definitely have to see in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best sweetest place ever!!!!! My friends kids always love to have their gelato!!! And I love to get Togo coconut tuiles. Decoration is very unique and looks very nice! ^^"}
{"text":"Kinda over rated in my opinion. Waited in line for 25 min at 8:30 am for so so crepes. The late was good though."}
{"text":"Coconut Chocolate Tuiles are amazing!  Everything is pretty good here, even their green power smoothies!"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato!!! mmmmm!!! They have a huge selection too! So many to choose from. I've tried a few (i.e., mango, strawberry, and pistachio) and all were delicious! I love how they have a chocolate fountain there too for the customers to stare at while they're waiting in line for their gelato! mmm...makes you want to buy chocolate or just stick your finger in there to taste it!"}
{"text":"What is it about this patisserie that has me coming back here every time I go to Vegas?  Located inside the Bellagio, it goes without saying that the prices are ridiculously expensive.   But their gelatos are creamy and never too cold, you can have your choice of plain waffle cone or a chocolate dipped one.  Their crepes are average, but the enticing display of beautifully made pastries will have you salivating from the rose macarons to the triple chocolate mousse.  Uh-huh. Don't say I didn't warn you.  Their biscottis are always appreciated by my co-workers too."}
{"text":"Maybe it's what I ordered but i wasn't impressed with this place at all.  Their decor was really nice especially with their chocolate fountain.    We ordered the crepe with the exotic fruits on it. All it had was the crepe, the fruits were I guess all pureed together and bit of mango.  Since all the fruits were pureed, to me it tasted and had the texture of baby food! It was too weird and not so good. The ice cream that it came with was pretty good though.  It was coconut and it had real coconut shavings in it.  Overall, the place is cute, but everything is really overpriced.  Our crepe was $10 and looking at everything else, it's pretty overpriced. But then again, what do you expect?  it's vegas!"}
{"text":"The largest chocolate fountain was enough to impress anybody. Their rose macaroon was delightful, just the right amount of sweetness. My husband really enjoyed his cheesecake. We also tried their berry crepe. I expected a more fluffy crepe, although its sauce was very good."}
{"text":"Nice selection, wonderful flavors, but over priced. Understand the over the top presentation in Vegas. $30 for 3 kids gelato- hmmm."}
{"text":"Returned to this patisserie this weekend for ice cream one night and breakfast one morning. It's incredible how a few years can change your perspective.    The ham, cheese and mushroom crepe was absolutely incredible! I would return for this no matter where on the strip I was staying. The crepe had the perfect crisp and the interior was gooey with the perfect mix of ham, mushrooms and swiss cheese.    I really loved the oreo ice cream too. We ended up loading up on some sweets to-go and the highlights were the sugar cookies and the chocolate covered peanuts.   The best place to satisfy your sweets cravings in the Aria!"}
{"text":"I got the Créme Brûlée flavored ice cream and it was very good! All the desserts were very pretty. The line was long at first but it moved very fast."}
{"text":"This little cafe area was located right next to the Aria Guest Elevators and it was dangerously tempting EVERY SINGLE TIME.  I went there three times during my four day stay haha.  It definitely gets crowded here with the long lines and small seating area.  Definitely have someone in your party go wait for a table and have them order for you.  They have a huge variety of coffee, pastries, desserts, crepes, gelato, omelettes, salads, and sandwiches.  It could get complicated as there are three lines.  The right side is the coffee and pastry line.  The left side has two lines (but they sell the same things) and they sell coffee, crepes, and omelettes.    CARAMEL TWIST: I LOVED this coffee drink so much.  It was still strong, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  I ordered this every single time. WINNER IN MY BOOKS.  BERRY CREPE: Not overly sweet and it's yummy.  Made to order fresh!  This crepe comes with marinated berries on top and a scoop of whipped cream on the side.  Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.    MUSHROOM OMELETTE: HUGE omelette with mushrooms scattered around.  It does cost like ten dollars, but at least  they make it seem like they used five eggs to make it haha.  Healthy and hearty choice.  GELATO: I only tried the creme brûlée and mango gelato.  Both were good, but I definitely could only handle so much of each.  The texture was on point, but the flavors were both on the strong side.  Creme Brûlée was sweet and mango tasted a little too artificial for me.    ALMOND CROISSANT: It was big and yummy.  Inside the croissant, there's a sweet paste.  I definitely needed help finishing it because I can only handle so much sweetness, but it was definitely good.    This place can get a little pricy, but what isn't in Vegas?  I also noticed they had another location in Bellagio too!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is genius! wish I could bake like him lol. The lines here can get pretty long, but the workers keep it moving pretty fast. I suggest you come early because they don't make their pastries all day. They just make a whole bunch fresh the start of every morning so once they sell out of an item you're gonna have to wait til the next day! It's pretty expensive here, but it's vegas and the breads/pastries are totally worth it. Everytime I come to vegas I always have to get their apple brioche and turkey croissant sandwich. The chocolate croissant and cookies are divine. I've tried a bunch of the other goods here and none have disappointed me"}
{"text":"This is chocolate heaven!  I am like a kid in a candy store at this place and this is my kind of candy store. There is a crepe place on the left and a café on the right of the chocolate shop. Since I have just had dinner I looked around to view the beautiful delicacies...I ordered a box of bonbons. I love the lemon flavor the most, I also like the praline, dark chocolate, and orange.  My husband loved the peanut orange.  We did not care much for the banana and my cousin loved the coffee flavor and salted caramel.  I want to come back and try the pastry."}
{"text":"If you go to LV for a family trip, this is the place to be!  If you have a sweet tooth, don't go here everyday or your teeth would decay.  This place is almost like Heaven.  I really adored the cool chocolate and white chocolate fountains coming down from the celling.  Did I mention that their 'smoked salmon sandwich' is also delightful as well?  Don't forget to buy it with their chocolate crepe... ahhhh.. my mouth is watering as we speak (read).  I would most definitely come here again.  Also, there's this crepe maker Rosetta from Hawaii, don't let her make your crepes, she's really mean and has bad customer service.  Other than this, it was love at first taste. :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Almond Croissants ever! This location in the Bellagio is much smaller than the one at the Aria (1/3 the size), but the line is usually shorter, and they don't run out of Almond Croissants as quickly as they do over there. The pastries and cookies, etc. selection is essentially the same, but slightly less variety. This is the same for the gelato. This time around we tried the Crème Brulee flavor (too sweet), and Hazelnut (pretty good).   I will definitely be back for more pastries from Jean Philippe!"}
{"text":"I've had some hits and misses with items at Jean Philippe's Patisserie, but his Almond Croissant and Palmier are delicious! My friends and I stayed at the Aria, and the Patisserie is conveniently located right in front of the elevators so you can stop by on your way in or out of your room. However, make sure you come early if you want a particular item (like the Almond Croissant) as they do sell out of things! This time around I tried:  -Cheese Danish ($4.25), Croissant ($4.25) phttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA#dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA]: The Cheese Danish was pretty good, but not as delicious as some of the other items. However, the plain croissant was really disappointing, and had a weird taste to it. I might get the Cheese Danish again but would skip on the croissant. -Palmier ($4.25), Blueberry Brioche ($4.25) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-7?select=dqkdPi6K5S-_J6VBw4jANA#pLKoCTqGk01v3AoNUjttjA]: The palmier was amazing! It was a little on the sweet side, but I loved the sticky texture of the sugar glaze and the butteriness of the cookie. A must try! On the other hand, the Blueberry Brioche was just ok, and I didn't like the taste of the marsala or whatever alcohol it had in it. Skip!  I've also tried the coconut cookies they sell in the tubes in the prepackaged items side, and that was just so so. The madeleine was equally disappointing, and the ones from Costco actually taste better. My friends tried the quiche and Chocolate Brioche and really enjoyed it, but I thought the Chocolate Brioche had too dry of a consistency for my liking. Also, the first time I tried the Almond Croissant it was amazing, but this last time it was a little overcooked and not quite as good, but still very tasty!   There is always a short line/crowd of people here, but the service is much faster than at the Bellagio location. There are also small tables to sit at if you want to eat your food right away. They also sell sandwiches and other café type items as well as coffee.   Although their items are not cheap, it is worth it for the quality. I will definitely be back to sample more pastries (and hopefully their cakes/macarons) the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place ! One of my favorites spots in vegas super clean friendly service , delicious food savory and sweet. Their coffee drinks are delicious too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries.  The raspberry macaroon was delightful. The creme brûlée was awesome !!!!!  Loved the experience. Will definitely go back. One place that is definitely not Vegas hype.  Extent legit pastries.  Thanks for the great memories."}
{"text":"Such fabulous desserts!! Went to the Aria location when my friend was here with me and then dragged the guys to the Bellagio location two days later! I'm so happy I went to both. The Aria one is less crowded and located in the casino, the Bellagio location is way more crowded mostly because it's right in the center of the Bellagio and they have a glass case where you can see the chocolate being melted. It's hard to figure out if people are in line or if they're taking photos...  Every dessert is awesome but a little pricey, about 8.50 for each one. But it's a perfect little snack to go with a coffee as you try to avoid the heat of summer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the red velvet cupcake. But it always sold out thou. And their savoy chicken crepes. The price for chicken crepes is reasonable compare to other dessert item."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars  This is my go-to brunch place when I'm on the Vegas strip. Line can be crazy and there's limited seating.   Ham and cheese on baguette (cold) - 4 stars for what it is - a simple French ham and cheese sandwich. The panini version is just as good but was on ciabatta this time (not sure if that's a new thing or the usual).  Chicken panini is a solid 3 stars  Butter croissant is a solid 3.5 stars - felt really airy and empty, but it actually had a nice fluffy and ample filling. The entire pastry is topped with sugar making it really sticky. However, that adds a nice sweetness to the croissant.   The desserts are really pretty and good renditions of classic French pastries. I'm a fan of their strawberry tart. Expensive, but so is all of the other non-ghetto food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bliss... pure bliss! I had one of the dark chocolate small cakes available here and my friend had the rose macaroon dessert. They were both fresh, smooth and absolutely delicious. Given that this place is in the Bellagio, I expected to pay $7-9 for the dessert but I think it was around $6. What a treat! I will definitely come back to this dessert spot when I return to Vegas.   And the huge chocolate fountain is totally cool. I can stare at chocolate dripping down feet and feet for hours... :-) Yum!!"}
{"text":"This is as easy as it gets to enjoy indulgence on a budget in Las Vegas. For a free experience just walk in and check out the beauty of the confections, or instead of gambling it away on a game of blackjack, spend that $20 on a sandwich, crepe, or a delicious dessert and coffee at Jean Philippe Patisserie!"}
{"text":"I first sampled these chocolates when they were left in our Bellagio hotel room - unlike other hotel bedside chocolates, these were incredible - I had to get more to bring home!  The boutique itself is a bit small and does not offer a large selection of items, but it's adequate in getting that chocolate fix.  They have simple chocolate bars, some specialty bars, caramels, hot cocoa (drinking chocolate) and chocolate covered marshmallows.  This is definitely one of those places you always stop by when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The crepe maker are smiling now!!! The people who works here seem to be smiling now!!! I love their crepe. I love their goodies!!! Definitely will come here again!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for being a super star when it comes to pure perfection with every single presentation of various desserts.   It was amazing to see the chocolate fountain flowing with white, milk and dark chocolate at the Bellagio as its display but found the sculpted dragon made out of chocolate molding with pulled sugar even more amazing!  I see why people are attracted to this place.  Talk about great eye candy!    My friend ordered the raspberry tart and the rose tea macaron.  The raspberry tart was basically a crust filled with pastry cream and a tier of raspberries.  That was not something we felt was worth almost $7.  Nothing special.  The rose tea macaron was definitely something out of the ordinary but again didn't retrieve enough of our interest to try it in the near future.  It's basically rose tea infused into cream to give it that distinctive taste.    I went back the next day to the one inside the Aria hotel and got the fruit tart.  Although it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, I wasn't feeling much excitement with the pastry cream nor the crust.  For paying so much for a little pastry, I had high expectations that this would be the best tart I've ever tasted.  Sadly, it just \"looked\" great.    I would probably end up going back to vegas to try their other treats.  Who knows?  I might end up with a favorite!"}
{"text":"Dessert was delicious. Gelato was not overly sweet and big scoops were on the cone so it was a perfect filling dessert. Macaroons we're okay. Nothing too extraordinary. Lots of people taking photos but service was fast and lines breeze through the check out. One less star for being overtly priced---you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"After a walking around for a while and enjoying beautiful Aria we settled on a cup of coffee and something sweet. Something sweet was pretty good. But coffee sucked big time. It was watered down and no taste. Very disappointing. The stuff at the counter was also quite rude.   I gave 3 stars for decor."}
{"text":"husband had the Hazel nut nuttella truffle pastry (forgot the exact name) which was really good, creamy and just awesome.  I had the cookies n cream ice cream and creme brulee which was Delicious. cookies n cream was OK, i actually threw it out so I can enjoy the bottom scoop of Creme brulee. We would come back again to try other deserts. Ofcourse the chocolate fountain was out of this world, and so was the lady of chocolate in the center of the place on top. I didn't give it 5 star because the cookies n cream ice cream being so blaaah.  would love to try the mango ice cream and the rest of the beautiful deserts."}
{"text":"Really cool place to grab a snack at any point of the day. I loved all my pastries and the sandwich was okay too. I would love to try the cakes on display!"}
{"text":"Could have ate here twice a day everyday, it's that f'in good. REAL croissants, not that canned Pillsbury shit everyone makes in Michigan and try to call it authentic. Ham and cheese croissant with bechemal and gruyere is amazing. Nutella Beignet is legit. Such a great place."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Its beautiful decor and the largest chocolate fountain that makes you fantasize about jumping in and swimming in it adds to the beauty of this place. I love the tiramisu cake and their gelatos. The prices are a bit steep for the dessert, but what can you say?? Its Bellagio and you are paying for high end dessert and the ambiance. (which is why I took 1 star away)  The tiramisu has little crunch balls in them which make it very delicious and the smooth and fluffy texture just melts in yo mouth like butta! haha. The gelato is full of flavor and it is usually hard to just choose one flavor.   I love the garden next to it as i walk around eating my goodies. The garden is usually updated every season and I am always anticipating to go there whenever they change it. If you prefer not to walk around while eating your dessert, you can sit on the other side and watch the fountain show as well. Everything about this place really shows elegance and romance."}
{"text":"i love chocolate here sooooooooooooooooo much also chocolate crape was awesome."}
{"text":"I was enticed by the chocolate fountain thinking I was going to get the best hot chocolate ever. It was probably the worst hot chocolate I've ever had. Lukewarm, barely any chocolate flavor, and definitely not worth the price. The almond croissant was okay; good flavor but a little dry and no where near the best I've had. The quiche however was very good along with the Nutella strawberry crepe, which is why I gave this a 3 star instead of a 2. Long wait, steep prices, but some redeeming items in there."}
{"text":"So during my past visit to Vegas, I had to make a one-day side trip to Burbank, and before going out there, my girlfriend asks me to stop by the Jean-Philippe at Bellagio to pick up some cakes for her.    It was the first time I have heard of the place, and she told me that someone sent her office a gift basket of cakes from the place, so she wanted to have some more.  The cakes that I tried were excellent, but more than that, I was just standing there with my jaw on the floor, looking in awe, at the chocolate waterfall/fountain that runs along the side and ceiling of the place.  That was just a sight to behold!"}
{"text":"I'm here with bf on a Sunday morning. This place is a bustling with people waiting along the circular counter. We have chocolate croissant, dulce de leche, espresso and iced tea. Fat mode status since we are on vacation. Everything is so delicious. The croissant is flaky and chocolaty, dulce de leche is oozing with perfect caramel. The staff is very friendly. Will comeback"}
{"text":"If you have any hankering for something sweet, this place will do the job!  Not only are there handfuls of different flavored gelato, there's also an assortment of sweet and savory crepe offerings and mini pastries.  While you decide on what you want, be dazzled by the world's largest chocolate fountain.  Made of confectionary grade chocolate, it took engineers 2 years of planning.  Now that's the kind of engineering work I want to do!  I mixed pistachio and tiramisu gelato in my cup, and though it cost me an Abe Lincoln, the portion was rather generous.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastries and gelato. Be warned though that just one of those pastries will set you back about $10!  I wasn't prepared for the sticker shock  but I suppose it was a good thing since it kept me from buying another calorie bomb. I had the key lime tart with mango which tasted as good as it looked... and then I walked it off. I went back again to try the mint chocolate gelato and it was really good."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, large portions (great size for the money you spend), and the café seating nearby is a lovely spot to take in the splendor inside the shop and hotel."}
{"text":"Best Crepe option on the strip!   You can dine in this little pastry shop and get the full view of their sculptures and trippy cakes, or take it to go and explore the Bellagio and its fine pool area(s). The plastic pewter cutlery here looks a lot like metal, just make sure you don't come here tipsy. Or better yet, do. You'll love it.   Next time I'm around Vegas I'll be sure to spend more money here, and a lot less at the buffets on the strip, thus avoiding the inevitable food poisoning."}
{"text":"I expect Monsieur Jean-Philippe's menu of French café fare to be no less than délicieux, as are its renowned desserts.   Stopping by for brunch in hopes of a light snack (in preparation for a buffet that night), I got the SAVORY SALMON CREPE... which turned out to be gigantic and filling. Maybe the French are skinny because they eat these big healthy buckwheat crepes stuffed with salmon and veggies, leaving no space for buffets. The flavors were simple yet highly complimentary: a heartier dill cream to balance the savory smoked salmon, with chopped asparagus for an earthy dimension and crunch, and a blend of spinach/cheese/tomatoes borrowed from classic omelette toppings. In my opinion it's a bit too heavy on the cheese, but overall quite satisfying.  After tax the crepe totaled to almost $13, which is reasonable for a quality (and ginormous) crepe. Note that the salmon and chicken savory crepes are the same price.  *Be warned that the savory buckwheat crepes are very grainy to the point that it's almost bitter; you'll probably like this only if you like very whole wheat stuff. If you are not adventurous and/or do not have tastes of a health freak, I suggest the sweet crepes for a more familiar and fool-proof dessert.   Service was speedy and professional; it's fun to see them make perfectly flat, perfectly circular crepes and omelettes on the round girdle. While the food display has a clean look, the seating area is limited, uses an ugly marbled pattern on the tables, and faces the neon lights and smoke of the Aria's casino area--I much prefer enjoying my dainty Jean Philippe treats at the dainty Bellagio location."}
{"text":"Stick with a plain sandwich (roast beef, turkey, etc).  The \"French\" style sandwiches are way too rich.  The omelettes are not thoroughly cooked and have way too much cheese. Roast beef sand was good."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure returning to the belagio and ordering my a double scoop of ice cream on a sugar cone.    So many flavors to choose from and you can order crepe. But it's not my first time here, I knew what I wanted so getting in and out was swift and painless.   New Year's Eve, lines were shorter than usually! Boy was I happy to see them open still. Rocky road and dulce de leche to go please.   Very swift process, wait order pay and I was gone back wandering the hotel. I'll be back !"}
{"text":"I was at the Bellagio this past Sunday as i was ready to walk to the Casino to get a free drink I passed by Jean Phillipe hmm i turned around to see the menu was thinking a shake but decided to go generic and get a scoop of chocolate mint gelato, from the first taste i was hooked. I think now that when i go Vegas i will have to make this place a must stop from this point on."}
{"text":"We ate here twice for breakfast while staying at the Bellagio but we should've comeback during the day to see the desserts since they don't put everything out until later!  Trip 1 my husband had a croissant and I had the chocolate crepe which was out of this world! It's not too big or rich to where you feel you can't finish it. It has a nice blob of whipped cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate shavings and brownie bites. Trip 2 my husband ordered the chocolate crepe and I got the Dulche de Leche crepe which features more carmel instead of chocolate. Both were hits with us. We went at different times of the morning and though the place is small there was always plenty of seating and we got our food fast. I could come here for breakfast everyday just to try their huge crepe menu!"}
{"text":"You guys have to come here to check out the chocolate fountain. Its one of the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Also, I gave this place a four not five because I tried their flan and it was ridiculously gross. But their chocolate opera cake is really good it's Tiramisu cup Was not even close to the tiramisu at ralph's. this place has soo much pastries even though I didn't like the flan. I will come back to try more of its pastries!!!"}
{"text":"we came here wanting dessert and left with satisfying portions of delicious gelato, which we sat and ate while watching the endless parade of people wandering by on the casino floor. they have a large selection and it's all really good, and they are open late-ish for post-dinner dessert cravings. i haven't tired anything else, but based on the rave reviews their pastries seem to get, i think i will remedy that on my next trip to las vegas."}
{"text":"Always stop here after walking through the Conservatory at Bellagio. If nothing else- just to marvel at their eclectic selection of cakes and pastries. You'll have to fight your way through the dozens of folks who are always marveling at their giant 15'(?) chocolate fountain. Wife wanted crepes which they prepare right in front of you. I was amazed at the skill and precision of the man who was making crepe after crepe in front of us. Ordered a chocolate crepe which had just the right balance of light/fluffy pastry and chocolate sinfulness to it. Their dessert crepes sell for around $11. Very pleased.."}
{"text":"solid coffee.. solid sandwiches.. perfect for a hangover  the desserts is food porn and you know you want get dirty.."}
{"text":"Literally my first stop whenever I'm in Vegas (I've seriously left my parents to check in at the hotel while I walked over to the patisserie).  It's super chic looking (what else do you expect from a store at the Bellagio) and everything is fun to look at. I usually go with a hot chocolate - not too sweet and you still get a rich, chocolately favor - and a pastry which I change each time. The croissants are magnificently flaky  and my favorite is the almond one. It's a little pricey, but worth it for a treat."}
{"text":"okay this place looks like HEAVEN to me when i first saw it.. ME? i'm a total chocoholic and everything sweet..the whole experience was pretty awesome..although let me be honest that this was not the best cakes i've had, i still think that their cakes was really good..  so when u walked past it, u'll definitely can't missed it..this place is so nicely decorated with their cute n pretty pastries displayed..it makes you wanna drool all over the counter n stare at all those luscious heavenly cakes..it's sort of hypnotizing..well at least it was to me  =)  so after drooling n staring at them..i ended up buying like 7 different kind of cakes n pastries (i wasn't planning to eat it all at once though) i forgot which ones i got cuz it was a while ago n also i bought cakes not by what's inside but by how they appeal to my eyes (typical women decision making process)  but i definitely remembered how smooth n creamy their mousse is and how sweet n decadent their cakes were..they're just great n did i mention pretty? hehehe..  oh well, yes the price is pretty pricey, but i mean u get what u paid for though..it was worth it..cuz it's almost like eating a piece of art..the cakes were nicely made n decorated..some of them even covered in chocolate covers that they made themselves.. definitely a must try when u're in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is an expensive place to be. And getting the worth of every buck is essential to enjoy your stay here so being practical is imperative when you go around and shop and give yourself a treat. Jean Philippe Patisserie is both a sight to behold when you visit Bellagio. They hold a record of biggest chocolate fountain which is such a delight to see. We came here for the sight of their yellow lady made entirely of chocolate and their rich selection of gelato. It was worth the buck without burning a hole in your pocket and they do not skimp on the portions too. What a delight! I got a scoop of dulce de leche and it was divine in every lick."}
{"text":"My friends took me to the one @ Bellagio this past Christmas. I ordered the chicken crepe (i think it's called Black Forest), the souffle crepe and orangina. Everything on the menu is overpriced, but that's expected since it was in Bellagio. The chicken crepe was delicious, but I had better ones at a small joint (Crepe de Paris) in Irvine.   Their souffle crepe was disappointing- I did not taste souffle and and there were barely any fillings- I had to shell out an extra $6 (almost paying for another half of the crepe) for more toppings.   The setup of the place was like a fast food joint. Service was poor- the cashier rushed me to give her my orders. Hey, I've been to McDonalds and never once did a cashier told me to hurry up. The crepe makers were just a bunch of 20 some year olds slapping on ready made stuff from the fridge in the crepe.   Honestly, Jean Philippe, if you are going to charge me $22 bucks for a crepe, you better get your booty in the kitchen or have a legit chef make me that \"awesome\" crepe ,and it better taste better than that delicious unforgettable $9 crepe I had at Crepe de Paris in Irvine.   I don't think I'll want to spend $40 on 2 crepes there again- a one time experience was good enough"}
{"text":"DeeEFFinLicious treats, but be prepared to wait in line.  There was a.  15 min wait for crepes (due to popularity) but service flowed because the people behind the counter new how to get things done.  A+    The Giant Macaroons with raspberries were awsome! It was a stacked and stuffed Macaroon that was almost obscene yet beautiful to look at.  LOL...  Their assortment of goodies is well worth a visit !"}
{"text":"Most people can't help themselves as they start drooling at the sight of the beautiful chocolate fountain circulating at the front of the store.  It is a good thing they have a glass protecting the chocolate fountain, or I can totally imagine all those tourist (including myself) dipping my fingers into the fountain to get a taste of the lovely looking dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate oozing from top to bottom.  As much as I love looking at the chocolate fountain, I really hate this location because it is always packed with people.  They should really open a express line for patrons that only want a cup of coffee.  It was really ridiculous that I had to line up for 30 minutes before I can get to the cashier to order my coffee and be told that the wait time for the crepe will be another 60 minutes.  I like crepes, but not enough to be wasting 90 minutes of my precious vacation time to eat a dessert crepe.  If you want to have a relaxing cup of coffee and some pastries, I highly recommend going to the Jean Philippe at the Aria Hotel instead.  This location at the Bellagio is a total madhouse flooded with tourist."}
{"text":"Beautiful little spot for a fresh delicious crepe and coffee. I LOVE the berry crepe and have indulged twice in the last few days. the apple croissant is light flaky and so buttery....everything is stunning. The coffee is strong and rich.  The creme brûlée is one of the real stars and I will have to work hard at trying of few other beautiful treats.  The chocolate fountain is fun to look at but this is a place for beautifully prepared elegant French rolls, desserts and light meals.  Everyone has been very friendly and efficient. The line isn't as long as it looks. well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Their pastries looked very impressive -- beautiful works of art. I opted for a banana crepe instead (still sweet but not the sugar high their pastries would have been). The line was pretty long, wrapping back around the counter and into the hallway, but it moved fairly quickly. By the time I ordered and paid, my crepe was waiting for me. Soft, delicate, and slightly chewy... yum... caramelized bananas and a huge mound of whip cream... double yum. Sure, it was great, but grossly overpriced at $9 in my opinion. Next time I'll have to try their gelato or pastries."}
{"text":"For anyone craving sweets, this spot is a must. It's a much large space than their sister spot in the Bellagio and has a larger selection. They've got some of the most beautiful and artistic pastries in town with flavors that equal their beauty.   Pastries are perfect any time of day. Their almond croissant was excellent with its flaky pastry and almond paste inside that wasn't too sweet. The chocolate croissant was also good. The interior contained plenty of slivers of chocolate surrounded by a light and flaky shell.   There are so many enticing sweets to choose from. A spiraling cone of cream topped tart custard and a delicate shell to create a key lime tart that I instantly fell in love with. The triple chocolate was a creamy mix of dark chocolate mousse, milk chocolate cream, and white chocolate cream. Their special Easter dessert last April was a work of art that also tasted amazing -- candied pineapple, mandarin cream, carrot sponge cake and oat streusel filled a chocolate egg."}
{"text":"So we went to this place to get one of the beautiful cakes in the window. Unfortunately, they didn't have any available. So we settled for a cute cheesecake covered in white chocolate with raspberries on top. I left the store while my husband paid. We got up to the room and realized that we didn't have any silverware. I went back and waited patiently in line to ask for some. I got up to the register and was completely ignored and never even looked at. I eventually butted in and asked for silverware. The woman very rudely told me it was at the other end of the store. I got my silverware and left. I took a bite out of the white chocolate and it was okay, but I when I got to the cheese cake part, it was very gross. NOT worth $9 for such an itty bitty cake. Both my husband and I took 2 bites and couldn't eat any more. There were raspberries in the middle, but they were also no good. I will most definitely never be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Had the quiche Loraine and a savory crepe and 2 coffees. The crepe was awful and the quiche was nothing extraordinary and probably reheated after sitting. Wasted about 50 bucks on this. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is a treat for all the senses. The chocolate fountain is almost as much of a tourist attraction as the Bellagio fountains. It is definitely a great spot to take your friends and family after taking a gander around the conservatory.  Their desserts are works of art and would be a shame to eat if they weren't so delectable.  Their gelato is of such high quality that it made me turn my nose away to all other gelato places. My favorite is their Nutella gelato.  I used to think crepes were pretty straight forward and tasted all the same until I tried the ones at Jean Philippe. You can just taste the quality in every ingredient from the chocolate to the whipped cream.  The restaurant in Bellagio is quite small compared to the one in Aria. I wish they would expand the place because it can very crowded and there is limited seating.   They are known for their desserts so it came as a surprise to me that their food is just as satisfying. I had the best prosciutto sandwich that I have ever had. Every time I think I have tried the best gelato, crepe or sandwich... Jean Philippe manages to raise the bar even higher."}
{"text":"Awesome dessert shop located inside the Bellagio. We usually pass by it every morning because it's on the way to the lobby, and I'm always tempted to get something each time. Their white mocha latte is really good; I just needed to add some sugar because I prefer it sweet. Additionally, their almond croissant is to die for. They also house the world's largest chocolate fountain and they have a statue of a lady made out of pure chocolate! I'd definitely come back some time to try out what else they have.  Tip: There is usually a line near the front of the shop, but this isn't the real line. It's mainly the line to take a picture of the chocolate lady. The real line starts in the back, so go here and save a lot of time!"}
{"text":"As I get fatter and older, I find myself more attracted to the sweets and desserts my parents shunned me from when I was younger. So going to JPP fulfilled some deep down desire to divulge myself in a delicious dream. Dreams that you have when you sleep alone on a cold night and just want something to remind you that you're still attached to this cruel disdainful world. Anyway, the cheesecake was TOP (I recommend eating it first to get a blast of creamy sweetness and to rebel against your healthy parent overlords) and the crepes were light but portions were filling. Highly recommend going for brunch and brussert (brunch + dessert) but beware of a longer wait #5stars"}
{"text":"Love how beautiful their dessert look! I got the carrot cake and it was amazing..It's a unique take on a classic. Only downside was that it was $8 for a small little portion."}
{"text":"If you are a sweets lover, you must stop by this place while in Vegas. They have the best pastries, crepes, chocolates you will ever eat. The gelato they have is also terrific especially on a hot summer day. The chocolate fountain they have is amazing and you won't believe how much chocolate is flowing through it. The store can be crowded at times, but the lines usually move pretty quickly. My wife loves this place and we must go there every time that we visit."}
{"text":"It's definitely a cool place to check out. I got the opera and red velvet cupcake. The opera was one of the best I ever had and the red velvet was too pretty to eat, but was a let down when I actually ate it. The inside was surprisingly dry. But the worst experience was the Cashier Magali( I think this is how you spell her name). I got my cakes to go and asked her for a spoon, she rolled her eyes and handed me one. I also asked for a bag to put the boxes in as it was hard to juggle two boxes and a drink all the way to my room. She gave us a used and dirty LAUNDRY bag. Can't even make this up. I had to ask another employer on the other side for a clean bag which they got for me. I'm still shocked at the fact that I spent 40+ dollars for 3 items there and the cashier didn't have the decency to give us a bag."}
{"text":"Did anyone actually eat the food here, or are they just reviewing how pretty it looks?    4.5 star yelp review...walking distance from our hotel.  One $ sign...I had to try it.    We got there and hubby got a ham and cheese croissant and I got a savory crepe.    Both were nasty.  Husband's croissant was a greasy mess.  No pockets of air filled in his croissant at all.   My crepe was thick, bland, and a waste of calories.  $20 for a ham and cheese croissant, crepe, and a coffee.  1.5 hours wasted in Vegas.  1,000 calories wasted in my belly. :("}
{"text":"Had their savory crepes and opera cake! Everything we had was fantastic. We also took a vanilla nougat back with us and it was heavenly!! Best we've ever had!"}
{"text":"The Chocolate Souffle Crepe is excellent and unforgettable, but for $11.50, its slightly pricey. The coconut and oreo gelato is creamy at $3.75 each scoop. Great and cheery service  experience. It seems to have a Q all the time."}
{"text":"The birthday cake macaroons are wonderful!! Best I've ever had! I will definitely be returning for more."}
{"text":"I thought it was just OK.  I've had better crepes and MUCH better gelato elsewhere.  They really need to add some class to the service for the price."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if it was worth waiting in line, but when I saw the pastries I couldn't resist.  The items are pricey...about $8 for cakes and tarts. I ordered the fruit tart and the raspberry tart with pistachio mousse.  Not only did they look gorgeous, but they tasted divine.  Even my fiance, who isn't a sweets person, gobbled up the tarts. I glared at him for taking the last bite :)."}
{"text":"Nuttella brioche! Variety of sandwiches (including traditional baked ham and cheese - Croque Monsieur)! Crepes! Gelato! French croissants! Jean Philippe brings the entire sweetness and street food of France and combines it in this one place! A must for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or mid-night snack."}
{"text":"Extremely good!!!! The best tasty treat in Vegas.   Freshly made,  quick service.  Yummy. ..can't wait to visit vegas again to try another treat.  We got to people watch and have a lovely afternoon snack...The iced tea was refreshing too."}
{"text":"When there is a special occasion in my family, the only place we trust with baking our cake is Jean Philippe Patisserie, because special occasions call for special cakes and Chef Claude and his team ALWAYS deliver. This year we ordered from the Aria location. We had a princess party and needed a cake fit for royalty. I showed Chef Claude a picture and he and his team made magic happen. This cake was LEGENDARY. Everything was edible, the towers were made of delicious CHOCOLATE. The pretty pink fondant was shimmery and yummy. We ordered vanilla cake with creme brulee custard and strawberries. The cake was moist and delicious, the creme brulee custard was extraordinary! There were beautiful intricate details added that truly showcase the team's artistry, the picture doesn't do it justice. The cake is the centerpiece of a party and this cake took our party to the next level. Another unforgettable cake. Thank you Chef Claude!  LET THEM EAT CAKE!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my daughter's birthday and it was EPIC. I provided a party plate with the design I wanted and they really brought it to life. Chef Claude and his team are amazing! They created a delicious work of art, my party guests are still talking about it. This cake exceeded my expectations. It was adorable and delicious. I ordered chocolate cake with pineapple cream cheese frosting, it was PERFECTION. Best cake I've ever had! Picking it up was a treat because the Patisserie is beautiful and has the most amazing chocolate fountain and cake displays. The service is excellent. Chef Claude and his team are true artists creating one of a kind creations sure to make any occasion special. Thank you Chef Claude!!"}
{"text":"Above average dessert place.  They have a wide variety of desserts, far exceeding your average restaurant and even a lot of other dessert places. I have had their gelato (was okay) and the triple chocolate (good - not too heavy either).   Its quick service, and far more oriented towards grab and go as there is limited seating."}
{"text":"I didn't sleep well and we had to check out to head to the airport. Must have caffeine. We headed down to the starbucks floor and there was a massive line. MASSIVE! It was insane. We headed down one more floor and found Jean Philippe Patisserie. They had multiple counters and check out points. We ordered our coffee and decided to get some breakfast here. Best decision ever. Although its pricy, the workers here were very efficient and the coffee was pretty good. We got a panini- pretty freaking tasty! I'm sure we got our breakfast and coffee way before we would have gotten our coffee and fatty starbucks breakfast if we decided to stand in the massive starbucks line."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! BOMB.com This is a mandatory stop if you are anywhere near the Bellagio. I optioned to try the Chocolate ice cream with chocolate dipped waffle cone! TO DIE FOR!!! Check my pic and you will see it was worth the $6."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most affordable meal inside Aria. But it is only coffee and pastries. I had a breakfast panini which was served warm with egg, ham and cheese. It was tasty and enjoyable but nothing to rave about. Unfortunately everything here is pre-made, so if you want to take out and ingredient in any of their paninis this is not an option. However, they do have a large selection of fresh made, quiche, paninis and pastries. There is also a connected sweet shoppe with lots of gifty type items. Definitely on the pricey side, but selection is pretty good, you'll find things here that are hard to find elsewhere. Their truffles are amazing, very creamy and flavorful without being too rich."}
{"text":"The assortment and beauty of the sweet delectables is jaw dropping! We didn't come here for desserts but for a quick bite to eat before a long night out (of drinking of course)! Thankfully they had pre-made sandwiches & panini's that they warm up in the oven or on a press for you. I got a chicken panini with cheese and sun dried tomatoes & basil. It was tiny for the price of $13! But the first bite I took into it, it absolutely melted in my mouth. The bread was out of this world! Buttery & crispy, it had french written all over it! I no longer minded the hefty sandwich fee and happily devoured the rest of it! I felt like I ate a couture sandwich!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here- a panini for me and a crepe for my husband. The panini was really good! Crepe was okay. We were full but really wanted dessert so we went for a walk and then came back! Dessert was lovely. And such a gorgeous cafe!   We'll be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars except for the price..which really isn't a shocker since most establishments along the Strip are pretty pricey. Anyways, overall the dessert and crepe are sinfully decadent..The chocolate truffles are so good and the crepe that I got was pretty big. You can share one to lessen the guilt. The coffee was ok nothing to really rave about. I like to stop by once in awhile but because of the price I wouldn't go here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"There was  a Jean Phlippe in the Aria hotel we were staying at.... but I opted to wait until I saw the Jean Philippe chocolate fountain at the Bellagio Hotel - It was so cool seeing the chocolate come out of the sky, and sliding down the glass plates.. not sure where the chocolate goes but I hope it doesn't go to waste!  This bakery was a lot smaller, but it didn't matter - the people lined up around the counter and patiently waited as servers got pastries, sandwiches, and skillfully made the drinks and crepes.  I was on my macaron quest in Vegas and unfortunately, the little ones were not sold from this bakery. There was a little green pistachio macaron on top one of their craft pastries, so I decided to opt for their giant rose macaron - bright raspberry coloured, the size of a hockey pick (approx). with raspberries and custard cream sandwiched in the middle, decorated with a dried edible sugared rose petal on top... pure elegance!  My first bite into this piece of artwork was soft, and well balanced - sweet, but not too sweet, and nice to have some real fruit as a part of the filling. The rose petal only tasted like sugar, so I left it. It was good to share with my friends as the portion for one person can be a little too much. The rosewater was subtle and although an acquired taste, I thought it was just right.  The gelato at JP is really something else. The silkiness is divine and the flavours are bursting with flavour and it seems like any flavours combined would still be perfect no matter what. Trying the oreo and the strawberry... I could not have tasted a better pair. If there was a whole tub, I think I'd eat it all. I don't know how the workers can resist!"}
{"text":"A bright and beautiful patisserie with tons of sweets on display, Jean Phillippe is located right next to the casino floor and is hard to miss. Their presentation is so enticing that your body just kind of forces itself to go inside and take a look. Of course, \"just taking a look\" is impossible when you're completely surrounded by SWEETS!!!!!  I tried to really limit myself here, since it's not exactly cheap. Out of all the different varieties of desserts that they had to offer, I went with the pastry section because it was the most \"bang for your buck\". I was able to get two pasties for a little over $9 and devoured them way too quickly. At 8:30PM, the pastry selection wasn't really as extensive as the pictures on Yelp. I ended up going with the blueberry danish and the cinnamon roll, which were both really delicious. The blueberry danish was very rich in blueberry flavor and the edges were perfectly flaky. The cinnamon roll was also flaky, had a good amount of cinnamon inside, and was topped off with frosting. Not too sweet.  Next time in Vegas, I'll definitely have to try their gelato or their cakes."}
{"text":"The little \"French\" in me sparked by this patisserie in Bellagio where the world's largest chocolate fountain can be seen. Watch and drool over chocolate in dark, white and creamy chocolate flowing right before your eyes. Flash photography aside from tourists snapping at the chocolate fountain, crepes indulgence is what I'd rather do. The \"Royal Savory Crepe\" made with mushrooms, grilled chicken, bacon and cheddar at $10.75 festooned with vegetables was especially yummy. Because I love chocolates, \"Chocolate Dessert Crepe\" is intense! and it is described as with \"intense\" chocolate fudge brownie chunks and whipped creme. The \"Berry Dessert Crepe\" is fruity. Lots of berries but marinated sweet and topped with whipped creme. Some other time, \"Vegetarian Crepe\" completes my vegetarian conventionality. Variety of hot and cold beverages curb my drink demand. In a contemporary modern stool-like seating area surrounding a circular bar where crepes are freshly made on a hot circular large flat plate surface by an efficient crepe chef lady. Cozy, classy place for breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner. I just love crepes and it's here I can go for it each time."}
{"text":"Good place to stop if you have a sugar craving.   I tried their Oreo gelato, the Nutella beignet and the Nutella napoleon. All were tasty but I have had better desserts elsewhere.   I loved the seating area overlooking the casino floor.   The rotating Cake towers are a piece of art!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out what this bakery has to offer. I bookmarked this bakery prior to my Vegas trip and I remembered to look for it while I was in the casino. It's extremely easy to find since it's really bright and it stands out.   The set up is bright with a lot of colorful treats. I came during late night so some cakes were gone. There was a lot of packaged baked goods left but I didn't buy too many since my luggage wouldn't be able to fit so much. Everything looks so good and I wanted to try a lot more. I suggest checking this bakery out. I'm sure you can find something that will appeal to you.   I got the red velvet cupcake, it looks so nice that I didn't want to eat it. It was tasty and I will definitely return if I had this bakery in my hometown.   It was late night, the service wasn't great. I think they should fix that. But the treats were awesome!"}
{"text":"In the land of overhyped and overpriced desserts, Jean Philippe would be my go-to choice. They do a good job here of feeding both your eyes and stomach as any good Vegas hotspot would do. Ooh & aahh over the streams of cascading chocolate and witness the crepe-making process before sitting down to one of your own. But not before you get lost in a crowd trying to find the actual line because Vegas wouldn't be Vegas without this mass of chaos.   I recommend the Banana Fosters Soufflé Crepe. The vanilla creme inside tastes like a thick pudding and is fantastically indulgent. A scoop of ice cream on the side to balance out the thickness/sweetness would have been ideal, but instead I opted for a free cup of tap water to wash it down. Each is good to share between 2-3 people. Jean Philippe also offers plenty of packaged products which make perfect gifts."}
{"text":"I try to visit this particular location every time I come to Vegas. They have a large selection of things i'm not supposed to be eating, so I just choose one. I chose the \"chocolate imperial\" this time. It was a rich mousse and ganache dome with a hazelnut base and vanilla cream center. I definitely needed a drink to wash this down, the ganache was incredibly intense.   I've tried a bunch of cakes from this place, and have not yet been disappointed. Definitely try to come by, it's worth a stop, especially if you're staying in City Center. The alternate bakeries (cough Va Bene cough) are a waste of time."}
{"text":"Art in pastry and dessert form.  Do you just take Instagrams, snapchats or twitter the images? Display them on Facebook for all friends to see?  They're so freaking nice you don't want to put fork to them.  Ah what the heck - smash, stab . . Mmmmm.  Really like all of the desserts - we tried many of them.  The sorbets are tasty too.  Big fan.  And if you want - grab a bag of chocolate covered anythings and have a treat to snack on later."}
{"text":"lost in translation.  the italian 'panini' somehow got translated for JP to 'eponge'  squeeze these sandwiches and watch where they got the inspiration for the waterfall outside.  oh, and the staff were haphazard and inefficient, keeping me away from the tables for far too long."}
{"text":"We stopped at the location in Aria on Saturday morning around 10 AM and the line is already long for the pastries.  There are 2 lines; the left one for gelato & crepes (sweet and savory) and the right one for pastries/breakfast items/coffees.  Based on recommendation from a friend, I ordered all 6 flavors of the cupcakes (chocolate, blueberry, carrot cake, strawberry, red velvet, and lemon?) and 2 chocolate desserts (one with a macaron on top and the other was a chocolate mousse).    These are not cheap cupcakes, at $6 each they are a splurge.  One lady took our order and gave us the receipt then we continue to the cashier to pay while they're getting our items.  Each cupcake was individually box (very nice) and ready for our 4-hour drive home.  The cupcakes made it home in great shape but not the chocolate desserts.  The chocolate desserts melted but the taste is still so heavenly.  Each cupcake was held in a colorful plastic container instead of the typical paper cupcake liner.  True to my friend's recommendation, these cupcakes are amazing.  Each flavor has a layer of cake, and a layer of flavored-mousse (instead of frosting), then top with colorful gelatin.  For the blueberry and strawberry, there's a layer of preserve.  The cupcakes are not heavy and the size is just right, maybe small for people who are used to Sprinkles but they're not sweet like Sprinkles.  All I can say is they truly are the best cupcakes.  Almost forgot to mention their cookies which are located at the cashier.  Saw them as I was paying and asked the cashier to add one chocolate chip and one double chocolate cookie to my order.  She was really nice (no attitude like other yelpers mentioned) and even went ahead and placed them in the cupcakes bag.  At $3.95 each, these huge cookies (about 5 inches diameter) are a great deal because they are very delicious; fresh, soft, slightly chewy and moist.  There are lots of other sweets but they'll have to wait 'til next time we're back in Vegas."}
{"text":"loved the pastries but minus 2 stars for the service, crowds, and price.  great place to stop by for a little treat."}
{"text":"I stopped by here several times to view the largest chocolate fountain and decided on this trip to try something out. The counters are set up in a semi circle so there was no clear way to enter since you can order anything in the shop from either side. When finding this out we waited for our order to be taken and waited for the crepe we ordered to be made. We were fortunate to find a little table near the shop to eat as they crepe was messy, with Nutella, not a bad thing. It was very good except the the whipped cream which was very bland and runny. overall a good experience just not very over the top."}
{"text":"Really nice. Better than expected value. Things taste as good as they look."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe: a pastry-lover's paradise.  It's difficult to walk by without stopping for a treat. The rose macaron (with fresh raspberries) is one of my favorites, but you really can't go wrong.   And if you're looking for something savory, they've got tasty sandwiches and salads, too.  Always my last stop before we hit the road to head home!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of the reasons I like staying at the Aria. We average about two stops per day when we're in Vegas. My very favorite thing is the rose macaron. The macaron is delicate and crisp and perfect and the fresh raspberries are delicious. It's big enough to share, but light and not too sweet and altogether delicious.  The Asian salad is perfect for eating at the pool...refreshing and tangy and spicy, with lots of crisp veggies and well-cooked and seasoned shrimp."}
{"text":"WHOA. WHOA WHOA!!?!?!?!  WHY IS THIS ON THE \"NEW BUSINESS\" PAGE!?!?!?!  I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE DAY 1 AND WE DIDN'T JUST OPEN UP YESTERDAY!?!?!  Trust me, I know what I'm talkin' about!!!  This location has been open since 2006......  Clarence  needs to fix this......or is Darwin up to no good!?!?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Sorry to see this place closed.  It was always a treat to go by and partake of some of the most elegant and scrumptious desserts in town, and view the impressive chocolate fountain.  They were cool, having delightful dessert sculptures on display, as well as sample wedding cakes, and holiday decorations.  They had very elegant silverware (that was really plastic, but you couldn't tell), and very, very thick napkins, which felt like cloth.  It was luxury.  So were the prices, but you didn't mind.  The crepes, both sweet and savory, which you could see being made, were so well-made, perfectly cooked, and flavorful.  Oh, well, alas."}
{"text":"Line at 10:30am on Sunday was out of control. Still, I'm glad I stuck it out - best freaking almond croissant I have EVER eaten. Yummmmmm.  Also tried the mini-sandwich trio later in the day. Loved the tuna (don't be turned off by the odd color), veggie was a'ight, and ham was just not my thing. It would be great to take to the pool and split between pals if you aren't so into forking over $16 for a premade turkey wrap. Pool money should be spent on booze."}
{"text":"Oh my chocolate cupcake heaven! Yeah, wowwed this time, but shocked at price for small cupcake, but so joyful thanks to beautiful chocolate...  Still hate the lines and crowded setup..."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in a line. We checked out the Jean Philippe in the Bellagio and that was a cluster \"you know what\", so we decided to go to the Jean Philippe at Aria. At least the line is linear and doesn't confuse you like the one in the Bellagio.  Expensive, but the taste is GREAT! It's hard to find a decent French patisserie in San Diego, so I'm happy to shell out a little more cash.   Sandwich: I was super happy with my prosciutto sandwich. I think it was about $8 and I was satisfied with what I had. The bread had the famous crunch that French people cherish. I'm not a rosemary fan, but the bread had hints of rosemary and was crunchy. They smother a good amount of pesto on the bread and layer the sandwich with mozzarella, basil, tomato and luscious and light prosciutto. It was the closest taste I could have to pan con tomate and jamon iberico in Spain, so I was a happy camper. The sandwich was heated up so the mozzarella was melty which I loved.   Lemon Meringue Tart: It was recommended by the worker. I asked her which one I should choose between the key lime tart or the lemon meringue. I would say the circumference of the tart is about 4 inches in diameter, so its a small dessert and you won't feel too guilty after eating it, especially after a sandwich! The meringue was soft and firm with toasted waves of heavenly taste. The lemon was sweet, tangy and tart. They also had a surprise of raspberries inside the lemon tart. The crust was light and airy. A very refreshing dessert. Think the dessert was about $6-8 as well.  To Go Dessert: Get the Brioche with nutella. It's a hit with customers and compliments a cup of coffee very well. The nutella is nice and gooey inside the middle of the brioche. The brioche is made to look like a bread cupcake with the middle ozzing nutella. It's a favorite!   Eating at the patisserie can be a challenge because there is always a line. I recommend that you really look at the choices before you get into line. Your mind goes back and forth as you wait in line passing the sandwiches and desserts. They also had generous portions of salads and other assortments of sandwiches and quiches. When you have made up your mind, then get into line. Anywhere from a 10 min to 20 min wait. Sometimes it is so busy that you might not find a seat at the patisserie. There are many barstools and tabletops, but if it gets too busy and there is no place to eat, you can walk around Aria and find a place to enjoy your goodies. I do prefer eating at the patisserie. Wash down a pastry with their delicious coffee. Again, don't be pissed or upset if you drop 20-$30 for yourself here. Places like this are hard to come by, so KNOW before you go."}
{"text":"Finally... my first review on Yelp! Date visited: 2008-07-07  I have never ventured past Bellagio's beautiful gardens, but I was broke and bored so I did some exploring.  What do I see? A HUGE chocolate fountain! Okay, you've got my attention. Pastries, ice cream and fancy cakes galore! I had just eaten more than I should at the Bellagio Buffet, so I just grabbed some chocolate covered pretzels for the plane ride back home and a post card of the chocolate fountain (to show off to my friends).  Next time, before I go the buffet, I will definitely try either a crepe or a pastry... and of course more chocolate.  A few side notes: I like the bag they put your goodies in. hehe If you ask for ice water, they give you a real cup with a lid! Not some dinky plastic cup where you barely get a gulp."}
{"text":"I adore this place.  Jean-Phillipe is a feast for the senses. If there is a heaven, I'd imagine it would look a lot like Jean-Phillipe. I enjoyed gawking at all of the beautiful pastries and was entranced by the world's tallest chocolate fountain continuous pumping silky, smooth, chocolate-y goodness.  I ended up getting creme brulee dipped in chocolate topped with tiny truffles and gold shavings. I think I saw Jesus. So amazing. My boyfriend had the gelato and his eyes glazed over.   JP is a religious experience in the midst of the apocalypse that is SIn City."}
{"text":"If you want to eat incredible salad, sandwich and drink coffee, take a break and incredible dessert. You should definitely go, love it!"}
{"text":"We love this place! My husband and I come a few times a year here for date night...we see the floral display in hotel and then come here for dessert. We love the crepes (me especially :), there's seating behind with chairs and tables for nice cozy connection and in area prime for people watching. It's little busy, little noisier due to open air design,  but still enjoyable.  Desserts are sooo tasty."}
{"text":"Everything in the display case looked so good! Too bad we only ordered one thing, Key Lime Pie - $6, and it was heavenly!!! The crust, the key lime part, everything was perfect, not too sweet, and not too limey, just perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to think I shouldn't trust any good reviews written about Vegas businesses because people were most likely too drunk to understand their actual experience.  That being said, I chose this place from all the glowing reviews. Even took an Uber to get there to try these desserts everyone was raving about. Finally get up to the counter..only to find a very small selection of very small desserts. Prices high, desserts small. Welcome to Vegas, right? I could tell by the look of everything that nothing was really going to taste THAT great, but it was nearing the end of the night and we wanted some dessert..so we had to make it happen. I chose the cinnamon roll (so dry) and I don't remember what my husband ordered. Something with chocolate and vanilla cream. He said his was just ok.  So frustrating to get there and be let down by a disappointing selection and unremarkable taste. I enjoy cakes from my local Safeway more than this place."}
{"text":"This place is such a cute little dessert stop, conveniently located at our hotel for our visit. I ordered the strawberry tart, and it was amazingly delicious. Red, ripe strawberries on top of a yummy thin layer of sponge cake/other deliciousness that I don't know the name for. I also ordered the caramel twist coffee, which was a great duo with the cake. The coffee was not too sweet, and you can definitely taste their unique brew, with a rich, delicious aroma at first sip. Will definitely be coming back here, even though Vegas is far and it won't be for a while!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria has such a beautiful presentation of deserts and gift items.. but what I ended up having was the Apple Sensation Crepe.. a long wait but worth it! It was one of my MyVegas facebook game rewards so it was a nice treat.. tasted great.. The service is very professional and efficient.. I tried the Berry Crepe on another visit and it was excellent also.. Only issue is it can get cramped here it is hard to find a seat...  If staying at Vdara, Aria is about a 3 min walk and Jean Phillippe is conveniently located at the Aria entrance closest to Vdara... Looking forward to trying a beautiful desert here next time!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.   So, we are walking around Aria trying to figure out where to eat, and lo and behold, this patisserie is right in front of us with tons of delicious treats.   Many kinds of gelato offered for $4.75 for one scoop. There are also many different kinds of chocolates and truffles for purchase. I adored the banana milk chocolate (chocolate and banana are my favorite flavor combination)... so good. You can buy boxes of chocolates or buy the chocolates a la carte for $2/piece.   There are rows and rows of delicious pastries and desserts, all of which looked beautiful, but we never got a chance to try them, because we got full from our sandwiches and wanted to save room for dinch (the meal in between lunch and dinner) later.   Here's what my husband and I had:  - Chicken tandoori sandwich: Really good with moist chicken and light sauce on ciabatta bread with tomatoes and cucumber slices  - Chicken basil aioli: Delicious moist chicken with a sweet (almost too sweet) basil aioli, provolone, tomatoes, and basil on ciabatta bread.   The wait is kind of long -- you have to wait to pay, and it's painful having to look at all those delicious desserts while waiting. The wait to \"make\" the sandwiches also took a while.   My husband kind of wanted a roast beef sandwich, but he didn't want it cold and asked if they could warm it for him, but they said they could only microwave the sandwich. LAME.   This is a delicious place; I can't wait to come back sometime to eat more food here. Everything from the sandwiches to the chocolates to the gelato is pretty expensive for what it is, so be prepared to fork it over."}
{"text":"It's Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna write about something I love. It's no surprise (rather, it shouldn't be a surprise) that I love good dessert. Anyone can slap together sugar with carbs and call it a day, but Jean Philippe is something else.  I've never had something I was disappointed with at his patisserie. From the gelato (the hazelnut is heavenly) to the flaky pastries (pain au chocolate that rivals some of the best in Paris) and creamy custards (yes, please!) to their coffee, even: everything they serve is undoubtedly delicious.  Sure, it costs a pretty penny, but when is perfection cheap? Never, that's right."}
{"text":"Awsome! The pastries and coffee from this place are a tad pricey but is very good and worth the extra $. I was here every morning :) Try the cinnamon rolls with the white icing, they are extremely nice. If you go for the raspberry doughnuts watch out for the jam (there's a bit too much)!   Only down side is it can be very busy with a long queue."}
{"text":"No matter how good the pastries might be, if they are served with a really bad attitude then they might as well be made out of dog chow.  We were in line for 30 minutes, and not because they had tons of people in line, they were literally that slow.  So when you walk by and they seem super busy or packed, just know it's that they are super slow and not that they serve that many people.  Three people around me in line left before reaching the counter because it was that slow.  It could have something to do with the fact that \"charles\" who claimed to be the manager did nothing but stand around the entire time or it could be that another worker had a wash cloth and wiped the same three feet of counter not less than ten times and did nothing else.  The only person working hard was the poor lady making crepes.  Charles let this happen instead of doing the right thing and offering to help her.  Guess he's too good to do any real work or get his hands dirty.  The people in front of me were planningo on ordering gelato, but the first three flavors they requested were greeted with \"we're out of th0at flavor\" and then \"we are out of anything with nuts\".  This was interesting since Charles, you know the manager thad stood around doing nothing, seemed to be responsible for keeping the gelato bar full since he stood over it making a list of what was needed.  In all the time I waited, he never brought any of them out though.  Finally, I get to the front of the line and I ask Charles if he is a manager.  He answere \"yes\" but kept his head down and wouldn't even look at me.  Guess he's too good to interact with customers too.  When I told him I felt the service was really bad and that I didn't appreciate that someone that handled money without washing their hands was now handling the overpriced pasteries I ordered, he didn't even respond.  I kid you not.  He was three feet in front of me and he literally pretended not to hear or see me even though he actually replied to my first question (without looking at me).  He should have just said \"f*ck you\" to me so at least I didn't hold my breath waiting for a  response.  I wish I had an opinion about the food, but the experience was so horrible and dealing with Charles was so insulting that I didn't even eat what I ordered.  I gave it to my kids (of course after I made them give me fresh ones because of the ones they first tried to give me with nasty dirty hands)."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for charm alone. The cases are full of beautiful little pastries, chocolates, and gelato and everything seems so decadent. I couldn't help but stare at them every time I walked by. It seemed appropriate to stop for a little breakfast before leaving town. The coffee is excellent, but pricey ($5-6 for a latte). If you like brioche, try the dulce de leche or nutella variety. It's such a charming place that you'll want to stay awhile!"}
{"text":"After the comedy show Saturday night, we looked for some place to get a drink, or I accidentally suggested \"sweets\", so ended up coming out to this place to try their cakes!!  Yup, things happen for reasons!!   We had: *Mini Sweets Sampler: So cute!! Mini Pudding, Cake Pops and Raspberry macaron are on the chocolate base. *Opera chocolate cake *Tall coffee (who drinks coffee that late at night? Meeeee..)  We got us a nice comfy table and chairs in the hallway next to the window looking down in the pool below..  If you see way too long line up front, try the cashier on the side by the chairs. That one had no line whatsoever.  I can see myself keep coming back here.."}
{"text":"I was thirsty and wanted something cold and non alcoholic.  I had an excellent but sort of pricey iced mocha.  I am glad I am not easily tempted by some of the other treats I saw as I could easily have ordered a whole bag of stuff."}
{"text":"vegetarian quiche was great. It's Vegas! I wanted to indulge a little more in their muffins, crepes, etc."}
{"text":"This is the place for me. I like french food, has been to France so many times and this place satisfy my pastry cravings.  I would skip any meal to come and eat here.  Wao."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is in a somewhat odd location within Aria....  right at the edge of the casino floor.  With the \"bad\" out of the way, here are my thoughts:  The service was polite, friendly, and knowledgable.  You have GOT to try the white chocolate mocha....  Y-U-M!  The gelato can be summed up in one word:  Orgasmic!"}
{"text":"Since we were staying at the Bellagio, we had the opportunity to try a number of pastries from here (and coffee).  They were all of high quality.  The coffee was excellent.  We tried the almond croissant, the dulce de lece brioche, a cinnamon roll and a cherry tart.  By far the best of these was the brioche.  An amazing combination!  The pastries are very rich and flaky.    In general, an excellent choice for breakfast or dessert."}
{"text":"interesting chocolate fountain, though it's not as big as I expected it to be, guess my friends hyped my expectations of this place. In general, I like the decor here.   desserts are nice but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Nice crepes. We ordered the souffle berry mix.  Not too sweet,  but just right.  Cream and berries were very fresh.  Good sharing portion if your not too hungry.  People love to stand and take pics next to the amazing chocolate fountains."}
{"text":"Attracts a lot of attention with their larger than life flowing chocolate fountain and their even larger crowd that gwaks at the delicious crepe making station and gelato bar.   Their gelato are creamy and delicious and does not melt as fast as other gelato I've tried. Their Banana Nut flavor is delicious -- it even had some caramelized toffee pieces in it!! We also tried their delicious cappuccino flavor which had yummy espresso beans in it.   Their pastries were literally too pretty to eat.   Lines are long and service is slow and the shop is minuscule compared to the gigantic \"I am part of the Willy Wonka\" branch over at Aria."}
{"text":"I felt like I walked on to the set of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Serves pretty much the same thing as the smaller version of Jean Phillipe Patisserie over at Bellagio.   A lot fancier layout with candy and chocolate adornments in ever corner of the store. Lots of space. Not as crowded (at least for now)."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing pastries and chicken sandwiches you'll ever eat!!!! Located inside the aria casino as well as the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.  Check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.   I really wanted to love this place. Maybe I went in expecting too much? Maybe the local shops in San Francisco have spoiled me? Maybe the notoriety of their \"amazing\" chocolate fountain has become more significant than the actual product?  Regardless, Jean Philippe failed to make a fan out of me and my sweet tooth.  Delectables: (1) Blueberry muffin - bland; not moist at all; I've had better ones from Costco and \"day-olds\" from almost anywhere.  Girl behind the counter recommended this over the blueberry danish (what would that have tasted like? rock?); (2) Triple chocolate cheesecake - sounds delicious; tastes average.  Dark, milk and white chocolate cheesecake with an Oreo cookie crust and topped with a truffle? Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? It was; (3) Veggie crepe - why did this taste like garden vegetable soup smeared in a crepe? I couldn't even tell what veggies were actually in there. I am so confused.  Side salad was A-OK though; (4) I did like the almond croissant. However, the ones at La Boulangerie are better, and half the cost!  Coffee: SKIP IT! Paying almost $8 for a double iced latte is an abomination. There is a Starbucks at the Monte Carlo that will make you better (and predictable) coffee for much less.  If you must though, order two shots of espresso over ice (under $5) and add milk yourself.  Whole, skim and half and half are conveniently located just 2 steps to the side of the main pastry counter.  FYI separate (faster) line in the morning for drip coffee only orders.   Customer Service: Fast and furious, but generally good. One note though: Kevin, please lighten up. It's not all so bad!  Heavy sighing and eye-rolling when people whip out a credit card - requiring you to do an additional step - is not a great way to earn customer satisfaction points. I witnessed this on two separate days.  You work in a chocolate/dessert shop after all! Try a couple of truffles when the blood sugar gets too low :-)  Ambiance: Chaotic (unless you get there at 8 am)."}
{"text":"Best French desserts in the town!!! The Creme Brulee was out of the world ! Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"I noticed they had one in the Bellagio hotel and the one in aria hotel. There was a line but the workers looked like they took their last breath before death. They were not too friendly and the crepes were overpriced (as to be expected in Vegas.) For their crepes they place everything on top of the dough and not inside, which I thought was weird."}
{"text":"One of my favorite store I always get croissant from this place and the selection is amazing and the chocolate cake is delicious"}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not. No No No Guys. At both 3PM and 9PM the service we received was terrible. Ohh those faces, not nice ladies. Someone in front of us asked the price of one of their items, for not all of them are listed on the board, and that seemed to bother one of the ladies.  On top of that their products, in general, are both overvalued and overrated.  I had a \"pecan sticky bun\" and a day or two before my purchase that bun had left its stickiness somewhere else. I promise. It tasted more like a dry/not-fresh croissant with some cinnamon and nuts on top than anything else. And a few of the nut's pieces were stale/burned, one of the two. I know they tasted 'funny'. Take your sweet tooth somewhere else; there are plenty of great places around.  Pass by only for the decorations: they are pleasant to look at. I almost forgot: their gelato is actually good."}
{"text":"Beautifully crafted desserts.  I liked the Oreo gelato.  The flan and creme brûlée were good but not the best I've had. The crepes looked awesome, will have to try them next time.  The crepes are between 8-11$ and gelato single scoop 4$ and creme brûlée 7$, affordable considering its in the Bellagio."}
{"text":"The best chocolate and pasteries everrrr! We took a couple pasteries back to the room to eat while we were watching the bellagio fountain out on our balcony. And let me just say that it was to die for! We had the cheesecake, fruit tarts, and a couple chocolate covered strawberries. We had to go back and stock up on chocolates to take back home haha! Unfortunately my family devoured all the chocolates, including mine once I got back home! Sigh until next time I guess! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a banana nut muffin, received a blueberry muffin. When I spoke with the manager, she rudely asked me if I wanted blue berry or banana, when clearly I'm returning to exchange the blue berry muffin.   Food was decent, just poor attitude/service when confronted about the issue of an error on their part.  Probably would not come back to this specific location."}
{"text":"I swear, every time I'm at Aria; that's my excuse to eat here! They have new sandwiches and salads; and now have paninis =)  I say the best bang for your buck is to go with the trio of sandwiches -- ham, veg, and tuna -- for $10.50. And other sandwiches are around that price and you only get one. Might as well, get to samps a lil bit more than one for the price you pay.  The veg sandwich was my fave...they had brie as the cheese :)"}
{"text":"At Jean Philippe's in the Bellagio, they have 4 different types of extremely huge gourmet ripened strawberries - one covered in hazelnut chunks, one in toffee, one in coconut shavings, and one half of milk and half of white chocolate (the first three are also covered in chocolate).  I've tried the milk chocolate as well as the toffee ones - my absolute favorite were the toffee strawberries.  They're all refrigerated, so it's quite cold, and the berry itself is extremely ripened with a little bit of tang but awesomely sweet.  The toffee covering was absolutely divine. These deliciousness comes in a 'reusable' plastic cup to catch all your droppings so you can eat the crumbs at the end.  YUM!  I even met the big man himself, and he's extremely nice, humble, and quite funny!  +toffee strawberries :D +look for Chef Jean Philippe :D +located inside the Bellagio"}
{"text":"love their croissant! currently they have 2 locations in LV: Bellagio and Aria. The chef also has another dessert  shop iDessert in San Diego. Hopefully they open one in Northern California!"}
{"text":"As if the gigantic chocolate flowers in the glass case weren't enough to entice me to pay a visit, the display cases kind of make me turn into a heifer. I have only sampled a few of the truffles but all were delicious. I mean, anything with waffle cone pieces in it will win me over (I don't remember the name of this tasty truffle). The praline truffle was also fantastic.   I wish I had less self restraint. Next time I'll let you win, Jean Philippe! $2 at a time!"}
{"text":"For many, many years, I have been in love with the Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio.  When I lived in Vegas, I visited many times to get crepes or other treats.  I often said that I would order a cake from them when it came time to get married... even if the wedding cake cost thousands of dollars (which they kinda do, btw).  Well, in January, my fiance proposed (in Vegas) and though I no longer live there and cannot get my wedding cake from them, we got a mini cake to celebrate with.  It was BEAUTIFUL!  Flawlessly gorgeous.    If you're going to order a custom mini, order a day or 2 in advance.  You'll be picking design, flavor, filling, etc.  It's worth the $90.  Though the icing is a bit thick on the mini, it's still delicious.   Long live Jean Philippe!  So sad I live in the Bay and cannot get them to ship my wedding cake.  (cry)  The mini  made my engagement weekend even more special though!!!  See ya there!"}
{"text":"my new love at aria!  came here on my last day in vegas, and had breakfast. i had a chicken pesto panini it was so delicious and with orange juice it makes everything better. the bread is toasted to perfection, the chicken is nicely cooked and has melted cheese on it. the pesto is nicely flavored. it can be a bit pricey, my total was about $13.  the raspberry gelato was also really creamy, smooth and delicous. their desserts look so yummy too. i cannot wait to come back here for my dessert and breakfast fix!  everything is picture worthy, they have model cakes and desserts. and tons of chocolates to choose from. im not sure the exact prices for everything but pricey and worth it!"}
{"text":"Even if you have no intention of eating anything here, it is absolutely worth a visit just to see the chocolate fountain!  There was nothing here that I can eat. My husband loved his decadent little pastry, declaring it out of this world.  The entire hotel is a \"must\" and since you're here anyway, stop into this chocolate shop to see the amazing chocolate creations! Get your camera ready!  If you are visiting Las Vegas with children, you can be sure they will love it here!"}
{"text":"I get an almond croissant $4.25 from here every morning I stay at the Bellagio. They are huge and delicious with extra thick glazed almond slices on top.  Crisp on the outside. Soft on the inside. They're much larger than a Starbucks almond croissant so you're not really getting super overcharged either."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  We came here today to get macaroons to take home for family. They had NO boxes to take them. They could only put them in plastic bags. These are French macaroons so very delicate. We can't be the only people who want to take these home for family and friends. And the man working the counter couldn't have cared less. Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly fruit tart! This place is just like sweet tooth foodie's dream come true when you're staying in a resort. I was in aw when staring st all the tasty sweets, the ceiling, and everything around this little place. many beautifully decorated desserts and sweets!  Ofcourse I bought a fruit tart and gobbled it down while playing roulette! It was absolutely delicious! The custard and crust were not overpoweringly sweet and the fruits were delicious. I had one strawberry that wasn't up to par with my freshness standards, but it was late at night so that's to be expected from a fruit tart around midnight.  The ones in Paris are much better, but when you don't want to walk that far, this place offers pretty tasty options. The only reason I rate this place four stars is because of the prices, but I guess that's to be expected from the strip."}
{"text":"what is jean philippe pastisserie. a name that i can not even pronounce. all you gotta know is this place is legit! so imma call you JPP!   gee... this is another store that is like everywhere in vegas now. i kept walking by saying umm.. each time i walked by jean it looked packed. they were opened late. they had a freaking chocolate fountain thing. i told myself i had to go. so i did. wouldn't you?   they had cupcakes, danishes, muffins, gelato, crepes, smoothies, coffee, cakes, sandwiches, and oh so many more things i couldn't peek at it all.   the con to this place is its so packed i feel guilty to ask for a sample of the gelato and just went with my default flavor: coconut. 2nd con is the price. i saw some girl drinking a tropical smoothie so i just had to. $9.00 bucks my friends. nine whole bucks for a smoothie. that's like minimum wage right there! i could really taste real fruit in my smoothie. in my coconut gelato i tasted and saw coconut flakes. now that's what i call authentic.   my boyfriend got the ice coffee with soy milk. that thing was yummy as well for a non coffee drinker as myself. the total was like $18.00+. so it placed a dent in the pocket area but a satisfied stomach.  did i mention their napkins are like the expensive thick kind? they have all sorts of cakes on display that rotates! they were pretty decked out! They have seats in the store and some outside in the walkway. so sit and chit chat or take it to go and walk off the calories so you can eat some more somewhere else!"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY- this place is incredible! If you are a Sweet person, this is your HEAVEN! From crepes, to tarts to chocolate bombs to cookies and coffee- every piece of dessert is impeccable looking and tastes even BETTER than it looks.   Staff is very friendly and will definitely help assist you with what to get depending on what you are looking for!  You can't go wrong with whatever you choose."}
{"text":"While not as good as Bellagio Gelato or the Illi place over in Paulazzo, this place in Aria deserves some accolades as a solid place in the City Center area for some late night dessert cravings. I am here only to tell you guys about one item..the Lychee and Rose Sorbet.   The taste is nothing I've had before, and believe me, I've had some weird and wacky flavors before. The tartness of the lychee marries perfectly the flower-y, sweetness of Rose, and it all just makes sense when you put that goodness in your mouth. Much like Mel Gibson and Danny glover in the Lethal Weapon movies, this is one partnership that should last forever."}
{"text":"WAYYYY OVERPRICED!!!! 100% OVERPRICED!!! Try it once but don't waste your money there!!! As a person that was born and raised in france, I must say this is the real deal. Pure authentic french patries. Brings me back memories eating this stuff. But you know what? I'll give it 1 star. I'm probably going to be the only one doing this and get criticized by 99.99% of the people rating it, but I DARE to do it because Monsieur Jean Phillipe gave his heart to the devil and its money.  Charging over $5 for croissants and pain au chocolat (choclate croissant) is an insult to all the french bakers in france. People must know that these items are not supposed to be anywhere near $3.00.  I paid $30 for 3 pain au chocolat and a panini. To my knowledge the right pricing should've been close to $15 at most....not $30. And by the way, although his pastries are good, they are not the best I have ever had, not worth $30 at all. These pastries are overpriced by 100% of what they should be, and I don't care if people say \"Yeah...but you know...everything is expensive in vegas and he's a master pastry chef...blah blah blah...\" A pastry chef with real dignity should know the difference between ripping people off and adjusting a right pricing. I know my pastries and I've eaten these everyday for over 18 years.......and this is an insult, an insult to the customers who have no clue about its real price and the french bakers in france, trust me. If you must try it, try it once just for the experience. Just know however that you are getting ripped off very very badly.  If you want to eat more than 4 french pastries that are just as good then go to Le Village buffet at the paris hotel in vegas, at least there you'll get unlimited pastries for the same $30 I paid for just 4 items."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Aria and this was convenient for breakfast.  The pastries are worth the money but they should invest into better coffee.  Here's my list of breakfast pastries and I've listed the better tasting ones first.  1)  breakfast panini 2)  sugar brioche 3)  chocolate croissant 4)  Cinnamon roll"}
{"text":"Holy crepes!! We had the chicken savory crepe, and a Nutella filled dessert crepe. The crepes themselves are so tender, they melt in your mouth! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cafe Au Lait seriously disappointing. Very weak, burnt taste. Chocolate croissant pretty good. Seating area to the side if you get lucky."}
{"text":"They had the BEST CROISSANT I tasted in Vegas, hands down.  Super flakey, buttery and soft on the inside, brushed over with a fruit jam that gave it a hint of sweetness.  I could have eaten 10 of these!!!    We also got their Madeleine was pretty dry, their pain de raisins was a bit too dry and not as fresh for my liking, and their macaroons which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Our stay at the ARIA was wonderful, we are coming to vegas 4 times a year always stay at ARIA, we love Jean Philippe we had bad customer service before but this time THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE at Jean Philippe Patisserie. We eat almost every day there....The crepes and pastries are great BUT depend who make the crepe is the quality and presentation, all the time we were there the ladies who make the crepes are so rude...they looks like they doesn't like there job.  We asked for crepes for to go they just give me the crapes whit out any top cover and bag also they charge for water OMG incredible.   Jean Philippe is a great please love the decoration but the service is just  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!  If a manager is reading this review..... You MUST talk to your employees. They are the face of your business and must put on a pleasant face at all times."}
{"text":"The cranberry croissant was great for breakfast.  Menu was a little pricey but there was an okay selection for a quick grab/go breakfast."}
{"text":"Such an adorable looking place at ARIA :) Came here for breakfast so I didn't have a chance to try out the pretty desserts - they're nicely displayed near the cashier. The line up was quite long for mornings.  I ordered the turkey croissant and mocha which were so delish!! Loved everything they put it in the turkey croissant. The drinks were also not too sweet and very smooth. Great choice for a quick coffee break too!"}
{"text":"The pre-made salads here are delicious, as are the baked goods, and freshly made crepes. Obviously over priced, but it's inside of a hotel in Las Vegas so that is expected. The service is also great.  In the evening, all the baked goods sell out but the freshly baked crepes are a great late night dessert to get.   Good source of last minute gifts; there is a huge variety of mugs/chocolate boxes/gift boxes for purchase."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars after the 2nd time there because their service is good.   The place is always busy and people tend to cut off the line. The crepes were overcooked as opposed to soft. I think I don't need to go back there for snack anymore. The strawberry smoothies were the worst! It's just like strawberries blended with milk. No taste but bland milk! They should have changed the word \"smoothies\" to something else. Not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, the coffee isn't great here, although it's not really what this place is known for anyways. The \"perfect roast\" coffee, cappuccino, and American are not worth getting here.   The pastries, gelato, and crepes are another story. I've visited a few times, and tried something different each time. So far, I haven't had something I wouldn't want again. A few particular items I especially liked include the salmon savory crepe... And we'll, I tried thinking of a particular pastry I've had that was exceptional, but they're all delicious. The almond croissant, cheese Danish, Apple brioche, and spinach quiche. I'm getting hungry thinking about it already.  If there's anything that really annoyed me, it's the fact that no one cleans the tables. Each time I've sat down to eat, crumbs are everywhere, and occasionally spots of stickiness, and other leftovers. Also, I can understand waiting in line, but it's always just so slow. Be sure to bring patience while salivating at the displays of food and chocolates."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some elegant pastries or desserts, look no further than Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio Hotel. We had the Raspberry Napoleon, it was the right balance of light and creamy, and wasn't overly sweet. We also purchased some nougat that was also airy and chewy good."}
{"text":"Worst crepes I have ever eaten.  Customer service was awful.  It was disorganized to order. Limited selection of options. I watched as the Assistant Manager burned one crepe and completely shredded another and then still put them on a plate and served them to me. It was ridiculous. The caramelized apples weren't fresh and tasted like they came out of a can.  You can skip it."}
{"text":"Had a strawberry and Nutella crepe at this location and it was good. It was very rich and decadent.  I really wish they would put the whipped cream in the crepe.  Otherwise, a lot of wonderful desserts."}
{"text":"Feeling Parisienne or want to? Try this place out. Although I am a sucker for my Starbucks drink in the morning, their food offerings are less than enticing to me.   I do however, have a thing for fine French pastries which are hard to come by in the southwest! I was jumping for joy when I found this place, their croissants and fruit danishes are to die for. I do admit I had almost a pastry for each breakfast I was in town - they were that good and worth the walk (my math was that if I walked to go get it, I would burn off the pastry at the same time).   In addition to pastries and coffee, they also have a few sandwiches and some confectioneries. I didn't bother with the chocolate because I knew it wouldn't make it home - either I would eat it, or it would melt. I did grab some of their nut filled nougat which was out of this world.   Be prepared for the elevated prices, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The crepes and gelato are amazing! A bit pricey, that's for sure, but well worth it. Sometimes a sweet treat is necessary, and this place knows how to satisfy your sweet cravings."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to resist this place conveniently located in the Bellagio near the conservatory. Although it might seem expensive to pay $17 for two items, it never bothers me because I'm always satisfied. Beautiful to look at and equally beautiful to partake. They also have crepes, gelato, pastries, sandwiches and salads if you want  something more. There are small tables near windows overlooking the pool to sit and enjoy or take your treats to go."}
{"text":"Hotel/restaurant cafes are usually nothing more than \"MEH\"....but Jean Phillippe, damn y'all. Everything about this place is quite impressive.  Yes, it's pricey and the lines are usually long, but what can you expect for a cafe that's next to elevators in a hotel that has more than 4,000 rooms?   No lies - their iced coffee is THE BEST I've ever had. Expensive, but worth it. You won't want any other iced coffee after this.  Otherwise, their espresso beverages and brewed coffee are tops.  Their pastries are ridiculously rich, but perfect.  Their sandwiches and quiche are so well done and oh so yummy!  We stayed at Aria and probably ate here 5 times.  \"Ate here\" meaning we sent someone down for morning coffee (none in room at Aria) and had a late night snack (closes at midnight)."}
{"text":"Helloooooooo Chocolate fountain! I am sure everyone wishes they could eat all that yummy chocloate flowing down from the ceiling of this place but they are lucky to find even more delicious items inside.   You can almost smell the crepes being made down the hall and even if you werent in the mood for a nutella crepe, now all of a sudden your life depends on it! You MUST have one. They are delicious. We had some of their sandwhiches for lunch which were expensive but delicious.  I for one was not a fan of the two dessert items we sampled, as I thought they were both a bit boring and tasteless.   All in all, this place is fun to visit when you want something sweet, a good place for a fast lunch but be prepared to pay the price ( Its Vegas, but still)."}
{"text":"A night of partying needs proper hangover food.  Food like greasy fries and pancakes and fried chicken to fill you back up and feeling re-energized. Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely not that place.  The food here is delectable and more deserving of a stomach that has not been recently ravished by rum or red bull vodkas. This place has huge selections of desserts, well made treats, crepes, coffee, paninis and more.   I stayed at Aria during my last trip to Vegas and Jean Philippe Patisserie was right off the room elevators.  This makes it tempting to grab a quick treat right before heading to your room.  The sandwiches are good but very heavy/buttery as typical French food is.  I had the Tandoori panini with a side salad.  Although it tasted excellent, I was feeling really heavy/full afterwards. The coffee is soso.. there's a Starbucks (or two) in Monte Carlo - better coffee is served there.  However the desserts are incredible.  I did not order any dessert myself but I did have a bite of a friend's chocolate tart-looking thing.  Looking back I wished I had ordered something for myself as well.  The prices are high but that's typical for anything inside a large Vegas casino."}
{"text":"It is a gorgeous place in Bellagio, because of this, doesn't matter whether the food is \"good\" or \"very good\"...... Asian salad did surprise me, the shrimps were so fresh and the sauce was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Too pricey for the level of the service they provide. The crepes are OK but are not worth waiting \"an hour\" for. we ordered 2 crepes and were told they would be ready in AN HOUR. We returned in 20 mins to check on our order and they had already boxed our crepes and they had become soggy and watery from being placed inside a to-go box while very hot. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Some of the best gelato I've ever had!  This place is jammed packed full of sweets, most of which I've never even heard of.  Which was awesome!  The only thing bad about this place is they close so early.  I can't tell you how much more our group would have spent if they were open until 3AM.  Probably better for our waistlines that they weren't though!  We also had a quick dinner here as well one night and the sandwiches were good.  All were about $10 a piece and huge.  We didn't finish our food.  Stuffed!"}
{"text":"Long lines for being so early in the morning!!!  Worth the wait, the almond croissant was incredibly flaky with buttery goodness and the Nutella brioche was excellent as well.  It was so difficult to not get it all over yourself.  The coffee was good and I typically don't like just black coffee with cream and sugar.     My only gripe about this place is that it's too small, very inefficient flow...if you wanted cream and sugar or napkins, it's on a counter in the reverse direction of the ordering and paying line.  When you are trying to leave, people are trying to get to the counter with minimal space to move.    I must come back next time I make a trip to Vegas and visit Jean Philippe Patisserie to try the other selections.  Hopefully, I don't break the bank...a little spendy for pastries."}
{"text":"I love this place  Like Way too much.  Back when I was young and not 21, my parents discovered this sugary place in Bellagio. And me being my young self, as a rugrat, I loved sugar.  Well now that I'm over that hump, I still love sugar and ice cream. And during our trip to Vegas, I HAD to go to Jean Philippe Patisserie. Just HAD to! And my cousin said okayyyy and so we went to JPP.  They serve breakfast and you only have 1 line in the mornings til around 11:10AM. At that time, they separate into 2 lines. So if you're like me and want ice cream, you can get a second line at that time rather than wait in the whole long line.  Chocolate- Love it. Rich, very rich. Sweet. Amazing. Tasty. In love. It's like on a whole nother dimension. I wish they had it here in Socal.:DDD I always get this and I wish I could just eat this every dayyyy.  Mint Choco Chip- Hehe the mint is in chip form and it just brightens and freshens you up. It wakes you up.   They also have chocolate bars and other Halloween candies. They have waffle-ish stuff as well here, so you CAN eat this for breakfast. But at the end of the day, I still love their gelato/ice cream."}
{"text":"I don't know, I think I'm giving this 5 stars more because I love JPP. I love the Bellagio location, and when Aria opened, I fell in love with this location too. Haha.  Located..hmm. It's by the casinos and bright. So you'll see it if you walk around Aria haha. :P Just follow the signs :D Jean Philippe Patisserie is here- just a couple casinos away from the Bellagio one! There are two different sections, the first being crepes, coffee, and gelato. The second one is desserts. If you go in the left area, you get to stare at the gelato. Since we had gone to the Bellagio one for gelato just the day before, I decided to not give it too much thought.  I had two rewards to use from myVegas. One was for a free crepe (yay!) and another was for a free pastry.    Crepe side. They have savory and they have dessert crepes. We decided to get the savory crepe ($11.95). They make the crepe out of buckwheat flour (hence why it's brown).   The savory crepes: Forest- Swiss cheese, black forest ham, wild mushrooms fricassee, scrampled egg  Salmon (The one i chose!)- Swiss cheese, pico de gallo, asparagus, fresh spinach, caper/dill sauce topped w/ smoked salmon  Chicken- swiss cheese, grilled chicken breast, fresh spniach, piquillo peppers, chipotle sauce  Italian- Sauteed Zucchini, over roasted tomatoes, fresh arugula, ricotta cheese spread, topped w/ proscuitto and basil psto  Veggie- Swiss cheese, feta cheese, veggie saute, chipotle sauce, fresh spinach  Their salmon was GOOD. The caper/dill sauce reminded me of a strong tartar sauce but damn this was legit. It was heavy but brought upon something light to the dish. Yeah. That's an explanation I would give. Everything else (the crepe, the asparagus, spinach) that was all in there mixed excellently with the caper/dill sauce. I think that sauce definitely makes the dish. The salmon on top? Mhm mhm mhm. The smoked salmon was definitely saltier than I would have liked, but I think that's what smoked salmon tastes like :P It was raw, not cooked, but I like raw hehe. Mix it with the sauce or try to put it in the crepe but it'll become lost. They give a decent amount, but at the end of the day $11.95 is expensive. But it's good :D I wish I took a photo of it haha.  Pastry side: Just look, see what you like and eat it :P It most likely is good.  Almond croissant: $4.5- Had a flaky and subtle almond taste. It was strong enough to announce that it was there, but not strong that it overwhelmed the croissant (ie, you knew that it existed).  I forget what the last thing I ordered was! Oh no I must be getting old sigh. :/  If you have the Aria keycard and enabled charging, you can charge it to your room so that you'll be able to pay for it when you check out.  Also, this does NOT have the world record chocolate fountain. That is Bellagio.  I love it I love it I love it :)"}
{"text":"We had the Napoleon, Opera and chocolate covered strawberries.  The Napoleon was great, but the Opera was terrible and the strawberries were really tart.    I wouldn't recommend Jean Philippe Patisserie because it's just an eye candy bakery.  It's bright.  It's flashy.  It's pretty.  It gets the attention of sugar addicts, but I'm pretty sure you can get better fine pastries at a better price elsewhere.  Would I go back?  Yes.  But only for the Napoleon."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe, i cant find the words to tell you how much i adore you. Your passion and hard work has helped you stand above the rest and one can see those qualities through ur established locations.   An award wining pastry chef dubbed as the best in the WORLD. No wonder you have the fans that you do. Fyi- I once drove 4 hours to Vegas just to eat at the Aria location and drove right back. (Yah, it was worth it.. and still is)   Your savory crepes and mouth watering pastries are one of a kind. I cant even describe the attention to detail thats applied to each piece and the taste in the quality of ingredients.  x reasonably priced/sometimes overpriced x service was slow today  x crepes/ice cream/shakes/coffee/pastries & etc  x Aria + Bellagio (2 locations) x lots of gift options  x limited seating x super long lines sometimes x open from 6am- midnight  I have been coming to JP for over 4 years now.. so take my word for it!  Go give it a try :)"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts! So many yummy looking cakes, so little money hahahha  I got their Dark Chocolate Mousse with chocolate cream and chocolate glaze. Cost me $7. Not cheap, but hella good and hella worth it! Love the chocolate combination...it was rich and thick just the way I like it! My friend ordered one of the savory crepes. It was OK- I'm more of a sweets person."}
{"text":"This location isn't the one at Bellagio, so I'm not sure why Yelpers keep posting photo from there onto this page. This location doesn't have the chocolate fountain! This one is much larger and spread wider, with seats for you to enjoy your sweets.  The gelato is very good. I got the Oreo flavor and tried the vanilla. The crepes smelled bomb but since the service was so bad, I didn't order one. I asked the lady helping us which crepe was the most popular one. She straight up said she didn't know. I was taken aback by her abruptly rude answer, and she corrected herself, trying to explain that everyone had different taste and that she hasn't tried all of them on the menu. Okay, but don't you work there? Don't you notice which ones are more popular and the bestselling? Can't you ask a co-worker for their opinion? So dumb.  I later went to the other side and got the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, but didn't taste anything like your typical tiramisu. It didn't consist of any ladyfingers and the coffee flavor overpowered the rest, although still remaining a very light dessert. The service at this counter was also abysmal.  Not sure I'd come back, unless it's for some bomb gelato. Maybe next time I'll be tempted to order a crepe."}
{"text":"Creme de la Creme !!!  Orgasmic culinary experience as far as desert !! If you like French pastries this is THE place to come in Vegas. Inside Aria hotel this small cafe is located right in the casino and is not to be missed ! The most amazing patisserie with huge selection of heavenly desert that melts in your mouth and makes you smile like a kid in a candy shop wishing you can try each and every one of them. We had Sweet Trio and I could have easily eaten 3 more! They also make crepes which we want to come back and try since they looked soooo good, salads, sandwiches, muffins, cookies, gelato, truffles and of course croissants. Go go go and indulge ! It's Vegas after all!"}
{"text":"Please make a note. This review is for Jean Philippe patisserie in Aria not Belagio. Sorry my bad....   OMG! Orgasmic culinary experience as far as desert !!

{"text":"Very good chocolate dessert :)    chocolate fountain, and their cakes are soooo pretty!  just a little spendy, long line, and there flan wasn't good very dense..."}
{"text":"Tastes like disappointment.   I've given this place a try a couple of times for their desserts and gelato.   Pastries were ok. Flan was ugly (yes, appearance does factor in!!) and had a weird texture. The opera and Nutella cake were too sweet.   The gelato, however, was a tragedy. Texture was very hard. I had Oreo which was not mixed well enough, divided nearly in perfect half with one side being vanilla and the other Oreo mixture. Creme brûlée and rocky road were better, though still not nearly creamy enough to be considered a good gelato.   Perhaps I should stick to eating French/Italian desserts only in Europe.  Unfortunately for Vegas this is the only decent French sweets shop around."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop off for a quick, light breakfast or an afternoon snack. They have a wide assortment of different pastries and desserts to choose from, and they do an amazing job on their presentation.   Since this place seems to be best known for its chocolate (after all, it has the world's largest chocolate fountain), we decided to go for the chocolate crepe which comes with chocolate fudge, brownie bites, and whipped cream. The chocolate was amazing...probably some of the best tasting chocolate I can remember eating. Luckily they give you a generous portion of whipped cream to go along with it, so the richness of the chocolate doesn't overpower the taste of the crepe. The crepes were very light and thin, you can even watch them make them right in front of you too which was nice. Unfortunately the lady making them was a bit rude when we asked of the brownie bites had any nuts in them, but the crepe was good enough to overlook her attitude.   Next time I come here i'd like to try the smoked salmon sandwich or one of their creme brulee desserts (there's multiple kinds). Maybe this place is a bit expensive, but it's Vegas."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS.  This place sells coffee, cold and hot sandwiches, salads, and various gorgeous pastries that rival Laduree in presentation and taste.  I had a croque monsieur which was really delicious, albeit a bit small.  My friends and I split a cobb salad, which was good (your basic cobb).    The real standouts here are the pastries, which look freaking amazing (I uploaded some pics).  I ate the \"Intense,\" which is a chocolate mousse covered in a dark chocolate ganache and topped with a little macaron.  The chocolate taste was very rich and dense, the mousse light and fluffy, and the macaron perfectly chewy.  I want to eat here again."}
{"text":"I wish there was less than star to give. I don't even know how they manage their restaurant. While serving and making eggs, it was just gross and disgusting how they prepared it. First of all, mixing meat and touching bacon, and then on the same pan/crepe machine, they try to make a veggie order!!?? What are we? Barbarians? The person before me ordered eggs, bacon, and whatever else. They were all being done on the same crepe pan (seriously? No separate pans for veggie orders? Some people are vegetarian while some don't want meat oil to touch their food). Anyways, the worker kept touching the bacon stripes while wearing gloves back and forth. When she finished, she placed them on a plate. She served and for the customer ahead of me, she grabbed fruits to make him a smoothie directly without changing the gloves!!! What is this? Bacon smoothie? Then she asked me for my order, I asked if she makes veggie orders on separate pans? She said no. Well, she didn't even wash her hands. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"I just want to rave about those jelly chocolates they have in the display. I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the blueberry. Don't get me wrong, they're all pretty good. My boyfriend doesn't even like chocolate, but he thinks they're the bee's knees! The jelly is encased in this delicate chocolate shell. You pop one of these babies in your mouth, and with the first bite, the shell just completely breaks open to reveal this burst of fruit flavor. The chocolate is perfect. It doesn't overpower the flavor of the jelly, and it's just bitter enough to complement the jelly's sweetness. The jelly is tangy and sweet. For some of the more powerful flavors, one might feel overwhelmed by it, but the experience is over pretty quickly because the pieces are small. Besides the blueberry, I distinctly remember enjoying the lemon jelly as well.   Both times I have been here, the service was forgettable. I must have picked the right time to go because there was barely a line (perhaps, two or three people in front of me?). The first time, the woman who took my order had the most sour expression on her face. I almost felt like I was being a bother by ordering something. I actually felt a little guilty for making her walk to the display case to grab the chocolate pieces...The second time, the two employees started conversing, making me wait a few minutes. Finally, when one turned around, he seemed pretty nice. He got my order and rang me up, but he wasn't friendly or anything special. The price is also nothing to rave about at $2 a piece. But hey, it's still something worth trying!"}
{"text":"ask me if i care if this place is overpriced? i don't. it's vegas. expect it. i'm so glad JPP was right next to the guest elevators. it was super conv. for me. and they didn't close til midnight. the dessert selection is endless! see the pics i uploaded. i tried a savory crepe and it was ehhhh. a bit gross. but whatever. i'm such a sweets person, idk why i didn't order a dessert crepe. drunk much? maybe. haha. anyway, i though the latte's i ordered every morning were spectacular. it totally healed me from my hangovers. lol. anyway, i can't wait to come back and stuff my face with more desserts! btw, most of the workers there were really friendly. it's possible they started remembering my face with my 2/3 visits per day. :)"}
{"text":"I came here twice on my past trip to Vegas, it's very convincingly located in the Aria.   First time I got the Green Goddess smoothie, it was really tasty, more citrusy than green (which is what I originally wanted), I'd get it again if I'm craving something sweet, not to replace breakfast (the reason I got it).   The glass is clear so you can see them making the crepes, which is always cool. All of their savory crepes are make with buckwheat batter, which I hadn't had before. I chose the chipotle chicken crepe, has spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and obviously chicken and chipotle sauce. It's was really good!! And huge lol priced good at $12, my friend wasn't feeling the buckwheat batter, which I get, I think the other batter might have tasted better, I really enjoyed it as is.  I didn't see any seating, but I took mine to the pool, so I was happy   On my next trip I wanna try the strawberry Nutella one!"}
{"text":"I always try to make sure I stop by JPP at least once every time I visit the Strip.  Most often just to check out what fine looking desserts they come up with.  And as usual, they don't disappoint (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=HiukNcTgt4mKDS-W6l3ypg).  Sure they're pretty pricey at about $6.90 each, but you have to consider that you're basically buying confectionery art.  As usual it was very difficult to pick just one, but I settled with the last Lemon Tart that I saw.  It was just eye-catching (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=abOZKFyRig8rrD1B3UYSbw).  And yes, it was goooooood!!  Probably not as good as their Cheesecake from my last review, but still delish nonetheless.    It still bugs me about the lack of seating at the Bellagio location, but there are some tables with a view of the pool just a few feet away.  I still prefer this location over it's bigger sibling at Aria which can get really crowded at times.  I shall be back to try their creme brulee!!"}
{"text":"In the last few years I've developed a serious knack for specialty desserts, especially pastries like those from Jean Philippe Patisserie.  This location is much bigger than it's Bellagio counterpart, sans Giant Chocolate Fountain.  But plenty of tables to sit down and enjoy your sweet treat.  My suggestion with their desserts is if you see what you like, GET IT RIGHT AWAY!!!  It's pretty much while supplies last on a daily basis there. Once it's gone, they won't make it again till the next day.  I tried to get their pretty cheesecake after my dinner one day, but they already sold out of it.  So I settled with the Strawberry and Lime Tutti Fruiti.  It was delicioso!!  4 Stars!"}
{"text":"Fabuleuse crêpes chez Jean Phillipe! I had one of the most amazing and healthy crêpes today. Tasting amazing! Friendly staff. Cozy chairs and lovely table views. Great recipe for breakfast. Reasonable prices. Although, I don't see the point for a tip."}
{"text":"One of my unwritten vacation rules is to never eat at the same place twice in the same trip. The fact that during a 3 day visit, I came here twice says a lot.  Anyone who knows me knows that desserts and sweets are my reason for being. I would rather eat dessert than a meal nearly every time.  The pastries here are hand-crafted and beautiful. Typically when food is this eye-catching, it often looks better than it tastes.  I'm happy to report that that wasn't the case here. During my 2 visits, I tried several beautiful as well as delicious items: A raspberry napoleon, a mini chocolate mousse, an eclair, and a mixed berry crêpe.  Everything was divine, and as you can imagine, cost a small fortune.  Their coffee was quite robust and a perfect complement to the pastries.   All of my wonderful treats were enjoyed in the Chihuly glass atrium in the exquisite lobby.  Definitely a highlight of my visit and a must stop if you enjoy desserts as much as I do."}
{"text":"My group of 3 enjoyed eating our tasty chocolate treats here!  Our treats were in the $5-9 range, and water was $5.  The service was good, the line moved quickly.  We sat at a small table inside the shop.  The chocolate fountain was unique."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop off real quick for some dessert. Ended up grabbing some pistachio and coconut gelato. It was delicious! The coconut was especially good, the pistachio I have had better at other places but it was still good.  Make sure to check out the chocolate water fountain cause it's huge! Next time I'm going to grab some chocolate desserts (cupcakes, pies etc.)"}
{"text":"I got the sweet cream crepe with mix berry sensation which was very good.  I would give 5 stars for the foods and 3 stars for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a light snack or if you're craving something cold and sweet. The Patisserie has a bright and clean and modern look to it, and is in stark contrast to its sister outlet at Bellagio.  The tables an counters are shiny and new and have a thick solid wood top.  The gelatos and sorbets are quite tasty and flavorful. There's a broad selection, though I have seen places with a wider assortment than here."}
{"text":"J'aime cette patisserie!! Les crepes & les eclairs de noisette.. Superbe!! Yum! Smoked salmon sandwich is great too. Two locations @ Aria and Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Can you say SWEET!!!   So, I stood in front of the glass display case for a full 15min because I didn't want to have to make a choice, I want them ALL!!! Yes I'm greedy little girl. Everything looked soooo pretty and sooo yummy! The staff was very nice and tried to help me make a decision, and kept laughing at me as I nervously darted my eyes back and forth between each of the different items.   I finally after 15min of deliberating like a hung jury, decided to go with the chocolate cheesecake. It was soooo pretty inside a sheet of chocolate, topped with a sphere truffle. I was sad to mess it up with a fork. It tasted amazing! rich chocolate creamy smoothness. Perfect amount of sweet, soft going down. heavenly!  One of these days I'm going to buy 1 of each and just not leave the house for a week while pigging out on all the sweets."}
{"text":"I love bakeries. Jean Phillipe's is the kind of place that makes a dessert lover want to cry because it's just too beautiful. Everything here is so pretty and cute and tasty looking, but all cost a pretty penny. It's probably best to just stare at the display cases for a long time and just pretend you're eating what's inside, because there's no possible way for you to afford the money or stomach capacity required to inhale everything you might want here. It's kind of tragic really.   On a more serious note though, GET THE CREME BRULEE GELATO. IT TASTES LIKE REAL CREME BRULEE. THERES EVEN BROKEN UP SUGAR PIECES MIXED IN. ITS AMAZING. Okay I think I've said enough."}
{"text":"Do I really need to review this place? I mean, who could not like chocolate, crepes, pastries, savory sandwiches and delicious coffee?  Only reason why it has 4 and not 5 stars is because of their prices! My boyfriend always gets the White Chocolate Mocha which is, roughly, a 10-12 ounces for $7.75.  Geesh! It's pretty good, but Geesh!  They offer gelato, smoothies, sweet crepes, savory crepes, tons of pastries, cold/hot sandwiches and coffee.  Everything is EXPENSIVE, so don't expect a cheap treat!  You will also find different pre-packaged treats for sale.    One important thing I recommend: STAY AWAY FROM THE SAVORY CREPES (ham swiss, chicken, turkey, etc.) They are just nasty in my opinion!  The batter they use is different than the one from the sweet crepes.  This batter is dark brown and tastes like cardboard! The inside filling does not make-up for that awful taste!"}
{"text":"All the way 5 stars. Absolutely fabulous!!:)) it's impressive how well the flavors complement each other and the displays are out of this planet"}
{"text":"The treats are awesome. If you have a sweet tooth, give this place a try. The decor is awesome and there is chocolate and sweets everywhere. I would suggest getting one or two desserts at a time. My eyes were to big for my stomach and Aria doesn't have space in the refrigerator or you can have them send up one for $25 a day, boo. I though the key lime was the best out of the ones I did get to eat."}
{"text":"The Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio has a Chocolate-fantasy like theme, where you can see the largest chocolate fountain in the world.  I have visited this place a couple of times - sometimes just to adore the beautiful pastries.  I have tried the crepe and hazelnut ice cream, and they are simply delicious.  They are quite pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Impressive - yes. Tasty - not as good as you would think.  With all that said, this is still my type of place to get a quick bite, late night bite (open until midnight), or indulge in a pastry.  Small juices - $4.95   Chocolate croissant $4 - mammoth in size, thick crust and thick throughout, which means it won't be an airy soft croissant, EXTREMELY salty.  In fact, that's all that I could taste. This truly tasted like salty bread in the form of a brick-like croissant.  Tandoori chicken sandwich - good but bland and heavy, I didn't understand the need for cheese in this sandwich.  Sundried Tomato Chicken Sandwich - this was the better of the 2 sandwiches and had more flavor (barely).  All sandwiches are: *roughly $9 to $10 *all come with cheese  *all are  pre-made which means that they do not make to order if you have special requests (what you see is what you get) *can be slightly toasted or pressed, which makes it super greasy (so if you want to feel less guilty, maybe eat it as is aka cold) *filling for 1 person *overall - bland sandwiches   Coconut Macaroons -  Individual wrapped: $2 for the plain or $3 for the chocolate half iced  4 pack - $8  These are dense and moist mothers.  The coconut flavor is mild.  Halfway through, I almost forgot I was eating a macaroon because it is so moist, it has the texture and consistency of a brownie or a cake pop.  Palmiers $14 - waiting to be opened but I have a feeling that these will be as salty as their croissants  Caramel Corn - $9.80 waiting to be opened  Chocolates - $6 for 2 pieces waiting to be opened   Overall, you are definitely paying for the brand.  They place a lot of attention to every detail, which I can appreciate - down to their plastic ware - which looks like real silverware. heh.   Location: in Aria   Parking: free self-park structure"}
{"text":"Everything about this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria is AWESOME!  I came in to look for macarons, and walked out with:  Raspberry Rose Macaron ($6.00) - a 2.5-3\" diameter hot pink macaron with an ever so lightly rose cream and perfect fresh raspberries in the center.  A candied rose petal topped it.  This was like a Paulette rose macaron on its wedding day -AMAZING!!  Triple Chocolate ($6.50) - buttery and slightly salty toffee bottom crust, chocolate ganache, chocolate cream and vanilla cream layers, covered in a rich chocolate mousse, 1/2 enrobed with ganache, and topped with a ganache filled pistachio macaron.  With a roll of fudge on top, and a band of chocolate around it.  Omg, amazing!  Everything was mildly sweet, and the macarons were moist in the middle, with a perfect crust.  Each desert was packaged in its own mini cake box so perfectly - and service was gracious and fast.  My friend also got a scoop each of the pistachio and Oreo gelatos, and they were super yummy!  Jean Philippe, I think my good friend Paulette would eat you up.....I know I did!  = P"}
{"text":"After having an amazing time at Absinthe, I decided to end the night on a sweet note.  Checked my handy dandy yelp app and all signs pointed here.  I had about thirty minutes before they closed, so I booked it to the Bellagio.  The walk alone was delightful through Bellagio's breathtaking lobby of Dale Chihuly sculpted glass flourishing the ceiling and the patriotic themed flower garden that was just so pristine and impeccable.    I saw Jean Philippe's Patisserie in the distance, well actually, the chocolate fountain.  Whoa!  Yes, a spectacle that requires you to really look up to appreciate the magnitude of this Willy Wonka-like contraption.  I envisioned myself as Wonka character, Agustus Gloop (\"Let me in, I'm starving!\") and breaking into the fountain after hours and drinking my chocolate heart's content and then getting all sleepy and appearing the next morning inebriated in the window display like \"Chocolat\" character Comte de Reynaud (played by Alfred Molina).  Despite wanting everything, I decided on Dulce de leche gelato.  Just brilliant!  Perfect texture and the flavor was probably one of the best I've tasted outside of Rome.  I savored my treat standing in the rotunda garden, relishing in a flood of sensory delights that are so abundantly Vegas.  #Yelp 365:  044/365"}
{"text":"The cherry Danish was good and the blueberry brioche was ok but I was most disappointed in the crepe which I had been wanting to try. The crepes at The Paris are much better. Next time I'll walk across the street"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of sweets & dessert but do you know the line \"you had me at hello\"?  That about sums it up.  Everything looked so delicious, I had difficulty choosing just 1!  Finally decided on a pastry & a small cup of coffee....paid $4 for the pastry & $3.50 for the coffee....totally ridiculous for the coffee but the pastry was worth every scrumptious bite!"}
{"text":"I always make sure to stop by this place a few times during my trips to Vegas! Love their stuff and always interested in their decor. Love the coffee and drinks! The coffee drinkers with me admitted it being one of the best coffee they've had. Not being a coffee drinker myself, I indulged in the hot chocolate and loved it! Among their sweets, I have a few favorite but will honestly say that not all of their stuff is amazing. I like their flan, beignets (Nutella or raspberry or plain, love them all), and croissants (almond or with Nutella). I like their crepes as well and have had probably most of them (if not all). Their service is usually great but I think this time around they were overwhelmed and getting two pastries took over 20 minutes and the line kept growing. During one instance, the cashier spent over 15 minutes just calculating a lady's total and packing her things to go (it started becoming a bit ridiculous). But I won't hold this against them as I'm sure they have new people to train all the time and they have a lot of customers; but then again,they should be used to it and need to come up with a better system. Overall a must while in Vegas but do expect a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"So who wouldn't love to see the biggest chocolate fountain in the world? It's Vegas so it is only appropriate for everything to be gaudy and that is exactly what Jean Philippe did.   Everything tasted just wonderful and all the desserts are made with great care and attention to detail. My only problem was that there is not seating and the wait staff move at an extreme glacial pace. There is one side for coffee and crepes and there is another side just for desserts. It's never marked which side is which so I had no idea where to go. The worst part is I wanted both a dessert and a crepe and both the lines were long and slow! What on earth was I supposed to do? When I finally got to the front of the line I asked the man if there was any way that I could put in an order for a crepe even though I was on the dessert side and instead of saying \"let me see what I can do\" he huffed and puffed and told me what a trouble it was going to be for him and I should just wait in both lines next time. HOW RUDE! That single moment pretty much ruined my entire experience. Then 20 min later I finally get my food and I have to find a bench somewhere just to eat my now soggy crepe."}
{"text":"Yeahhhh Nutella Brioche! I finally got around to coming to this place because I was staying at the Aria with a friend and needed breakfast before our trip to Mt. Charleston. We did wait in line for a long time but it was worth it!   I ordered the Nutella brioche with a cafe au lait and my friend a Nutella brioche and a iced mocha. Her mocha was not good and she went back to ask for something different. It was immediate how quickly the manager or somebody in charge gave her something different. That alone is worth a good review on Yelp!   I did not try the macarons which is why I can't give it five stars--I am such a macaron sucker! But the Nutella brioche was delicious. Seating is kind of a drag in the morning hours, but you can find something and if not, go somewhere else and people watch--prime for the LV Strip."}
{"text":"Their pastry is just like their chocolate fountain, such a wonder to just look at.  So pretty, you might not realize it's real.  We actually headed here after dinner at Top of the World because their gelatos just looked so inviting.  I dont think I held such high expectations, but apparently, the gelato just didn't do it for me.  It was late in the evening, so most of the flavors I would have chosen were already gone, so I opted for the \"cheesecake\" gelato.  Not sure if it was supposed to be lemon cheesecake, or if that's what cheesecake is to them....but either way...it was way too sweet.  WAY.  I couldn't even counter the sweetness with massive amounts of water.  I had to throw it out.  Sigh.  Thankfully though, I also did get a rose macaroon (leave it to the French to discover you can eat flowers).  The presentation and look brought me back to my trip to Paris.  And the taste, definitely redemption from the sad and sweet gelato.  The macaroon was pretty large, it can easily shared with another.  If I were to go back to spend that kind of money on dessert, I'd go with the macaroons."}
{"text":"I can't miss this place whenever I go to Las Vegas. Their cakes, pastries, crepes, and chocolates are absolutely fantastic!! Everything is pricey, but it's definitely worth it!   This time I tried bear claws (very flaky and buttery puff pastry with hazelnut pastes inside), Dulce de leche brioche (it's incredible!! amazing dulce de leche!!), triple chocolate cake, and imperial (chocolate cake with hazelnut pralines covered with ganache). They were soooooo good. I wish Jean Philippe would open up a new store in L.A.    I have 2 complains and that's why I deducted one star;  I didn't like the fact that there is only one person to take orders for everything.(and she wasn't friendly) I wish they would have one more place to take orders. Also they only have 3 small tables and chairs to eat. I hope they would have more space to dine-in."}
{"text":"I much prefer Bouchon. Had the oatmeal raisin cookie here, which was pretty dry and lacking in flavor. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Yikes. Their morning rush is so rough. The male worker writing down orders literally didn't take time to answer any of my questions or answer them properly, for that matter. I asked for an egg white and cheese croissant... but wait, they can't do that.  First of all, they don't do egg whites.  Secondly, he informed me they would have to charge me for each individual item (the croissant, the egg, and the cheese) but they could still make it.  Okay, fine. I'll play by your rules. I ordered as he told me thinking they would put it in a nice little sandwich for me. However, I got to the checkout counter and the lady informed me they can't put the sandwich together. I would have to just have my croissant in their signature white bags, with a side of eggs and a slice of cheese on the side.  No. No. And just No.  Thanks to the miscommunication of all people at this rushed little joint, I wasted 15 minutes of my life in a line where I just walked away with my almond milk cappuccino, a Fiji, and an Orange Juice (which isn't freshly squeezed, btw) and they lost three customers who love to spend money."}
{"text":"Jan Philippe Patisserie is located inside Bellagio (around the corner from the Botanical Gardens).  I love seeing the huge 27 feet chocolate fountain.  It was pretty amazing.  Its nice that this place opens up at 6:30am.  Its a great place to grab breakfast or a snack early in the morning.  Everything looked really good on display.  It was really hard to pick something.  I decided to go with the chocolate crossiant, which was very delicious.  There was a good amount of chocolate inside.  My husband really enjoyed the cherry danish.  We ended up coming back later in the day to try the desserts.  We bought the Nutella Napolean, and it was very good.  The chocolate mousse in the middle with the chocolate coins on the top.  I enjoyed every bite!  Overall, I would definitely come back to try other items."}
{"text":"A must visit when at the Bellagio. Delicious desserts and chocolates. The Patisserie is very close to the famous conservatory. Service can be slow especially on the weekends and holidays but everyone is really nice and accomadating despite it being smaller than the Aria location. The perks of this location is that the famous chocolate fountain is located at this location and must Stop for photo opp. I highly recommend the Nutella Crepe....simply amazing!"}
{"text":"It's sad to see a popular Patisserie that was part of Aria Resort and Casino. However, after my recent visit here. I actually didn't notice any difference in what is offered here compared to Jean Philippe. The service is pretty good considering how busy they are. The staff seem friendly and attentive plus they have a nice systematic way of moving the line. All pastries look very similar and taste delicious just like JP. Majority of the staff are workers from the previous Patisserie. The wonderful cake displays are available for purchase and they have abundant of retail items that are worth checking out.   French style crepes are made onsite by the Crepe makers. Flavors range from sweet to savory like the popular Nutella Crepe, which I highly reccommend! To savory crepes, like the Forrest and Italian savory crepe.   There is a wide range of pastries, about 2 dozen or so. From Cheese Danish to a Napoleon, pretty much to accomodate everyone preference when it comes to desserts.  2018 Yelp Review #1"}
{"text":"Game Over! Best Sandwiches/Paninnis in town! Fresh, tasty and so so good! Easy to share. We shared a tuna panini and smoke salmon sandwich, an iced latte and a flan...a perfect Sunday brunch! Not cheap, but well worth those duckets!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake was soft, the hot chocolate was not sweet at all. The tiramisu had Oreo cookies in it and no coffee flavor. Oreo cookies? WTH? Waste of money."}
{"text":"When you think decadent, over the top, spectacular looking desserts, this kind of sweet spot comes to mind. The choice were overwhelming (next time will try gelato). It's a patisserie first so I focused my attention to the pretty looking baked goods. I'm a key lime fanatic so this was my selection. Happy to share it's the best rendition I've ever had. Despite the green coloring (I know it's for show, but real key limes are yellow looking), the texture, flavor notes and execution were spot on.  I also got a bite of the opera cake, though not a chocolate fan, I found this quite tasty since it was layered and assembled beautifully.  The location is tucked away in the casino in Aria, but it's worth finding. A sure win while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall the best pastries you'll find in one place.  Gelatos are awesome, as well as the sandwiches. Although, I didn't get to try all the desserts, I'd say most of them are as good as they look. Eat them fresh, as they were meant to be eaten, don't let them sit too long."}
{"text":"Pastries I recommend:  Chocolate croisant - amazingly light crunch and flaky. Nutella Brioche - i love nutella so i guess this recommendation is a bit bias Blueberry Brioche - really good.  had great blueberry flavor and a nice soft crunch.    Almond croisant was pretty good.   As I was leaving, i saw a lot of people eating their chocolate crepes.  I think i'll try this for my next visit."}
{"text":"As you round the corner inside the breath taking Bellagio and you approach Jean Philippe Patisserie you will, for a moment think you are entering Wonka Land. To the right of the main counter you will see a melange of chocolate cascading down into shallow glass ledges allowing the chocolate to pool and then overflow to the ledge below, somewhat like a waterfall. Random fact: this is the largest chocolate fountain in the world, Guinness Book recognized. Above you a train, and all around will be cakes, desserts, bright colors and delicious smells. And right directly in front of you, will be the Mr. Wonka of Crepes. Pouring, flipping and serving them up warm and neatly decorated.   This is how it works, go to the register (as the sign instructs) order your crepe of choice or other confection and wait until your name is called. Don't rush the bystanders and start shouting orders to the people actually making the crepes, that's not their job to take your order.   They have quite the assortment, we opted for: Bananas Foster, Dulce de Leche and Apple Walnut crepes. As we stood nearby taking in the production I realized that the crepes were not actually being made the way I've seen in so many places (my most favorite crepe place is inside Paris Hotel, Le Creperie I should have went there). My disappointment kicks in. Rather than fill the warm air crepe with the delicious choice I've selected. The crepe is folded and slapped on a plate and then the topping is what you'd anticipate to be your filling. So now I'm eating an open faced crepe. I would have much rather enjoyed my sweets neatly enclosed and dusted with powder sugar and served with a dollop of cream. It still of course have a somewhat pleasant flavor, but my palette did not feel completely satisfied, it was lacking a little pizazz. My bananas foster was a little strong (alcohol flavor) and the the sauce was a little runny for my liking. For the three of us to enjoy these crepes it was almost $35 and it really was not worth it, (sigh).  I'd go again, but not my next visit. My next trip will include a stop at Le Creperie!"}
{"text":"Worth going simply to see the chocolate fountain!  SO cool and it smells dangerously delicious.  They had so many adorable seasonal chocolates as well - I was amazed by the craftsmanship of what they made.  Definitely a good spot to grab a gift!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Tried the crepes, a holiday cookie, ice cream and coffee.  Nothing special.  Crepes were mediocre.  Kids all took one bite of the cookie and claimed it tasted strange.  Most of the cookie went in the trash.  Not worth the wait, the calories or the trouble of figuring out which line goes where."}
{"text":"Great spot to indulge and satisfy any sweet tooth craving one might have :-) so break out your wallet and splurge!!"}
{"text":"I go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs over gelato. It's seriously one of my top favorite deserts. This little shop is located right by the casino in the Aria. Literally we sat by a slot machine while Joe drank his creme brûlée milkshake and I ate my Oreo waffle cone. HUGE selection and you can taste a few before deciding which one to get (I tried the mint chocolate, Oreo and chocolate. Rather expensive though. 18 bucks for a waffle cone and a milkshake. It tastes more like ice cream then gelato. They also serve coffee, expresso and lattes as well. There's one in the Bellagio too I noticed."}
{"text":"I came here because 2 of my sisters recommended it. The bakery has an overwhelming amount of options and all of it is delicious. There's definitely something for everyone and I'm excited to return and try the gelato. Our beignet and croissant were amazing. But their customer service is crappy, at least here at the Aria location. The employees have no clue what a smile is and they're not helpful. They also will smash your to go desserts in a box."}
{"text":"Stop by for lunch and my wife and i tried a couple of the savory crepes and an apple brioche. The brioche was light and buttery and very good. The crepes were also quite tasty. The buckwheat batter of the crepes was airy and light, very tasty. The salmon crepe was filled with veggies and topped with smoked salmon. It ate like a meal. We also had the black forest crepe which was topped with and egg and filled with ham and mushrooms. I think i liked the salmon crepe better, but both were very good. There is no seating inside the restaurants but there are tables set right outside. Make sure to check out the chocolate fountain in the restaurant, It's  very large and strangely hypnotic."}
{"text":"Solid desserts!  I had the almond chocolate chip croissant and it was very tasty!  As well as Oreo cake.  The vanilla topping was the best."}
{"text":"Looks like another outpost of Jean Phillipe's bakery, the first inside the Bellagio.  Selected 12 pieces of chocolates and truffles:  COCONUT chocolate/dark chocolate: like a super fancy Almond Joy. PISTACHIO TRUFFLE: gooey pistachio center.  Yum. 5 Stars.  COFFEE (lip stick one): very intense coffee flavor.   Boyfriend ordered an iced coffee.  Might as well have been coffee flavored ice water.  Sucked hard.  Wander around a bit more because there are Starbucks all over the place  e.g. Monte Carlo, MGM Grand food court, Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"The chocolates are all wonderful.  The cakes are phenomenal, too.  The carrot cake is popular and sells out quickly.  My favorites were the Key Lime and the cakes made with chocolate mousse.  The Snickers Cake was a bit disappointing and lacked in flavor compared to the others.  The veggie crepe was pretty cool; it was very hearty with robust tomato flavor in the filling and a lovely bunch of greens on the side (like a gourmet pizza crepe of sorts).  Jean Philippe is a nice treat before or after a show."}
{"text":"Stood in a VERY long and very slow moving line for some breakfast goodies here one morning while in Vegas because it seemed fast and easy. Wrong. The line moved at a snails pace and after standing for 30 minutes had barely moved.   Finally we reached the front and I ordered a chai latte and blueberry muffin. The chai latte was not good at all. I threw it away. The blueberry muffin was edible but not worth the wait. I was starving so I ate it   The gal next to us got a savory crepe and it looked good probably should've done that but I didn't want hot and heavy.   Long line, expensive, and bad coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery. Addicting sweets. Delicious pastries. Delectable eats. Luscious gelato. Decent prices (for the LV STRIP)  Two words: ALMOND CROISSANT!!!  I love this place... it's stunning to the eyes and mind-twisting delicious for your taste buds and stomach. The only complaint was it was \"conveniently\" located right next to the guest elevators, so we passed by here about 5 times a day... So I ate here about 3 out of 5 of those times :)"}
{"text":"I stayed at ARIA for a work conference. Awesome right? I frequented this little lunch/coffee/bakery shop a lot during my visit. I normally have vanilla lattes or mochas, but I tried this caramel beverage (caramel sauce in drip coffee w/ whipped cream). It was AMAZING. The coffee here was great and the caramel sauce addition was good for me since I don't drink black coffee. However, a 12 oz was probably $5ish. Seriously, it's just drip coffee w/ caramel. I guess it's Vegas. The bakery items were good/ok. I don't remember anything worth noting. All very expensive. 5 star drank. Minus 1 star for ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"Met NC for coffee at Jean Philippe, which was a good since it was easy to find.  Being right next to the guest elevators, the ambiance was such that you can do some people watching or just enjoy the conversation.  Not too loud, not too quiet - perfect for coffee and catching up.  Had the raspberry macaroon, some pastry topped with a mound of raspberries, and a coffee latte - about $6 each.    The macaroon was dope.  Perfect texture, crunchy cookie with a chewy center filled with raspberries and a lavender flavored cream.  The raspberry pastry thing was nothing special and I'm not a coffee snob - just needed the caffeine.  All in all, pretty tasty but kinda pricy.  Ohh well, that's what you get for the area or should I say Aria?"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you must see if you come to Vegas.  Find their famous chocolate fountain at the Bellagio.  Who won't be intrigue by this beautiful tri-chocolate delicious dreamy goodness art.  Even the chocolates are good here.  I got a tin set of the white, milk and dark chocolate,  and mocha coffee.  I bought the silver candy almonds and chocolate coconut macaroons, but did not care for it too much.  Everything else is yummy good =D  This place does get busy so expect a line.  They have ice cream and crepes too, but I did not get a chance to try it.  Maybe next time when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. Absolutely amazing!!! The only thing that sucks is they run out of pastries at night."}
{"text":"OMG! Sweet tooth overload! AMAZING DESSERTS!  Everything is soooo good! Sweet, creamy, and filling! Tons of different flavored gelato and crepes! and they make it right in front of you. There is most likely always a line, especially after the dinner rush time. But it is soooo worth the wait!

{"text":"I ate pastries here back when it was Jean Philippe Patisserie and it was amazing. Now, it doesn't seem to be quite as elegant or have the options it once did.  We wandered through trying to decide what we wanted to eat for breakfast. Honestly, none of the pastries looked all that appetizing. We ended up just getting some macaroons. The birthday cake was my fav by far out of the few that we got. I don't often go into the Aria while in Vegas since it sets back so far from the main strip, but when I do I will continue to linger through Patisserie to grab a bite."}
{"text":"This location is inside Aria. On one side they have gelato and crepes, on the other they have beautifully designed desserts.  Not only do they please the eye, they please the palette as well. Slightly expensive, but worth the indulgence."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after watching Zarkana for some crepes and gelato and here is our experience:  We were here around 11pm on Monday night and the line wasnt that long, maybe 3 parties ahead of us.  We ordered two scoops of gelato (delicious) a chicken crepe and a nutella crepe.  We were watching the girl make the crepes and noticed that our order got skipped (we had been waiting around 15 min by now) we asked her about our order and she didnt even look up at us and said Im sorry its not written down here, cant help you sorry and moved on to the next order.  That was unacceptable.  We went to the guy to took our order and he told her he forgot and to begin our order to the girl.  So we had to wait another 20 minutes since she was already working on someone elses to get our crepes.  How unprofessional and rude!   On the other hand, the crepes were absolutely delicious, I highly recommend the two crepes as well as the gelato.  Our total was around $27 for the two crepes and gelatos.  My tip is to keep an eye on the crepe girl because she was either having a bad day or she had a bad attitude problem and will mess up your order unless you watch her like a hawk"}
{"text":"Cute French pastry shop located inside the Aria. I LOVE sweets! So this place holds a special place in my heart.  They've got everything from cheese Danishes and lemon rasbperry muffins, to creme brûlée and cheesecake.  I ordered a buttery croissant, graham cracker cheesecake, and caramel coffee...all for the grand total of about $17.00.  This place is not for the meek folks."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Aria Hotel for a 3-day work convention and found myself walking downstairs to Jean Philippe every morning during my visit! The coffee here is phenomenal and I highly recommend trying the Hazelnut Latte for a morning pick me up! I usually don't opt for sugary coffee drinks but knew I had to try it here since everyone else was ordering it!  The pastries here are also very tasty and there is so much to choose from. The chocolate almond croissant is delicious, especially paired with my coffee. I'm looking forward to coming back to try the gelato and cakes next time as well!"}
{"text":"Aside from the grandeur sugar art and the cascading chocolate lover's fountain, Jean Philippe Pâtisserie is like a confectionary lover's paradise. In dire urgency for my sweet treat fix after a well deserved evening, I was able to attest Jean Philippe Pâtisserie's name by the several pastries that I devoured at 1am.  A L M O N D  C R O I S S A N T  [ $4.25 ]  Y u m m y ! I don't think I can ever be disappointed with an almond croissant, but Jean Philippe Pâtisserie's croissant was soft, flakey, and filled with sweet almond marzipan then gently sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. Perfect for the morning paired with a fresh brew or a quick late night snack, it was crispy + flakey just like a croissant should be. No wonder I couldn't resist just one, I had two!  B L U E B E R R Y  T A R T  [ $4.25 ] Made of buttery croissant base topped with a lavish blueberry compote, the blueberry tart is made for anyone looking for a sweet fruity treat.  S T I C K Y  P E C A N  B U N  [ $4.25 ] I saved this for the morning, and glad that I did! The bun was still buttery soft with layers of beautiful pecans topped with a sweet candy glaze. Upon first bite the sticky pecan bun was still soft, buttery, and moist! I loved the toasted pecan on top that had a light nutty burnt taste; this could be considered one of their best pastry treats yet.  Since Jean Philippe Pâtisserie is a 24 hour establishment, they even offer Parisian meals along with grandeur cakes and café panini for late night goers. Although I did not have a chance to try their lunch & dinner options, one of these evenings (perhaps at 3am), I will try a crepe or two x"}
{"text":"First Impression: A wonderland for foodie with sweet tooth.   What I ordered:  Savory crepe: 4/5 - whole wheat crepe, satisfying, but not original enough to be impressive The trio; creme brûlée, macaron, and peanut butter lollipop: 5/5 - I love the peanut chocolate lollipop. It tastes better than it looks. It was my favorite. Note: I bit into the milk chocolate platform, it beats any Hershey's bar I've ever had.   What impressed me: All the cake display, the variety of pastries and cakes, the decorations and presentation.  What I didn't like: So difficult to decide what to get. If I didn't have to choose, I would want to try everything!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Best hot chocolate and coffee and love their cheese Danish. So coming here again tomorrow with the whole family."}
{"text":"All the best sweets!!! Must stop here. They have so much to choose from. I'm a fan of the milkshakes and macaroons."}
{"text":"Ordered a large latte for $6.75 and asked for an extra hot and light some. After waiting in line for 15 minutes I received a Luke warm coffee with a bunch of foam. Customer service here is less than desirable. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I'm stuck between 2-3 stars but will bump it up to 3 stars because I visited this place 3 times while I stayed at the Aria.  The first time, we had breakfast and I had the ham omelet and a gingerbread steamer.  My fiance had the smoked salmon crepe.  We barely ate half of our food and just threw away the rest.  The food was so disappointing considering the hefty price tag.  Also, if you're coming here for breakfast, DON'T.  It's packed. And a cluster.  We were confused as to which line to order our drinks, which line to order food, which line to buy desserts.  Forget it.  We came back in the evening after watching Zarkana with the family so my nieces could get gelato.  I had a bit of everyone's gelato (hazelnut, mango, coconut) and I have to admit, it's pretty good gelato.  I ate mostly the hazelnut gelato and the nuts were crunchy and had a perfect toasted flavor.  I'm a fan!  The last day we were there, my fiance got some coffee and bought me two chocolates: earl grey and salted caramel.  We ate this on the drive back home and I thought that the chocolates were tasty but not the best I've ever had...and definitely not worth the price tag.  Overall, it's a nice place to look at pretty desserts and for gelato.  Otherwise, it's overpriced and definitely overhyped."}
{"text":"The macarons here are terrible. While the shells are decent, the filling is completely off. The fillings here are too sticky and/or way too sweet. I got the pistachio, salted caramel and coffee (aka my go to macaron flavors) and I hated them all. What a disappointment seeing as macarons are a French treat so it only made sense to go to a French bakery to find good ones. Go elsewhere!  The cream cheese danish was pretty on point though. The cheese filling wasn't overpowering and the danish itself had the right amount of fluffiness and flakiness. It was basically like the perfect cream cheese on the best part of a croissant.   The croissants here are so-so...I've definitely had better which is disappointing to say since this is the renowned Jean Philippe patisserie. I felt it was too flaky and a tad over baked? I prefer Costco's croissants...  It's definitely a beautiful bakery though with gorgeous displays. The desserts? Very average. Jean Philippe Patisserie's more like a jack-of-all-trades but master of none."}
{"text":"My fiance and I walked by this place every day on our stay in Vegas and we had to give their crepes a try. I got the chocolate crepe and my fiance got the dolce de Leche. The quality of their chocolate is outstanding, but definitely not the best crepe I've ever had. Although their fruit smoothies are really good! Totally give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Desserts, Chocolate, Pastries, Desserts, Truffles, Tarts, Desserts! OMG This place is my heaven! Definitely not cheap but the things that they are making and selling are out of this world! I tried the chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate ganache and small chocolate crispy balls inside. The mousse was so smooth and the crispy balls gave it a nice crunch. Also tried a dark chocolate raspberry truffle and a tropical jelly chocolate which was pretty much chocolate with a passion fruit jelly inside. Absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"Had their salmon sandwich... so good.  All the pastries look so good too.. almond croissant, chocolate croissant...  There was a line around 11:30 but that was not a problem, as line moves quickly.  Also bought some chocolates to bring home as gift."}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended that I stop here and try some of their pastries and since I have a sweet tooth I could not resist! I ordered the brioche bread with Nutella and it was so chocolately rich. It was nicely filled with Nutella and chocolate chips. I could not stop eating this chocolate goodness! Can't wait to go again and try more of their pastries. It was quite the treat!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain is a cool gimmick to get people in the door, but when you find out that it's mostly palm oil that keeps the chocolate flowing, it definitely makes you realize that like most things in Vegas it's all for show.  The real chocolates and pastries behind the counter, though, are the real deal.  JPP gets five stars based on their ridiculously good nutella brioche - it was moist and chock full of delicious nutella.  The other couple items we sampled were also amazing, but the nutella was insanely good."}
{"text":"Got a latte and ham and cheese croissant to go. Latte is ok here. The croissant was kind of of soggy. Not sure if it was the box they put it in for to go that made it soggy. Most places put it in a paper bag. Overall, place is just ok. Watch out for the lines though, they can get pretty long. They have a special coffee line only next door."}
{"text":"Tasty coffee, excellent almond croissant...and they open at 6 am, so it helps for travelers on east coast-time. The location in the Aria is pretty impressive, Bellagio location is tame compared."}
{"text":"I've been coming to here for years and would have given them 5 stars but they changed their recipe for my favorite item the vanilla eclair.  The no longer have the candied macadamia nuts on top which gives this very smooth and creamy desert some much needed texture. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, but not the eclair I have eaten for years and crave every trip to Vegas. Also, the seating area outside the shop was very dirty. Hopefully I was there at a bad time and this isn't the norm for this spot."}
{"text":"If you like a good french breakfast, this is about as good as you're going to get, and the pricing makes it attainable. Probably had one of the better croissants i've had in my life. The croque monsiuer was magnificant - crispy on top and creamy inside. Wife had the fruit parfait, which was decadent. I wish I could have eaten more - all of the pastries looked awesome. They had several types of brioche that I would love to try some day.   Some reviews complain about pricing - I found the quality of what I received to completely justify their sale price.  The patisserie is beautiful, as is everything in that hotel. Very modern and upscale. We did find the service to be a little awkward, since the prepare some of the items fresh, there was about a 5-10 minute wait to get my food. It was worth it so I'll give them a pass.   Highly recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're not interested in mayonnaise or have an allergy to it forget having a sandwich there. What a failure, seriously no options on the side. The lady that seem in charge didn't really care, kind of a take it or leave it attitude."}
{"text":"Nutella brioche...sinful.  An almond something... perfect.  Bran muffin...tasty.   Coffee.... good.  Pricey.... but worth it."}
{"text":"Holy Toledo Batman!  The largest chocolate fountain in the world is right here.   If you are on a diet, this is the right place to ditch it! located in an unassuming corner of the otherwise opulent Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas, this little pâtisserie will transport your imagination and senses to Paris.  On a circular counter, your current and future favorite pastries are waiting for you, enticing you to choose one each, as you move along the line. Pause, for a second, stop drooling, and keep on moving, at the end of the line you can discreetly charge it to your room, or as I do, sell the family jewels, you can't eat them anyway.  Out of the two Las Vegas locations, this one is little more pleasant, as can sit and enjoy your peccadillo in a tranquil, and elegant atmosphere, the one in ARIA is on the casino floor, is hectic & very noisy. That said, you will be equally pleased."}
{"text":"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy Pastries, Cakes, Chocolate, Gelato, Crêpes, if it has sugar they have it! There have two locations in Vegas, Aria, and Bellagio, it's MGM's answer to Bouchon bakery, and it's infinitely superior. Delicious flaky, fluffy, crusty, buttery, creamy, sweetness, all in one place, it's so decadent, if it was 1920 would have been banned, it would have been illegal, it would be prohibition. I know there are great bakeries in Las Vegas, but on the strip, this is the one to visit.  If you are looking for something less indulgent, they also have delicious sandwiches, and savory pastries and crêpes. You can also special order a lunch box, and will be ready right before your trip, so you can enjoy a delicious meal instead of airport food."}
{"text":"I had a croissant that was pretty good, however the coffee was horrible.  The specialty chocolates are good.  All is just overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The crepes are really good and truly enjoyable. Almond croissant was delicious, selection of baked goods was really nice, coffee was good. Overall the food was really good.  The one item that didn't work for me was the ham and cheese croissant; to greasy and you need to eat with fork and knife, which I didn't have time for.    If you want check out Paynard's in Caesars palace that way you can compare two really good places for coffee, baked goods and simple breakfast items, you really won't be disappointed by either choice."}
{"text":"Was craving a strawberry daiquiri as I was laying out at the pool. Instead decided to come here for some gelato. I decided to get the sugar free strawberry flavor. This fed my daiquiri fix and was perfectly sweet. I believe my single scoop was $3.50 and the size of my fist, but worth trying."}
{"text":"A pastry shop that could entice people who are normally impervious to the charms of cake. If you enjoy Asian bakeries, which create beautiful pastries with understated flavors (so as to not overwhelm you) and do not contain an entire bag of sugar for each cake, you'd love the pastries. The Jean Philippe cakes are as delightful to the eyes are they are to the mouth.   I was pleased with every cake I tried, so I can't recommend a specific one. Let your eyes chose one of the delectable cakes, and enjoy the results.   The other offerings (ice cream and sammiches) are not extraordinary.   If you prefer cakes that have sugar in the the first three ingredients or love Safeway cakes, you will just be disappointed. Save your money."}
{"text":"Very good smoothies, gelato and crepes. Usually pretty busy and it's a little out of the way to get there."}
{"text":"OK! So I had the hot chocolate...great!  Then the vegetarian crepe, I'm not a vegetarian but the crepe was good, fresh, light.  Next was the Asian shrimp salad...also good.    Our plan was to just have some dessert but when we got there we realized we were kind of hungry.  I was sketchy about eating real lunch at a dessert place...but I didn't need to be.  The food was just as good as the desert.  Next time I will try a sandwich because a lot of people were getting sandwiches, maybe they know something I don't know (lol).  So unfortunately with our lunch we had very little room for dessert, so we settled for two pieces of chocolate...since that's kind of what he's known for , I was ok with this.  Let me tell you...the man knows chocolate.  I had the earl grey ...if you're a big big tea drinker, like me, you'll love it.  Next was a chocolate with coconut, I don't really like coconut but it was good...the textures was awesome...a definite party in your mouth lol.  Oh, last was the white/milk chocolate strawberry which was also good...but all chocolate strawberries taste good...you have to be an idiot to mess up a chocolate strawberry.  So, I will be going back...probably Friday lol."}
{"text":"Located in one of my favorite hotels, the Bellagio, this candy and dessert shop is pretty awesome albeit service was a bit slow.  The line starts out the front and you walk in a circle to each station to choose a dessert of your liking.  I picked up a strawberry sorbet.  It was actually one of the best ones I've tasted.  Yes my pick made it look extra messy but that was because I took the pic after eating it.  Yeah it was that good and delicious, I couldn't wait.    They're known for one major thing.  Their awesome chocolate fountain display is simply marvelous.  White, dark, milk, just everything flowing down.  It was magical, it was beautiful.  My only sad moment was when I saw that the chocolate fountain flows were bottled up and neatly package.  It then dawned on me that I could not buy it because I was taking the plane home and no liquid is allowed.  NOOOOO!!!  It looked so awesome too.  The pain cuts so deep.  Oh wells I'm driving next time.  After the sorbet and fountain part, we got over to the pastries.  Sadly they looked not that good so I opted to get two OJs which were pretty good.  I'm not sure if they are freshly squeezed but still very delicious.  I'd definitely return here again.  My overall impression of the place is nothing short of spectacular.  The main reason is the chocolate fountain.  I went to the other Jean Phillippe in town but only this one seems to have it."}
{"text":"I mean, JPM is an award winning pastry chef through no fluke.  I love his pastry shops from the décor to the lovely pastries themselves, his spots are always a must for me now.  Rolling through Vegas I made sure to hop over to a few of his bakeries to give his pastries a try.  Nothing but consistency and more importantly they taste amazing.  I'm not a fan of crepes but after trying them here I'm convinced that it just depends on the baker.  Though I must admit is is very pricey here but then again its Vegas and everything is kinda pricey anyways.  Aside from the pastries, the gelato is extremely delicious too but expect the lines to be ridiculously long here.  Everyone and their momma wanted the gelato but that only meant it was really good, at least to me it was.  The service was extremely nice and mixed with the great food and decor, this is one place you must visit in Vegas.  Overall my experience here was nothing short of spectacular.  The prices are high but definitely worth it in my opinion.  My chances of returning are pretty high, but only if I should return to Vegas again."}
{"text":"If you in Las Vegas , you have to try it. The best desert I ever had. Every desert is a piece of art. We had to go back next day to get more. Coffee wasn't so good though."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Aria and had a quick lunch of prosciutto panini and cobb salad. Very high quality ingredients and portions are the right size."}
{"text":"i hate to give it a 3 star but i'm being really objective. it was crazy that i bought 8 pastries without trying a single one.. not even a single bite or lick. left all for my friends.  had croissant while having my bath :D it was nice, but wished it was  crispier on the skin and flakier. banana orange jam was sorta too watery that i can't really taste the banana nor orange. maybe 65% fruit wasn't enough because i like my jam thick!"}
{"text":"Sweet little pastry, chocolate and crepe cafe! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's in the busy lobby and is limited on interior seating. I ordered the Black Forest Crepe which include a buckwheat crepe filled with ham, mushrooms, cheese and onion topped with a scramble egg. It was delicious! And a nice portion of flavor! The cafe was clean and neatly decorated with Chocolate goodies including a floor to ceiling chocolate fountain. More people were photographing the chocolate fountain than there were eating!"}
{"text":"2.4 stars.    This review is for the take out sandwich.    I ordered tomato spiced chicken panini to go ($12). the break was hard as a rock probably over toasted it and left it out for so long. It was cold too.  For a 12$ sandwich, I expected something better."}
{"text":"The Nutella beignet was my favorite! The gelato and crepes were alright, nothing extraordinary (especially at the price you pay). I would stick with the pre made deserts by the cash register with the food and not bother with the ice cream and crepes on the other side."}
{"text":"Some of the best desserts Iv'e had outside of Paris. The passion fruit tart and key lime were the best and had such a unique flavor. The dessert are quite pricey so if you're coming to have breakfast for 2 you're looking to spend around $50.  The crepes are also very good and you can get sweet or savory ones (nutella and salmon were good), the salmon sandwich wasn't anything special but the turkey and cranberry croissant sandwich was good. The lines here are always long and it's always packed so you won't always be able to find a seat. You can skip the sandwiches and stick to the dessert crepes and pastries."}
{"text":"I want to marry the prosciutto sandwich. That is all."}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe gave me flashbacks from my trip to Paris. Artfully crafted pastries, sandwiches, and salads. Pricey, but you get what you pay for. Delicious pastries and sandwiches, nice portion sizes. The croissants are so airy, flaky, and buttery. Definitely worth the calorie splurge!"}
{"text":"After stuffing my face at the buffet, I'm pretty sure I did not need to make a stop here. Wrong! I could hear the chocolate croissant calling my name from across the casino. I am so glad we were united, the croissant was delicious! Buttery, flaky, everything you would want a chocolate croissant to be and more! :)"}
{"text":"Got to use another myVegas reward! 1 free crepe! I got the savory salmon one! Unfortunately it was made with cold, smoked salmon - and not much of it. But it was still pretty good.  It had a great white sauce and lots of veggies like mushrooms and spinach. I really only ate until I had finished all the salmon they put on top, which was only like maybe 6-8 bites - at most. It was made from a buckwheat crepe which was cool. The guy was also super nice! And we got to watch them make it.  We also tried some samples of the gelato, pretty good. We were sold on the oreo one. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came by to try the crepes as per another Yelper's recommendation. I was amazed at the chocolate fountain when I arrived.  I ordered the Chicken Crepe, but I had the opportunity to try the salmon as well. The chicken was slightly dry, but the salmon was super fresh and on point! I had the opportunity to watch the workers make the crepes in front of me."}
{"text":"Came by for an afternoon snack and breakfast at Yum E's recommendation.  The chocolates, gelato, and pastries were definitely world class! Delicious!  The quiche was a winner. Once heated up, it tasted light years ahead of the frozen ones from the grocery store I'm used to eating. The ham and cheese croissant was excellent as well. The ham and swiss sandwich croissant was delicious too, when consumed the next day.  Pricing was on the expensive side, but hey, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate crepe and lots of tempting eye-candy."}
{"text":"This place is worth stopping at if you're into just checking out things that might be a little different from what you typically see, but I didn't feel that anything about this place was really more special than just the fact that it has the largest chocolate fountain I have ever seen.  bonus points for a seriously intense selection of different ice creams, pastries, crepes and more though - for such a small space they pack in a lot of different options.  There is very limited seating so unless you luck out you're likely taking it to go.    I would echo what some other reviewers stated about the organization of the shop - you really don't know where to get in line unless you've been here before.  It's not like you can't figure it out but when there are long lines the last thing  you really want to do is waste more time figuring out if you're in the right line while other people hop in front of you."}
{"text":"im whatevers about crepes but these are AMAZING! ordered one with apples, another with berries, and the dulce de leche brioche...just visited this patisserie for late night eats with the bf and was not expecting something..so yummy so yummy there's a party in my tummy!"}
{"text":"The decoration and the chocolate both fantastic. Decoration is pretty much whimsical and modern. I love every pastry: the color, display, tasty. I got some Christmas Presents for my family."}
{"text":"This review is for their gelato only because that's all we tried here. Our \"first\" visit here was a result of visiting Aria Casino and Hotel. I opted for the coffee flavor gelato and Mom & HL got their chocolate mint flavor.   I tasted HL's chocolate mint and wished I had gotten that flavor - it was so good!  So the day before we left I suggested we go back for more gelato here. My ulterior motive was to get my own scoop of chocolate mint gelato. Boy I was not disappointed. Yum yum yummy literally in every bite! Their chocolate mint is one of the best flavors I have ever had - yes it was that good!   Next time I am in Las Vegas, I will go out of my way to stop by and enjoy this fabulous flavor again!  I highly recommend this place and btw the size of their scoops will make you smile too!"}
{"text":"I was at the aria for 2 days and i ate lunch and dinner there for two days. Great sandwiches, convenient to the room locations. The best coffee is the americano, if you like strong coffee with a pick me up, da best!!!"}
{"text":"Cute, delicious desserts as well as salads, paninis, and sandwiches!  The desserts look way better than the savory food, but still delicious. The display tempts you to want to order everything!  Located in the Aria/Vdara hotel near the casino-- a bit pricey ($12-15 for a salad/panini) but it's vegas, so I won't complain  I stayed at Aria for my most recent visit, so I came here for breakfast and lunch every day, haha. I wanted the breakfast panini but they were sold out, so I ordered the ham & cheese croissant-- more like a sandwich, but the croissant was very buttery, flakey, and soft. The cheese was perfectly melted!   Asian salad was good, and had a nice serving of shrimp.  Prosciutto Panini: fresh ingredients, delicious prosciutto"}
{"text":"Really pretty looking desserts :)!  Wish I had more stomach space to eat more treats!  But I only had room for a crepe with strawberries and vanilla gelato - yum!"}
{"text":"CHOCOLATE and GELATO HEAVEN!  Best chocolate souffle crepes ever! Well worth the money and wait. It had delicious chocolate sauce and chunks of what it seemed like soft brownies with walnuts in them, custard, side of whipped cream and powdered sugar. I also had the INTENSE and yes it was just that. I counted about 10 different treatments to chocolate in this ONE little piece of macaroon mousse treat! I recommend their iced mocha to wash it all down. :] Oh, and HAD to try the sugar brioche because of a yelper. That was prepared very well also.  We sat not too far from the shop outside in the lobby. I'm pretty sure it was for their customers too. The view was of the Bellagio's pool."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie may be a chocolate lover's heaven. What catches your eye are the loads of chocolate fountains dripping down from the walls into glass bowls. At first glance, it looks like fake plastic chocolate but when you get a closer look, lo and behold it is REAL fountains of chocolate flowing freely for observers to \"oooh\" and \"aaah\" over.  This particular Patisserie is conveniently located nearby the Bellagio suite elevators. We made numerous late-night trips because it was so convenient. All of the workers there need to get the stick out of their a$$e$ because they made each visit so unpleasant. You're surrounded by a bunch of sweets for pete's sake! Shouldn't the smell give you a natural high?They were a bunch of emotionless robots.   Gelato -- I stuck with the mixed berries gelato. Very tart and soft, almost like soft serve. You can see bits of the berry seeds with every bite.   Make sure you make it there early if you want to sample their baked goods. We had a late-night run maybe an hour before closing and they had already run out of their cakes."}
{"text":"Desserts at J.P. Patisserie look stunningly beautiful, but luckily the taste doesn't betray and confirms to be on the same level! We had breakfast there twice during our 4-nights stay at the Aria and both times we had a hard time trying to decide what to taste. Not only sweets, everything on their menu was lovely (I've personally tried the croque monsieur)."}
{"text":"FIRST AND FOREMOST....... THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED.  PLEASE FIX THIS !!!!!!!  How is it with this wonderful patisserie that I have now, for the SECOND time, been unable to try their most delectable baked works of art?  We actually stayed in the Aria Hotel this time, Jean-Phillippe was right there, but once again, I didn't get to try anything...... well, I should explain.  I didn't get to try the FANCY pastries..... but I did, at least, get to try their croissant-like items.  I wanted to try their macarons, the gorgeous, decadent pastries, but time was not on my side, and neither was my stomach.  I was battling some type of stomach flu thing, and eating these rich desserts would have been stupid.  Also, I didn't have an Igloo or other device to ship any home for a later time, so there they sat in their display cases with me taking pictures..... that's as close as I got.  I ended up buying a blueberry muffin, lemon cranberry, and a chocolate croissant.  They were tasty, but they were also several days old by the time I tried them..... sooooooo, a little stale. My fault for waiting, certainly not Jean Phillippe's.  My daughters both purchased some of his chocolates and raved about them.  Macarons, too.  Nobody ended up buying or trying any of the fancy pastries, though.  Okay, so what this tells me is that we need to return, and maybe the \"three's a charm\" will make it happen.  A couple of new things I noticed is that they now offer gelato.... and...... when we stopped by, they were making breakfast for people, plus they have sandwiches at lunch, too.  Not sure if this was always the case or if they had implemented these items since 2012, the other time I had visited."}
{"text":"Great lattes! I treated myself to the key lime tart. Not sure about the fruit compote between the crust and custard. If it was okay I guess. My friend loved her Napoleon torte."}
{"text":"I stopped into the Bellagio today to pass some time before going to an appointment.  While there, i stopped at JP Patisserie and had some banana gelato.    They have added tables along the hallway, and I was able to get a seat with a view toward the pool area.  The gelato was great, as always, and I enjoyed it more with a seat good for people watching.  Jean Philippe, whether at the Bellagio or Aria, is a great stop to make."}
{"text":"Needed some caffeine for myself and ice cream for the kids so decided to try this place out.  As another person mentioned, the line is a bit confusing as they have two areas to get in line.  If you want ice cream, you have to order it from the other side where the crepes and pastries are located, so you need to decide on your ice cream flavor and order what you want from the other side.  Their coffee was nothing special and tasted kinda like mcdonalds  coffee.  And of course they are over priced for everything they have."}
{"text":"I just stop in for a quick fix of JP gelato.  I got the Peanut Brittle, and it was excellent as always!  This is such a good place to stop and look at the lovely bakery goods and have some gelato."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it. Love the crepe and the yogurt cup. Customers need to wait in line for kinda long. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"It's over the top, pricey, and the wait in line can be lengthy but once you order, it's so worth it.  I don't think you can go wrong with any selection but when I stop by, it's always the same thing-chocolate croissant with a cafe au lait.  You will almost believe you are in Paris until you turn around and see the mass of humanity all playing slots behind you."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom nom nom. I am five pounds heavier after only two days' worth of unfettered access to the gastronomic orgiastic delights Bellagio's little \"coffee shop\" has to offer. Tiramisu gelato, resplendent with chunky mouthfuls of espresso-soaked sponge cake? Check. Nutella brioche, bursting with creamy hazelnut-chocolate flavor? Check. Scrumptious plain coffee, made luxurious with gobs of caramel syrup and real whipped cream? Check. Peanut brittle gelato, which may have finally converted my gelato-ly skeptical SO to the dark side? Check. Fresh fruit cup, with juicy blueberries the size of your thumb? Check. Breakfast panini that made my SO's eyes roll back in his head from pleasure? Check.  Okay. So I spent well over $100 there in 48 hours. Shut up. Everything I had the pleasure of ingesting was superb! The world's largest chocolate fountain (which would look soooo much better in my living room) attracts a bunch of annoying tourists with cameras, but if you can focus on the goods and get past the chaos, you are gold!"}
{"text":"A beautiful place located inside the Bellagio hotel just down the walkway from the lobby. You walk in greeted by imitation chocolate fountains and 3 crepe stations where employees are making crepes and making it look so easy as if they could do it in their sleep. A good selection of light foods and sweets for any meal. Even the crepes are not only for dessert but can made into any meal on their menu. They have three order taking stations and the flow of traffic moves around the center work area. It can get a little jammed up and the coffee prep station for sugar and cream is in a tight an inconvenient spot. There is counter seating after you have your order but it can be tight and people ordering and receiving their food are constantly passing behind you and bumping you. Prices are a little high, but maybe not for Vegas. For an omelette, a pastry and small coffee I paid about $23"}
{"text":"Omg the Cheese Danish is the best I've ever had! They are usually sold out, but today was my lucky day.. I have had other Danishes when they were sold out of the cheese,  but there not as good .. I usually take pictures but I ate it so fast I forgot! Lol"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, wow. You will not be left disappointed. My favorites are the bear claw and almond croissant. Both are $3.95, which I think are reasonable for how well they taste and how big they are.   I really want to try the Nutella brioche, which looked delicious. I went with three other people and our order was large. My boyfriend ordered a panini and it took 10 minutes after everyone else got their food for him to get it. 2 groups behind him got their panini's before him so their system with orders isn't that efficient. My dad also go an extra apple pastry and we got an orange juice that no one ordered. Nothing wrong with free food!   The line takes a while but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Yay it's always fun to stop by here and get a crepe before you hit the pool and sunbathe. I enjoy their savory crepes and I always have to have pistachio gelato! The chocolate fountain is fun too but it didnt impress me too much, I don't know why. We always get these free food coupon things when we stay at bellagio so before we leave we always load up on free sweets at Jean philippe!"}
{"text":"We were passing through the Aria and smelled the delicious crepes that were being made. I decided to stop and peruse through their vast amount of chocolates.   I decided on some chocolates to take home to some friends. My biggest gripe about this place is the check out process.   I stood in line for a good 15 mins before anyone came to help. They may have been understaffed the employee who was in charge of the cash register was also making crepes. It seemed very inefficient.   The chocolates themselves where amazing, you definitely get what you pay for as these chocolates were not made by Hershey. If you are in the Aria or general area, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I recently went back to Vegas so I had to revisit Jean Philippe at Bellagio Casino. So glad they don't close until midnight so I made it there just in time. Yay, they have my White Chocolate bars this time! The last time I visited they were all sold out so I had to buy the small nuggets of White Chocolate. I have to say again and again, Jean Philippe has the best Chocolate! =)"}
{"text":"Got a free crepe with MyVegas Slots...got the banana one. So good! Prolly wouldn't have paid for one ($10-12) other wise."}
{"text":"It was already late into the evening when we arrived at this French bakery hankering for dessert. From the outside looking in, the well-lit interior was small, with foot traffic evolving around the circular glass case overlooking a number of desserts that were on full display. We sat at the small counter to slowly fork into our treats once the bill was settled. The noise level was high, and the room was filled with anticipation. My eyes were much bigger than my stomach on this decadent evening.   The Triple Chocolate Cake ($8) was layered with chocolate mouse, thick milk and white chocolate cream, and toffee at the bottom for texture. It was the most decadent dessert of the night. The chocolate flavors were multiple and distinct, but also intermingled with a level of balance without it being too sweet.   My favorite of the night was the Lemon Tart ($8). It was made with lemon custard, vanilla meringue, white chocolate ring, and candied strawberry at the bottom. I wished the crust was easier to cut into. Aside from that, the refinement on all levels was unparalleled. The layer of candied strawberry served as a nice intermediary between the ingredients, but also cut through some of the tart elements of the custard. It was worth getting.  The Vanilla Éclair ($8) arrived with cream puff dough, vanilla cream, and a thin piece of dark chocolate on top. Unfortunately, the cream puff dough did not taste fresh. I loved the vanilla cream and a touch of coffee to add a nice element of surprise. However, I did not think the price was worth the value, especially given our problem associated with the cream puff dough.  Santi's choice of Pistachio Rice Crispy Ball ($3.50) came with rice crispy that embodied a sweet aromatic pistachio flavor that lingered and intensified along with each chew. It was delicious. I can't wait to try the strawberry flavor on the next visit.  I also had the Ice Tea ($4.25) that tasted refreshing and clean, but over-priced for the size of the cup. Service can be confusing as there were two lines and a lack of clarity on the protocol. Overall, it was still a pleasant experience with a number of shortcomings. These shortcomings had to do with the limited selection of pastries available, freshness of the Éclair, and price. In short, I find the desserts to be balanced in flavor, not too sweet, and made with high quality ingredients. I hope to eventually visit the location in Aria for a close up comparison."}
{"text":"Had some delightful nibbles in here , plenty to buy however EXTREMELY overcrowded due to the high spec and quality in the shop but none of these people seem to want to buy stuff"}
{"text":"This review is based on lunch we had here. Before heading out to the pool, we wanted to grab a quick bite. An employee suggested we could eat here. Everything you can order is laid out on display behind the glass. Some of us ordered salads. When we asked for more dressing, they said salad comes pre-made so they couldn't provide it for us. Uhhh.... What???? Some of us ordered the croissant/panini sandwiches, they were ok at best; the bread kinda cuts up the the inside of ur mouth. The service was horrible. You wait in line and you order, and you pick up ur order when it's ready. But the workers were so indifferent that I thought I was at the DMV for a moment. It took forever to get their attention when I asked for the coffee & water that they forgot to provide. One of the workers literally glanced at us a couple times & just looked away when we called for her attention. Now that I'm on here I realize that this place is more known for their desserts, and they did look yummy. Maybe I'll come here & deal with the bad service to try out their dessert stuff next time."}
{"text":"Everything is outstanding.  Eye candy for hours literally... Breakfast, lunch and dessert... It's all good.   Jean phillippe and one of the other pastry chef team members came out to grab lunch while we were enjoying our Crepes with a perfect view of the decadent pastry case."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't done a review for this place!  I always try and bring my out of town guests here and they're left awestruck. Don't miss it if you come to Las Vegas.   This wonderland island of sweetness is located inside the Aria Hotel, and can be a bit tricky to find. But it's really breathtaking once you arrive...and your nose will certainly know once you get closer.  The smell of coffee and baked yumminess oh my, and the stunning shop is so glamourous like a crystal filled with chocolate.  Lots of pastries, crepes, coffee, cookies, a variety of desserts, Gelato, etc.  Bonus? They also have another shop located at Bellagio with a giant chocolate fountain on display!  The crepes here are so delicious so please order one!  Fluffy fresh and fabulous. We had dessert here once after eating at the Thai restaurant at Aria (Lemongrass).  They have wonderful packaged gifts to go. I always bring home a giant chocolate cookie for the kids-and it's less than $2 and a bag of chocolate dipped biscotti for me also less than $10..   Which reminds me...I'm all out.  Time to go back."}
{"text":"There is always a line here and for good reason.  This chocolate lovers dream is located inside the Bellagio just around the corner from the Conservatory. This location is a bit smaller than their sister store at Aria.  Nonetheless even if you come here just to look at the one of a kind chocolate waterfall display you'll be in line quicker than I can pop a Macaron in my mouth!  Fabulous little pastries, Gelato, coffee, crepes and french desserts to satisfy your guilty pleasure.  Everything is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, I get nervous that things that are TOO pretty won't taste as delicious as they look.    I wasn't disappointed either time at Jean Phillipe.  Their gelato is delightful.  Their lattes are scrumptious.  Their desserts are astoundingly beautiful and surprisingly priced around $6.  I had expected to pay more.  Everything is a bit pricey but it won't blow your budget and like I said, really seems low for the surroundings.    We sipped on some fancy seasonal lattes and dove into some chocolate mousse, crepes and something else.  I can't remember ... but I know there was chocolate and we thought it was pretty darn good as we licked what was left off our spoons.    We always take out of towners for a stroll by since it is absolutely beautiful and their is much to look at!  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed if you indulge in a treat."}
{"text":"crepes, pastries, gelato, and more!  The decor of this place is beautiful, as with anything inside Bellagio. The chocolate fountain display is worth staring at. I came here with a group of 7 for lunch. Not a lot of seating options, they have a couple of small tables but this is more of a place you order and take to go. They have variety of pastries and gelato you can choose from as well crepes and drinks. Their pastries looked so good! I didn't get any but I really wanted to because they were just gloriously sitting there waiting to be eaten.  I got the smoked salmon crepe and a banana foster crepe to share. They both tasted great but for the price I paid, I expected a bit more. Both crepes are about $12 each and that's a lot for crepes in my opinion. The salmon crepe was delicious, they use a distinct sauce that I found quite enjoyable with the salmon. There was also asparagus inside the crepe that added a nice crunch, but i felt like that they gave too little smoked salmon. The crepe was mostly filling and I wanted more smoked salmon. The banana foster was sweet and the caramel was wonderful but I wished the banana wasn't so mushy because the entire crepe lacked any sort of texture. I also got a mocha and that was pretty standard. To finish off my meal I got a chocolate chip mint gelato and I really enjoyed that. Their gelato was smooth and creamy :)  I did enjoy my crepes but for what they charge, I expected better. I'll be back again to try their pastries :)"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast one morning. It's located inside Bellagio hotel. We ordered 4 crepes. They're about $11 each. Breakfast crepe portion feeds 2 people. Dessert crepe is for 1 person portion although you can always share. Crepes are very good. They also have many different French pastries and pretty desserts.   You place your order with first person and pay with second person. They're high tech. It helps to move line faster.   This place does get crowded and sitting area can be limited which I don't care for. It's located close to Bellagio garden."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience - will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment/voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe - the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the quality of their gelatos. I wanted to get the pistachio flavor, but asked fir a taste of it first and it was pretty bland. I went ahead and tried 4 more flavors, which all turned out to be bland, so I defaulted back to cappuccino flavored gelato. I've had this flavor many times in the past and this was again unbelievably bland. The waffle cone I got with it was crisp and crunchy though.   I've heard that the Jean Philippe in Bellagio was much better in quality, so maybe I will try that store next time instead."}
{"text":"This place is goooooood! If you go to the Aria buffet on the second floor for lunch, you will see some beautiful desserts there from JPP as well. My mother ordered the wedding cake from this place while we stayed at the Aria, a fairly small one. It was delicate and...decadent! Some people don't think their dessert is as good as the appearance, but that depends on what you order. I recommend their crepes, the sweet ones. I've tried the Forest, and it was way too salty for my palette."}
{"text":"Such beautiful desserts, (almost) too pretty to eat! I've tried a handful of things including their caramel iced coffee, macarons, Nutella cake, powdered donut. I'm a fan of them all! My favorite is the white chocolate cheesecake. A must every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"zjean phi-lipppe pah-teez-ahr-ghree  I kept saying the name in the worst French accent possible. Rolls off the tongue. We stayed in the Spa tower so every time we needed to go anywhere, we would pass by this place. So good that we made it a point to get a little something each time we passed.    What drew us in was the chocolate fountain. It's so mesmerizing to watch, but at first I just ignored it because I thought there was now way it was real. Super cool and I kept seeing tour groups around it.    Now for the food - the gelato was tasty and the perfect texture and density.  Sometimes gelato places make it too much like regular ice cream where it's too hard or too thick or not thick enough. We had the mint chocolate chip and the small size satisfied our gelato craving nicely.  We also had a couple of the tarts. The strawberry tart was delicious even though it was $6.50 and tiny, it's totally worth the tastes.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=L7QmuervWX8nYzFYbZsD-A&select=RvqRJsW79dfKIWxkzKbGjQ The fruit tart was a little different, but still pretty delicious. If I were to have it again, I would go with the strawberry just because I liked the bottom base thing more.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=L7QmuervWX8nYzFYbZsD-A&select=tkL_T6YaT8nIXGxy7_Sgow  We didn't get to try any of their bread or bagels or crepes, but maybe next time. Once we ate one of those tarts, we didn't want to order anything else."}
{"text":"The creme brulee italian ice was a 'revelation' even though I feel sort of ridiculous saying that. 2 scoops for $5 is a great value to get a premium culinary experience in the middle of your day on the Vegas strip. The other scoop I had was the Mango Passion Fruit and that was good enough but not so noteworthy. I can't wait to go back and get that creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Yum Gelato!!!  I never tried it before but they have a coconut Gelato with fine pieces of coconut in it.   It tasted great.     Also go to see the world's largest chocolate fountain.  Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Located just past the Conservancy. Would recommend this location over the one in the Aria although the line was longer. Aria does have a better selection, but the crepe make was better at the Bellagio. Even the whip cream tasted better."}
{"text":"Located just past the lobby and lines for Haze. We had visited the Bellagio location the night before and this location was faster, but the creeps were not as good. The strawberries were sour, the whip cream was completely without taste and the style of crepe building was different. The crepe was entirely folded before any garnishing was added. Very little Nutella or chocolate in comparison to the Bellagio location's crepes.  The crepe maker was also less than friendly. Go to the Bellagio location just past the Conservancy."}
{"text":"I have found my favorite dessert in the whole wide world and it's the vanilla flan at JP.  There are so many to choose from but I can't get anything else, gotta have my flan.  I would give it 5 stars but the service could be a little better and organized.  Be prepared to wait 10 -15 mins for your food and don't be surprised when your panini comes out luke warm."}
{"text":"I got the exotice fruit crepe which was good.  It came with a scoop of coconut gelato.  I thought the geleto taste better than the crepe.  Its about $15 for a crepe here, which I thought was a lil pricey.  I think the next time, I'll just go to Paris hotel for crepes.  But the gelato here was great.  The coconut gelato had lil bit of coconut pieces in it and it was sooo creamy."}
{"text":"Dulce de Leche or Bananas Foster Crepe with Creme Brûlée Gelato is the bomb!  Really.  The flavors explode in your mouth."}
{"text":"There are several locations for the French patisserie. I have walked by the location plenty of times. It has a world record plaque for the largest chocolate fountain. One can miss it walking in a hurry. It's amazing to look at.   Lots to see from desserts and pastries. Fancy cakes and little desserts.   There is usually a line. Finally found a point without a line. Staff is quick to help get the orders moving. Staff makes good selections as we elected to try the almond croissant she mentioned. We ordered a coffee beverage.   The pastry was served warm as if it came out of the oven. Flavors were sweet. Texture was flaky and melted with bites. Finished in almost no time.   The coffee drink was more on the bold side. However it was sweet in it's right.  Good: fast helpful service matched with tasty pastries match the attraction to the shop. Bad: always a line.  I'll likely make a return trip to this patisserie. There is another shop in the other casino."}
{"text":"The Bellagio is this local lady's favorite Strip casino and for me, there are three must see aspects of the Bellagio: The iconic fountains, the magnificent conservatory, and the amazing chocolate fountain at Jean Philippe... And I must admit, I find it nearly impossible to visit Jean Philippe to see the fountain and not order one of the decadent desserts.   JPP sells a fairly wide variety of items from gelato, crepes (sweet and savory), pastries and of course, boxes and boxes of chocolate. I have not had the crepes and have only had small tastes of the gelato... I go for the desserts, pastries and of course, the chocolates! I have yet to be disappointed by anything sold at JPP, even the drinks are delicious.   Jean Philippe is almost always busy, but service is always efficent and friendly. There is limited seating within the actual shop, you can find a lot more around the corner headed toward the buffet. Prices are high, as one should expect, it's the Bellagio...  Even if you are not in the mood for a sweet treat (or a savory offering), if you are at the Bellagio, JPP is still worth a visit to see the worlds largest free-standing chocolate fountain. Chances are if you are anything like me, one look will instantly have you craving something sweet!"}
{"text":"A MUST DO! A FREE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD. DO NOT MISS THE LARGEST CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD. It is right around the corner from Bellagio's Botanical Gardens. Imagine standing under 2 tons of moving chocolate white, medium and dark. Well that's what they have here. It is awesome. Thank God the display is enclosed in glass I saw a couple of women who looked like they were ready to dive in. LOL!   Don't forget to check out the equally awesome Chocolate Lady. Great desserts that look great and taste great. Yum!!! They also have a larger shop @ Aria."}
{"text":"Oo La La  The perfect place to stop for a little eye candy and porntastic blessings served in the form of chocolate sweeties.  After catching the fantastic water show out front, set to Sinatra crooning Luck Be A Lady tonight, we wandered in and I was drawn to Jean Philippe like a moth to a flame.  The chocolate fountain was too much and while my friends were watching that lovely decadence drip into receiving crystal receptacles, I was eyeballing the little souvenirs for my two little friends back home.  I purchased two Rocher for $6 each and a bottle water for $2.50 (downed in under a minute)  Fantastic truffles, gelato and pastries for the so inclined.  And given the influence of Bellagio standards, the customer service was good."}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorite places in Vegas to grab a quick bite. We literally went here every morning as it was conveniently located at the Aria hotel where we were staying. They have another location in the Bellagio showcasing their famous chocolate fountain, but I feel like the Aria location has much more variety because it isn't just sweets. This place has everything from gorgeous, handcrafted desserts, croissants up the wah-zoo, sandwiches, crepes, salads and even gelato. I think what I love is variety, there is something for everyone. I've tried the chocolate covered strawberries and they were divine. The chocolate croissant just melts in your mouth, it is so fresh and so scrumptious. My husband could not stop raving about the almond croissant as that one also looks so delicious. Taste matches some of the things we ate in Paris so Jean Philippe is definitely authentic french if you ask me. The sandwiches are all prepared fresh with so many different varieties, we had the ham and cheese croissant (can you tell we have a love for the fluffy, puff pastry?) and it was delicious with some kind of red jam and packed with fresh veggies.   The atmosphere is very cute, very modern and unique. It is always busy, no matter what time of day you come here as people are circling around Jean Philippe. However, the line moves pretty quickly and within 10 minutes you can usually order and get your items and hopefully find a good seat. This is a must go to for everyone and although the prices are a tad higher than your local coffee shop or Starbucks, you really get what you pay for as the quality is amazing! Everything is amazing and the variety of truffles is insane, and they are all so beautiful. I will definitely be coming here again even if I'm not staying at the Aria."}
{"text":"If I was a preacher, I would do all my sermons standing on the counter of Jean Philippe inside the ARIA casino. My sermon would be filled with a bunch of \"Goodlawds\" and \"heaven on earth\" kind of phrases.   Beauty can be only sugar-crust deep sometimes, but Jean Philippe Patisserie is not shallow in any way. The displays are stunning and made me run up and down the long cases, from the chocolatier section all the way to the napkins like a Mad Hatter. Even the napkins looked good.  Pistachio rice krispie treats. That was new, and though I didn't try it, I did have the Pistachio Dark Chocolate truffle. It was good, but my least favorite item, only because it was like eating pistachio Jell-O pudding housed in chocolate. Bill Cosby would have approved, though. The Earl Grey Dark Chocolate truffle, with the delicate, Chinese-font word \"tea\" printed on it was so good, I exclaimed after each nibble until it was gone.   I also got a blueberry \"cupcake\" - which wasn't a cupcake really at all. Pro-tip: the exterior tan bottom? It's not edible. You know I found out the hard way. It was like blueberry cheesecake all around the outside, with deep purple cake in the center, intermixed with the vanilla bean cream cheese filling. Delicious, but after a couple of bites, it was too cheesecakey to me (not overly a fan of cheesecake) and passed off to my garbage dumpster--I mean, my friend.   But GOODLAWD. The giant raspberry macaron, filled with vanilla cream and fresh sweet (not tangy!) raspberries was unlike anything I have ever had before. From the sugared rose petal on top to the vanilla bean swirled filling inside, I could not get enough! May be on my top 10 fave dessert list now ^_^  'Hope this wasn't tl;dr, but get your hiney over to one of the Jean Philippe Patiserries STAT. Pretend it's a slot machine that you can't lose on."}
{"text":"Okay so I feel bad for the people who don't walk around the corner from the bellagio lobby and happen upon the flowing chocolate fountain and smell of fresh crepes and nutella! This is my most favorite dessert place in vegas, I have to come here every time.   Breakfast stuff is great like panini sandwhiches and breakfast crepes but I always have to get the nutella crepe.  Theres also gelato and tons of desserts and little chocolate gifts you can bring home.  I just hate how its so touristy some people don't buy the food they just take pictures of the fountain.  I also love the plastic utensils, it looks like real silverwear! So smart! Love it."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I take my daughter Isabella to the Atrium at the Bellagio every holiday and change of season to check out the new displays. I was looking for a place for us to snack and I found gold! It's a worthy destination in and of itself for dessert, coffee or a nice lunch.   The ginormous chocolate fountain is fun but what is served goes way beyond chocolate. The gelato is excellent.   The food is presented beautifully and all very very tasty. The croissants are perfectly executed. The French press coffee was also exceptional."}
{"text":"After walking the Las Vegas strip time to chill with warm Cage latte and some pastries. Came across Jean Philippe inside the Aria. They have Great variety in pastries and chocolate goodies.  Well worth time to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee with hubby"}
{"text":"Chocolate... EXCELLENT!  Crepes ... EXCELLENT!  Pastries... EXCELLENT!   Seating to enjoy your food... very limited, very tight seating areas (no real seating at the other location)  Ordering, disjointed, doesn't flow and can be a little confusing.   Other than those minor things... the staff we nice and we really enjoyed our food.  I would recommend this to others.   4 Stars"}
{"text":"I always try and make a trip to Jean Philippe when I'm in Vegas - whether it is the one here or the one at Aria.  You don't even have to go to eat because the decor is so breathtaking.  This one has an amazing chocolate fountain that is the Guinness Record holder for tallest chocolate fountain.  The other other location has beautiful displays made out of deliciousness.  This time around, it was a chocolate dragon - get that? An entire dragon made out of chocolate!!  Anyways - their food may not be the cheapest but it is exceptional.  I've had the sandwiches which are great for lunch.  Their gelato is creamy and rich and one scoop for me just hits the spot, and is $3.25.  I can't even remember all of the different desserts I've had that are simply delectable.  Their coffee is also pretty decent.  I have yet to try their cakes though, which is definitely something I'm interested in.  It's also a fun place to get foodie souvenirs, they have delicious macarons and chocolates that you can give to anyone, as long as you don't stay outside in the Vegas heat for too long and they melt away...  Really, I have no complaints.  I could sit here and watch that TV all day that teaches me how to make chocolate ganache or fondant roses.  Til next time..."}
{"text":"The cocoa and cognac truffles were heavenly. I wish there was a store like this in L.A!"}
{"text":"Two words. NUTELLA BRIOCHE. The best dessert I've ever tasted hands down, a must try! I had breakfast here most of the time, just because it was so convenient and much cheaper than anywhere else in the resort. There was so many things to choose from, crepes, salads, sandwiches, gelato, pastries, etc. This place has your sweet tooth going!  VERY GOOD: mango gelato, cookies and cream gelato, vanilla gelato, NUTELLA BROCHE, tuna melt sandwich, crepes, breakfast sandwiches, french vanilla iced coffee, fresh orange juice  Not so good: the creme brulee, flan, raspberry rose cream macaroon -- these desserts take off a star for me. LOOKED soo good, tasted so not.  Everything is pricy BUT cheaper than any other places in the Aria Resort."}
{"text":"Headed over to JPP for a midday snack of one of their gorgeous desserts and an iced coffee. I almost couldn't decide on what I wanted...all the desserts looked so good. I ultimately decided on the triple chocolate. Typically I would shy away from such because it tends to be super rich, but it's delicate appearance was just calling to me. The dessert itself was light and fluffy, given that it was mostly mousse. The pastry bottom was a nice touch as was the nutty texture inside. Yum. Not to rich but definitely satisfying for my typically insatiable chocolate cravings!  They definitely charge a premium price for both but at least the dessert is pretty to look at...the coffee not so much, but it is a large serving so I guess I can't complain all too much except for the fact that there was absolutely no body to it."}
{"text":"Visited jean Phillippe at the Bellagio, wasn't very impressed. The chocolate fountains are beautiful. Bought the chocolate cheesecake pastry, was a little warm, maybe if it would have been a bit cooler could have tasted better. I would re-visit to try something new, more likely the Aria location next time."}
{"text":"We went here around midnight and there was a line that took a while for us to order. I got the lemon sorbet and it was nice and refreshing. They sell gelato, sorbet, chocolate, pastries and other things too."}
{"text":"Ordered rose macaroon cake, banana crepe and latte, all taste incredible !"}
{"text":"I love their iced coffee, it's definitely worth the drive for me. I got the light colored brew draft with vanilla flavoring and it was amazing. This coffee is definitely different from the rest in a good way. 10/10 :)"}
{"text":"To be fair, I only had one thing here. That one thing, turned out to be amazing and that was a nutella crepe with strawberries inside (((mouth begins to water))). I knocked off a star for the somewhat confusing layout (there are three separate lines) and you don't realize you're in the wrong one until you've already stood there and get to the front, only to be told you're in the wrong place. Great.  Since I wanted a crepe, they pointed in the opposite direction. So I jumped into yet another line and because of the layout, I wasn't sure if I was in the right place again (didn't see any crepes being made) so I ventured around the corner, saw crepe making and a register and stood there. And stood there, all the while being absolutely ignored. Finally, I asked if this is where I order and the unfriendly girl making crepes pointed to the line in which I previously stood. Kind of stupid since the menu can't be seen from the line so how would someone know what to order?? Based on a recommendation, I already knew what I wanted but had I not, that would have been frustrating. Seating can suck as well. That being said, the crepe was made fresh to order and was presented beautifully.  The display cases are gorgeous, packed full of every type of pastry and confection your heart (and hungover stomach) could possibly desire."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a while ago while staying at the Aria on business.  We had walked past the patisserie when headed up to our rooms and the brightness of the area along with the cakes really caught my eye. So the next morning whenever i was craving some coffee I decided to head down and get my fiancé and I each one.  Whenever I got down there I was able to see the multi tiered cakes up close and they were truly amazing!  It made me wonder how long it took to make them.  After a short wait I made it to the front of the line and ordered two Americanos only to watch them punch something into a machine and have it spot them out.  For the $10 it cost I was really hoping to have the barista take a minute and pull the shots.  The coffee itself was decent but not great.  The bottom line for me is that I would not head back here again in the future for coffee.  However I would definitely give it a try if I was looking for a baked good."}
{"text":"I had a class in the Bellagio conference center but they served a continental breakfast with no protein. I like to have some meat in the morning so I found myself waiting in line at JPP for some breakfast.   I didn't know what I wanted but the young lady behind the counter recommended the ham and cheese croissant sandwich.In the case, it didn't look appetizing but after they warmed it up.... It was serious. The croissant was crispy and flaky, the ham was good, oh but the cheese was a bechamel sauce so it was a cheesy white sauce. This sauce really made this breakfast sandwich.  I think I need to come back soon to have another one or try to replicate at home!"}
{"text":"Crepe's was good but not the best I had the cheese Danish was the boss"}
{"text":"Came here on a quest for gelato.  And I did get gelato (and some macaroons since they looked beautiful).  As somewhat of a gelato connoisseur, I was only so-so about Jean Philippe.  It was delicious, satisfied a craving, but did not live up to the hype, and not in my top 10 gelato.  I ultimately settled on a scoop of Creme Brûlée and one of Cookies and Cream (random craving).  The Creme Brûlée was similar to a tiramisu, with caramel sweetness and a little more cream than is typical of gelato (and therefore higher fat content than the usual 6-8%).  The Cookies and Cream was average vanilla gelato with cookie pieces swirled in.  If I were to go back, I would get the Creme Brûlée again but not the Cookies and Cream.  They have 20+ flavors at a time, so try a few until you find that delectable one you need to have."}
{"text":"I tried to eat ice cream and was here to visit.  It was also popular. I ate cappuccino ice cream, and it was unbelievably tasty.  The staff were very good and good.  We took pictures with the polar bear model dolls beside getting the ice cream from there, and I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I think trying the gelato for the first time warrants a re-review. Don't you?  After a visit to the fall exhibit at the Bellagio's Conservatory and Botanical Garden, I took a short stroll over to Jean Philippe Patisserie to check out their sweets and baked goods. The gelato is positioned front and center near the record-holding chocolate fountain. With the line not so long on a Monday evening, I decided that I had to try it.  Fortunately, it didn't cost an unheard-of exorbitant level of pricing even at a Strip hotspot. At $4.25 for a single scoop in a cup, $2 for every additional scoop (although one wonders how many scoops they can squeeze in), and extra for cones, you can surely budget for this selection of classic/safe flavors. I got in a sample of pistachio gelato before proceeding to order one scoop each of my go-to flavors, mango sorbet and hazelnut gelato.  The pistachio is that artificial almond-ridden stuff that resembles the cheap ice cream pistachio flavor, so I quickly forgot about it. The mango sorbet was nicely tart and rich in flavor, not too far off from the best flavored mango sorbets that I've had. However, it had way too many shards of ice crystals, suggesting some long-term storage issues that should not be present in a premium product. The hazelnut gelato was quite smooth aside from the untraditional but welcome chopped hazelnuts. Fortunately, that flavor was free of ice crystals. But perhaps the biggest issue is the gigantic gelato spoon that forces you to use just a corner or else plow through your dessert far too quickly. This has no place going with this dessert.  The almond croissant is still lovely, even the day after. Throw it in the oven for a few minutes if you want to restore the crunch or just enjoy the fluffiness and almond paste goodness alone. I also tried their palmier for the first time, which was also awesome and addictive. If you want flaky, buttery puff pastry with the right amount of sugar, this is the way to go.  So for those keeping score, it's a green light for baked goods at Jean Philippe Patisserie, and a yellow light for the gelato. Certain flavors will do in a pinch, but it's no must-go destination for gelato connoisseurs. As for cakes, chocolates, or crepes - maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Mmmm perfect spot for a cup of joe, breakfast, and dessert.  The pastries and crepes are yummy here.  The gelato are a bit to creamy for me but still good.  Ambience: open and bright  (Its like a cafeteria set up but in more of a trendy setting. Service: quick and efficient sometimes slow. Price: $$ Food and drinks: everything i had was good to me from the little cakes to the chocolate truffles in the case and the savory crepes.  Overall my fav place for brunch or dessert. I always make it a point to come here before my meetings."}
{"text":"I visited 4 patisseries (Jean Philippe, Amore, Bouchon and Payard) during my 4 day visit to Las Vegas and this one beat them all.  I tried 4 pastries and they were all wonderful:  The Carrot Cake (moist cake surrounded by a centimeter of coconut buttercream frosting, trimmed with white chocolate), Mille Feuille (perfect vanilla custard with puff pastry, topped with fresh raspberries), The Raspberry Macaron (Large parisian macaron filled with fresh raspberries and a custard with a hint of lavender--this one was a favorite) and finally the slice of flan (no, that's not the flan from Mexican restaurants, but rather perfect vanilla custard baked with a buttery crust--yum).   I also visited the Jean Philippe in the Bellagio.  They had the same pastries, but the presentation was not as attractive as the Aria's one.  The Aria's Jean Philippe makes you feel like a kid in a candy store.  My recommendation:  Buy one of everything and share with your companions so you can get a wonderful tour of their pastries!"}
{"text":"To die for nutella and strawberry crepe!  If you want to indulge in only one thing you must have this!  My husband who doesn't care for crepes said it was the best crepe he's ever had.  It was perfectly cooked and they didn't skimp on the nutella or strawberries. I can't wait to have one next time we're in town."}
{"text":"As we check into our hotel room at the Aria, we walk over to the guest elevators to go to our room and pass by the massive Jean Philippe Pah-tees-ree counters and I KNOW I'm in trouble over the next few days. Yeeeesh...  The pah-tees-ree offered a great selection of sweet and savory crepes at their crepe station! I love anything with bananas so I naturally got the bananas foster and asked them to add Nutella, which is such a wonderful combination of flavors!  The crepe was folded in a rectangular shape topped with the bananas foster, drizzled with Nutella and finished off with powdered sugar all over the top, along with a side of whipped cream!  It was everything I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth. A bit pricy for a crepe, especially with the additional charge for the Nutella which brought the pricetag for my badboy crepe to about $11! But definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"\"Feast. Taste. Enjoy the moment.\"  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a feast for the eyes --chocolate fountains, chocolate shoes, chocolate dragons...pastries and desserts in an abundance of hue and textures. Soak it all in. For a moment, nothing else in life really matters aside from deciding what will one have as a treat.  On this my 3rd trip, I decided on a white mocha and paired it with a raspberry tart. With the first bite, time paused --delight took over, the palette, the senses, and the experience. From the perfectness of the raspberry, to the balanced richness of the custard, to the buttery goodness of the cookie base, it was many moments in time until the last crumb was eaten that will be a joy forever.  Yes the space at this location with tables and chair stools are minimal and I would suggest taking the goodies in one of many comfy hotel seating close by the area windows but even the location with patrons milling around ordering their goodies did not in the least take away from the delight of the food.   So go, choose your heaven and enjoy it in your earthly corner now."}
{"text":"Excruciatingly long waits, always. Been there several times and there's never enough people working. I don't understand it. I counted a few groups of people who started to wait in line and then left after a few minutes. That's just a horrible business model to lose revenue from something that would be so easy to fix. One more employee would cut the wait time in half. Sell 3 chocolates in an hour and there's their wage. It pays for itself. Is it intentional? Like you think the food is so good that people would/should wait up to 15 minutes in some cases? Cuz it's not. It's pretty good, I won't lie, but not worth that."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I feel like a child in a candy store. I want to try everything my eyes lay sight on! This place is always poppin' any time of day whether it be breakfast time, lunch, dinner, or late night munchy time. I love JP's croissants, muffins, and crepes. Mmm mmm mmm! I always get a croissant with a cafe au lait to go along with a basic nutella crepe with some yummy fruit, if my tummy has the room of course. I like how they make the crepes right in front of you to 'ooh' and 'ahhh' at. Definitely a good place to pick up dessert."}
{"text":"I can't even explain how good my raspberry tart was))) it was probably one of the best deserts I've ever had!!! Well balanced, not too sweet, soft but with little crisp in it, fresh raspberries on top!!!!!! Mmmmmmmm)))) Cafe air lait was very nice as well))))"}
{"text":"Delicious freakin' crepes.  I don't think I need to say anything more but I will because I almost died when I had the crepes and gelato here. Yes, it was pretty damn good.  This place is always packed but no kidding right? It's Vegas and this one is located in the Bellagio. Perfect for me since we were staying at Vdara and I literally just walk down a pathway then BAM there it is!  Ooh so many creations to choose from. It took me at least 5 minutes to finally decide and even then I was having second thoughts. Everything just looked so tempting. I went with the Exotic combo with mango, pineapple and coconut gelato. The crepe was airy and sweet while the mango and pineapple had a perfect tart taste. And the coconut gelato just brought everything together heavenly. Every single bite was fantastic.  I also bought some chocolate coconut macaroons dipped in white chocolate. It was a nice treat to have back at the hotel.  My all time fave has always been pistachio gelato but coconut has made it to my top as well. Definitely a must to visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"When coffee machines don't exist at your hotel rooms, you are forced to buy coffee somewhere else like in the hotel restaurant or cafe. Most often, you end up with mediocre coffee. But I'm glad Aria forced me to buy coffee from Jean Philippe Patisserie because it was worth every penny, including their pastries and sandwiches. If you want to spend your meager gambling winnings ( less than $40), spend it here. Their almond croissant was buttery and almondy delicious.  Breakfast sandwich was full of hangover-friendly ingredients. Coffee was perfectly brewed and smooth. One thing which I regretfully did not get to try are their cakes and savory crepes. So gorgeously presented, it makes all the patisseries in NYC look bad. Why this joint is not located anywhere else outside of Vegas is definitely a puzzle for me."}
{"text":"Nice selection of chocolates baked goods and gelato. One pet peeve is the staff closes before posted hours and not very friendly. We arrived before midnight and they already blocked Off entrance and would not service customers . Bummer"}
{"text":"I got the caramalized bananas & nutella crepe for a little over $11 & the crepe was really delicious. It was really simple but the texture & taste was amazing.   Definately one of the best crepes I've ever had, however, the unhappy & grumpy staff makes the experience Not as pleasant.  Seriously, Bethany & the girl making the crepes at the front, WHY choose work that involves serving people all day/night if you are clearly miserable doing it? Honestly, is working there worth your happiness? Well, your words & actions clearly don't show it... The manager will definately be hearing from me."}
{"text":"I love stopping by this place when I'm visiting the strip. The coffee, almond croissant, and prosciutto sandwich are amazing. Prices are reasonable as well for the quality of the food.  The only downside is that there is always a huge line, so the servers end up being a bit inattentive."}
{"text":"In addition to the renowned chocolate fountains, the Jean Philippe Patisserie in The Bellagio has an assortment of sweets, ranging from gelatos to pastries to packaged gifts. They also have some savory items, including sandwiches.  You're literally a kid in a candy store.  I stopped by to get a sticky bun, but couldn't turn down the almond croissant, which is the size of a Nerf football.  The helpful server also recommended the Nutella donut and Nutella brioche, but I had to go with my instincts.  At $4+ a piece, they're certainly not cheap, but the quality can't be beat.  The croissant, in particular, is delicious. It's crispy, flaky, buttery, and full of sweet almond paste.   I spent about an hour working out the hotel gym just trying to burn it off.  But hell, it's Vegas. It's good to indulge once in awhile. Or, in my case, twice in one day."}
{"text":"We checked out the Aria hotel and Crystal mall at City Center and we ran across this this dessert pastry joint.   We tried the mango and berry sorbet. I found the sorbet to be quite good and they are generous when it comes to sampling different flavors.   Prices here are very fair here - two scoops for around five bucks and the quality is well worth it. They also have a large variety of pastries and crepes.   I definitely would return here for my sweet tooth fix."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my visit to Aria Hotel...Yes, it was pretty as well as pretty overwhelming - there's just so much to look at and choose from -  but I think they should have made a larger more roomy seating area. Everyone was packed in there like sardines!!! I know that this place is fancy and on the strip but I don't think that's an excuse to overcharge... Other than that the pastries I tried were all yummy: =Key Lime -  Lime Mousse filled with pieces of Mango(Love Mango) on a sugar cookie crust... =Blueberry Cheese- Blueberries and cheese baked together surrounded by a sweet brioche =Almond Madeline- Almond flavored Madeline (soft cookie) =Nutella Brioche- Sweet Brioche bread filled with Nutella =Cookies & Cream Gelato - I think that sums it up.. Yes, this is a yummy place!!!"}
{"text":"So, this entire place probably doesn't deserve a 4 star review but their GELATO is awesome. Having tasted gelato while in Italy I can say this is definitely the closet thing to real Italian gelato I've tried. My favorite is coconut. I've tasted gelato many other places. This comes closest to the real deal."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth's galore! Loved all the chocolate pumpkins they had on display, but my mind was focused on one thing, macarons! Picked up an espresso and pistachio, and they are tiny at $2 a piece. But they were perfect bites of heaven! Things are pricey here as I witnessed a little boy get a milkshake for $10 here!"}
{"text":"The desserts look very beautiful hair. The prices seem a little ridiculous to me...  We ended up paying $19 for 2 ice cream sundaes!  And when we came back, to give it another chance and order some pastries and coffee in the morning, I ended up paying $23 for 2 cups of coffee and a little pastry.  I don't think I would be complaining, it's a pastry and the coffee tasted as though it was worth that amount of money... But the mochas I received from Starbucks and Coffee Bean are actually more flavorful and the coffee I had here. The slice of pastry was good but not worth $5.  I don't think I would come back here. I would search out another place for pastries and coffee , or even an ice cream sundae."}
{"text":"The desserts here all looked very appetizing but for some reason, I wasn't too impressed by the ones that were recommended to us. I'm more of a dense cake/cup cake person as apposed to a cake that's made entirely of a chocolate/white chocolate shell and filled with creams or mouses. It ends up tasting too sweet and it doesn't seem to satisfy me unless there's actual cake or layers of something I can bite down into.  The hubby and I only ended up trying two desserts here, one was a chocolate, hazelnut mouse bomb and the other was a cheesecake, which at first I wasn't aware had not \"cheese\" filling but rather something airy and covered in white chocolate (which BTW, I don't care for white chocolate at all because it's not really chocolate.)  So anyway, the chocolate fountain on the other hand was very cool looking and it was a shame I couldn't try it. The crepe station did look more appetizing so I may try that next time we're in town.  Overall, it was too sweet and airy of a dessert for me and a bit too pricey at about $8 bucks a tarte/cake. But do try something here and maybe you might just end up liking it."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to get some breakfast, a snack, dessert, or coffee prior to checking out the Bellagio Gardens or going on a stroll on the Strip.  This is one of the few places on the Strip where you can get some good noms for under $10.  I've had croissants, gelato, and coffee here - all of which were great.  The iced coffee is strong and bold, just the way I like it!  The gelato is very creamy and not icy at all.  There are a good number of flavors, but not so overwhelmingly expansive.  You can also sample before you buy, which is very nice.  The pastries are about $4 and are very tasty and actually pretty large in size - definitely well-priced.  This bakery is very pretty (especially the chocolate fountain), is centrally located, is affordable, and of course makes delicious goodies.  What's not to love?  Definitely a must stop destination on a Vegas vacation!  I always get some goodies on my way out of Vegas for my journey home!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I headed here straight from the airport for breakfast. Lines were busy, but moving. Excellent food and especially great dessert."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my husband's birthday and it totally exceeded my expectations.  I ordered a custom cake on a Monday for that Friday and they got it done! I emailed back and forth with a gentleman named Duke and he was on point. I sent him a photo of the cake I wanted with some minor changes and it looked even better than I imagine.  More importantly, it tasted amazing. Vanilla cake with strawerry brulee and fresh strawberries. Everyone loved it!  I would recommend Jean Phillipe anytime you need a special occasion cake in Vegas.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Among all the other deliciousness here at Jean Philippe, the chocolate almond croissants are my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Although my boyfriend and I stayed at the Bellagio on our last Vegas trip... we never got to try this place out... even though we walked by it EVERY day during our stay. How LAME are we?! Absolute epic FAIL! I promised myself during my girls trip that I'd come back and give it a try. Brought my girlfriend here while we had a pit stop after shopping and got some gelato... well, I got some gelato AND a chocolate covered strawberry. :) The chocolate covered strawberry is your average strawberry and nothing to rave about... I just LOVE white chocolate and I just LOVE strawberries. Nuff said. I got the vanilla gelato and the espresso gelato. O M G soooooooo delicious!!! Just a perfect balance of flavors and absolutely pleasing! I was so sad that my boyfriend couldn't be there with me lol! It's pricey... but worth it! I wanted to try a crepe but wasn't in the mood at that moment. They also have the chocolate fountain which is beautiful. Wish I could open the glass and just have a cup of white chocolate lol. This place is ALWAYS busy so be patient and take your time looking around because they have awesome gifts to bring back home!"}
{"text":"Oh, Jean Phillippe Patisserie! How I love you. I went more than once to this location while I was in Vegas.  We had delicious crepes and a coffee for a mid-day pick me up! Each visit we tried a different flavor on our crepes. We ended up splitting so much I can't even remember all the kinds we had. They are presented beautifully, and taste delicious. The gelato is also absolutely delish.  Had a good sized line each time we went, but it was okay because there are so many pretty cakes, massive chocolate fountains, and other assorted goodies to look at... you'll be easily distracted while you wait.  Can't wait to pop in again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Come for: croissant and almond croissant Skip: the long lines  There's a reason the line is so long. They serve good pastries here! Their croissants are delish! Hope I can come back to try more things like their chocolate éclairs, the legit kind with the chocolate crème pâtissière, not the whip cream you see fake French bakeries put in theirs. Heard good things about their gelato too."}
{"text":"This place is great! Came here twice in my 2 days that I was in Vegas. I had gelato the first day (hazelnut) and it was really good. Not the best, but definitely one of the better ones in the states. 2 days later I came back for brunch and I got the croissant which was amazing, so crisp and fluffy at the same time. I also got a sugar crepe with strawberries, whipped cream, gelato and chocolate sauce. mmmmm sooo good. I walked by the Jean Phillippe at the ARia and I loved the chocolate dragon display. This location wasn't as big or as well decorated but the food was still really good."}
{"text":"As I was staying in the Bellagio, Jean Philippe was easy to locate and hard to miss. Before heading out for meetings in the morning, I grabbed a veggie quiche and iced mocha for breakfast and returned the same day with a colleague to grab the frappe as an afternoon treat. The lines are long so be prepared to wait 15+ minutes but the quality of the food is worth it. Moreover, some may consider the prices to be high but the ingredients and quality are differentiated from other options.   I enjoyed the option to drop by throughout the day while staying in the hotel and the chocolate fountain is a picture opportunity in and of itself."}
{"text":"i haven't yet tried this place yet but the look of this chocolate store already beats it. i love how half the store sells sweets that are ranging from 5 to 12 bucks for a tart or chocolate dessert.   the other half of the store had salads and sandwiches which i do see a lot of people get in line for and eat inside with very limited and few tables only. the salads and sandwiches are probably ranging from 15 to 20 bucks easily.   the environment is a wow, the display case of chocolate fountain from the ceiling is about 4000 pounds of chocolate. its a must see and wow."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of baked goods and pastries.  Prices are affordable and the quality is great.  Everything we had was simply delish!"}
{"text":"This JPP in the Aria lobby confusingly has multiple counters, but our purchase of the chocolate-heavy Imperial was worth the wait, rich and enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you come here to eat savory food, you're crazy...  It's a dessert place...plain and simple.    Coconut gelato: a must-try; the triple chocolate cupcake was tasty as well.   Chocolate indulgence or insanity, whatever it was called: was SUPER rich and decadent but very tasty as well.    Key Lime Pie: had the right amount of tartness, though I prefer it to be a touch less sweet (I'm not a big sweets hoarder)  Red velvet cupcake:...meh, I've had better.  The cake portion was lacking.  Get anything creme brulee that they make...their custards are super silky.    The chocolate croissant was excellent.  Very flaky and delicious.  We actually got it for the next morning and nuked it, and it still came out delicious.  Big thumbs up on that.  I've come here twice, and I always end up getting a plethora of desserts to share.  It's really the best way to experience a variety without breaking the bank or feeling like you're a lonely, depressed, geriatric with a sweet tooth.    Solid overall...always a must-go everytime I hit up Vegas.  I especially like the Bellagio location because of the fun decor.  The one knock is that the ordering system can get a bit confusing and weird at times because there's 2 lines (sometimes 3), and it's at random and no real direction.    Also, they tend to run out of stuff very quickly, so go early for the best sampling."}
{"text":"Strong sweets. Artfully packaged for the gifts to bring home. Were lucky enough to visit in December, 2016 - Grinch alert!!  Beautiful decor.  The caramels were out of this world!  The other fancy chocolates, both milk and dark, were tasty and made a big impression with the family that received. Truffles were good.  Would like to try more of their fancied up candies. Bring your Platinum card!"}
{"text":"Oh my word. My mouth waters when I think of this place. Dessert heaven.  Every morning I'd have their plain sugared brioche with an OJ. Simple but simply delish. Pretty much every dessert or chocolate or macaroon I tried was wonderful. I only tried one candy that I didn't care for (they were white chocolate covered pistachios and I bought them for the hubs - underwhelming, but they looked pretty!)!"}
{"text":"I got a Chai Tea (out of a box that looked similar to Trader Joes) and a Croque Monsieur and it had a fantastic melty cheese. I also got a Almond Brioche, Almond Croissant, and Cheese Danish that were all done very well.   They were not overly reliant on sugar to deliver flavor, they were well executed treats for breakfast. I definitely recommend coming here for a lighter meal or a little treat."}
{"text":"After walking by the shop and being mesmerized by the chocolate fountain, we had to stop by for pastries and coffee. We had the cheese Danish and the almond croissant. The cheese Danish was great! I've had better almond croissants so I would pass on that next time."}
{"text":"If you never been to Jean Paul's than you are missing out. Just looking at all of their desserts makes me happy. It is literally like being a kid in a candy shop. You want to try a bite of everything, but of course I didn't but only if...  I had the napoleon as it reminds me of being a child and walking to our local bakery to get a delicious flakey napoleon. It was delicious!!!  If you don't go for the desserts you have to at least checkout the chocolate fountain.  It reminds me of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. You will be in awe, and want to be like Augustus Gloop drinking chocolate right out of the fountain."}
{"text":"It's a little on the lower side of ratings. Maybe less than three stars.   I thought lemon would be great and mango would be horrible, but it was quite the opposite.  Consistency: can lack, not overall smooth (for both flavors)  Lemon: bitter as hell  Mango: delicious  Price point: Kind of cheap for what I got  Scoop size: your second scoop is smaller, kind of meh.  People in my group liked this place, I've had better.   -  I don't like how they bill you in a restaurant tab though, kind of annoying in hassle way, kind of absurd. (this does not reflect my rating)."}
{"text":"The record-holding largest chocolate fountain was a let down. I guess the exaggerated scale of Las Vegas made me expect something on the scale of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory - not something that seemed more like a cascading Champagne pyramid.  The Aria store doesn't have a fountain, but is the better location because they sell more stuff. The Bellagio venue has a patisserie and ice cream, but doesn't have those delicious chocolates (unless you buy them in a pre-selected and pre-packaged box). It also felt cramped, sloppy, and unorganized. Keep in mind, Aria is only a monorail ride way."}
{"text":"A true patisserie is generally focused on the obvious pastry, but they offer much more than just wonderful sugary delights. The setup is confusing because there are two lines to buy the many foods.  Order the following at the straight display case on the right: + Bakery (5 out of 5 stars): DO NOT SKIP THE PASTRIES. Easily tempted to order the many cakes and tarts, don't miss the heart-shaped palmier which had fantastic qualities like crisp, flaky, buttery, sweet, and sticky. The palmier was perfection and is sometimes sold as small cookies in pre-packaged containers. The Nutella beignet was an exquisitely flavored doughnut sandwich dusted with sugar. The apple brioche beautifully contrasted the firm bready exterior with the almost creamy interior. The sticky bun was topped with wonderful nuts, but needed more cinnamon. The chocolate croissant was good, but could have been sweeter. + Take-Out (3 out of 4 stars): Pre-made foods like quiche, fruit and salad bowls, and sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich was juicy and contrasted by the acidic tomatoes and red onions. The ham and cheese sandwich nicely combined the mini baguette and Dijon mustard. + Coffee: Sorry, but I don't drink coffee.  Order the following at the round display case on the left: + Chocolate (4 out of 5 stars): I've tried six different bon bons. All were smooth, delectable, and focused on the feature flavor. They were small so buy twice as many than normal. + Omelet and Crepe Station (2 out of 5 stars): With both sweet and savory crepes, I'd avoid the savory crepe because they use an odd buckwheat batter. With ham, too many sautéed mushrooms, and not enough Swiss cheese, the \"Forest Crepe\" was weird due to a spicy aioli. As if the crepe batter didn't already have enough egg, a fried egg was on top. Maybe my hangover made me imagine this bizarre crepe.  Yelp reviews misstate that the largest chocolate fountain is here when it is at the Bellagio (see www.yelp.com/biz/bellagio-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens-las-vegas). Also, roughly a third of the photos posted here are the Bellagio location."}
{"text":"This place was good, but didn't knock my socks off. The pastries are gorgeous. I had a raspberry tart and it was lovely, but the flavor wasn't all that astounding. The way this place is hyped up, you think you are in for something out of this world. Gelato was fine but no better or worse than gelato anywhere else. Chocolate fountain was ok but it's not as though you can dip anything in it and eat it. You just look at it. It's behind glass."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to say that I'm a HUGE dessert fanatic and I absolutely LOVED this place!! When I saw the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the dripping chocolate...and I was immediately attracted. When I saw all the crepes, cakes, and other desserts that they had...I was hooked and had to try something out.   I came here 3 times with my friend on my 3 day Vegas trip. Yes, once everyday. I tried their chocolate crepe with rum raisin gelato (added extra), which tasted amazinggg. It was the best crepe that I have ever had...and I've had many types of crepes before in my life. I also came back just to try their gelato, which tasted more like ice cream than gelato, but it was still really good. I also got their rose petal raspberry macaron, which tasted like heaven. They have such a huge selection of cakes and pastries, but if you come here, you MUST try their crepes!  Even if you're not hungry, just walking into the restaurant and checking the place out is a treat too because they've got so many cool designs of cakes...even ones looking like the louis vuitton suitcases! The servers were also pretty friendly, and the stuff they use for the plates are also very nice looking.  Overall, one of the best dessert places I've been to and I'd DEFINITELY come back the next time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"One stop shop for all your dessert desires.  Chocolate, pastries, gelato, crepe...This place has it all and it's soooo good.  Definitely try the crepes and the pecan cinamon roll.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Carrot cheese cake!!!  Since Amore' Patisseries is closed today, we came to JP for breakfast. An order of a prociutto panini, a butter croissant, a carrot cheese cake and a opera cake.  One happy camper!!!  =)"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is a great place to grab a quick pastry, coffee, or have a casual breakfast.  While the Bellagio location isn't as welcoming or beautiful as the Aria location, the food is just as good and the service is great!  The pastries are great, the crepes are fantastic (both sweet and savory) and the selection of dry goods has something for everyone!  I don't get the infatuation folks have with the chocolate fountain---its just a bunch of dripping chocolate.  Much more impressive are the wedding cakes displayed around the shop."}
{"text":"Sans doute la meilleure boulangerie de Las Vegas ;)  Je vous conseille les pains au chocolat, le mille-feuille et les crêpes !"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this amazing little shop quite by accident as we were exploring the Bellagio. And when we found it...we sure were glad that we had skipped dessert at dinner.   Jean Philippe's is a feast for the eyes first. A beautiful glass fountain drizzling white, milk, and dark chocolate cascades stepwise overhead. A mannequin wearing a chocolate dress stands in the center of the patisserie, and breathtaking multi-layered cakes line the walls.  The pastry cases hold smaller marvels. We chose a trio with creme brulee, a raspberry macaron, and a cake pop that tasted like a gourmet snickers bar. To top it all off, the plate that the trio was served on was made of chocolate. Absolutely top notch!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place when I was in Vegas. There is a pretty amazing chocolate fountain behind glass. It is a small location with only a few seats. I got a dessert to enjoy there and an almond croissant for later. It was very yummy!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and super flaky crossiants and buttery brioches. I'm a fan. Crepes are also very good so is the coffee. They use very high quality ingredients in everything well worth the price and a visit. I've liked everything I tried.  Crossiant: Very buttery and flaky.  Sugar Brioche: Love the crunchy top and the softness of a sweet roll  Souffle Crepe: Very eggy tasting crepe and lightly sweetened fluffy souffle.  Coffee: Better than Starbucks on the strip  Breakfast sandwich: Very tasty eggy goodness. Egg is still runny and not over cooked like usual breakfast sandwiches you get.   Cons: Very expensive but it's on the strip what do you expect. There needs to be more stores like this."}
{"text":"Still very tasty and same as other location. Love the display of the chocolate dragon. Best bakery on the strip.  Tried the chocolate chip gelato very creamy and milky with the right crunch of their signature chocolate."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain out front is what captured my attention and lead me into the shop.  We originally came here just to get a breakfast crepe before our flight back home,.. it was pretty decent and tasted a lot healthier than all the other meals I had during my trip in Vegas.  But there is one thing that I know will keep me coming back and for me to reward this place 5stars.. the cheesecake,.   it was a thin layer of cream wrapped around a cheesecake creamy goo,.. that just melted in my mouth,.. mmmmmm,.. did that even make sense?! HAHA  I will be back cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"After waiting 40 minutes on a Monday morning to get through the line, I expected what was advertised - a world-class patisserie - and got nothing of the sort. My needs were simple and I ordered a cheese Danish and some coffee. I think I would have been happy if the Danish had been at least room temperature, but it was very cold, as if it had been sitting in a refrigerator for a couple of hours. Even Starbucks offers to warm up your pastries, so I'm left with the sad realization that I wasted my last morning in Vegas, spent twice as much, and waited six times as long as I would have if I had gone to any average coffee shop."}
{"text":"Holy crap! Make sure you come right when they open or else there will be NOTHING left for you to try or even LOOK at. I was craving something sweet and saw that this little dessert café was on my must-do-list when in Vegas. The pictures on the website and images posted by pinners on Pinterest have made this little café so indulging and amazing that I had to at least smell the place! It was easy to find (to the left-hand side of the garden) when looking at the garden with the parking garage on the left (I believe).   Please make note that you MUST force yourself through the hordes of tourists that are blocking the entire entryway. You seriously feel like a celebrity due to the amount of flashing going on and how much they are yelling at you in multiple different languages trying to get you out of their pictures. But as the typical American I am, I stood and ordered my food which made them super angry.   The establishment should at least have someone maneuvering tourists around so that we CUSTOMERS who want or WOULD like to purchase something can. Seriously I could have flipped out on multiple people but I had coconut gelato on my mind helping me to stay calm! My boyfriend ordered a crepe and also a chicken sandwich, both were great but nothing compared to the gelato. I was super sad and disappointed that we were unable to try any of their premade tiny soufflés or desserts. That's the entire reason why we went but like U said make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"Over priced, way over priced. Don't know why folks are willing to pay so much for such mediocre food"}
{"text":"The mint chocolate chip gelato is so delicious. So delicious that my friend and I stopped by twice for it during our 3 day stay in Vegas. At first glance it's a bit pricey at $5 a scoop, but really that one scoop can feed two people because we ended up splitting it both times and it was more than enough. This will definitely be one of my go-to dessert places next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok wow. I love Jean Philippe and I did not know he had a location here. This is amazing. Fresh made and with the largest chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"Tried the souffle crepe here.. it was pretty good!  Good chocolate. It was a better than average crepe.  The whipped cream however, was very mediocre.  The chocolate sauce used wasn't the best I've ever had. I'd rate the chocolate a 4.  My friend also tried it, but she though it was more on the mediocre side. They don't have chocolate fondue here.  They don't have chocolate fondant here. The best chocolate shops always have something to wow me... just crepes, gelato, coffee, smoothies, milkshakes..  nothing you won't find elsewhere in America.    They do have bottles you can buy to MAKE chocolate fondue yourself.. but for the lazy there aren't any options."}
{"text":"Tried 2 desserts.  The Snickers cake is really great, very rich.  The pumpkin tart was very good too but go for the cake!   Minus 1 star for price, $15 total :("}
{"text":"Definitely a feast of the eyes and taste buds!!! The Aria location is just like nothing you have ever seen. Delicious chocolates, desserts, crepes and paninis... I will come back and try every single one they have... This is what you call love.... xoxo"}
{"text":"If i had to choose a place for dessert crepe..i'd choose you jean philippe ! the nutella one is my fav...we also ordered chocolate..which was good but not as amazing as nutella cause you know i loveee nutella!"}
{"text":"This cafe has a playful ambience and courteous staff. Both the sweet treats and the coffees always delight! Make sure and drop by to see the decorative displays as well as the chocolate fountains. You'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The chocolate waterfall is something of a photo-op for tourists. I enjoy their nutella crepe with added banana slices... yummm just thinking about it!   Last time I went here a friend was looking for something more savory so she ordered and we shared the turkey croissant. Sad to say they just pull their sandwiches out of a fridge but I must say I enjoyed it. The croissant was buttery and flakey and all things it should be :)   Of course prices are a bit high due to its location in a fabulous casino right on the strip.   Last but not least there is not much seating so first come first serve."}
{"text":"i always come here once on every vegas trip...it's become a tradition. my favorite has to be the royal crepe (grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese) it's so creamy and delicious! prices are a bit high, but hey you're in vegas...and you're at the bellagio it's expected.   the lines can get a little crazy i was here last weekend and i waited 20 minutes for my crepe -_- i didn't think it was worth it til i had my first bite and remembered why i suffer though this line all the time lol   highly recommended if you want a quick bite to eat or craving a luscious dessert.   oh yea...they're also known as having the \"worlds largest chocolate fountain\" lol"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie, you have stolen my heart.  My cousin was in town and was staying here at the Aria and with the baby in tow, Jean Philippe was the best bet for the three of us. In fact we liked it sooooooo much for breakfast that we came back for lunch.  For breakfast we split the smoked salmon bagel and a couple of sweet treats. Smoked salmon was UH-MAZING....thinking about it makes my mouth water now. We came back for lunch and I had gotten a turkey sandwich. Croissant was flakey on the outside but melt in your mouth goodness on the inside. I also got a pain au chocolat to go and a chocolate cupcake for the hubby. Food was really good and I thought the pricing was semi resonable for the sweets. The line looks long, but they have a system that works.   This place is definitely one of the cheaper finds that you will find in City Center. I will definitely be back if I'm there."}
{"text":"The opera, creme bulee, coconut truffles, etc. are just a few of the items I splurged in purchasing because I won a gift certificate to this magical place. I am not a huge dessert person but I could buy just about anything from here and be very happy with my purchase."}
{"text":"This place has the prettiest desserts.  I had to pass by it every time I was going up to my room in the Aria.  DANGEROUS!!  We did end up getting some desserts and it was very yummy.  However, this review is only to point out that the TUNA PANINI is extremely delicious.  The bread it was on was the perfect thickness and crunch.  The tuna melted with the cheese ever so perfectly.  I scarfed this down like there was no tomorrow.  This is not the typical flat panini one would imagine.  It's more just like a sandwich with french bread.  Really good though.  High recommend this sandwich to anyone."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW!!  Jean Phillipes is my new must have whenever we go to Vegas!!  The service was quick and kind even with the long lines during breakfast hours.  But the presentation of the pastries and shop attract you in. The arteries and treats all look amazing and they taste even better!!    I only got to try a few truffles, opera cake and fruit tart, all incredible. I wish u could have tried the cupcakes and Nutella filled muffins, next time for sure though.  The location at Bellagio looks amazing and has giant chocolate fountains at the entrance!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten at a place and thought...wow why have I not tried this before?! Well thats the exact feeling I had the first time I came here several years ago. I make sure to stop by every single vegas trip (which is quite often). The desserts are amazing!! The cheesecakes are my favorite for sure. Both the raspberry and chocolate ones are out of this world. The staff is very friendly too! Trust me you will not regret coming here (besides maybe the weight gain after becoming addicted). There are some of the best desserts Ive ever had and I am a frequent traveler!"}
{"text":"OMG so where do I begin?! This bakery is more delicious than words could describe. I love the tropical smoothie and the raspberry cheesecake. They are like heaven on earth. Every Vegas trip I try to stop by and get them. I am an Mlife Gold member so I frequent Vegas often. This is one of the highlights of every one of my trips."}
{"text":"Everything looked scrumptious. The chocolate fountain was interesting. The decor was very appropriate. They had every kind of deserts one could think of, incorporated even on the Gelato. We had the deulce de Leche, and Tiramisu, long and behold, the Gelato had actual Tiramisu inside, and the deulce de Leche of course the thick Leche. Both very good. Although I myself preferred  the Tiramisu better as it wasn't as sweet as the other"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food is probably worth 5 stars.   The chocolate was great as expected. For 2.25 a piece, they better be. I had the Gringo (dark chocolate coffee with caramel), Chiquita (banana, milk chocolate), and Earl Grey. All were smooth and tasted exactly as they were made to be tasted.   I also had their Cafe Latte and Americano. Great coffees. Very pricey. About 6 dollars for a small of each.   Here's where the bad part comes in: the service. The cashiers are EXTREMELY rude. Yes, I get that you must be tired and whatnot, but this is your job. I'm a waitress and I know how shitty food service is, but it really isn't that hard to smile and hand food out behind a counter. One female cashier was just yelling at people that the line was whatever way... The store layout is straight up terrible. Very confusing and MADE to make people look like idiots. Not the customer's faults.   Great food without the service to match."}
{"text":"Had their hazelnut & cream brulee gelato....it's just ok...nothing fancy....but the nutella Mille is really good very creamy and not too sweet..the service was ok..they are not busy there was no line but the waitress is trying to rush me out and put the take out bag too close to my Mille so the cream get on the bag...had to ask her twice to get me a new bag...and she puts the clean bag inside the bag that's dirty....really??! You can't just change the bag for me? And why are you giving me a dessert that touches the bag...?"}
{"text":"How can you not pass by here and not get anything? Been going here since they opened. Always trying many different things. Prices are pretty decent. You have to try their macaroons, crepes and chocolate coved strawberries. They have other desserts that are good too. Many gift items to buy as well for friends or family. Service is always good. I just wish they gave samples! Hehe that would have topped it off for me to give 5 stars! =)"}
{"text":"At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA Creme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!"}
{"text":"This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy! There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it!   One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled \"French macarons\".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having \"fat liver\" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!"}
{"text":"I was at this establishment earlier today and although the pastries are good the service was awful.  I can go to Fred's Bakery and get the same taste and better service and less money."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here one morning. Jean Philippe Patisserie is located inside the Aria Hotel & Casino.  Ordered the Quiche Lorraine, a small cup of coffee, and a bottle of water. The place was very busy, so it took about 7 minutes after ordering to receive my food.  The Quiche had good flavor. Unfortunately, it was only luke warm. It would have been much better if the food were actually hot.  They offer a lot of baked good options for breakfast, as well as a few breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype! Long lines, one cashier. Unfriendly service, no smiles, no greetings.  I ordered the flan- bland, thick flour based like jello pudding in a box. Also got pecan sticky bun- meh!"}
{"text":"One of the best patisseries in Vegas and known for their not overly sweet desserts. This is definitely comparable to a Parisian patisserie. Conveniently located on the ground floor of the Aria, it is easy to find even for non-hotel guests.  The line gets really long specially if there is a huge conference but it moves fast.  But this gives you time to look and take pictures of creative cakes and pastries."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my bf since we were starving and had an hour to kill between a wedding and the reception. The salad we got was bomb dignity. I don't even remember what it was, but it had vinagrette dressing, and was absolutely delicious with nice chunks of meat in there.   I was super stoked about their croissant, but thought it was average. I can't speak for the desserts since I didn't get to try them yet. Next time!"}
{"text":"They look good and they taste even better! ^_^bbbbb If I have 5 thumbs they would all be up. But, I settle with the stars.   If you treck to the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas, and enjoy the indoor garden/green house that grace the big hall next to the lobby, venture in a little bit further. Behind the green garden there is a small garden of indulgence. Jean-Phillipe Patisserie. ( I believe he is the head chocolatier for Bellagio) Well, the place is spectacular and filled with goodies dripping from its wall and ceiling. Literally. :)  My favorite indulgence there is the gelato. It is pricey, but so worth it. I mean, hey, you are in a fancy place, you gotta expect to pay a fancy price. At least it's fancifully good too ~.^  What is your mood? Something light and refreshing? Something soury to perk you up? Something with umph and rich? fruity? etc etc. You gotta taste them and make your pick. My last venture was for Tiramisu and Rum Raisin. *drool* Perfect combo. My sister chose strawberry and chocolate. The chocolate gelato is dark and rich and taste more chocolatey than a chocolate colored frozen sugar. That, my fellow yelpers, is how chocolate ice cream or gelato supposed to taste like.  In the Summer I would usually go for the fruity sorbet type, like mango, coconut, lemon. They perk you and chill your body as you stroll out into the hot summer of Las Vegas.  The place opens late and will fulfill your sweetest indulgence from something cold, something warm, something hot and something crunchy. Cakes, Pastries, Chocolates, Candies, Crepes, Gelato. You name it. They opens pretty late and starts early in the day (in case you play hard and forgot the time of day and realize you need *ehm* breakfast. Get your savory crepe, or salad, or sandwich, and a cup of hot chocolate ^_^"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Rude staff, mediocre ice cream.  Any gelato place in Italy is lightyears better."}
{"text":"The huge chocolate fountain was what caught my attention. The environment, service, and great coffee gave this place a 5 star review. Definitely a must stop by place in vegas!"}
{"text":"Sweet paradise. Very cute location in the Aria with a small area to sit and enjoy your treat. There can be a bit of a wait for crepes, but it is well worth it! They have perfected their batter and the crepes are very light and fluffy. There is also a wide dessert selection. I recommend anything chocolate, their chocolates are perfectly balanced. My favorite dessert was the chocolate imperial. If you're on the strip it is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The store is amazing and the chocolate fountain is awesome. This review is for the customer service.  I have never been here before and asked the cashier \"how sweet are your iced mochas?\" The response \"well it's chocolate.\" Great! I know that. Are we talking one pump? Two pumps? Am I going to walk away diabetic?!   I know you are hating your life as every child in Vegas wants a gelato but for those of us who want coffee, AND don't want to drink a milkshake, put on a smile and pretend to give a sh*t about customer service.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were tempted by the gelato as we walked through the hotel. So we stopped and tried the coconut and dulce de leche flavors. Both were excellent in their own ways. The coconut had flakes of coconut throughout. The dulce de leche was salted caramel goodness. Prices were reasonable and cheaper than a few other places we saw around. Service was quick. My only complaint was the lack of flavors they had compared to other places we saw on the strip. Maybe they ran out by 3 in the afternoon?"}
{"text":"Very enticing little sweet shop within the Bellagio hotel.  Its most prominent feature is their floor to ceiling, multi-tiered, sinuous chocolate fountain.   You just want to slide your head under and drink chocolate all day!  The shop is NOT within the main area of Bellagios shops and dining.  Rather, it is nestled in the walkway toward the meeting rooms and Salon/Tower Rooms.   Just follow the signs toward those areas and you won't miss it.  There are two walls of appealingly packaged chocolate delights to purchase as gifts -- or to feast on in the privacy of your room's closet! --  while the central area is more bakery/cafe style order and pay.  There is no seating within the store but a lounge area with tables and chairs are directly outside for people watching.  I ordered the following individually packaged items (prices are approximate):  Brownie ($3.50) - oval shaped, moist, light brownie with chocolate chips.  Not overly dense or oily.  If you like chewy brownies, this isn't it, but for a light brownie it had great mouth-feel.  Chocolate Coconut macaroon dipped in white chocolate ($3.50) - moist and dense with flakes of coconut.  This is NOT a purely coconut macaroon, instead it is more of a chocolate brownie with lots of coconut.   I liked it but not sure I would buy over and over again.  Double Chocolate cookie ($3.25) - terrible.  This cookie was obviously made a couple days ago and never removed from circulation.   The cookie was hard and dry.   I went back the following morning and exchanged it for something else.   Management wasn't happy about it but was kind enough to oblige.     Fruit Cups ($8.50) - ok, I know this is not a bakery item but I was impressed with them.  Pineapple, cantaloupe, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries were in good shape (neither over nor under ripe) and sweet.   Now, to have fruit like this in February is a treat!  Ordered it two days in a row and felt less guilty after eating all my insulin spiking treats!  Overall, a fun place to stop and peek if you enjoy the visual appeal of chocolate shops, but the quality of the baked goods is more typical rather than top notch."}
{"text":"I hate to give one star but the chocolates here had too much junk in them. I would not recommend these to anyone. Maybe just go the Hershey store and save your money since this stuff isn't clean and very overpriced."}
{"text":"Tasty desserts and beautiful arrangements.  It well deserves its 6.00 to 6.50 price range.  Nothing better than great looking products from the outside and further proved itself with what's on the inside.  Love the show pieces, especially the chocolate ones, very creative."}
{"text":"Price: Expensive for pastries but worth it  Food: I had the chocolate crepe, exotic crepe, a sandwich, and ice cream. Everything was delicious. Super delicious and top of the line ingredients. There was a long line for the food but what do you expect from a super good pastry shop. Everything I got was really good, fresh, mouth watery and overall amazing.   Overall: I would recommend you stop at this patisserie when you are in Vegas. Everything on the menu is delicious and so so good. Its nice to splurge on yummy-ness while in Vegas."}
{"text":"- Large, savory crepes made fresh in front of you. We had the \"Salmon Crepe $11.95\" and thought it had too much sauce  - Unlike the Bellagio Location, this cafe has a decent sized dining area and condiments as well - Knowing how difficult it is to find water fountains in Vegas...They sell hot water for $1/cup and tap water for $0.75/cup...  - Beautiful gelato display. I watched as people sampled as much flavors as they desired."}
{"text":"Service quality has dropped horribly. No one smiles and everyone looks like that customers owe their money and it's our privilege to buy pastry here. The line-starting sign is EXTREMELY confusing - at least 3 people jumped the line ahead of me. The place changed its name a few days ago and the quality went with its old name."}
{"text":"Last breakfast before leaving Vegas and I had to try a pastry at Jean Philippe.  Almond croissant was best croissant of any kind I've ever eaten.  Flakey, crispy, creamy almond paste and toasted almonds.  Perfection."}
{"text":"I miss the gelato I ate all summer in Europe.. this gelato hit the spot! Merci Jean Phillippe..  I will say that it was incredible busy but definitely worth it! And the decorations were amazing"}
{"text":"If I could, I would rate this as 3 1/2 stars.  This Jean Phillipe (Aria casino area) is larger than the one in the Bellagio. They have separate crepe and chocolate areas, along with the main area with the pastries and sandwiches. We got the raspberry macaron, fruit tart and an orange juice. Each pastry was pretty good, although it was a little pricey (over 20.00 for the three items before."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, my girlfriends that got there earlier told the rest of us about a crepe place in the Aria.  I'm such a huge fan of crepes that I had to try it.  I ended up going there in the early morning before my flight.  It was ambitious as I was pushing it a little with the timing.  Luckily the Aria hotel was not too far from the Hilton where I was staying so walking was not too long.  It did take awhile to order and get my crepe but the cashier did ask me if a 10-15 minute wait for the crepe would be too long.   I did order the veggie savory crepe and did enjoy it but felt rushed trying to eat it.  I would definitely want to try one of the sweet crepes to see how those are also.   JPP also does have other items on their menu like pastries, salads, coffee, etc,.. so plenty of items to choose from. They are limited with seats but it wasn't a problem finding a seat.   Since the Aria hotel is non-smoking it definitely helps in that you don't taste smoke while eating as the place is not closed off and right next to the tables."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to for delicious food and desserts whenever I'm in Vegas.    We always order our usual favorites:  ---EXOTIC CREPE with COCONUT ICE CREAM (forgot the price- but this crepe is the best)  ---TURKEY CROISSANT $11.95 ---CHICKEN BASIL PANINI $11.95 ---CREAM CHEESE DANISH $4.25    All I can say is when you're in Vegas I don't mind spending a lot of money for good food.    Yes the prices here are pricy for a sandwich and desserts, but they're always delicious.    Plus you're in Vegas so who cares about the damn price.  Just enjoy and indulge in the good food and yummie crepe while having a great time in Vegas! :)."}
{"text":"I noticed the lovely lady made with care in this place while walking in the Bellagio. This work of art attracts many people to take pics or stop in. They have a chocolate fountain too! Yay!   I tried the croissant and it was good. Flaky and delicious. I stopped in around 10:00 am on a Thursday and the line was short. I wish I tried their desserts, until next time...."}
{"text":"Such a fun place ... World record chocolate foundation and great pastries, chocolate and confections.   Raspberry macaroons were the best I've had probably with fresh raspberries, homemade marshmallows very tasty and the dark chocolate was also great.  The cheesecake pops and creme brûlée also got rave reviews.   A bit pricey but that's not a surprise."}
{"text":"As a french woman I can say it's the perfect \"french patisserie\". Everything is really tasty and good. Not to expensive. There is one store at the Aria hotel and one to the Belagio."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had. Their desserts will hook you as well. The nuttella Brioche is my guilty pleasure, but if you want to be more indulgent, try one of their small artisan cakes. It's like eating art!"}
{"text":"When I walk pass by.... WOW! Beautiful cake decoration! I can't resist to stop & check out the store... and of course take lots of pictures!!  Checking out the prices for the merchandise they are selling... kind of pricey. Maybe because it is the pastry shop in the hotel."}
{"text":"What a busy cafe/bakery!!  LOVE the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain~ What a beautiful design!!   Always crowded but it is fun to wain in line and check out the merchandise or pastries.   A little bit pricey... but it is in a such a beautiful hotel, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Long lines always. And your noir card doesnt work here! Breakfast sandwhich for scott. coffee and my favorite here buttery flaky Crossiants! Everything is soooo visually overwhelming!! You want to order all of it!! And everything is delicious!! I love the roast beef sandwhich, the curry chicken sandwhich. The desserts are all very delicious but rich. They have fresh squeezed juice and the coffee is pure heaven. The crepes are also delicious. My boys love the dessert crepes. my mom loves the veggie crepe. My favorite is the flaky crossiant and a cup of coffee. I visit here every time I am in Vegas and I take home 6 bags of whole bean coffee."}
{"text":"Loved the the Nutella crepe and the very berry crepe! They also have very good macaroons that are super soft! They are sweeter than the ones at the Houston galleria! Loved it. They were super cheap on their Nutella though. I asked for extra Nutella after I received my food but it was an extra $2.00 charge after I had spent $40 on my crepes and macaroons. Would recommend though."}
{"text":"Pro: It's Jean Philippe  Con: Out of this world mistakes.  This is from our last visit Oct 2015  1. Order taker skipped people in line, there was organization 2. Didn't ask for my name - how will I get my order? 3. Order take didn't inform another guest and me to pay at the cashier or letting us know where is the cashier 4. Order take and food prep skip order process around - skipped me completely 5. Mirie helped me with the packing after I asked her for the order 6. Didn't receive our drinks 7. Didn't know if we wanted our food there or togo.   I had a chat with the manager, Julie, she didn't seem to care about my experience, just want to give me my money back. Yes, I realize that you folks are busy with an large party service by the urgency of the kitchen, but blowing me off like I was annoying you is just the last straw. I don't want free food, I want to be treated like a human being, much less a patron."}
{"text":"Classy place for a great cup of coffee and almond croissant and brioche. Don't let the line discourage you ... It is worth the wait and the line does move!) Their are few seats in the store but as you exit into the store, out into the Bellagio , there are tables and sofas in the lobby like area!"}
{"text":"I went two years ago and went again this past trip and noticed that their standards have dropped a bit.  I don't know if they've been consumed with pride because of their chocolate fountain (that everyone oogles over and impedes traffic at the Bellagio) or if they started more mass production.    In any case, two years ago, the croissants were superb but I've gotta say that Bouchon Bakery trumps them this time.  It's not that they weren't edible - they were quite good, but the wow factor was just missing.    Their meringues were okay and I got these thin chocolate wafer cookies and I'm not sure what to think of them because the taste of cinnamon overpowers everything.  Overall, come hither and admire that fountain - please let others pass through that pathway though."}
{"text":"Confections, cash, and casinos! Welcome to Las Vegas!  I finally discovered Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip earlier last year and still think about all their delightful desserts.  This place is a mecca for your sweet tooth cravings. I'm very impressed with the delicate and intricate designed desserts behind the window display. Honestly, I have only tried their desserts at their Bellagio location but noticed this selection is at least double the inventory since the bakery is housed here.   My favorites at JPP is the truffles, macarons ($2.50) and their pistachio flavored rice krispy treat ($4.99). The pumpkin spiced macaron had a bright pumpkin flavor and the crisp outside to gooey inside ratio was perfect. The truffles hands down had to be one of the best. If you know someone who's a huge chocolate fan, buy some truffles and instantly gain \"brownie\" points!  And it does not stop there... with a full cafe, gelato bar, crepe station and packaged gifts, this place offers an arrangement of sweet offerings. This will always be my primary choice because of: selection of pastries, the truffles and shorter lines.   They have several seats and tables for you to enjoy your plated desserts and beautifully decorated seasoned theme throughout the area. My interaction with the staff has been extremely friendly and I never felt rushed to make a decision.   You'll definitely hit the jackpot at Aria's Jean Philippe!"}
{"text":"No this place does not get my five stars.  Between two girls, we got: Red velvet cake- TOO MOIST, where's the cake, the density?! Tiramisu- Decent, but definitely had better ones  Creme brulee- Where's my caramelized topping, and white chocolate in creme brulee...Since when??  Nutella Brioche- This was good! my only recommendation was to serve it warm, then it would have been heavenly! one chai latte- DELICIOUS- THE REASON WHY I GAVE THIS PLACE FOUR and not three! one cappuccino   for 37 dollars  Expensive for an overhyped place. Either I made the wrong choices or it did not live up to the hype that day."}
{"text":"Best ice cream I've had in a while in America. It's not super creamy but it's creamy enough to be better than your top shelf Ice cream but not enough to be Gelato. But of course we make do, after all shelf life on the good stuff from Italy can't be realistic. Love love love. Tried the STRACIATELLA ice cream, wish I would've bought more . Ordered the berry crepe, delicious. Can tell the whipped cream is made in house. And it's not stale type of tasteless in house whipped cream that sometime is made by these high end places to keep the foodies skinny? Idk. Of course the pastries will be over the top delicious. Selection of beignets and other good stuff. Got there late at night so selection was limited but maybe that's a good thing for my waist. If you haven't tried their goods, I highly recommend you do . All delicious. One day I'll try the chocolates which should be over the top delicious too given everything else."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert, but I was actually craving something savory, so I went for the Forest crepe. It's pretty big for around $12, and it's a thin buckwheat crepe with Swiss, ham, and mushrooms. I got a sunny side egg on top. The caramelized onions looked good, but there's an extra charge for everything. I'm glad I got the chipotle sauce on the side since it was basically an unremarkable aioli.    I also tried the strawberry gelato, which was good on the first taste but then became a bit monotonous.   Oh yeah subtract one star for their no water policy - not even tap?! You can only pay for water there..."}
{"text":"Located inside Aria right by the guest hotel elevators. It stands out against the darkness of the casino and is visually appealing with its bright lights and array of colorful sweets and pastries.  Me and the galpals decided to get breakfast here before heading to our cabana by the pool.  The line was a little long, but that was mostly due to people standing around admiring all the colorful treats on display.  You place your order at the counter and then wait for your number to be called to pick it up.  I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich: cream cheese, hardboiled egg, sprouts, and red onion all on a baguette.  YUM-O!  The cost of the sandwich was $9.50...normal for Vegas standards.  Seating is extremely limited so if you're a big group expecting to find seats together, it'd probably be easier to take it all back to your hotel room upstairs and eat there. Luckily we found enough scattered seats so we could enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Had 2 scoops of gelato. One was Pistachio and the other was chocolate. The husband had coconut and mango. Both were delicious. However, they really nailed the fruit essence. The coconut receive the highest approval rating for quality and taste. Why should you care? Because my husband usually says \"meh\" about everything. You can also try before you buy. We both got 2 scoops in a cup, total: $11.35 ( incl tax). Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as the one in Bellagio. Gelato every day is my mantra. If you're staying in the Aria its a hop skip and just to sweet gelato goodness. Don't be shy, order 2 scoops in the morning and come back at 1:30am and restart...it's not like I've done it, okay maybe... Enjoy the chocolate selection too. $2.25 per piece."}
{"text":"I took a bite of the caramel with sea salt, and the world slowed down.  Vegas crowds zoomed by, lights flashed, slot machines chimed, but I was in the center of a slow motion vortex that just held me and the flavors in my mouth."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best pastries, dulce de leche gelato was so good.  I also got a strawberry with nutella crepe and it was delicious.  The texture of the crepe and the sweetness was on point- to die for!  This is also a great place to pick up a quick breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"This place is so overrated. Looks amazing BUT oh my was the ham and cheese croissant so salty! Yuck! Both my husband and we were not able finish our salt lick. Blah! We did however each chase what we ate down with a bottle of water. I do not recommend this sandwich! We will try the desserts and ice cream next time."}
{"text":"On a two day notice I was able to order an amazing cake. The cake was ready exactly when they advised. When I opened the box it was not only beautiful but more than what I expected. Everyone loved it and the taste was also amazing. I will go back."}
{"text":"Was expecting over hyped junk but this stuff is GOOD. NUTELLA BRIOCHE. Wow! Worth $4 worth the calories. Ice cream not great."}
{"text":"Oh em gee, LOVE Jean Philippe!!!! There isn't anything that I've tried and have not loved here! The pastries, sandwiches, gelato, croissants, cake pops are all delish! I'm a huge pastry fan and this is definitely my favorite place to satisfy my sweet tooth. They also have a location at the Bellagio that's equally as good. Try this one, try that one, try them all!"}
{"text":"Inside the posh Bellagio Hotel for people getting lost.  Just try the crepes, and by crepes, I mean one crepe in particular: THE EXOTIC CREPE. The mango/pineapple crepe that'll be the best $9+ spent OF YOUR LIFE. The crepes here are winners. They're thin and fluffy, the warm fruit compote is awesome, and the coconut gelato changed my life. You can buy the gelato by itself for $5 a scoop (WORTH IT). I'm a local so the chocolate fountain and location in the Bellagio doesn't really phase me. But it's still pretty.  How to eat the exotic crepe: cut  piece of the crepe, douse it with some of the food compote, and then snag a scoop of the coconut gelato and shove it in your mouth. Wait for life to change.   Repeat."}
{"text":"Wow amazing pastries. My husband and I stayed at the Aria for the first time. When we first arrived at Aria we walked by and HAD to buy something. The display case was clean and well stocked. I bought a butter croissant, and it was gone within minutes. (Adam helped me!)   What is great about this place is that they are open until 12 am. And they are open fairly early as well. I seriously came here 2x a day to grab a bite to eat. I felt as if Aria didn't have many \"fast\" options for people on the go. I was in a bit of a time constraints because of the seminars I had to attend. By the end of my 3 day trip to Las Vegas.. I could not even look at a pastry. I ate 3 regular croissants, 2 chocolate, 1 chocolate muffin, 1 fruit salad and a cheese danish. The coffee had a bold taste.. just what I needed to get my day started.  Now about a week after my trip to Vegas, I am craving for the flaky crusts of pastries again.  Mmmmm..  One negative is the ham and cheese croissant that they offer in the morning. Ewww.. i didn't like it at all. It was way to cheesy. FYI, they only serve a limited menu in the morning, afternoon and dinner.   One plus that made up for the gross ham and cheese croissant, was that my husband had forgotten his debit card at the register. He didn't realize it until about an hour after he left. He went back to the counter and they knew immediately what he was talking about. One of the staffers said that he turned it into security shortly after he left. So my husband then went to security.. and after some ID verification he had his debit card in hand. Wonderful eh?"}
{"text":"Such great service. And tasty treats that I took back to the room and scarfed down.   While I didn't see any point in the day when there wasn't a line. It seemed to move surprisingly fast -even at 3am navigating the slew of drunkin munchie having cheeba monkies - and it would have been well worth even a 10 min wait."}
{"text":"This location has a grand display of chocolate fountains behind a glass enclosure, which is what attracts hoards of people. It's always busy and there are multiple lines for different things (gelato, crepes, pastries, etc.). My first time at this location, I was confused. It was about 15 minutes before closing, so the line for gelato started from the inside instead of outside, which was weird because I couldn't see the flavors available before choosing and paying. It also felt weird to ask for samples because I couldn't see the flavors and because they were busy, so I did not ask. People were lining up even at closing time.  I got a double scoop of pistachio & coconut sorbet, which complemented each other perfectly. My friend got a double scoop of tiramisu and oreo, which went well together too. The gelato is perfectly soft, cold, and rich in flavor. I got my gelato and went out to watch the Bellagio fountain show, so the gelato melted more quickly than it would have if I had stayed inside the casino. It was still enjoyable!  I came back the following afternoon for a refresher in the summer heat. This time, the line for gelato started from outside, which made more sense for viewing flavors before ordering. I got strawberry sorbet, which was just the right amount of fruity and so refreshing. My friend got the berry sorbet, and it was a bit too tangy/sour. I also got a raspberry cream dessert to-go, and the chocolate in it was so rich. Can't go wrong with any dessert here.  The only negative was that around 3pm in the afternoon, about 4-5 flavors were out. Pistachio and coconut ran out, which are my go-to flavors. Some customers left the line after seeing how many flavors weren't available. I'm surprised they didn't refill sooner."}
{"text":"This is the best gelato in Vegas, hands down! I used to go elsewhere for gelato/ice cream in Vegas, but once having tried Jean Phillipe's, I keep coming back.  I like the Aria location because it's in an open space with more variety and choices of desserts. It's easily accessible from Vdara (if staying there). It's also less crowded than the Bellagio location, so it's much easier to ask for samples here before choosing flavors! I say flavors because one is not enough! I've had the pistachio and coconut. Soft, cold, and rich in flavor! No icy ice cream and no dripping all over (unless you eat it outside in the summer heat). There are friendly employees and a beautiful display of desserts."}
{"text":"On a 4 day visit to Vegas, we stayed at the Bellagio so I managed to have 3 days worth of JP.  This also means that I have 30 days of workouts to even things out but it was definitely worth it!  Raspberry Tart - Take a look at the photo I posted....how can you pick just one?! But I closed my eyes and pointed at the Raspberry tart...and boy did that gamble pay off!  I am a raspberry lover and this satisfied every craving I could ever imagine.  Crepes - Tried the Forrest (Ham, Egg, Swiss Cheese), and the Apple Sensation (Caramelized Apples, Candied Pecans, and Whip Cream).  The Forrest was just ok, but the Apple Sensation was...well, sensational. :)  Nutella Brioche - It's nutella. A lot of it. In a flaky brioche pastry. Tasty - yes. Life changing - not really.   Finally...as a nightcap, I tried the JP Road gelato (their take on Rocky Road). Wow. So amazing...I think there are also cookie dough (oreo?) pieces. The chocolate was so smooth and velvety....so worth it.  Tip: - Don't be daunted by the long line ups! Not only are they worth the wait, but they do go by pretty fast."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe at Aria is becoming my go to place for sweets in Las Vegas.  The Bellagio location offers many of the same items, but the one in Aria has better seats.  The environment also seemed more elegant at Aria.  The pastries may not rank in the top tier for flavors, but I would give a high average score considering the selection and presentation.  The quality is also consistent.  No drop since the first time I came here a few years back.  On the negative side, I don't think there were many new introductions.  No big deal since I won't be able to try them all with the current vast choices."}
{"text":"I tried both Bellagio and Aria's locations, the pastries and crepes are generally good. This time we ordered a Raspberry Macaroon and Chocolate Opera, we were pleased. Only drawback, I find this kind of places overpriced and overrated, but that's just a personal opinion."}
{"text":"Just looking through the display glass here made my mouth water. All of their desserts and pastries look amazing. We had a comp for a free pastry, so we decided to stop by here before our show in Aria. We choose the lemon tart because we didn't want anything too heavy before the show. I was extremely happy with our choice. The tart looked beautiful, covered with some toasted meringue and a white chocolate ring and tasted just as good. The meringue was light and fluffy and the tart was multicolored, which we did not expect. The crust was a little more compact and a little hard to break, but still very delicious. It is a little costly, so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have tried it if not for the comp. However, now that I have tried it, I'm likely to make a special stop here on my next trip."}
{"text":"Over the course of my stay at the Bellagio, I came here two times. Each time I got a crepe and a pastry.  On the first visit I got a chicken, spinach and parmesan crepe and a chocolate croissant. The croissant was a little too dry and flaky outside, but the gobs of chocolate and soft, chewy interior made up for it. The crepe was a good size with quality ingredients and a nice side salad.  On the second visit, I got the ham, mushroom, egg and swiss crepe and almond croissant. The hard exterior of the crepe was made better by the soft, delicious almond paste inside. The crepe was better than the first one and was savory and filling - also came with a side salad.  My only recommendation is to change the ordering line up somehow because you order made to order items toward the very end of the line when you pass all the desserts and ready made items on the inside, and chocolates on the outside. This means that lookie-loos are in the way when all you want to do is order and get going. But that's my only criticism."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and quick! Quiche Lorraine never disappoints. That, and a fruit cup and latte: $27. So, a bit pricey. This is the third latte I've ordered and am pretty bummed: no froth, just lame. That is my only complaint. My friend had the Nutella donut and said it was the most amazing donut she's ever had-she doesn't even like donuts. They make them fresh daily and run out early. This place is right next to the guest elevators (casino level) and easily accessible."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe seems to be the new hotness in Las Vegas and I'm not so sure it's deserved. The decor of the Patisserie is great - fondante everywhere and lots of nice looking pastries and chocolates to buy. Like others have noted, I don't think it's worth the price. On the other hand, there's coffee and breakfast foods, making this a popular place in the mornings for any Aria hotel guest.  For us, we got their paninis, which was quite delicious. There's a panini with pesto and chicken and the bread is awesome. The only gripe is that even if you get the panini to eat there, they still give it to you in this giant plastic container, which just gets thrown away when you're finished. Oh well."}
{"text":"Coconut ice cream. One word. Amazing. Every bite you take, you will have a enormous amount of pure coconut."}
{"text":"So lucky we found that place. Everything behind their display looks so good. Each pastry with its own unique design. All of their salads and sandwiches are pre packaged which sounds bad but it's not. Not only that it looks great it's also delicious. I've tried the smoked salmon sandwich that I will defiantly rate 5 stars.  Snickers eclair was good as well. They have recently changes their whole menu so it is a bit different than we are used to and they are now missing their famous tuna melt sandwich which was spectacular. However they have many other menu items that are great. We tried Nutella brioche, which had defiantly a generous amount of Nutella inside. Their coffees are great with a huge flavors selection. Staff is friendly and nice"}
{"text":"This is located in the Aria hotel near the hotel room elevators.  I would say that this is a solid 4-stars. It is very pricey but everything in Vegas is pricey.  The desserts are a little too sweet for me but definitely delicious enough for me to want to try a few of their petit cakes.  They have breakfast here and they are open 24 hours so you can get a middle-of-the-night snack if you want."}
{"text":"Whenever my sister or I travel, we always try to bring back something edible for the other. I remember when I first received my small package of peanut brittle from Jean Philippe Patisserie. I looked at the label, saw the price, scoffed and thought to myself, this better be some hella good peanut brittle. Who the heck would pay $15 for peanut brittle?!?!?! Uhhh yeah... apparently I would because I bought two packages of it on my first trip to Vegas. I SPECIFICALLY sought out the place JUST for the brittle... but well, like all good places you end up buying way more than you anticipated.   This wonderful patisserie is tucked inside the Bellagio hotel. Although many people rave about the chocolate fountain, I didn't find it THAT spectacular. Honestly, by the way people were describing it, I was expecting to see the type of fountain out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But the fountain is a nice addition to the place. They also have crepes, gelato, a beautiful assortment of pastries and desserts, chocolates, and drinks. I left with 2 chocolate brownies, 2 packages of peanut brittle, vanilla sugar, and a fruit tart. I had to stop myself at that, even though I didn't want to! It's like gambling, you have to know when to stop. So if you get a chance, check this place out. I've definitely found one of my favorite sins in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a sweet treat, coffee, breakfast pastry, or sandwich. Heck, it's fun just to walk through and look at the chocolate fountain and the beautiful desserts.  When I stayed at The Bellagio this place saved me when I was desperate for coffee. I had the caramel coffee and it was delicious. The caramel was rich and not too sweet. It was nice to stroll The Conservatory around the corner while enjoying my coffee.   I grabbed some sweets to take home at the end of my stay as well. The raspberry tart (almond sponge cake, pistachio cream, raspberry mousse, brittle, and glazed raspberries on top) was really good. I enjoyed every last bite and the winning flavor combination. The lemon meringue tart had a nice tasting filling with a lightly toasted fluff topping. The only item that I didn't love was the apple brioche because it had an odd flavor and was a little on the dry side.  As you'd expect the goodies are on the pricey side. Everything in the case is marked so while pricey it shouldn't be a surprise when you go to pay.  The shop opens at 7 a.m., but doesn't start putting out the over the top desserts until 10 a.m. according to the cashier. The early hours are for breakfast pastry, crepes, omelets, and coffee."}
{"text":"This bakery instantly draws you in with its fancy desserts and displays. The selection of baked goods is very impressive. It was really hard to decide on just a couple of items. I ended up choosing a giant raspberry macaron, keylime dessert and a chocolate cake. Everything was sweet and delicious. They don't have much seating so it's good to grab on the go."}
{"text":"In love with their gelato! Best gelato of my life. This place lights up my day and leaves me with a smile. It was a hot day and I really needed something sweet!  I got the coconut and hazelnut gelato in a white chocolate cone. Craving satisfied! I think bc they actually give you huge scoops it got too sweet. I was better off getting 1 scoop but I wanted 2 flavors!  I wish this place opened up in California! I guess this gives me a reason to come back to Vegas bc of their gelato!"}
{"text":"For the past 10 years, I've been searching for the perfect croissant that is comparable to the Le Nôtre croissant in Paris.  I've accidentally stumbled on it here at Jean  Philippe Patisserie!!! The buttery, flakiness and crunchiness in every bite...omfg...I have found you!!! The plain croissant is the best one, chocolate and almonds are good too but a tad sweet for me.  The crepes, sandwiches, salads and chocolate are okay.  Their latte or cappuccino is my must-have in pairing with my plain croissant.  The 5 stars is for the croissant only!"}
{"text":"OMG.  That's what I have to say about my cinnamon sugar crepe with a scoop of vanilla gelato.    The lines are confusing.  Stand here for a coffee, stand over there for a dessert.... stand in my way and piss me off some more.  But I took my crepe to go and had it in the luxury of my room.    TAMF = tasty ass mother fucker."}
{"text":"Yum.  This was located in Aria, which was lucky for us since we stayed there and ate here every morning!  It was the perfect way to start our day.  The lines were super long on the weekends, but it was well worth the wait.  We sampled the Nutella Brioche, a few croissants, a scone and some desserts during our frequent visits.  All were absolutely delicious.  Fresh and warm, sweet but not overly sweet for the non-sweet toothers like me.  Yes it is expensive for a croissant, but you're on vacation- who cares!    They also offer chocolates, crepes and gelato which I kept saying I would try, but never got a chance to once we came back to Aria with full bellies.  Next time."}
{"text":"Damn, that was good. JPP drew me in with the sheer attractiveness of the space. The decor is inviting and the pastries are ridiculously gorgeous. Like, too pretty to eat. But I managed.  Gelato: Very good. Peanut butter was the best.  Chocolate truffles: Tasty but not the best ever.  Chocolate Croissant: Heavenly. May be the best ever.  Sandwiches: Curry chicken was rich but oh so good  Cupcakes: Prettier than they taste but would try more to be sure :-)  I could have tried way more than I did and all I can say is, I am glad this doesn't exist anywhere near home.   Cons: Surly employees (each and every time); pricey, as is everything in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lovely savory crepes. The smoked salmon with spinach and dill cream in a buckwheat crepe was excellent and huge! It made a very quick and tasty lunch. The pastries are delicious as well as the macaron. I do wonder what happens to the chocolate in the huge fountain."}
{"text":"Had the banana foster crepe and it was delicious. Giving it a 4 b/c the ladies were kind of sassy and rude!"}
{"text":"I only had one thing, but DAYYYUUUMMMM was it good. Had the raspberry cheesecake, which was surrounded by a white chocolate coating. I'm not a white chocolate person at all, but this was some good chocolate and even better cheesecake."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe, you are a genius! Wish I was there when they had the chocolate dragon for the year of the dragon.   I stayed at Aria recently and walked by this patisserie as I was going up to my room. Decided to pick up a few items for lunch. We came here three times during our stay. The first time we had the cobb salad, which was very good. Second time was chicken pesto sandwich, croissant sandwich, raspberry rose macaron and fruit tart. The last time we had a chicken pesto crepe from the crepe station. I am a sugar fiend, so I will get dessert pretty much every time I eat out. I would say that the raspberry rose macaron and fruit tart, while beautifully arranged and presented, are not worth getting. The flavors did not leave a lasting impression. The crust to the fruit tart was too thick. On the other hand, the savory items, especially the chicken pesto sandwich and crepe (if you like pesto) are a must try.   It is quite pricey, but I definitely recommend trying this place out if you are in Vegas. I also love how they open late (:"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for breakfast on our way to see the Picasso gallery. They have so many delicious treats. Unfortunately, since we were in a hurry we just grabbed ham and cheese croissants and coffees. It's a bit small inside, you have to go around people to get to the sugar and cream stand. Take a look at all the pastries before ordering, the line covers some of the pastries and they take your order before you get all the way to the register, so you dont really get a chance to see everything they have. Hopefully next time we can take a quick break and enjoy a delicious treat. :)"}
{"text":"Best chocolate  pastry I have ever eaten. I had the imperial and my wife had a cheese cake. You can tell this is not an average desert. The prices were reasonable and service was spot on. Glad we don't have one where I live or I would be 100 pounds heavier."}
{"text":"For Vegas, this is a great cafe to grab a snack or dessert. I hate wasting time in Vegas trying to find a place to eat for a decent price, and I especially hate it when I have to leave the hotel for a quick bite. But not here!!  When I stayed at Aria, I came here all weekend to grab a bite to eat. They have really great pastries (the almond brioche is pretty amazing...) and their spicy chicken panini is pretty damn good. (It's not spicy, FYI...just delicious.) I also tried the cobb salad (not bad for pre-made salad) and coffee. All was great. It wasn't overly priced (I could spend just as much at a Panda Express **wink wink**...which some of my other friends did--they thought it was going to be much cheaper. But after a 20 min walk in the heat and the $10 price tag for 1 plate, I would have def rather spent my time & money at Jean Philippe!!)  Don't expect to get a huge meal or a full stomach...but expect to be satisfied!! I'll def be back next time I stay at Aria..."}
{"text":"One thing I always look for in a store is variety. I'd say that they had a variety of desserts to choose from!   I got an Imperial (a chocolate mousse) and it was delicious. It was $9.20 and I believe it had a Ferraro Roche kind of chocolate in the middle. It had two pieces of chocolate on top but they weren't as flavorful as I'd imagine if to be. We then got a Berry Crepe and let's just say I was not the biggest fan. My friend seemed to enjoy it, but I wasn't a big fan of the tarty flavor from the strawberry sauce?? I'm not sure where the tart flavor came from but I'm pretty sure it was the raspberry or strawberry. The crepe itself was nice and thin.   I loved the look of this place overall. They had a big chocolate fountain and I was amazed by it. They also had a huge cake in the middle of their work place (but it was above them). The way they decorate this place is nice, but the seating is a little cramped."}
{"text":"i must say that Jean Philippe Patisserie has many dessert selection to choose from...so many that i cannot decide which one i want. From crepe to gelato to cakes to coffee - ahhh~ i want them all!!!   I ended up treating myself to a caramel twist - it has a strong coffee flavor, which i like. the caramel was there but it didn't overpower the coffee flavor nor was it too sweet.  Thinking my cup of coffee would be enough, i was wrong, i just had to order a dessert... i ended up getting the triple chocolate flourless cake. It was okay; waaayyy too sweet. It for sure satisfied my sweet tooth. I wished i had order their crepe cuz it looked really good.  Yes, it is expensive but sometimes u just need to treat yourself to something good after a long week of hard work."}
{"text":"The desserts here are incredible..they are small, but rich. We got the Snicker's cake and another chocolate one, and they were to die for! Absolutely delicious..we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the vanilla flan and nutella brioche. The flan was creamy, light and not overly sweet. The brioche was yummy filled with nutella and mini chocolate chips. Perfect dessert to go with a cup of coffee overlooking the Bellagio poolside."}
{"text":"Chocolate makes any day 100x better. I was mesmerized by the pastry counter and the flowing chocolate fountain above me. I wanted to try everything but I knew a collection of $6.90/dessert would have made my wallet cry later on. The cashier suggested the Chocolate Cheesecake and Imperial as the most popular dishes sold. Both were beautifully decorated and almost too pretty to eat. There is a limited number of seating inside the patisserie so I proceeded to move to the Bellagio seating area adjacent to JP. I went on a Sunday evening and surprisingly, there weren't too many people lining up or buying but I can imagine the place does loop around.   The verdict: Chocolate Cheesecake had a rich, overwhelmingly sweet white chocolate exterior. The mousse-like filling was too rich for me, but I love the Oreo graham cracker! It was a nice complement to the cheesecake. I like the creation just because it is different from most of the standard cheesecakes I have tried and this one tastes more moist, airy, and fresh.  The Imperial was my favorite just because I felt it was the perfect combination of chocolate, hazelnut, and crunch. Mmmm. This pastry gets my vote :) Try it.  Next time, I have my eye set on the rose macaron and the nutella brioche."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the red velvet cupcake.  Wonder if anything else would have been better. Overpriced and too much frosting.  The people that waited on me not the friendliest people"}
{"text":"One thing for sure, I couldn't have asked for much more of a selection. Seems like they had something for everyone. It all looks fresh and good too. Mine was for sure.  Lotsa tasty Gelato choices!!  Friendly service Resonable prices, considering the location."}
{"text":"The Gelato here is perfect and the price is probably the least damaging to the wallet when compared to other 'Gelaterias' on the strip. It's probably one of the best I've had and I only come here for it. I haven't took the chance to try the eye-popping dessert creations, I'm too cheap for it.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a good place when I want a quick escape from living the local life and want to feel like a tourist for about 20 minutes. I get lost in my thoughts as the creaminess of the gelato seduces my mouth as I sit and stare into the crowds passing through the Aria casino. I just hate when a promoter approaches me and hands me a card for free drinks and entrance to a bar or club. Leave me alone."}
{"text":"A crazy popular stop in Bellagio for not only sweets but for savory stuffs too.  There's always a line so be prepared to wait.  People flock to this place just to see the chocolate fountain.  The decor is amazing with the big train hanging above everything.  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Vdara for his birthday weekend and had to hit up Jean Philippe for food since nothing was available after 8pm.  Instead of something sweet we shared a wheat crepe with chicken and some cream sauce holding it together.  Decent crepe with a side of salad with yummy balsamic dressing.  Next time we visit it's dessert time!"}
{"text":"had his croissant at Bellagio a few years ago and never forgot how good it tasted.   got to relive that memory this weekend.  it was every bit as good as i remembered it.  regular croissant + dub expresso  Best Ever!"}
{"text":"The desserts were good overall. And I had a smoked salmon sandwich which was particularly memorable.  But, now why the 1 star review. I will tell you. For some odd reason a friend suggested that I get him a coffee mug ( don't you love it when your friends have inexpensive tastes in gifts ). And viola, a few moments later I see this coffee mug at jp patisserie. It looked good ( a little too pretty for a guy, but he was gay anyway so it was fine ). I expected it to be priced more than 12$. So, I ended up buying two, one for myself.   First use : The lid opening for drinking is leaky even when tightly closed. I thought i will be careful not to invert it or put it in a bag or something.  second use :  The lid itself starts to leak rendering it completely useless, unless you want your coffee dripping all over you when you drink your coffee.  and my friend who i gave this too, also had the same experience.   seriously, Jean Philippe, I am pretty sure you guys figured out that this is a piece of crap. But, decided to price it cheap and sell it anyway, because you guys spent some insignificant amount on manufacturing it in china.   On top of it, the mug says something like patent pending or some such nonsense. I hope you guys do get your patents for this proved to design.   now, why 1 star ? cause I believe you have very little integrity with the quality of the products you will sell."}
{"text":"Frustration! I went on christmas day.  My biggest frustration with this place is seating. Awkward, artsy but not functional and tight squeeze with close encounters (I don't want to smell the breathe of the person sitting next to me, especially if I don't know them)  The manager is snappy  Food mediocre it's really hyped up & all just for looks.   I got a ton of food; savory Crepes forest & royal, chicken pesto panini, Cobb salad  Royal savory crepe was creamy cheese & salty. Feel like it should be on pasta, instead.    Forest crepe; forest ham, mushroom & I think Swiss cheese. That was basic but good in comparison to my original dish (Royal Savory Crepe).   Chicken pesto panini: my favorite from the pick. Why? IDK, maybe because it wasn't food stuffed a sponge like-tasteless crepe. It was soft yet crispy bread, flavorful fillings.   Cobb salad had bad smelling dressing. Had to ask for balsamic vinaigrette. If it smells bad I'm not eating. I like crepe, but this place did not cut it for me, maybe it was because of the service during a holiday. I'm not sure, but I'm pleased. It's whatevers to me. Ate it, tired it, didn't really  like it. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Stick to what Monsieur Phillipe is good at: sweets! The light, grab-and-go options (paninis/wraps/salads) are painstakingly average and not worth the splurge. On the other hand, you will not regret going for anything chocolate. If you are having trouble deciding, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable about method of preparation and ingredients used."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain is so impressive, to keep you distracted from the pretentious anal sphincter behind the counter who lack all sense of customer service. Go enjoy the chocolate, but allow for some time to be ignored and looked at like you're wrong for wanting to do business with them."}
{"text":"The employees here have French accents!!!! I know, right??? But seriously, this place was great! I was waiting for my boyfriend to cash out and was craving something sweet. Look to the left and there was Dessert galore!! Such a hard choice to make with the many options... But went safe with the cheesecake. Oh wowsers!!!! Definitely going to try more than the cheesecake next visit."}
{"text":"One of the few breakfast places in the Aria and there always seemed to be a line in the morning. The food is quite good (and they did a good job on making an americano). Prices are ridiculous ($8 for a yogurt parfait!) but this is the case with vegas now.  THe service is not great. THe line is due to the amazing slow pay out process. Not sure why it takes so long. On my first visit, the left an item out of my order and gave me a different thing than i ordered. But, it was a happy surprise as the nutella brioche was SO good! The breakfast panini was also great. Had hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese, and i assume bechamel sauce. Quite rich and decadent. But, a nice treat after late nights."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about their crepes! We stayed at the Aria for 3 nights, 4 days.....I literally had two crepes a day my entire stay. They have sweet and savory options - I tried most of them and have to say they were ALL excellent! They make them fresh while you wait, all fresh ingredients.   The gelato here is pretty great too. The desserts are all rich and ascetically pleasing. There is always a long line for this fantastic little shop. My one and only complain is their sandwiches are not made fresh.   Make sure to stop here when you are in Vegas, the crepes are an absolute MUST!"}
{"text":"The queues are huge (30mins typically) and there's little seating but the crepes are good, if you are willing to wait."}
{"text":"Tried their blueberry danish and their regular coffee and I was impressed!  Expect a long line in the morning and arrive early if you want your favorite pastries! Will definitely come back here when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"These guys are completely under staffed. It takes 45 minutes to work through the line just to get a coffee. Highly inefficient ordering system. Needs massive improvements. Otherwise, food is good"}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 3 stars for service.  The cafeteria style detracts from an otherwise great experience.  Chocolate croissants are to die for - flaky, buttery, and just enough chocolate.  Espresso is great - Had double espressos ($4.50 each) twice.  Lunch - Ahi Tuna salads could not be finished by my ladies - $12 each  They gave me a taste of the Ahi - perfect.  Salad had crisp fresh greens and lots of tuna and greens..  Prosciutto sandwich ($10.50) was easily finished by me, but very tasty.  They have numerous salads and sandwiches to choose from - smoked salmon, and ham come to mind. To the left of the food line are their chocolates, gelato and crepes.  Open 6:00 AM to 12 midnight.   Warning on service: when they get busy, they may screw up your order.  Make sure they write order down correctly - yes, they use a pad and paper as of this writing.  Iced tea is $4.00, but we didn't get them because the server though it was \"iced water\" even though they charged us for iced tea.  This was of course at the busiest time of day, so after a little back and forth I gave up and came back later to the manager, who immediately refunded our money and apologized profusely.  I would gladly pay more for a sit down version of this restaurant to eat the fabulous food.  Their unbelievable desserts decorate the serving and eating area.  Check out the kiosk in the dessert section - you can see a tremendous number of pictures of their cakes etc.  Worth a look."}
{"text":"Who wants expensive desserts and drinks?! Well, you ARE in the Aria, come on now people, bring money bags along and get some yummies!  I'm being a little silly here, of course, but don't come here without expecting to shell out some money. Jean Philippe is an open-area type coffee/dessert place off of Aria's main casino floor. The intricate sculptures of the \"walls\" and mod furniture styling is fantastic.   The desserts are delicious. Period. I shared with a friend the \"Intense\" flourless chocolate cake and the Strawberry/Lemon Cupcake. Both were delightful. I also indulged in a coffee, which went perfectly with my desserts.   Overall - completely pleased with my experience here and I will come back."}
{"text":"I'm agreeing with Krsna on this one.  I don't get it.  The fountain is a chocolate fountain.  Are people really that impressed that it's in the book of world records?    The Bellagio room had no coffee pot so this was close to the elevator bank.  $4 for a cup of coffee??  And it wasn't good either.  Ridiculous.    The line set up here is so wonky and stuffed with tourists that don't know what to do and keep staring at that stupid fountain.  Move on and find somewhere else - and I guess take a picture of the world's largest chocolate fountain if you MUST"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it so much, but disappointed! Just not tasty. Three of us shared the cheesecake and the chocolate peanut one (I forget the cute name), and at $6 a pop it better be the best dessert of all time- not even close!"}
{"text":"This is no average bakery! This is high end, good quality, excellent presentation patisserie! Every bite is just so deciduous, you can taste the amazing flavors, just perfect!   You have to spot by here whenever in Vegas!  And come back on your last day in town go take some home!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holla! I'm not a fancy smancy type of foodie when it comes to sweets but this place almost made me to be. I stayed at the Aria for a weekend and walked by Jean Philippe, only to see crowds of people in line in the store or at the actually bakery next to it. Because we only wanted a small, quick bite before the Viva Elvis show, we decided to try Jean Philippe since we saw people dining on sandwiches and salads.  We ordered the basil pesto chicken panini for me and the ham panini and good lawd, I think I ate the best sandwich on earth. The basil pesto chicken panini wasn't a humongous sandwich filled with loads of greasy fillers. You could tell they put care in their ingredients and how it's presented to you. The bread was lightly toasted and the overall flavor of the sandwich was delicious and not over \"pesto'd\". My date's ham sandwich was \"delicious\" for a ham sandwich that he thought would be a typical sandwich but he said they flavored the ham in some way  to bring flavor out.   After watching people tempt us with their crepes and other desserts as they walked by, we decided to try some of their desserts. We tried the tiramisu which came in a little square shaped container and looked beautiful enough for a photo! The first bite had a savory cocoa, vanilla bite followed by a thin, spongy layer of cake. Thinking I had enough, I saw there was over a half portion left in the little container. That says savory!  After a flan (which wasn't too great I hate to say) and a delicious espresso, we were off to our show. But one things for sure, next time we come to Vegas, this place will be a must stop for us!"}
{"text":"The best coconut sorbet ever. Highly recommend the exotic crepe! The fountains at the door are very cool too. Definitely worth checking out. Very conveniently located close to the Bellagio entrance."}
{"text":"::drool:: The pastries here are so gooooood!  I had a raspberry tart and a rose-something or other that was like a huge macaroon (my favorite dessert).  Hubby had a pumpkin cheesecake that he said was really good too.  I think this is going to be a permanent stop on all my Vegas trips now."}
{"text":"If you like dessert crepes, you definitely need to go here to try them.  My suggestion is you try the crepe with Nutella along with a scoop of raspberry sorbet.  You definitely won't regret it."}
{"text":"My mom and I grabbed a couple of gelatos after lunch at Javier's, right before heading out of town. Our last indulgence, if you will! She got the mint chip and I got the chocolate chip. Very yummy indeed... and just over $9 for both. Not too outrageously expensive considering all the other overpriced meals/drinks we had during our 2-night stay. I'll return next time I'm at Aria :-)"}
{"text":"This place may be a little pricey but the food is done with such precision and care that it is almost too artistic to eat. They have a large arrangement of cakes, tarts and other desserts as well as savory items like croissants. The ham and cheese croissant was so perfect for my hangover state. Rich buttery, warm and flakey. Put a nice comfort in my stomach. Only criticism is everything is pre-made then reheated. Would have loved to try it straight out of the oven."}
{"text":"Love coming here for crepes for breakfast, and gelato at nights. Amazingly it has very reasonably  priced (for Vegas) desserts and short lines as well.     Not sure I should have divulged this to everyone on a Yelp review."}
{"text":"The Bellagio Hotel and Casino is known world wide for their gigantic, larger than life fountains.  They have the outside fountains with their gigantic geysers of thunderous water rocketing practically into orbit. On the inside they have a giant chocolate fountain next to Jean Philippe Patisserie with tons of chocolate flowing like molten lava from exorbitant heights.  Everything else at the Bellagio is larger than life as well, except for the Patisserie.  I am completely dumbfounded as to why they would stuff Jean Philippe's into a tiny, extremely claustrophobic corner.  Whoever designed this shop, should have been boiled in chocolate and encased in its over tempered remains (maybe rolled in coconut) for eternity.  Chocolate and gelato are two renewable resources available all over Las Vegas and an absolute necessity for my times spent on the strip.  Jean Philippe has both of these resources along with buttery croissants, napoleons, crepes, and much more.  Their gelato is very good but I mainly go there for the chocolate.  Their chocolate patties are merely good.  Their truffles, on the other hand, are exquisite.  The exterior chocolate casings just might be the smoothest, creamiest, most delicious chocolate I have ever tasted.  The various concoctions Jean Philippe has contrived to fill these wonderful balls of culinary magic, in my opinion, are the most imaginative, blissfully decadent truffle centers of all time.  I can still see myself closing my eyes and basking in the incredible flavors of each heavenly bite."}
{"text":"ONE WORD: YUMMY!!   We were at the Bellagio for a wedding a little early to avoid traffic for the marathon taking place this past weekend.  As the wedding wasn't starting until 11AM, we realized we hadn't had breakfast, and wouldn't be eating until the reception later on. We decided we would stop by at Jean Philippe's as it was near the venue for our event. We noticed the busy atmosphere and long line but we were in a crunch for time and needed to get food in our stomachs.  We were not disappointed!! Everything we ordered was awesome! I ordered a cesar salad which was a very filling and a generous portion for the price, along with some yummy iced coffee. The chicken in my salad was super fresh and thinly sliced, and the cesar dressing was deliciously creamy.  My guests ordered a vegetarian quiche which she loved, and my other guest ordered a trio of tuna, avocado and brie, and ham and cheese sandwhiches which she loved as well!  Everything tasted super fresh and delicious, amazing quality and very little wait time for our big order. I had a bite of the avocado and brie and it was absolutely delicious!   They also had a bunch of mouthwatering smelling and looking pastries and sweets that we will have to try next time we are in town. Unfortunately I didn't see any macarons during my visit otherwise I would've definitely indulged.  This location also has the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain which is super unique and a tease to look at lol.  Make sure you stop by if you're ever at the Bellagio!!"}
{"text":"Writing this for my wife.  She has a serious sweet tooth.  We had breakfast here too.  I didn't care for their crepes, but my wife had a ham & cheese crossiant and said it was amazing."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is such an exquisite store that a sweets lover cannot help but stop in his or her track and go in and see what wonders await.   I am a sweets lover and was drawn by their beautiful chocolate creations. Unfortunately, this stop occurred during an afternoon stroll along the Strip. I so wanted to get a box of chocolates, but I was practical enough to know that the desserts will not have a chance against the desert. I will be back next time I am in town and satisfy my want for those chocolates.  With that in mind, this review is really just for the gelato. Perhaps after the visual treat, my expectations were very high, but I found their gelato to be just alright. The dulce de leche was too sweet, and almost cloying. The liquor-soaked pastry in the tiramisu would have made it an instant winner had the gelato it came with been able to hold its own, but it did not.  I will go back to try the other exquisite things I saw in the shelves."}
{"text":"The cascading chocolate fountains are mesmerizing.  I probably stared at it for a good 5-10 minutes, eyes wide, in amazement and awe.    ...and about 3 feet away the Huzbeau had the same expression, but he was looking at the Crepes menu - lol.  We were thinking, does it really taste as good as it looks?  We ordered a crepe with strawberries, vanilla gelato, topped with whipped cream and a gooooood drizzling of chocolate sauce.  Oh YEAH.  It was good.  Pricey, but good."}
{"text":"There service and chocolates as well as the crepes are something special. Exotic crepe was a family favorite too. If the crepe isn't perfect the girl throws it out. The omelets looked amazing and for the price of everything was a great calue. Minus drip coffee for almost 5.00."}
{"text":"They have really beautiful pastries.  I've only had one, the tirasmisu, and it was delicious, though too small!  The best part were the tiny sugared marshmallows that were sprinkled on the tiramisu.  The cookie that came with it was also good.  I've also had their caviar cocoa nibs, which are tiny chocolate covered nibs - excellent - and some hard molasses looking candy w/ nuts (just eh, esp for $16).  For the most part, everything I've had is good but the price is a bit too steep for me to partake in often.  Good thing I only go to Vegas a couple times a year!"}
{"text":"Wow....beautiful desserts.  When u eat them, it's like uhh....huh... not so wow.  Definitely gives them a thumbs up on the presentation, it definitely made my mouth watering.  Tasting part? Failed."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here to pick up a quick snack before our show.  I wish I could have stayed longer to debate over all the delicious choices.   I had the Trio Chocolate Cheesecake, and it was delicious.  You can taste all three layers of chocolate, sweet and yummy.  It feels a bit heavy towards the end, so it's better to share, or just eat half and save for later."}
{"text":"Food:  Great assortment of pastries and \"designer\" desserts, would want to go to this place 3 times a day if I was not worried about my weight. I tried the passionfruit crepes which was filled with a very balanced custard cream but the passionfruit preserve was too sweet for me.   Service: the staff is very friendly BUT the waiting time for ordering was looong. For crepes, especially, there's usually a 30-40 mins wait AFTER you order.    Ambience: nice and trendy but good god, there is no seating place. Just a couple high chairs that you should stare at people to make them uncomfortable to leave as soon as they finished their food."}
{"text":"I ordered the creme brulee and cookies and cream gelato and it was delicious! The creme brulee had the carmelized sugar chunks into the gelato and I really liked that.  The location in Bellagio has the world's largest chocolate fountain which is something worth checking out while in Las Vegas.   I would definitely come back again for their other desserts because those looked amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun.  It's pretty overpriced, but it looks like candyland inside and out and it's filled with any kind of snack you can want.   They specialize in crepes, which all looked amazing!  I went for the quiche and it was incredible.  It is a bit on the small side, but it's very good and the flavors do not disappoint.  The fruit and yogurt was also good, and the mocha I ordered was excellent as well.    They have tons of desserts and it's interesting to just walk around and check it all out.  They have huge chocolate waterfalls outside, so it's pretty easy to spot as well as being an interesting thing to see in person.  It has a very Willy Wonka feel.    As I mentioned, it is totally overpriced, (we paid more than $40 for a crepe, a quiche, 2 coffee drinks and a yogurt) but it's fun and it's good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for getting something sweet I know the place from the beginning and the quality here is amazing"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain, good menu and great taste... definitely a good choice after a party night."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 cakes for my girlfriend's birthday. 2 separate parties. The guest cake was great but the second was wrong everything. Wrong flavor, wrong color, and just a huge disappointment. I placed the order 3 days in advance and picked up the second cake on the way to her private party with just friends. It was obviously too late to fix their mistake and to make it worse they didn't offer even an apology. At over $60 a cake I say go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Late night dessert. Got here around 12am, there was still a line.  Most of their desserts and pastries were gone so we end up getting a strawberry banana Nutella crepe and gelato ice cream. They are open until 2AM, but the staff looks very tired from a long night."}
{"text":"The crepes were fantastic here.  My friend and I were in the mood for dessert after seeing le reve but weren't going to be okay with just ice cream, so we stopped by here.  We got two different crepes - she got banana's foster and my was just a plain nutella - and we shared.  I'm pretty sure we were licking the plates clean.  So good.  The crepes were made to order - including the actual crepe part.  I know some places stock pile a bunch of them and then just heat it back up and then put toppings on it.  Not here.  Also - you have to check out the HUGE selection of other pastries, chocolates and gelato.  They also have a huge chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain is a cool feature and fun to look at. We visited earlier in the day but weren't in the mood for dessert, so we took some pictures and decided to come back when it was less crowded. It wasn't \"less crowded\" when we returned, and after looking at the different \"lines\" to get into (one for crepes, one for ice cream, and one for chocolate/pastries) we were told just to jump in. We got a vanilla eclair, creme brule, and a Nutella Napoleon. All were seriously a mouth orgasm - so delicious!!! I absolutely love hazelnut, so I was excited to try the Nutella Napolean - it was the best dessert I have ever had, hands down! My boyfriend loved his eclair just the same, and the creme brule was also delicious which we shared since we couldn't decide what to get.   I read previous reviews so I knew about the \"steep price\" but realistically, it's not \"steep\" because a regular dessert at most restaurants anywhere, not just Vegas, are around $6-8 each. The three we had were each $7 so right on par, but the value in them was so much better! I would have paid $10 for the Nutella Napolean, it was that good.  There is a cute seating area just to the side of it in the Bellagio, so we sat there and ate our desserts. Wonderful way to end the evening."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love that I can WOW my out of town visitors for free at the Bellagio Conservatory then go around the corner to this beautiful smelling Patisserie. My lil family and I go here every time the theme changes for the conservatory. So atleast 4 times a year and then when we're entertaining guests as well. It's very easy to find just park in the garage enter the lobby and go left after all the beautiful flowers and a shop you'll see Jean Phillippes' on the right!! You can't miss the worlds TALLEST chocolate fountain =p There is also usually some beautiful edible creation right now it's cakes before it was a life size chocolate lady in a red gown! The first food you'll encounter is the gelato and fresh crepes being made to order. Once you enter you'll see the most beautiful little desserts. You can tell it takes time to make some of these. You'll see sandwiches and salads. Then fresh baked goods. They also have fountain drinks and espresso. I have tried a few desserts the rose macaron being my favorite. Their nutella brioche is YUMMY! Hubby gets the brownie crepe and adds bananas and tiramisu gelato to it. I've never disliked anything I've ordered here! I've never tried anything savory but it all looks yummy!!!"}
{"text":"So, I stayed at the Vdara and wanted breakfast on a Sunday morning. There were loooong lines at the Vdara cafe & Starbucks. Just a short walk across the street into Aria to the Jean Philippe Pattisserie to order an omelette, and watch a server craft it in front of me was about the time it would have taken to wait in those  lines.   So thanks, Jean, for a prompt and tasteful breakfast. And for the beautiful chocolate to admire while I waited."}
{"text":"Although I have been to Vegas enough to declare it a second home, I had no idea there were two Jean Philippe Patisserie. Literally next door to each. Well sort of.  I have passed this spot a few times, but had no idea it was the same as the fancy bakery with the chocolate fountain.  My guess is this place is slightly busier than the Bellagio location. I was told there was a 45 minute wait for a crepe. Considering there were only a few people ahead of me in line, my only guess is that the other guests who ordered crepes were patiently waiting at a table or some d-bag in front me ordered for himself and 20 of his closest friends. Either way, I ended up with a sandwich, the rose macaroon, and a strawberry lemon cupcake. Total $25.  Roast Beef Sandwich: Looks like it should be hot, but it's not. Despite that, it was actually pretty freakin' delicious. Maybe I'm biased, but the bread was soft and I love roast beef and horseradish. It was a pretty good size, still overpriced at $11. My guess is that it was made with extra love.  Rose Macaroon: I have an aversion for anything that sounds like it'll taste like flowers. But my nephew said that looks good, and you only live once. It wasn't too flowery. I'm a sucker for macaroons, but I think regular sized versions are better. Purely for convenience.  Strawberry Lemon cupcake: + 10 points for looking like the a cupcake from the future. +10 points for not disappointing in the flavor department (not too much lemon, not too much strawberry, not too sweet). + 5 because a spoon required (which sounds like it should be minus points, but I actually prefer cake in an actual cup and using a spoon. Keeps it neat.) I want this to be my next birthday cake. That's how much I loved it."}
{"text":"One of those places with known for that one must see display of something amazingly cool looking. In this case it's in the form of a chocolate fountain. As you can see from the millions of pictures available. This place is fancy as the disposable utensils rival the real ones in my apartment. If my grandma were with us, she would totally steal them!  I took the opportunity to sample the other two crepes in my party: - Salmon crepe. I have to say, I make some amazing decisions when it comes to trying out a new place. There was much more salmon on top than I had imagined. The pesto sauce (or whatever it was) was delicious! Flavorful to the point some may find it too salty. It's salmon and expected to be a little salty, but just an FYI! All in all, it's worth the ap12! I'm stuffed! - Italian crepe. Tempting second choice as it has prosciutto on top, but it was surprisingly low in the flavor department. (Maybe it's cause I ate it after the amazing salmon crepe.) It you want something a little lighter in flavor it's the way to go. - berry crepe. Looks amazing. But in all Honesty, exactly what you would expect. I think you could get something like this at IHOP. If we come back, we suggested my nephew get something a little more unique.  Do yourself a favor and order something that's not run of the mill. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. If you're in Vegas this is a must to stop and check out. They're in a couple of casinos, we went to the location in Aria. The crepes look to die for, we didn't get one though. The little desserts are the best. My wife had the tiramisu and said it's the best she's ever had.  Stop. Eat. Fall in love."}
{"text":"Best croissant ive ever eaten and the proccuto pannini as well as the breakfast panini are fantastic.  The breakfast panini was built very nicely with two pieces of good quality bread on the outside and a piece on the inside.  In between the breads there was melted cheese and ham, and in the middle layed a hard boiled egg with the bread cutt around it as not to disturb the rest of the sandwich.   for a quick cheap meal.  Located right off of the casino floor you wont have to go far to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"First time having the crepes here and they were devious!! Had one savory and one sweet! Both amazingly good!!"}
{"text":"I treated my mom to some goodies from here while she was in town. We shared a little chocolate mouse and a Nutella Napolean. I have to say that I was pretty surprised those two items alone cost me about $17. So I don't know that I'll be eating every day, but I did enjoy what we had.  Between the two desserts, the mousse was definitely the sweeter and richer if the two. However, I'd never had a Napolean before and I completely fell in love with the crispy chew if the layers of wafer!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious mixed berry crepe with Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries in sauce. Crepe was light and berries were fresh and delicious! Loved the floor to ceiling chocolate fountain this is a must do when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Chocolate, no. Roast beef sammie? A surprising yes.   Trust me, I am just as surprised as you might be.   With the last hour of our stay in Vtown looming, I wanted to use the last of our MGM express comps. So, since we parked at Bellagio, this visual storefront caught our attention. After purusing the goods, we were stuck between hot chocolate, coffee or forgetting the whole thing.   Then what do you know?  I spy, with my eye, that someone ordered a sammie and it gets freshly made somewhere and is brought out. The ones that looked unappetizing in the dispy case are not the ones given to you.    The clear winner in the sammie category in LV is Earl of Sammie, but dont be too shocked if you like the roast beef here. And at a little over ten bucks, not a terrible deal by strp standards.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"The Aria has a Starbucks upstairs from this Patisserie. Why start a review of Jean Philippe with that?  Well, you most likely will never find a seat here.  The pastries are wonderful.  The salads are fresh and tasty!  However, you may find all sorts of Vegas douchebags here with luggage and messy eating habits and downright uncivilized anarchy.  Thus, take your almond croissant, Cobb or Caesar salad and fresh juice,  head one flight up, turn right.  PLOP down on the communal table or assortment of benches, the cool kind, not the high school dumpy kind.  AND relax.  No noisy casino, or douche clientele downstairs.    ENJOY  Oh, forgot to mention they make fresh crepes, but we didn't get one this time. Next time!  everything is a bit pricey, but find a way to get some. Pretty good pastries."}
{"text":"Ooh la la delicious  Wonderful patisserie - chocolate almond croissant flakey and rich, with a very generous fill of rich almond paste lusciousness. Delicious quiche enjoyed by my husband, the only drawback from 5 stars is that staff told us the quiche Lorraine had no tomato, but we saw some flecks (possible cross contamination from other veggie quiches, so I had to hand it back and opted for a very good chicken Cesar salad instead. This place is a good option for a quick bite before a show or between table games- not a lot of seats, but we enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Vanilla cream filling! You'll be glad you did! The crepes look delicious and the taste certainly matches up. Their savory crepe was okay , the tart gelato was good, but the vanilla cream filled crepe with berries on top was one of the best crepes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I LOVE ice cream and gelato so I was super disappointed with the gelato. I can't vouch for their other stuff.  The best part was sitting at the bakery and doing people watching. I think my boyfriend and I must have checked out dozens of girls together, critiquing their outfits.   Shhhh!"}
{"text":"Pastries and chocolate!   Located inside of Aria. Look for the huge dessert bar in the middle of the casino and you found it.   Decor is really pretty. The dessert art is awesome.  Usually really busy on weekends.   The desserts are on the pricier side but what isn't in Vegas. All the pastries are priced at $8.  Raspberry Tart - $8 - Good balance of sourand sweet. The pistachio cream was nutty and sweet. The shortbread tart was buttery. The raspberries jam was sour but sweet and the fresh raspberries rounded everything together. Very unique but tasty dessert."}
{"text":"We got super lucky the day we came here because it wasn't that busy when we ordered.  After our order was placed, thats when the crowd came.    By the way, when I come here, I get so confused that there are different lines.  So yes, pay attention to what line you are in so you don't waste your time any longer to get your, oh so sweet delights.    We ordered crepes, pastries, hot chocolate, and coffee.   Since there were 5 of us we ordered 3 different crepes, lucky me right?    Yup, I got to try a lot.  All delicious.    I am reading through the reviews and yes it is a bit pricey, however, you are the strip and this isn't your average dessert place, so I think its okay to treat yourself, or your sweetie (See what I did there?)  Not much seating, so if you want to enjoy your dessert right away, save yourself a seat when one opens up!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to LV, this is a place that I always want to visit! The chocolate fountain is always amusing to watch..  Their desserts are great!! I love the variety and uniqueness.  I've tried the rose macaroon, decorated with a sugar coated rose petal on top.  Its filled with a vanilla like cream, and the macaroon is infused with a rose flavor.   Their choco-banana and other chocolate desserts are all rich, smooth, and tasty!!   Not to mention, their freshly baked ham & cheese croissants melt in your mouth.  Full of buttery, flaky goodness!  Yummm!!  We didn't realize how good they were, and wished we had bought two!    The almond croissant was huge, and also good.  Topped with plenty of almonds, and filled with tons of almond paste.  I would have loved to try the crepes, but the wait was 30 minutes long!! Crazy!!"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian crepe, which was basically a quesadilla. Salmon one is much better for the same value. Then had the banana foster crepe with creme brulee gelato on the side. I would say add the extra gelato, it makes the crepe taste a lot better! Also had the soufflé crepe with chocolate, but they dont add whipped cream. The brownie bits on top were really good though!"}
{"text":"Got the salmon crepe, and the portions bigger than you think. I had a hard time finishing it, but managed to do so. Also got a piece of chocolate there for almost $3 (got the praline one I believe) but not worth it, and was disappointed at the chocolate. I would much rather spend it on their crepes, which are some of the best Ive had (especially their dessert crepes). The Jean Philippe at Aria has more savory crepe choices but I prefer the one at Bellagio over Aria because the servers are more attentive and chefs are more professional. Besides, the one at Bellagio has the nice chocolate fountains.  I give this place a 4, but I would give dessert crepes 5 stars."}
{"text":"Leche de dulce was soooooooooooo good! Do it! Forgot the calories and jut enjoy. You can get any flavor and I'm sure you will love it"}
{"text":"Delicious french pastries and sandwiches.  Lots of sweets and treats.  Fun place for the kids to watch the cool chocolate fountain.  A little bit hidden behind the gardens at Bellagio but we always make a stop and get a new treat to try when we are nearby.  The almond croissant is one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"I got so excited when I came out of the guests elevators and turned to my right. OH. MY. GOD. I found heaven! *angels sing*  For the price you pay for a salad, you definitely get your money's worth. So fresh and they didn't go skimpy on the toppings! My friend at her Asian salad down to the last bite because in her words, the salad was \"ah-maz-ing\"! It wasn't your typically vinegrette.  The Caprese sandwich was just perfect. Ooey gooey mozzarella cheese topped with pesto on a bed of warm bread makes my day any day! So delicious that I'm still dreaming about it...  Last but not least, the desserts were AMAZING! Not overly sweet yet scrumptious. They were pretty light yet full of flavor. And sooooo aesthetically pleasing that it made me giddy like a little kid!  Yes please, I'd like to come back again!"}
{"text":"As I walked by, my eyes lit up and all I could say was \"oooooh\" and \"mmm.\" I knew walking in there would cost me hundreds of calories, maybe even a thousand, but I couldn't pass up all the yummy looking chocolate and pastries. I decided not to go with their chocolate because I needed something with more substance to tie me over till dinner.  I picked up their rose macaron (omfg! it's like the biggest macaron I've ever seen!!! but also the most expensive one I have ever purchased at 6.95), a napoleon, and a fruit tart.  The macaron was adorned with a very pretty sugar coated rose petal, and filled with cream and fresh raspberry. I took a bite of the petal, but it actually looks prettier than it tastes. The macaron, however, was delish. The cookie was not too sweet, and the cream and raspberry compliments it very well. The napoleon was also very good, although it was like any other napoleon I've had. I haven't had the fruit tart yet because I'm saving it for tomorrow (I can only have so much sugar in one day), but it does look good. It also comes sugar free. =)"}
{"text":"Any place associated with Tony T. has got to  be spectacular!  On a previous trip I indulged in some treat that involved almond crust and lemon curd, which is a combination I find hard to top sometimes.  Last night after my lavish Bar Masa meal, Susan D. and I ventured over here to admire the chocolates and pastries.  She bought a set of 5 truffles and I got one earl grey truffle (stamped beautifully with the word TEA all over it) and the coconut macaroons (yes macarOOns).  The truffle and one macaroon entered my mouth before I opened my front door.  The tea truffle - unique flavor and delicious.  The macaroon...well...I love coconut and I just recently made meringue-y coconut macaroons in a baking class and ate them for breakfast (eggs for breakfast, get it?)  Well, today it happened again.  I ate the remaining three macaroons FOR BREAKFAST (I pretended it was a normal pastry, it has butter and sugar like any other!) and I was deeply satisfied.  mmmmm"}
{"text":"Located beside the gardens in bellagio hotel, this little cafe hot spot is always busy. Tip of the day, while everyone is cueing (lining up) on the right, you can go around to the left and there is another register near the utensils to place your order.   Now for the food. Had to get the crepe and we decided on a dulce de leche, 10.50 plus tax. Then we watched the lady make the crepe, filling it with Carmel, powdered sugar , fold and more Carmel topped with sprinkles of shaved chocolate, whipped cream on top with a mint garnish.   Unfortunately we forgot to take a picture before we devoured it but it was one excellent crepe! There was not a bite left!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tooth's Galore!  I am a sucker for gelato and seeing a full case of it.. I simply couldn't resist!    Mango Sorbet:  It was average at best, the sorbet was too tart/ sour for my liking.   Price:  $5 or so, the usual.   Final Verdict:  Gelato not very memorable, maybe I'll come back to try the other desserts in the future."}
{"text":"Forget the desserts, the crepes are what keep me coming back! While world renown for chocolate and their cakes have visitors pulling out their cameras to snap away, one of my favorite Las Vegas traditions is heading to the Bellagio for a breakfast crepe. Whether it is savory you prefer or sweet, these calories are worth it. I recommend the banana foster. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I love more - the food or the ambiance. Jean Phillipe is such a fun place to visit just to look around; they even boast the world's largest chocolate fountain. My favorite thing to eat is the banana foster crepe.    Trying to find seating in the cafe is nearly impossible so just grab your food, make a left and grab a seat near the window overlooking the pool area."}
{"text":"Thanks to my friends who recommend this place to me!  Man.... I am totally falling in love with this place!   I am not a fan of macaron, so I can't give you any comment about the macaron.  But I tried their desserts, I am not kidding, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Chocolate!!!! Yes please!! Winner of best chocolate pastry chef in world competition!! YES AND DOUBLE YES!!!  I am a serious chocoholic....I seriously have chocolate addiction issues so when I saw this place I had to go try a chocolate pastry......diet can wait another day! I picked out the chocolatiest pastry they had which was a type of Nutella bar with chocolate fudge on top, topped with more chocolate ganache goodness!!  On to the taste....it was good...extremely good...but is it the best chocolate pastry I have had...no. Did I want to still stuff my face with it and go get another one...yes! I take off two stars because when you claim to be the best chocolate pastry chef in the world I expect you to blow my mind! If you're going to dabble in chocolate and get me all excited and ready to pay $7.50 for a pastry you had better deliver big!   All in all....pastry good....mind blowing good....no! Would I come back here? Probably yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to other people!"}
{"text":"I found a disgusting piece of hair in my breakfast sandwich (which btw is really not that good. They use kraft singles for the cheese!!!). Anyway, I told an employee about the hair; she insisted that there is no way and that I should \"prove it to her.\"  And then I told the manager...who also asked me to find the hair...and after trying to look for it for a minute (while people just stared), she asked me to sit down and find the hair. WHAT THE HECK????  Finally my husband spoke to her and complained and she finally said she would replace it (with a lot of attitude). And even then , she never gave us an actual sandwich, even after waiting 20 minutes. Another employee gave us one and said to enjoy.   This manager needs to be fired. Her name is Anna Karinana (sp?)."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but is just so-so now. The \"baristas\" have no clue how to make a cappuccino.  Ours were more like milky lattes. Unfriendly service.  Panini was good, but won't return."}
{"text":"Everything is really exquisite in appearance, but I didn't find the taste of the Snickers (too peanut-y) or the Almond Croissant (too dense) to be at the same level, especially for the price point. At least stop by to admire the artistry of the offerings though!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS.  Here are the thing I tried during my stay at the Bellagio...  Chai Tea Latte:  I came here for a simple chai tea, and ended up becoming a loyal customer here during my stay.  This Chai was DELICIOUS.  Perfectly sweet, and the best Chai Tea I've ever had*!  *Disclaimer: I am not an avid Chai Tea Latte drinker.  So take this Chai Tea Latte review with a grain of salt ;)   Red Velvet Cupcake:  WOW...can you say EPIC?!  This cupcake was perfectly moist, and just plain DELICIOUS.  Just simply PERFECT and it makes my mouth water just thinking about it!!  Okay...I have to talk about something else now because my mouth won't stop salivating!!!!!  Smoked Salmon Sandwich:  High quality smoked salmon, between two perfectly baked pieces of bread- doesn't get any better than this!  I wasn't expecting much since this place is a bakery, and I ordered fish; however, the sandwich, just like the cupcake, was EPIC.  Nutella Crepe:  O...M...G....This crepe was SO delicious.  One of the best crepes I've ever had.  Overall, this place is just amazing, and I highly suggest anyone staying in the Bellagio to give this place a try.  Even if there is a long line...WHO CARES. It's worth it... trust me ;)   Tip:  Make sure to look at all of their beautiful cakes! Maybe even snap a few photos :)"}
{"text":"\"Nobody knows the truffles I've seen.\"   George Lang This shop is beautiful. Perfectly displayed, perfectly packaged product surrounded me as I went from shelf to shelf admiring the amazing pastries and chocolates. The truffles were beautiful with a perfect bite to them. Everything in the store looked incredibly edible. I ordered two scoops of Gellato since it was over 100 degrees and we were about to hit the strip again. The Mango was fantastic and the Coconut was truly amazing. Prices were very fair for everything that I picked up. Would definitely return when back in sin city."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had a chocolate crepe and a yummy croque monsieur. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Bellagio and learned about this amazing place! Which ended up being a problem becaus we couldn't get enough, haha, we went there at least once per day and most times it was twice.   Great desserts, crepes, sandwiches and chocolate!  I loved their chocolate eclairs and chocolate cupcakes. They were delicious! I have also had the chocolate croissants and some tropical crepe which was good too.  It's hard to recommend one specific thing at Jean Philippe because they have a big variety of desserts, sandwiches, crepes and all types of flavorful and wonderful items.  Whether you're staying at the Bellagio or not, make sure you stop there while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Have you visited the younger, sleeker, sexier Jean Philippe yet?  I really think you should.  If you've already seen the original Jean Philippe at the Bellagio -- with its (in)famous chocolate fountain -- you might think you've seen all there is to see when it comes to Jean Philippe's sweet treats.    But you'd be wrong.  The new Jean Philippe in the Aria is completely different.  It's stylish and contemporary -- a work of art that seems to arise out of nowhere in the midst of the sprawling Aria casino.  There's no shortage of beautiful things to look at here.  There's also no shortage of amazing things to taste.  Although savory items such as crepes and sandwiches are available, I'm all about the gelato, chocolates, and pastries.  There's far too much to try in a single visit, so I recommend getting a few small items to sample and share.  In my case, it was an assortment of small chocolates, a raspberry macaron, as well as a small cup of hazelnut gelato.  They're all absolute perfection in terms of quality.  I doubt you can do better anywhere else in Vegas.  That's why Jean Philippe in the Aria is a must for any tourist with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I knew that I had to indulge my sweet tooth *just once* while in Vegas...  So, in typical Vegas fashion, I decided to go big or go home.  There's no better place to seriously indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe in the Bellagio, and there's no better way to indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe's pastry sampler.  For about $9, I was able to taste 3 of Jean Philippe's sublime dessert creations.  After taking a gander at the world's largest chocolate fountain (natch) and waiting in line for less than 5 minutes, I had in my hand a plate of the following:  ** A raspberry macaron stuffed with fresh raspberries and cream and dusted with powdered sugar.  I admit that I'm still a newbie in the world of macarons, but this macaron was delightful.  It had a beautiful chew -- not too tough or crumbly -- which played nicely with the juicy berries.  ** A chocolate, peanut butter, and hazelnut-filled cake lollipop.  This little package of bliss is as sinfully sweet and decadent as it sounds.  Another home run.  ** Crème brûlée.  As much as I adored the macaron and the lollipop, the crème brûlée was by far my favorite.  While I have a history of tasting some underwhelming crème brûlées -- whose burnt sugar top-layers taste like charcoal -- Jean Philippe manages to turn the crème brûlée top into a pristine pane of sugary glass.  It's absolutely miraculous to look at, and transcendent in both taste and texture.  The vanilla cream itself is also executed with care and skill.  As if these three desserts weren't enough -- they were all artfully placed on a base of pure milk chocolate.    Yeah, we finished all of it -- including the chocolate base.    (Don't judge.)  Needless to say, my sweet tooth was satisfied.  All of Jean Philippe's sugar-laden works of art are brilliant.   Next time, I want to try try Jean Philippe's crêpes and gelato.  Heck, I'll try anything Chef Philippe comes up with."}
{"text":"Yum, yum everything I tasted from here was worth every penny.  The chocolates and the gelato (tried peanut brittle and chocolate) are simply to die for.  And I am pretty picky, we have some of the best places in San Francisco.  But I was quite pleased with the unusual flavor choices.  It is a bit pricey but if it is good quality I don't regret spending the money.  Definitely made the Las Vegas experience even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM ONLINE!   I have not been to this location personally but I have tried to order online just last week. They not only messed up my order but have also been so difficult to contact. I have left multiple messages and tried to get into contact with someone in their office.   I have ongoing events in Las Vegas and I really wanted to give our guests some amazing chocolates. Our company works partly with Zappos and to be honest I was willing to partner with Jean Phillippes.   However after this incident NEVER AGAIN will my company be ordering from Jean Phillippes. I'll make sure of it."}
{"text":"The ultimate dessert and sweets confectionary.  We love the breakfast sandwiches and are totally obsessed with their desserts.  This time we had the dessert trio.  The base is a full bar of chocolate that is molded to hold a mini creme brûlée, a large cake pop and a mini raspberry macaron.  OMG so good.  We ordered not to share but we needed two, because we both wanted more more more.  I have yet to tasted something I didn't like at JPP.  Nelson you guys make some good stuff......!!!!!"}
{"text":"The place was lit up with sweet decorations and fountains of melted choco! I loved the design of the place!   The desserts were well made and they had lots of decor which was soo amazing to me. The gelato selection was off. They didnt have that many flavors at all and the price was pretty damn pricy but what can I say? it is gelato at las vegas. The taste of my pistachio gelato was amazing! Like the real thing to be real! The pastries were nice but then again, not worth the price to me. That goes for small inky dinky pastries.   I would come back!"}
{"text":"Fancy chocolate fountain. Me and my friend were up early in the morning so we went downstairs to this fancy jean Philippe store for breakfast and kind of disappointed with hot cocoa that kind of blah with no taste. I bought bags of chocolate so that I can get a Bellagio shopping bags for souvenir."}
{"text":"This cafe is situated in Aria hotel and it took us some time to locate the place. When you get there, I'm sure you will be mesmerized by the varieties of pastries, cakes, ice cream, crepes, sandwiches and many others via the display.   We decided to try out the Forest crepes (which has ham, cheese, mushroom, chipotle sauce and egg). Though it doesn't look appealing on the surface, don't be deceived by how it looks, it's really good. I don't mind eating this for breakfast everyday! (8/10) As for the Apple Almond Briche, filling is not too sweet and crust is crispy (6/10). Lastly, the cheesecake looks pretty! But....when you sliced though the white chocolate on the outside, the inside of the cheesecake has melted and it taste more like custard (4/10)  Latte and Hot Chocolate is average, nothing to rave about. I don't like it and will not want to order again. I"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 coffees, a blueberry muffin, a breakfast sandwich which was cold in the center, and the egg breakfast took 30 plus minutes. They seemed to have lost the order as they asked me what I ordered. There were no apologies for the wait. For a $40 breakfast it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Ice cream never disappointed here.  Rum rasin ice cream is always the best. Strawberries tart is perfectly sweet."}
{"text":"The chocolate crepe was pretty good but not worth the wait or the $11 price.   After waiting online for about 20 mins to place the order, we had to wait around even more because all the crepe makers were AWOL (even though they have 3 crepe making stands).  There is also very limited seating in the restaurant, so we took it to go and it was cold by the time we got it back to our room at the Vdara. The crepe itself had nothing inside it (which led my husband to wonder why they don't have a stack of crepes made and ready to be decorated).  They put chocolate sauce, brownie bits and powdered sugar on top of the crepe.  The crepe itself was average but the toppings were good, particularly the rich chocolate sauce.  My husband had gelato which he said was only ok, but it was more reasonably priced than the crepes at less than $4 per scoop."}
{"text":"I think I prefer this location to the Aria outpost.  The lines seemed shorter here and in addition to crepes and gelato, they had chocolate pastries and macarons (maybe they had these at Aria too, but I didn't see them due to aforementioned lines).  The seating is better here too - less in the actual restaurant, but plenty of nearby seating that's in the Bellagio-Vdara walkway and not a smoky casino.   I had something called \"Intense\" - chocolate mousse covered in chocolate ganache on top of a shortbread-like cookie ($7).  It lived up to its name and was rich and dark.   My husband had gelato at both JP locations and said it was about the same at both - ok but not great.  (I had a chocolate crepe at the Aria location that was good but not worth the 30 minute+ wait to get it).  I think the staff is slightly friendlier at this location too.  Plus, if there is a line at least you have the beautiful chocolate fountain to distract you!"}
{"text":"One of the rules of Vegas is, whenever possible, make everyone go through the casino.  Then perhaps they'll be lured in to do some gambling.  So, don't know where some place is?  Try the casino, that might just be where it is located!  And yup, that's where I found Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Aria!  Seems I lucked out as the line was rather reasonable when I got there for breakfast.  They seem to cater to those who know what they want, as they try to take your order along the way on the counter, so you don't necessarily get to let your eyes do the ordering.  They no longer make almond bear claws, so I opted for the ham and cheese croissant $9.95 for breakfast and an almond croissant $4.25 for later.  When I sat down to enjoy my fast breaking, I realized that they gave me the wrong pastry.  But when I showed it to the lady at the register, I was shocked that she returned the incorrectly served pastry back into the case.  Sure, I hadn't touch it, but how was she to be certain of that???  The ham and cheese was served melty warm, but paid the price in crispness lost.  It was okay but I could have done without having tried it.  (two stars)  The almond croissant on the other hand, I had it at room temperature the next day, and it was just wonderful!  Huge, well filled, crisp on the outside.  I enjoyed every bite!  (five stars)  Another day I stopped by for a pre-dinner sweet.  Also called \"Life is short!  Have dessert first!\"  This treat was their lemon meringue tart $7.  Sure their prices at first thought seem high, but I realized that generally the portion you get for the pastry isn't bad, cause they're actually larger than they look in the case.  This sweet repast wasn't too sweet, but it also seemed a bit light on lemon flavor.  There was also a surprise bit of raspberry in there.  (three stars)"}
{"text":"I tried, but I just couldn't pass by Jean Philippe Patisserie without picking up a little something for later.  So for my late night dessert treat I slowly enjoyed my smooth crisp Nutella Neapolitan $7 pre-tax.  Yum.  This storefront location opens into a hallway of the Bellagio, with seating options spilling out around the corner.  And wonder of wonders, you do NOT have to inhale smoke as you make your way through a casino to get to here.  Note for those with sensitive or developing lungs."}
{"text":"Chocolate almond croissant got smaller.  Selection of pastries are much more slim.  Aria appears to no longer have a contract with Jean Philippe.  With the price remaining the same while quality takes a hit, we will consider whether we still want to patronize patisserie at Aria and Bellagio."}
{"text":"this place is very pricey for a fast hunger fix!  BUT it is SO worth it!  the basil chix panini sandwich (warmed) is SO YUMMY, the nutella brioche was delicious as well.  management can be a little more friendlier to their employees.    how long does it take to warm a delicious pre-made sandwich?  get on top of it management!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMMMM!  A dessert lover's paradise.  The pastries here don't just look fancy, they taste fantastic!  I usually think when pastries/desserts look super fancy, they will not taste good, but that's not an issue here.  We ordered 3 to share.  They were all absolutely delicious.  I recommend the Imperial.  I also got some macaroons to take home, the chocolate one was good, but the others were just okay.  I ordered an iced mocha...it was delish as well.  This place is also great if you want to take something non-cheesy back for friends or loved ones.  They have many prepackaged items to choose from.  I like the coconut tuilles....SO good (my former boss brought me back some once).  They were out the day I went...bummer, but I got their direct number so I can now order them on the phone.  The place is very small, not that much seating, but we managed to get a spot.  Otherwise, I think there is some seating outside that is part of the hotel.  Some may say the place is pricey....but it's Vegas and it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The decor is just absolutely gorgeous, taking in all the neat artsy peices, rows of chocolates and pastries, it's overwhelming!!  I'm impressed that the food quality is consistant, since the first store is at the Bellagio, I expected a few discrepancies, but nope! The food was just as good here - I had the Banana foster which was so yummy. As always, this place was a bit pricey but quality over quantity!"}
{"text":"Oatmeal golden Raisin Cookie is Legit!!!  I realize that getting all excited over a cookie is kinda lame but believe me when I say this was the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had!  It was a perfect mix of butter, brown sugar, oatmeal, raisins and more butter!"}
{"text":"My gf loves their almond croissants, so flaky! I tried their sticky buns, flaky and light too!   Also got her a bar of nougat w/ pistachios, loved it! Grabbed a container of that coconut cracker thing and guess what? She loved it!! Can you see a trend? LOL  We've been here lots of times and just looked and was turned off by the prices, big mistake. This place is worth every dollar! You can taste the difference. On previous trips we did buy the chocolate bars and of course we liked it.   Can't come to Vegas without stopping in!"}
{"text":"Love their plain and Almond croissants.  Triple Chocolate cake was pretty good as well.  Palmier was delicious!   I also had a Nutella brioche.  It was not as good as other pastries that I had tried, so I give them 4 stars.  But over all I love this place :)"}
{"text":"I had their gelato and thought it was good but nothing spectacular about it. I had better one before. Maybe I need to try out their pastry and sandwich the next time I am back. Overall, I will give this place another try."}
{"text":"Pros: The desserts are delicious with excellent presentation! The location is in en route to the Aria lobby with the hustle and bustle of casinos. The chefs are dressed very professionally with their chef hats with neatly placed pastries. I got the fruit tart which was a perfect balance of sweet, cream, and crunch. It really depends on what you get but my limited experience tells me it is from upper middle to high-end quality and taste. There is also seating area that allows you to be a part of the high-paced action without having to move or get entangled in it. Enjoy your dessert and take in the good life!  Cons: As you may expect, the desserts are priced on the higher end but for the quality, I think it's worth the money for a snack or two that won't break you wallet.   Overall: Highly recommend this place for a light dessert and seats for people watching!"}
{"text":"Nutella brioche + Chocolate croissant = perfect petit dejeuner (small breakfast)  The brioche at Jean Philippe is perfectly soft, buttery, and delicious with a beautiful nutella center that makes you quite childish and happy.  The chocolate croissant is wonderfully flaky and layered with what tastes and feels like hundreds of thin buttery and crispy sheets of pastry that is unlike any other croissant I have ever had (including France and Switzerland).  It is the umami version of texture...layered, airy, and crunchy glory!    Two or three wonderful pastries with some coffee/tea and have an indescribable experience here or you can go to a brunch buffet and stuff yourself silly with warmed food platters...choose wisely!"}
{"text":"When a waiter in any restaurant asks us if we'd like dessert after our meal, we usually respond, \"No, thanks.\"   What we really mean is, \"ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?! WHY THE HELL WOULD WE EAT DESSERT FROM YOUR PLACE, WHEN WE CAN JUST TAKE A SHORT TRIP TO JEAN PHILIPPE PATISSERIE?!?!?!\"  whew... moving on...  ... okay, so not only is the place clean, neat, and full of the most nicely decorated pastries and snacks, but there's also plenty of seating within a few feet of the venue itself. Nice views + good snack = happy me!  The lines wrap around the kiosk, but the pump you out pretty quickly (yet courteously).   PLEEEAASSEEE make this a stop on your next visit to vegas. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"YO! This muthaflippin place is good! It isn't good for watching weight late night, but screw it! Vegas, right?! Right?! LOL Count me back for more gluttony!"}
{"text":"I should dock you a star for being on the Bachelorette.  I should dock myself a star for watching the Bachlorette.  Still, your food's excellent.  Good coffee, flakey croissants, and even your crepe was good.  Kind of expensive.  I guess Vegas gets your cash one way or another."}
{"text":"I just left this place ten minutes ago out of frustration. I was planning to buy chocolates, macarons, and drinks but ended up leaving. I am a dark skinned Indian girl for reference. I waited 10 minutes for a gentleman to finish up with his customers only to get passed over not once but twice afterwards for white people despite being next in line. The woman who worked there just looked at me and moved on. When I said something she paused looked at me and then went back to talking the white family she passed me over for.  I am never coming here again."}
{"text":"If you hate sweets - just go look.  It's eye candy beyond being delicious.  I personally prefer the location at Aria (not Bellagio).  It has gelato, chocolates, pastries, and more.  The selection is incredible.  My top 3 picks: 1.  The minitature hand decorate cakes - amazing present for someone special 2. The pastries - plenty to choose from (all at a great price)  3. The truffles - a beautiful box containing beautifully crafted truffles.  I consider this a must visit on a Vegas trip.  Quick visit, great value, declious product."}
{"text":"it's pricey. let's just say it and get it out there and then there's no surprises at the cash register.  then again, you're in vegas, so really, it's all relative.  and believe me when i say, the minute your mouth tastes one of the cakes from this place...all thoughts of anything negative will magically disappear....you'll forget that you gained way too many calories at the buffet, that you lost way too much money at the casino, and are going to spend way too many hours at the gym working off everything you did do yourself this weekend.  if you're lucky, you can get the people you're with to split and share. (make sure you get one cake/person...and THEN split and share...)"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite stops for a quick bite, particularly if we have Aria resort credit that we need to spend. I used to only get the baked goods and some chocolates to go for friends and family back home (I like the bear claw in particular), but I recently tried the crepes which I really like. We had a savory one with ham, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms that was great. It also came with a side of greens and baby tomatoes. Our favorite dessert crepe is the one that has the vanilla custard cream on the inside with the mixed berry sauce drizzled on top. The lines are always busy whenever I go but they do a good job moving the customers through quickly. It's definitely pricey though!"}
{"text":"I bought some gelato and loved it. I had the Butterfinger gelato and savored it. They have many different flavors, so check them out."}
{"text":"What can I say really? The desserts here are seriously a work of art, and taste like pure ecstasy. I always say I NEED to come here every time I go to Vegas but I always forget!! Ahhhh curse my soul! But FINALLY I made.... But I took them to go and brought them back to California with me... I guess not everything stays in Vegas...   I tried the Rose Macaron and The Key lime Tart, both very delicious! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I stop here and pick up some pastries! The cheese danish and cherry danish are my favorite. If you love chocolate try the almond chocolate croissant. I have also would recommend one of their breakfast sandwiches. Everything is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow...  Wow...  Wow...  Gentlemen... if you want to see a girl get really, really excited without buying her something that sparkles, this is where you take her.  Presentation: AMAZING Taste: Formidable. Surprising. Well balanced. Price: Fair, especially for the quality of food you are receiving.   A heavenly culinary experience - I would say that everyone should experience this place at least once in their lifetime.  Bravo...."}
{"text":"Excellent place for delicious pastries, chocolate cravings and any sweetness. Go check the amazing cascading chocolate."}

{"text":"The chocolate at jean philippe is amazing.  This location has different boxes than at bellagio.  The ones here are blue.  When I was there they had some unique chocolate sculptures on display.  Near this hotel are a couple of art galleries worth checking out - sculptures and glass."}
{"text":"This dessert shop is located on the Aria next to the Zarkana theater.   There is a wide array of deserts from gelatos and sorbets to crepes to the chocolates, macarons, and candies from most patisseries as well as cakes and baked goods.   I was excited to check this space because the displays are so intricate and impressive. I figured the actual deserts would be better than most. After dinner in the Cosmopolitan, I came here with a friend to celebrate his birthday.   Berry gelato is my go-to and it was tart, the way I like it. Too tart for my fiance. He really liked the cinnamon roll which they heated for him. Those were probably the best oc what we ordered.   The macarons were disappointing for $2.25. The cappuccino was bland and the raspberry lacked jam so it only tasted like raspberry essence. The chocolate was only a little better. At least the strawberry piece had fruit filled jam inside. My fiance's chocolate cake was too rich.   Overall, there was a wide variety but it was definitely disappointing. I wouldn't mind paying these prices for high quality dessert but it just didn't measure up. I wonder if done of the newly made desserts are better in the morning.   Service was slow. We had to wait in 3 different lines and it was inefficient. Seating is available and self-selected. Remember to bus your own tables."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than having pastries at 5AM after coming back from the club. The new Jean Philippe at Aria looks better than the one in Bellagio, but the cream fountain in Bellagio is a nice touch. I was tempted to try everything, so I got 6 cakes to my room and tried each one of them:)"}
{"text":"The sites and smells of chocolate and pastries weaken me! I had to get a quick bite before I got my gamble on. And why oh why did we come to Jean Philippe's?? I could hardly contain my self around the sweetness. I did good grass hopper. I was able to limit myself to the turkey crepe. It was yummy and curbed me from the decadent creations. I had to walk away quickly afterwards. I didn't even have a sweet crepe - what gives with me and this self control? Not even a to go bag for later (major pat on the back). I may break when I return. This might not be pretty. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Gelato Review ...  Stopped by for a little gelato.  They were (in order of preference):  Coconut - Terrific, with lots of coconut bits ... think Mounds bar.  Creamy and sweet, without being overly sweet.  Pistachio - Very, very good ... but probably a bit overshadowed by the coconut I was having at the same time.  Cappuccino - Good coffee flavor, but typical of most gelato places (not bad, but not something I'm likely to remember in a week or two)."}
{"text":"NOM - tried the \"Snicker\" this trip...so good!!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"drastically expensive compared to even new york prices, but very good ."}
{"text":"For the past three times that we were in Vegas this summer, we had been dying to try JP. During our most recent stay at the Cosmopolitan, we could not let the chance to try JP slip by, so we decided to come to Aria next door.  Have you ever found your eyes sparkling as you come across beautiful dessert decoration? We were wowed. However, once we had our first bite of their Napoleon cake, tasted their gelato, and drank their tea. Disappointed? Yes, very much. Napoleon cake costs $6.90 per piece and it was just not a right dessert with flavors and texture that we were looking for. Glazed icing on top was hard and super sweet. The puff pastry was hard and heavy. The custard was thick and also very sweet. Very disheartening! Gelato was no where close to what I could buy at grocery stores. Iced tea was costly, like $4.95, and tasted like ... yea... I don't even want to go there.  The world revolving around spectacular chocolate fountains, elegantly crafted chocolates, and magnificent cake decoration ... keeps on moving and leaves no trace whatsoever of us once encountering Jean Philippe. I felt like we were duped by the whole extravagant décor and display.  Never again!"}
{"text":"The line was long in the morning but the food was worth the wait.  We had croissants and crepes here for breakfast.  The prices for these items were reasonable considering the patisserie is housed within the Bellagio.    We had the Exotic Crepe, which came with coconut sorbet and a mango-passion fruit topping.  It was definitely one of the more unique crepes I've seen on a menu within the contiguous U.S.  The warm topping was very sweet but the cooling effect of the sorbet was appreciated.  The croissant was brushed with a thin layer of sweet glaze but the glaze didn't overwhelm the light and buttery layers.  It's a great place to grab an interesting breakfast within the Bellagio without having to go for a full sit-down experience.  There is an area with tables and chairs right outside the patisserie for customers to eat their purchases."}
{"text":"woohoooooooo! there's a reason why there's ALWAYS a line from 10am to 10pm... or as long as they are opened.... i always like their stuff and was so happy to see it during my stay at Aria...  sandwich, pastry, chocolate, drinks... yummy... everything is good! and oh the decor was so pretty that i can take million photos there!  ya it's expensive... i paid more then 35 bucks for one coffee, a muffin, a danish, two sandwiches.... but.... it's Vegas!!!!!!! everything is expensive!!!! and it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!!! I say that and I did not even taste...just looked...amazing!!!  The fountain is mesmerizing...you can't help but want to dip a finger in...guess that's why all the glass. :)  Also watched crepes being made...fascinating how fast they can go. Begged a customer to pause and let me take a pic...she said that was fine...but don't ask for a taste!! lol"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is located in the Aria hotel. Spacious and have a variety of pastries.   The only sad part was the lack of french macarons options. There were only three flavors yesterday.   Overall, this place is really pretty and it smells really good."}
{"text":"We went here for a night out as a family, and let me start by saying that the chocolate fountain is amazing! We splurged and got 4 different flavors of Gelato - dulce de leche, creme brulee, oreo, and mint. The Gelato was truly delicious, however not the absolute best I have ever had. The service on the other hand was horrible... Truly the worst service I have had in a very long time. We are a friendly family and when we greeted the woman with a \"Hello! How's your evening going?\" we got a blank stare... Then when we asked if we could try a couple samples she genuinely rolled her eyes at us. May I add that we were the only people in line as this time. The only words she spoke to us were to tell us our total and even then we didn't get any eye contact. I hope that she was just having an \"off night\" but she made me feel like I was a terrible inconvenience on her evening."}
{"text":"The Truffle Box. 5, 16, or 36 pieces of chocolate perfection. While there are many good things to experience at Mr. Philippe's phenomenal patisserie, walking out of the Bellagio with that little brown box puts a smile on my face like few things on earth have the power to do. While your experience may vary, if you love truffles BUY THE BOX! You will quickly understand that there are some things so good, the English language doesn't have words to sufficiently describe it."}
{"text":"I can't stop in Vegas without stopping here... To me it's more important than the gambling and the shows!"}
{"text":"I actually like the new location at Aria. Less crowded, ample seating and there's more than one register. The layout has expanded minus the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"My wife and I again redeemed MyVegas rewards for this patisserie.  In my case it was a dessert while my wife redeemed the crepe reward.  In the past these were considered interchangeable since a dollar amount is credited to each of our MyLife slot cards, but the cashier initially wanted to limit me to an item in the dessert display case.  She backed off after I explained our past experience.  We both ordered our usual crepes, mixed berry souffle for her and the Italian for me.  Both were very good.  One note: it has been reported that the affiliation with Jean Philippe at this location and the one in Bellagio will terminate in early 2018 with his name removed though the current employees are expected to continue in their respective positions.  Hopefully, quality will not suffer."}
{"text":"Lines are confusing, there's a sign that says \"order gelato here\" above the gelato so you'd think if you were ordering something else you'd stand in a different line but it's still the same and only line that makes you pass by the gelato line anyway. There aren't prices listed for pastries but know they're pricey! The decor is beautiful in here with a cool glass chocolate fountain.   Raspberry tart: $8.50 sooo good! The raspberry balanced everything perfectly. I usually don't even like raspberries.  Chocolate eclair: $8.50 my boyfriend liked this but I didn't think it was anything special to be $8.50  Flan: $7.5 DO NOT RECOMMEND. If you've ever had regular flan it is 10x better than this. This \"flan\" doesn't taste like flan, it's solid and doesn't have the slickness that regular flan has. Really plain, there's barely any flavor. If you try to really break down the flavor it reminds me of a sponge cake. Not worth."}
{"text":"You guys? When you're in Vegas you need to, NAY...MUST GO TO Jean Philippe Patisserie.   There are two locations that my husband and I have been to, the location in the Bellagio with the streaming chocolate fountain from the ceiling and the location in Aria.   We prefer the location in Aria since it is a larger location and has tons more seating. The Bellagio location is cramped with very little seating. But both locations have their draw so if you have the chance, visit both!  The patisserie offers an array of items from donuts, to crepes, to ice cream to coffee/espresso to gourmet sandwiches. I haven't had a sandwich from here, but we can attest to the desserts and coffee. Magnificent. Everything looks fake in the pastry cabinets! They're all so perfectly displayed.  The patisserie also offers pre-boxed confections that we've also purchased to bring home. They keep well and have traveled with us back to Florida without any issue.  I'm deducting one star because of their ordering process. They have different ordering counters for different items. One counter for crepes, one for coffee and desserts, one for ice cream etc. etc. And while this does make sense to break up the crowd, most people don't realize what they're doing and tend to stand around clogging up the main entrance. So, more signage is needed in my opinion."}
{"text":"I only gave it 2* because the food and pastries actually taste good. I would have given it 1* for product availability and service. Here's our experience: a bit before 2pm we tried to get some croissants.  They were out of both plain and chocolate croissants.  Then, we thought we should get some real food and tried to get some omelettes. Guess what? They were \"out of omelettes\".  But the worst thing came when my husband ordered a crepe without whipped cream. He really hates that stuff so he mentioned it twice. He was offered a crepe with whipped cream, but when the crepe preparer saw his face, she realized what the problem was. So, IN FRONT OF US, she took the whipped cream from the crepe WITH HER HAND (gloved, thank God!) and rhetorically asked \"Is it ok?\" My huband said \"no\" so she took the plate, wiped a bit more of whipped cream and added some sugar on top, then gave it to him. In the mean time, I'm getting us some coffee and tea. I asked for honey, and, you guessed,  they were out. I asked them to make the coffee less hot; it was stil hot. The manager was nice, apologized for everything and found some honey for me. We are still very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe has the best gelato, crepes, and croissants!!!!!! We stay in the aria sky suites a couple times a year and always stop here!!!!! The service and food is great!!!!! I would recommend this place to everyone who visits."}
{"text":"Cool selection of great looking chocolates, pastries, etc. But it didn't completely follow through for the high price tag.  I found the coffee really weak too.  Good but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Oh. Ma. Gawd. It was our last day in Vegas, and we wanted something brunchy. There was a big line but it moved fast--they were SUPER efficient. We each got a crepe: salmon, italian, and forest. Italian was the winner here; they also had run out of salmon, and offered to replace it with mushrooms but it was still kinda bad. The crepes were pretty huge, I'm a big eater and I couldn't even finish it. Delicious and very pretty to display!  We bought gelatos beforehand and brought them the receipt so we didn't have to wait in line again. Hazelnut had WHOLE hazelnuts in it. OMG, yum. JPP Road (aka Rocky Road) was delicious with big chunks of brownie/chocolate and marshmallow; the fruit one (I can't remember the name, it's a fruits of the forest flavor) was divine.  So all-in-all a great meal!"}
{"text":"Sampled the hazelnut, tiramisu, pistachio gelato and decided NOT to get any. They were creamy buttery lacking flavor. The creme brulee was ok. My friends did like their sorbets.  Chocolate fountain was kind of cool.  There are better gelato places than this. I liked Sugar and Ice in Wynn Hotel."}
{"text":"Things here are priced a bit higher than your average place but given that it's a brand name, and we're in Vegas, they try to justify it.   Gelato was delicious! I had the chocolate one and the pricing was fairly reasonable for a gelato place on the strip. Macaron wise, I'd still give the crown to Bouchon.   Great place to stop in for a quick snack to satisfy the sweet tooth! Seating here is better than the Bellagio location."}
{"text":"I have made it a tradition where every time I come to Vegas, I have to stop by Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria and get a ham and cheese croissant.   BEST Croissant EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM YUM! Everything is super pricey but it's Vegas and so worth it!   My friends got some sandwiches, I forgot which ones but they were extremely tasteful too!   Only sucky part was after you make your order the area for pick up is pretty tight. You gotta push and shove your way through a little, but that won't make me bring 1 star down! :)"}
{"text":"Almond croissant, almond brioche and chocolate croissant are awesome here! Both the plain brioche and Nutella brioche were also great."}
{"text":"This is the most elegant patisserie I've ever seen.  It's not possible to walk by without noticing your mouth water and eyes widen.  The patisserie was right by the elevators to our room.  Given the beautiful pastries, gelato, salads & sandwiches coupled with the $50 dining voucher that accompanied our room reservations, my boyfriend and I caved in to the temptation.  Day 1:  He had the tropical crepe with vanilla gelato.  WOW.  I had the almond croissant.  AMAZING.  Day 2: He had the roast beef sandwich and I had the chicken caesar salad with sun-dried tomatoes.  I've never had sun-dried tomatoes in my caesar before.  It was good.   Warning: VERY EXPENSIVE! (but worth it)  I am craving the croissant right now.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"The Creme Brule gelato and key lime pie is awesome! Also love the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Nutella crepes was awesome everything just looked amazing there."}
{"text":"Excellent quick bites ( sandwiches, paninis, crepes, quiche) and excellent dessert ( crepes, gelato, fancy eclairs, tiramisu, creme brûlée). All high quality and fair price. I had basil chicken panini with caramelized onions and pesto for $12 and a one scoop gelato for $4."}
{"text":"This review is for the mushroom crepes only. It's a huge portion enough to feed 2. It was pretty good. They have a crepe station and they cook it in front of you. I would come back here again for the crepes only.  Didn't care too much for the pastries."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place.  The Bellagio is a great hotel and casino in Vegas, and having Jean Philippe Patisserie in it makes it even better.  Their nutella brioche is my favorite.  Where else can you see the world's largest chocolate fountain?  All at the Bellagio.  Check out my blog post to see pictures and a short video of the fountain.    http://www.dinedelish.com/2011/07/19/jean-philippe-patisserie/  Thank you, Dine Delish"}
{"text":"When we all go to Vegas, we go because it makes us feel a certain way. The sights, the sounds, even the smells all give us a feeling of excitement and fun. One place that always give me the happy juices flowing is Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie. Something about the design and the colors of this bakery shop makes me happy. I have been to the Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie in Bellagio, and was pleased with the one in Aria as well. Their amazing concoctions of sweets and pastries wowed me the first time around. The one in Aria though, they had a mildly different approach. Serving more food like items, including sandwiches and pastries, they had more of a variety here. Not only were their pastries and desserts delicious, their sandwiches were amazing as well.  We ordered the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich. I am a self proclaimed lover of salted cured meats, and prosciutto might be one of my favorite. This sandwich, though it could have used a lot more prosciutto, was a favorite. Don't let my greediness for more meet fool you -- it had plenty of it. The saltiness along with the mild and creamy mozzarella was a match so perfect and clean. The bread was a bit crusy for my liking, but it was still fresh and had a nice texture to it. The touch of basil inside was a perfect addition and made everything come together -- a good snack to share.  We can't go to Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie and not get something for our sweet tooth. The white chocolate cheesecake was calling my name. It looked so nice and professionally made -- I didn't want to break the shell. Once broken into, the creaminess of the inside and the sweetness of the outside made for a nice treat. The round chocolate ball on top was the best.  It had a deep chocolate flavor and resembled something of a truffle and a moose.  It was a very delicious dessert and a nice indulgence.  The Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie in Aria seemed more toned down.  Being more of a regular coffee and dessert shop, their sandwiches were a nice addition to the menu. Though it was larger than the one in Bellagio, it didn't seem like it had the glitz and the glam -- it surely didn't have the chocolate fountain of all chocolate fountains.  Still, Jean-Philippe seems to draw in all the crowds.  Having prime location right next to the elevators and main casino floor, this is a popular spot for anyone looking for a sweet snack. Once again, Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie delivered the good stuff."}
{"text":"It was ok... the chocolate waterfall was kinda cool. Their coconut ice cream in the exotic crepe was good. The Napoleon was old stale tasting."}
{"text":"I came here twice with my family after eating dinner while waiting for our late night show. The lines were really long both times we were here, but my family loves pastries. The gelato did not taste like gelato, I didn't eat more than a few bites of the nougat, but the coffee and chocolate covered strawberries are delicious! My parents got two small pastries that they seemed to enjoy. The best part about the patisserie is looking at all the pretty pastries!"}
{"text":"I always loved their pastries and cakes and gelato and crepes ... and everything! They are not just perfect looking but amazingly good tasting, too. Because of that, ordering can take little long, but at the end, waiting is well worth it. My personal favorite is the Chocolate mousse with fresh raspberries. I order this every time I am here! It's dark chocolate covered real chocolate mousse. I have to say \"real chocolate mousse\" because so many shops are selling imitations! Unfortunately so many people can't tell the difference. But there is a HUGE difference! Anyway, quality is absolutely a priority here. I can tell you that here you can be assured, NOT assumed, that everything is always fresh.  I also like their Napoleons. The fine layers of pastry filled with a light cream. Love it!  The location is \"hidden\" behind the Conservatory. Lots of people don't walk away from the garden area. I keep telling my friends to make sure to walk behind the garden, to see the giant chocolate fountain!  Everyday is a happy day here!"}
{"text":"I think this place is over rated.  I like the ambience and the decorations. Definitely 5 stars for that.  Their crepes and pastries are decent.  I thought their gelato used to be good but well.. They were just ok. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"heaven.  if you know about MOF's then you HAVE to come here. each dessert was delicate and beautifully balanced. each flavor pops in your mouth but then blends so well together bite after bite.  individual pastries cost about $6.50 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Chocolate foodies dream.....Godiva who? Lol....But in all seriousness fantastic chocolate Ever! I'm attempting to figure out how too get stuff mailed to me has we speak."}
{"text":"Prior to a very late dinner we stopped here to take some desserts to go so we could enjoy them after dinner! Most people were getting ice cream but we purchased 3 decadent desserts! A dessert called Intense with rich chocolate and a pink French macaron topping it, a white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, and a double chocolate mousse.  After our late dinner at Noodles we headed back to our hotel room and enjoyed these as a happy birthday treat for my boyfriend. They were beyond amazing! All of them were rich and melt in your mouth delicious.  We will absolutely make our back here next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Coffee, Nutella Brioche, Chicken Crepe, Apple Sensation!!! My geez they were all sensational alright!!!   The coffee wasn't the best cup of coffee I've ever had so that was just alright. Please forgive cause we broke lent.. There was no diet over here while we were on holidays! The Nutella Brioche was lovely but I couldn't have eaten that whole thing myself. Of all the things we ordered, the Chicken Crepe was the best!!! & Apple Sensation crepe for our dessert at 10am was the best idea ever! I only wish we ordered everything else.. next time!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. This place is heaven. Take a break from crazy Vegas and come treat yourself."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for breakfast one morning and picked up a Vanilla Napoleon and a Nutella Brioche.  The Napoleon had pretty nice puff pastry in it. It was flaky, crispy, and had a pleasant slightly burnt/roasted flavor to it. The custard was pretty bland though. Its texture was creamy and thick, but it could've been sweeter and more eggy. I couldn't taste any vanilla either.   The Nutella Brioche also wasn't very impressive. There's tons of Nutella stuffed inside which is never a bad thing, but the brioche was kind of hard and pretty dry. It was also missing that strong buttery flavor which makes a good brioche so enjoyable.   Yes, the chocolate fountains are cool, but at the prices they charge for their baked goods, they should taste better."}
{"text":"The first day we went they had sold out of their nutella brioche ... They said they wud get more in the next day at 7 am...so w went the next day n finally got it...the brioche was buttery n it was adorned with nutella on top n.plenty of it in the middle...while it was good (cuz everything is better with nutella) it was nothing special...we also tried the chocolate mint gelato which was delicious...very refreshing for a hot day n a sizeable scoop  Brioche $4 Gelato $5.25  Also bring ur camera...there is plenty to see including the worlds largest chocolate fountain & a large marshmallow train :D"}
{"text":"First of all, the staff/chefs are excellent and very pro. They all live up to the standard of Jean Philippe. I've tried their hot chocolate and crepes before, and they were heavenly. Now, my wife was hungry as we missed dinner, and the line for crepes was long, so we picked up a tuna panini to go. Oh boy, was I in for a surprise when we bite down after we got back to our hotel. The bread was still fresh and crunchy, the tuna ain't your usual cheap canned tuna (which most places do) as it was fresh, full of aroma, and very very tasty. It is, by continental far to be the best tuna sandwich/panini I've ever had! It is worth every penny of almost 1,200 of it. Oh, did I mention their hot chocolate? It ain't cheap for a VERY good reason. You won't find one as smooth anywhere else, and as chocolaty, yet not too sweet. Don't just take picture of the cool chocolate fountain, get a hot chocolate! They should have something that say \"Be Calm and Drink Hot Chocolate\"."}
{"text":"Ever since going to the Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio for the first time back in 2007, I've always wanted them to open another location somewhere else in Vegas. In 2007, I stayed at the Bellagio so it was convenient to come here. However, all the other years, I've stayed in different places so Bellagio was always sort out of the way.   UNTIL!!!! They opened this in the Aria, the hotel I stayed at back in April. I was excited that I can come downstairs from my room and have my desserts whenever I wanted. Turns out I was wrong. It's closed early. Long lines and the logistics for lines are stupid. You go up to the counter and order, then you stand aside for 45 minutes to get your order, blocking those who are trying to order. There's a narrow gallery line for you to stand in, so not much space. Seating is difficult, you're standing there waiting for someone to leave, but everyone saves their seats and blah blah blah.   Food is pricey here but I don't mind it, that's not my complaint, my complaint is that the food is small for what you pay for. We got a croque monsieur, my husband got some breakfast sandwich and we got macarons to go, it took over an hour to get! Our cup of orange juice was $5 and it was made for an infant, it was so tiny.   So I say come here when there's no line (But we stayed at the Aria and always saw a line here!) and later in the day. However, they close at 5, so make sure to not come here tooooo late."}
{"text":"Heavenly sweets!  Stays open late, perfect for a break from all that gambling.  The tiramisu and the imperial are our usual favorites.  One can have breakfast here too.  And draft java is now being served."}
{"text":"No enough words to described this heavenly dessert place. Their desserts selection is phenomena, which includes crepes, gelato, chocolates & many desserts. Every dessert is made with perfection, the detail of each dessert are hand crafted to bring satisfaction to your eyes. It looks so beautiful that it's hard for you to even want to destroy it & put it into your mouth.   Their gelato comes in many flavors and the creation is prefect as well.  The taste of every flavors is exactly what the name of gelato is called. Their sandwiches and pastry is also great, so is their coffee. This place is great for desserts lover & someone who has a sweet tooth.  You can also order online at jpchocolates.com :)))"}
{"text":"Another location that is also located inside the Belliago Hotel.  This location has a larger varieties of sweet than the one in the Belliago.  To find out all the package pastry is actually made in this located and transported to Belliago.  It's a Dessert Heaven for Sweet Lovers..."}
{"text":"A few friends and I tried the one in Aria on August 15, 2011. This place has a wide selection of chocolates, crepes, pastries and salads.  I tried the passion fruit crepe and it was good. I liked the coconut sorbet more than the crepe itself lol.  The desserts here are for sweet tooth lovers, but the price is more expensive than other dessert places/crepes.   We did walk by the one in Bellagio and it looked a bit bigger. The chocolate fountain was literally eye candy haha.  3 stars based on the prices, long wait (one person making crepes and the cashier watching??), and most important customer service could have been better.  This is Vegas... you got to pay to play."}
{"text":"A must stop for anyone in Vegas! My friends and I came here for brunch on our last day in Vegas, and it was the perfect ending to our trip.   The food was magnificent.   1. Exotic Soufflé-Style Crepe: I've never had a dish like this before. My mind and taste buds were completely blown away by the combination of the warm crepe, tart pineapple/mango/passion fruits, and refreshing coconut sorbet. Tip: Get this instead of the exotic crepe, which is more dry and bland because the crepe has no filling.   2. Veggie Wrap: As common as veggie wraps are, this one stood out. The sauce was absolutely amazing.   The ambiance was magical. It took us a while to get out food, but that was no issue for us.  We watched different types of chocolate flow down into glass plates and create the world's tallest chocolate fountain. We admired a statue of a lady whose dress was made out of fondant. (my friend joked that she would want to wear it to her wedding).  We watched the skilled employees make the various types of crepes as we were waiting for out food, making it a fun experience. There were also a fancy seating area near the patisserie with large dining tables. This was convenient.   Jean Philippe is a gem that must be a part of your next Vegas foodventure!"}
{"text":"Being this is a Gelato made outside of Italy, it was very good... I mean VERY good... Too bad for me as I will always come here to get one... The hazelnut was crisp and right on... These people do know how to do it!! The place is clean, and nice... The chocolate fountains falling from the ceiling are simply spectacular... Come and enjoy a great treat..."}
{"text":"So disappointed...had a craving and rushed through traffic before they closed. We made line and family ahead of us was paying for their Gelato which we wanted to eat so bad and no one else in line but us. Instead one of their staff just slammed down in our face station closed sign they had out there and that's it and walked away. I understand they were closing but it would have been nice if he said \"oh that family was the last client served sorry for the inconvenience\". Never coming back not friendly and I didn't get my gelato."}
{"text":"Great location. Service was a bit off. Felt like they were trying to make you hurry. I tried the almond brioche and flan. Both were good, but I think Duchess bakery in Edmonton is still better."}
{"text":"we came to ogle the famous chocolate fountain and ordered  gelato crepe - excellent gelato in both taste and texture!  insane line!"}
{"text":"nice new location inside the Aria with beautiful displays and long lines. we ordered   chocolate croissant croissant almond croissant bear claw blueberry tart nutella brioche  everything was good, but the croissants were heavily glazed (to keep fresh?) very expensive for the pastries received."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. My wife and I got a cinnamon roll, Brioche with Nutella, and a Latte. Everything was great and there are tables along the windows with nice views."}
{"text":"The GF looked up this place so we stopped by on our first night and swooped some dessert. What a good find in the Bellagio. The reviews/ratings don't disappoint.  Brief Summary -- In the very busy Bellagio -- World's largest chocolate fountain (and coolest) -- A lot of different items on their menu -- Snickers Cake = O-M-G Delicious -- Yummy 1/2 chocolate/white chocolate covered strawberries  What doesn't this place have?! On one side you have desserts and the other side you have all different types of food, coffee, and beverages. In addition to gelato and crepes, they have a vast selection of pre-packaged items ranging from chocolate to cookies to rock candy.  We ended up getting 2 strawberries dipped in 1/2 chocolate/white chocolate, a snickers cake and the napoleon. The chocolate was good and the strawberries were ripe and delicious. The GF liked her Napoleon. She says it was light and not too sweet. It's basically like a vanilla cream wafer type dessert with a cookie on top? I didn't try it myself.  The winner for me was my Snickers cake. Caramel chocolate wrapped in a hardened chocolate cylinder. topped with some really tasty, toasted almonds and a weird marshmallow. It was awesome! It tasted similar to a Snickers but more refined and way lighter but so delicious.   If you're in the Bellagio, stop by and try something!"}
{"text":"The service is almost non-existence, the servers are slow and inefficient, and everything is hella expensive but OMG the croissants were huge and delicious. There was a light glaze of sweetness on the outside and the inner layers were warm and buttery. Now as for the chocolates, $2 for a tiny square? I kinda think it was worth it, at least, for the 5 that I picked out anyways.   5 stars for the croissants. Haven't tried much of anything else that I was worth paying the extra dollars for."}
{"text":"the man is an artist. i had the oreo, white chocolate, dark chocolate cheesecake. the cheesecake (very very light, it's whipped) comes in a purse made entirely of white chocolate with a dark chocolate truffle on top. there is an oreo cookie crust at the bottom. it was delicious.  everything there looks great and runs about 5.50-7.00. i do not consider this to be pricey as many people do, because you will pay about 6 dollars for a piece of chocolcate cake at tgi fridays that is probably made from betty crocker. these are delicious and labor intensive with very fresh ingredients. plus, they look great. i'd also imagine someone would love to recieve one as a gift."}
{"text":"So, i'm at the blackjack table at 7 in the morning and I meet this guy who lives in Vegas.  We play for about an hour, and he asks me if i'm hungry.  I say OF COURSE! and he says he will take me to get the best panini's in vegas.  We take the monorail and travel through the bellagio, etc.  I got a tour basically and and the end, was treated to some really great panini's.  I got the prusuittio panini and i'm not a huge fan of prusuitto but this was pretty good.  There was some sort of dressing/sauce on it and the bread was perfect.  I love panini bread!!!  It was a pretty big sandwich, so i brought 1/2 back to my hungover girlfriend :)"}
{"text":"Home to the world's largest chocolate fountain...what more do I need to say?  I didn't actually buy anything for myself but I purchased a box of chocolates as a souvenir for someone (who enjoyed them a lot and decided to keep the box because it was so unique).  However, all the chocolate pieces, cakes, cookies, crepes and gelato made some good eye candy.  I am definitely gonna come back to try some of their goodies next time ;)"}
{"text":"Love it!! The chocolate fountain and beautiful cakes are amazing! Hubby bought me a box of 16 truffles and I ate them in two days. Save it- I know you've done that too! Hubby also got a bag of coffee and they ground it for us since we don't have a grinder. Very nice!  Didn't eat here but the chocolate is outstanding- especially the Grand Marnier truffle. Yum!"}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until a friend told me about it! It's located in the Bellagio right next to the themed gardens, really close to the parking garage so it's a short walk away.  Just looking at the bakery made my jaw drop in awe! The chocolate fountain was so crazy looking, and the chocolate itself looked silky and smooth flowing down. All the decorative cakes on display were PERFECT and expensive looking. I was amazed!  This place gets PACKED and there are so many options for you to choose from I didn't know where to begin.. even though I was yelping through my blackberry, too many items were listed! I ended up choosing a ham and cheese croissant (gotta love em) and an almond brioche, as well as a strawberry rice krispy ball my friend recommended. The H&C was delish! Buttery croissant with baked cheese on the outside, and white cheese and ham on the inside. Quite good! The almond brioche was just okay, again, very buttery. Strawberry rice krispy was yummy, the strawberry flavor didn't taste artificial at all! Side note: the individual bags the pastries were in soaked through completely.. which means.. extreme oil!  I don't know what I was thinking, but I didn't order a crepe or purchase any of their chocolates :\ the line for a crepe alone looked long.. but they smelled so good! Next time I'm here, totally going for a crepe even if it's a 30 min wait. I also loved the boxes and bags they packaged everything in.. so cute and chic!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Ended up eating there twice in two days. The first day I ordered the key lime tart which was very good. The second day I ordered the white chocolate , chocolate, Oreo cheesecake which was AMAZING!!!! I want to try everything!!!"}
{"text":"This is my must have every time we come to Las Vegas! Desserts here are amazingly beautiful and equally delicious. I would recommend anything chocolate and the raspberry tart. Recently my boyfriend ordered the Snickers and it was so great, way better than the candy bar so much more decadent."}
{"text":"Caprese sandwich was amazing! $10.95 for a sandwich doesn't seem too bad for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner while walking the Strip and I had redeemed for a free pastry from MyVegas. Everything looked so good and pretty.  We ended up choosing the Snickers Cake. It was not too sweet, but didn't really taste like a Snickers.  I'm glad I tried it, but it was just okay."}
{"text":"Located at the Bellagio, the small of the two on the strip. Most of their items were sold out for the night, so I decided on ice cream & macaroons. The pistachio ice cream was great, it actually taste like pistachios & you could taste golden nuts if pistachios throughout the ice cream. The raspberry macaroons were very tart & a bit to jaw biting for my taste, great color though."}
{"text":"I think I could eat here all day. We tried it for breakfast. The crepes and omelettes are excellent, but the service/delivery system is slow. You wait in a long line to pay then go wait for the omelette and crepes. They also offer smoothies and coffee. The panini and breakfast pastries are excellent as well. However, the chocolates and desserts are the real treat. They look amazing and taste even better. Save the money by skipping the expensive desserts at restaurants and stop by here."}
{"text":"Employees behind the counter need more training and are not helpful. I would expect more from a place in Aria. Their attitude was apathetic to customers and you could easily tell they all didn't want to be there. Food was mediocre and all three types of salad dressing were terrible. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Who can take a sunrise, Sprinkle it with dew? Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two. Jean Philippe can....Hehe the Patisserie is a gorgeous sight. Where people walk by and have Willy Wonka fantasies of being Augustus Gloop....the symbol of gluttony to drink from the never ending flow of chocolate waterfalls cascading from one dish to another. The shop has a huge variety of truffles, chocolates, gelato, sorbets, and pastries.  You can also have a custom cake made. The pastries are best if you go before 8pm. Usually there's hardly anything left by 10pm.  I've had this decadant chocolate clair which the chocolate just explodes in your mouth coating it with extacy. The cheesecake, tastes like cheesecake. Not overly sweet, small so you feel less guilty, and covered in white chocolate gives a harmonious balance to the palate. His assortment of chocolate easily rivels Voges.  They do have sandwiches and stuff. The crepes are pretty fantastic. I had the bananas foster with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. It's not on the menu --- you gotta order it with your creativity. Mmmm it was great with the berry sorbet. Yes....that's made in house too! This place is definitely chocolate heaven. It's really cool to see everyone's reaction when they come in.  \"Mommy look at the chocolate!\" (Pointing at the chocolate falls)  \"I wanna eat it all!\" \"Yea me too!\"   Eh....kids=petri dish"}
{"text":"Oh boy, Foodies, BEWARE!  This is a must for the even pleasant SUGA BUZZ.  When just outside the entrance is this luring and mesmerizing ceiling to floor dark, milk, and white chocolate drizzle foundation from pooled glass leaves cascading onward to the next lower level.  Desperate for a coffee & breakfast (before chocolate) I ordered Prosciutto Baguette, Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil Pesto & that Coffee on Desperation!  All devoured, sadly no chocolate, maybe tomorrow.  Off to the gym to burn off the Chocloateless guilt."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is the absolute best:-) Only downside is the long lines. The food and coffee is outstanding! Some of my favorites are the yogurt parfets, the salads, and the french macaroons."}
{"text":"I was staying at bellagio and this was my go to place for good coffee, fresh salads, and amazing pastries! The only complaint I have is that the lines were super long. Standing for an hour to get my morning coffee did not make for a happy girl!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dessert places on the strip! Their crepes are super delicious but what I would come here for is the gelato. I highly recommend trying Oreo. It was just the perfect amount of sweetness without getting sick of it. I always always stop by here whenever I'm inside Aria. If there's a line, it usually goes by quick. I haven't tried the one inside bellagio but I'm sure it tastes the same. I had some of their pastries a while back but it wasn't anything too significant. It's all about the gelato here!"}
{"text":"Cute chocolate fountain that attracted a lot of attention, so people were clustered around, taking pics. Made it hard to wedge your way in to peruse the desserts, or even know where the line began, or to whom you could place an order with.    Long lines, which was expected, but was chaotic and confusing, because several people were being helped at once, depending if they were getting gelato or asking for a dessert. And then all those people taking pictures of the extensive chocolate fountain. I fought my way to the front, and ordered. Not sure if I was cutting anybody, but ah well. Food is a cutthroat business!   Lemon meringue tart- way too much meringue to tart ratio, although it was very cute and visually appealing. And my husband said there was some strawberry/red fruit thing at the bottom, after he ate the lemon and meringue. Not sure if it was a fluke, but this was one lemon tart he did not enjoy!   Fruit tart -- This tart I enjoyed a lot more compared to the old stale one from Cafe Madeleine at Paris. This had a smoother, creamier custard that I was hoping for, and a light crust that could hold the cream/fruit, but also be broken easily with my spoon. Very tasty.   Also sold fruit platters, coffee/tea, OJ, crepes, and sandwiches, but the sandwiches didn't seem that appealing. The big draw here were the desserts and gelato. And endless boxes of chocolates on display on nearly every wall of the place.   Expensive, but stay on the strip long enough, and the high prices don't seem that surprising anymore! Extremely limited in seating, and the few tables they do have seem to be pushed against the walls, probably to make room for the people moving around the store looking at the boxes or bags of chocolates.   Enjoyed what I got, to an extent, but was not really wowed by anything. Good, but not great."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to find this classy looking patisserie was less the fancy boutique and more a very pricy cafeteria line and a refrigerated case."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is a great place to pick up pastries and/or a quick bit without formally sitting down to eat at the Aria. Quality of pastries are good, although it has come down slightly over the years  The Ham and Cheese Croissant was very rich with the béchamel sauce. It was tasty, although a tad burnt...  Their coffee is decent, although it came out a tad too hot.  Their truffles are still decent, although they're a tad thinner than before.  Staff was mostly friendly."}
{"text":"Came by for coffee the other day and it was mediocre at best. Despite the premium pricing, coffee wasn't special...  The line for coffee was towards the back of the dessert cafe and the line moved along, albeit at a somewhat leisurely pace..."}
{"text":"Loved the Almond Croissant.  Took a small break just to relax and enjoy my surrroundings."}
{"text":"Quality on par with Bellagio but the service ruined it. The line is literally around the shops interior into the hallway. Why they don't have twice the amount of employees working is beyond me, this is the Bellagio. Its not that great of coffee they need a duken doughnuts who can bang out coffee all day quickly. Shocking such an establishment not staffing properly. Why the manager isn't ringing in transactions too is silly. The chocolate fountain was cool but you can only stand their looking at it so long."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We got the Nutella Crepe with 2 scoops of ice-cream (pistachio+ vanilla) and was sooo good."}
{"text":"Raspberry Cheesecake is by far the most amazing dessert Ive ever had!! I come to this bakery every single vegas trip. Fantastic dessert options and delicious smoothies."}
{"text":"Raspberry Cheesecake is by far the most amazing dessert Ive ever had!! I come to this bakery every single vegas trip. Fantastic dessert options and delicious smoothies."}
{"text":"Fact: This is the home of Guinness' largest chocolate fountain! What happened to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory?  I've had a variation of things here: savory crepes (merrrr), almond croissant (yum), creme brulee (so decadent and creamy), mango gelato (which in my opinion tastes more like passion fruit) and I am quite a fan. I think that Bouchon probably has a larger variation of sweets but Jean Phillippe makes and designs higher quality products. I think the location and set-up of Jean Phillippe just a little bit better."}
{"text":"Wandered through the Aria walking the strip and after seeing this place decided we had to come back. Arrived early for breakfast - got a nutella brioche and coffee combo for the reasonable price of $7 - The brioche was light and delicious. Would have loved the nutella lightened up a bit, but can't complain about pure nutella on the inside (who would!). Hubby got the cinnamon roll which looked delicious - never got a chance to try it!"}
{"text":"So flawless. So fancy. So modern. So delicious. So creative.  So expensive.  So worth it."}
{"text":"As I walked around the store admiring the truffles, macarons, chocolates, and rice krispie treats, I spotted the thickest cookies EVAR.    Me: I will only buy some if I get a bag Sales Guy: Sure, I have bags for you! Me: Then I'll take 4 =)  Thanksgiving had just passed and I wanted to give thanks to my supervisor and partner at work and my sister.    We took a bite of the chocolate chip and although the texture was the chewy type, me like, the taste wasn't worth $4.50.    Kudos to the presentation, service, oh and for the birthday cake flavor macaron (friend's fav)"}
{"text":"Rich and appealing desserts!   Definitely not your ordinary dessert shop you'll find in your local neighborhood. Each dessert has it's own uniqueness to it! This place is great for those who have a sweet tooth! They have a wide variety of desserts to choose from - cake, gelato, pastries and many more.   This is always the go-to spot for a quick dessert every time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"When you first walk up to it in the Aria, you can get pretty overwhelmed.  What with the legendary chocolate fountain and all, and over 60k desserts, what else would you expect?  The setup is very appealing to the eye and just done very well.    We decided to grab something in the morning on our way out, but you can pretty much come here any time of the day to satisfy your deepest dessert desires.    We had:  Apple brioche - Fresh, and taste, not too sweet, and a good density.  (It's kinda like a quiche) Cheese Danish - Also very good and tasty...nothing out of the ordinary. Almond croissant - didn't think I would like this one, but also VERY good and crumbly too, he he. Coffee - I have it black; can't remember what brand they had, but it was decent.  Imperial Chocolate Cake - Got this because of all the reviews and man, it totally lived up to the hype.  The Ganache was exactly as smooth and silky and not overly sweet at all as described.  The sucker just melts in your mouth like heaven in a bite.    Still have to try the gelato...maybe next time.    Priced at what you expect - 1)  It's Vegas  2) It's a Nice Vegas place 3) It's the Aria :)    Service staff was friendly; you can get overwhelmed with all the desserts, so just know that not every service staff member will know what every single item is, you might need to keep asking til they seek the help of another staff member."}
{"text":"Jean Phillippe is best known pastry shop at Vegas.  The patisseries are located at Bellagio & Aria. I used to go Bellagio location, I loved their chocolate and crepes!  This is must eat items at Vegas!  Since I stayed at Aria, it just next to the elevators to the hotel rooms.  Of coz, I wouldn't miss it.  What a big disappointment!! We spent $30 to get crappy cakes and coffee! Just felt like just a waste of $$$$ this time!  We only ate half of it and trashed the half.  Almond Croissant - I totally missed Thomas Hass double baked almond croissant, it fresh n warm! This one just ok. Opera cake - So soaky and too sweet!  The worst opera cake I had at Vegas! Tiramisu - Mediocre tiramisu! Some of Vancouver's pastry shops can make better Tiramisu than them! Coffee - OMG! Coffee so mild even tasteless!  Starbucks coffee even better than them!  I should only stick with chocolates and crepes next time."}
{"text":"Love the selection of desserts and pastries here. I felt like sitting in the middle of the shelf and going wheeeeeee - I was that happy with this place. The one we went to was in Aria but there's one in Bellagio as well with the famous chocolate fountain. Not very pricey by Vegas standards. The croissant I had was huge with a sprinkling of sugar on top. It is always crowded but turnaround is gr8. Try it!"}
{"text":"Very nice option for breakfast in the Bellagio.  I had the veggie quiche, which was delicious and filling, with a nice flaky crust.  The quiche and a coffee came to around $14 total.  They also had lovely chocolates and gifts of the sweet variety.   I may stop by tomorrow and try one of their crepes."}
{"text":"With unexciting breakfast options close by, and not wanting to trudge through the labyrinth that is the Crystals at CityCenter mall without my morning dose of caffeine, grabbing a pastry here was the easiest thing to do.   Little did I realize, that one visit would leave a sweet-toothed monkey on my back, and I am now thoroughly hung up on this place. So much so, that I will even wander through the haphazardly constructed Crystals in the wee hours of the morning like an oblivious zombie, when I am staying elsewhere and need to get my patisserie fix. Jean Philippe Patisserie is so worth the trip.   My goto breakfast has been either the Nutella or Dulce de Leche brioche -- or sometimes both! -- because nothing says breakfast like puffy bread made with an astronomically high number of eggs and sticks and sticks of butter. That said, I once bought four at a time thinking I could save myself the trip in the morning, but they sadly grew a bit stale overnight, so make sure to tear into them as soon as you can.  Recently, I discovered what was billed as a Snickers cake, which much to my surprise was actually a soft, puffy mousse cake that included all of the elements of its namesake candy bar. While I was expecting something a  tad more like a \"cake\", I was not disappointed by its soft gooey texture."}
{"text":"Good alternative to a sit-down restaurant if you need to grab a quick bite to eat in Bellagio.  They make sandwiches and sell simple pastries, in addition to gellato and chocolates.  There's also a seating area in an alcove nearby."}
{"text":"Oh my word, that chocolate fountain.. it was gorgeous. Sadly we didn't get a chance to buy from them because they had just closed, but I swear the next time I'm in vegas I will be buying from this location because they were simply decadent."}
{"text":"Strawberry tart is SO GOOD and pretty :)  The pastry store within the Bellagio is so cute!  It has this waterfall chocolate fountain that's just so mesmerizing.  The display of all the pastries is very alluring.  They even make crepes if you want.  Every time I go into this store it reminds me of My Lovely Sam Soon, a korean series of a girl who follows her dreams of a pastry shoppe.    I will definitely visit here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a world class pastry shoppe. If pasty is your thing, get a room at the Bellagio so it can be at arms length! The pastries are tiny little works of art and are surprisingly affordable for their quality and craftsmanship. There are also sandwiches, juice and sodas, various sweet and savory brioches, and fresh made-to-order crepes. This is a perfect place for a quick lunch or snack, though there isn't much seating inside the store and most of the tables in the hallways are packed with people savoring their delicious purchases. Venture further down the halls to find a table. This place is busy, so prepare to wait 10-15 minutes in line... but it's SO worth it!"}
{"text":"So many places on the strip , but for a touch of refinement - come here for a gelato , dessert, or my favorite crepe made fresh( a la mode). The servers could be friendlier, but I'll be the first to ignore that for my favorite treat.  Don't forget the world's largest chocolate fountain - great place to take it all in and there's always a cool exhibit in the live Bellagio garden next door."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but this place used to have the best chocolates but on my last visit to the Aria a month ago, I loaded up on the truffles and chocolate covered nougatine pretzel rods only to get home and find out that the quality is much lower than on my two previous visits -- 2 and 3 years ago. In fact, the chocolates didn't taste that much better than those Whitman drugstore candies -- meh. Desserts are also now made way ahead of time so that they are super stale by night's end -- beware after 5pm. That said, they get 3 stars instead of 2  because the fresh made savory crepes that we had there for dinner were quite good and reasonably priced relative to their dessert offerings."}
{"text":"I just had a white mocha latte....and it was way-way too sugary!  I was only able to have a couple of sips out of it.  Everything looks good here.  I'll have to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"We tried 3 different types of items from the patisserie.  We ordered savory crepes, sweet crepes, and gelato.  The gelato was fantastic, had great flavor and was nice and creamy.  The sweet crepes were super tasty too.  Savory crepes, ewww not so much, rather than having fresh ingredients I was appalled to see the fillings to come out of the refrigerator and straight into the microwave...nasty.  Sadly, the crepe itself was tasty, but the filling left something to be desired as it had a runny consistency (like baby food), lacked flavor, and had no real vegetables in the filling to speak of.  If I am in the area I may stop by for some gelato again, but not the crepes ick!"}
{"text":"This is a must when you are in Vegas.  Love everything about this place.  It's like you are in a bakery wonderland.  Everything is a work of art.  Their sandwiches are delicious, too.  My only advice would be to check your order before you leave.  One on occasion I was missing a sandwich and it was too much of a hassle to go back to get it."}
{"text":"Woweeee! I have a new favorite gelato place in Vegas. Coconut was my favorite but I can't lie, I did try gelato here 3 days. This was my dessert of choice! The crepes are good as well but the gelato really takes the prize. The chocolate waterfall is fun to see as well and there are a lot of patries that I will try on my next visits but it sure will be hard not to just get gelato and more gelato! While the seating inside is limited and cramped, there are a bunch of little tables right around the corner. Service was really fast for the long lines at night. Price is right on with everywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Two words to describe?: DELICIOUS and EXPENSIVE  $12.00 for a Salad $12.00 for a Panini $8.00 for a Cheese Danish Omlet - I'm not even sure how much THAT was And a chocolate made to look like a miniature layered cake $23.00 $3.00 bag of chips? Most reasonable thing in there!  They have to be out of their mind, they're lucky that it was a 3-minute walk from my hotel room, if not - there would be no service from this girl. Maybe their prices wouldn't be crazy high if they didn't have a designer create it with such detail from the huge cakes, to their lighting decor, to the seating, and enclosing walls. Insane.   I have to give it to them though, their food was excellent. It just puts my rating down by two because my wallet went dry."}
{"text":"This place shines as you walk by it--- it really draws you in to look around........ which I did many times since it is right by the room elevators if you are staying at Aria. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=63slVQOL5QhG90dGRqb-PQ  The pastries look and taste incredible.  Their gelato was some of the best ever. The Cheesecake flavor was so incredible I still don't believe it was gelato.  Price wasn't too bad. $5.00 for two good sized scoops.  Gelato = 5 star   Also tried a panini sandwich which was totally average.  3 star.   I probably would give this place a 4 star rating, but when I got home from my trip i noticed that one of my credit card charges which was $5.13 for some gelato was put thru for $8.13. I called my bank and was told they had added a $3 tip to my credit card slip.  NOT VERY NICE JEAN PHILIPPE!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing I ordered some pastries to take home and paid foe them no one said to me that I couldn't pick them up by 8am. The staff said  they don't recive them until 8-8:30am, it took me 20 minutes to get money back from the manager. Not once did he offer another item for me to buy or said sorry. Not good service. I would not go back and wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for their crepes only. I didn't have the extra calories in me to try any of their wonderful desserts.   My sis and I ordered both a savory and sweet crepe. We ordered the Royal crepe (grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese) and it was just ok to me. The crepe itself was some sort of wheat crepe that we weren't a fan of. We barely got any pieces of mushrooms and it was actually too creamy for me.   We were on a time crunch so we ordered the Exotic crepe to go. However they forgot that we ordered it to go but just added a top to cover it for us. We tasted a little bit of it before we headed out. All of the fruit with the sauce was delicious. The coconut sorbet was really good too and had tons of coconut flakes. Unfortunately they didn't pack the sorbet separately so by the time we got to the car it was a melted mess.   I also ordered an iced caramel macchiato and that I liked a lot. All three items were a little over $25 before tax and tip. A little pricey for the experience we had but I still would want to come back and try their other lovely desserts! I regret not getting just *some* thing."}
{"text":"Best deal in Vegas.  You might wonder how I could say that about a place that is far from inexpensive.  But dollar for dollar, I felt my money was well spent at Jean Philippe Patisserie. The $27 I spent on two crepes and a cafe au lait gave me more deliciousness and quality than any other meal I purchased in town.    Breakfast is phenomenal here. Nutella brioche? Yes, please. Paired with a well-made cafe au lait, it made early mornings a lot easier.  Excellent bread filled with rich Nutella cream was a decadent way to start the day.  The wild blueberry tart (which they called brioche but I disagree) was good as well.  Crepes are so good. The savory crepes are made Breton-style with buckwheat.  The mushrooms in my egg crepe were incredibly flavorful, a mixture of crimini and portabella that was lovely.  I picked up some chocolates as gifts and tried a truffle myself. Rich, creamy chocolate was just right.  Insider tip: look at the menu before you get in line. The line snakes around the shop, and they'll ask for you order before you can see the pastry selection, and the crepe menu can only be read if you are standing outside the shop in front of the crepe station. So decide before you get in line."}
{"text":"this little cafe is located in Aria.  we wanted to grab a quick lunch closeby to our hotel (Vdara) that wasn't too pricey.   you order at the counter.  when your food is ready, they call you over.  well, after about 10 minutes, we were notified that they were out of the asian salad.  (mind you, these are PREMADE salads...don't know why it took that long to tell us that)  then while we were trying to decide which other salad was a good substitute, they said, \"oh, we found ONE more.\"  you would think people would get it straight the first time.    so we shared a sandwich and a salad.  roast beef sandwich -- it was okay.  good bun...sandwich size was not too big but i suppose sufficient.    asian salad -- we laughed because the ingredients basically just threw everything asian in...the chinese, vietnamese, japanese, etc... it contained ginger slices, water chestnuts, green onions, .......  almond brioche -- not too sweet...fairly good but pricey.  guess that's expected.    course after i went to earl of sandwich, i wished i went before this meal.  if i had, i would have gone to earl of sandwich again having a DELICIOUSLY awesome, great price meal that can't be beat..  hindsight is 20/20??"}
{"text":"The best desserts to go ( or stay) we have found on the strip. They are pricy so expect to spend about $6-8 per person .  My husband loves the individual key lime pie. It is super creamy. My children try new things every time and they only had one time that they got something they didn't enjoy and it wasn't because it  was not good, the children just didn't like it. We do LOVE their cakes! If you preorder you can get whatever flavor you desire. We have had cakes for birthdays, New Years and just because. On occasion you can stop by and one will be premade and offered for sale. If you are buying dessert for 5 people it is a good deal to buy a whole cake.  They also offer gelato , coffee and crepes."}
{"text":"In 2015/16 We ordered a cake last minute ( 24 hrs in advance) for New Year's Eve. The only thing we requested was a white cake with cream and fruit filling, we left the rest up to the chef. What a wonderful surprise! The cake was not only beautiful but delicious!  The outside fondant was perfectly sweet and not grainy at all. The inside had layers of cream, cake and fruit. The presentation was top notch!   2016/17 we forgot to order and stopped by to pick up individual deserts and were lucky enough to be able to get a premade cake. It was delicious as always!!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab some coffee and desserts and rest. Whenever friends visit and stay at the Aria, we are sure to make a stop here. Not only are the desserts delicious, but they are absolutely stunning. Get your Instagram fired up because this place is too cute.   It is a bit pricey for a coffee/dessert shop, but this is Las Vegas people. Everything on the strip is expensive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe has the most amazingly delicious treats!!!  The turtles are creamy, crunchy, sweet and huge!  The Vahlrona Chocolate is perfect in flavor and consistency!  The Oatmeal cookie, although a tad too sweet, is a perfect crumbly, soft, chewy, brown sugary confection of delight. And the double chocolate cookie is also perfect in texture and deep, chocolatey flavor. This quick goodie bag to go was an ideal end to a wonderful evening in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times in the past. Unfortunately, Courtney, while very sweet, overcooked my crepe (crunchy is no good) and my eggs (dry and mealy is bad). It was just quite unappetizing at this point. Please more training for your cooks!"}
{"text":"Coming from a local standpoint, this place is excellent. Even if you don't have a sweet tooth and happened to be in the Bellagio, just check out this place for the world's largest chocolate fountain. The gelato is very creamy and SWEET. I get excited when I come here and order a big cup of gelato, with the hazelnut, tiramisu, and strawberry. However, for me, I could only handle a couple of bites of gelato because it was really sweet! Don't get me wrong, each morsel of gelato is scrumptuous, but I can only handle so much. Next time I will get a small cup.  Before, they didn't have crepes, now they have all types. I still need to check it out and try it. But, this is definitely a place to check out, just to say you've tried it and saw the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"The best spot for a light lunch in the Greatest hotel in Vegas! This place is almost as much fun to look at as it is to eat here. Though most people will be drawn here for the great Desserts. Either way, you need to swing by!"}
{"text":"World renowned chocolatier and World's largest chocolate fountain in the same hotel we are staying at? Sold! The fountain is pretty cool but the shop could use more space for seating. The candies and chocolates being sold along the shelves were neat as well. It was way too early (9 am) for sweets so we decided for some savoury foods. I definitely want to try the cakes, tarts or gelato later! We opted for the italian crepe (with prosciutto on top) since some Yelpers commented the crepes are big enough for 2. Also the almond croissant. The crepe took a while to make, I felt like I was waiting 15 min, which is really long for ... a crepe. Anyways, not the best savoury crepe I've had but the pesto and prosciutto was nice. Kind of thin but a filing crepe. The almond croissant was great except it was cold. This would've been the best croissant we have ever had if it was warm. Flaky, sweet glaze and something almond paste inside. A bit doughy inside, which I like, but husband hates. $4.25 for the croissant and $11 something so reasonable prices for a big name. I'll maybe try the desserts later."}
{"text":"The lines here are long and can get messy and confusing.  If you're patient enough to wait, Try the CHEESECAKE! I bought one for the ride home and wish I had bought 10 =("}
{"text":"Tried: Nutella crepe, chocolate eclair, tiramisu  Nutella crepe: Amazing crepe. Highly recommended. You are at a chocolate/pastry shop. This was the best item we have tried.  Chocolate Eclair: Eh, I won't get it again.  Tiramisu: Amazing. I didn't realize it was topped with oreo crumbs (Which I love!) until I actually ate the tiramisu. This was probably the best tiramisu I have had in the States.  General: This place gets really busy at times. Luckily, we missed the crowd but couldn't go back in line for a drink because the line was so backed up by the time we realized we wanted to get a cup of juice.   Also, note to anyone who's planning on going. Coming from a former cafe worker (during college days), please please please please PLEASE do not point out things over the glass. It is so unsanitary to do so. The glass is there for a reason. I freaked out by these tourists before me in line asking what's what over the glass and didn't order a single item that was on that side because of it."}
{"text":"A fun place to buy pastries and chocolate treats as you're perusing through Aria."}
{"text":"I love their crepes. Super delicious and all around awesome. Yes it is pricey but you're on vacation and splurging a little for this sweet dessert is well worth the price. I'm not into gambling but I love Vegas for the food. I get the strawberry, Nutella, and banana option but would love to try the chocolate crepe in the future."}
{"text":"Got a box of macarons for $16. There were eight pieces so essentially it was $2 per macaron and they were pre-packaged and it looked like they were pre-made too. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=hlElK7wkfQUNZuRO8VkA6Q  Raspberry - you can feel the pre-madeness, definitely not fresh.  Pistachio - the same feeling here, crusty, just off.  Chocolate - nope. Same comment as above.  Coffee - valiant effort, nice coffee flavor, but again, this just didn't hit the mark.  The macarons itself was a 2 star product, but the store overall was a 5 star. Lots of other stuff you can choose besides these old and stale macarons. They have plenty of fresh pastries. They have the world's largest chocolate fountain which was pretty neat. And they have a train locomotive completely made of marshmallows.  They also serve croissants and other extravagant stuff here. It's ok to splurge a bit since you'll be walking around anyway. It may be hard to find, but first find the conservatory and it's behind that. It's probably the less frequented areas since it is off the casino floor.  But if you do decide to go here, don't get the the macarons. It's pre-made, overpriced, and it's not even made by them. Label says, made at Aria. Stick with the fancy stuff they have out on display. Looks fresh, looks meticulously made, and if you're paying $6-8 per pastry, I'm sure you getting your monies worth."}
{"text":"We came in Friday night around midnight and got the Chocolate Crepe which comes with chocolate sauce chocolate shavings and brownie bits.  I asked if I could switch out the brownie bits for strawberries. The cashier said they weren't allowed to make substitutions and that she'd have to charge me 2 dollars extra for the strawberries. Sounded lame but she said it with such regret and she was super attentive off the bat so I didn't mind. We also added a scoop of vanilla Gelato to our crepe (I think it's what made it good) it had FRESH whipped cream on the side which was much appreciated except they forgot to incorporate the sugar haha it was just whipped heavy cream it wasn't sweet at all but I'm sure it was just that batch. I hope? We'll try it again, eventually.   Stars for excellent customer service, house made whipped cream, and fresh crepe.   Missing stars cause it cost about $17 something for a crepe with a single scoop of Gelato on the side."}
{"text":"This is a \"must visit\" place if you are anywhere near the Bellagio.  It is laid out in a circle, with servers and showcases on the inside, and displays of candies and cookings lining the outside.  A huge chocolate fountain at the entrance beckons you to the gelato and pastries section, or continue around the circle to the baked goods, sandwiches, crepes, and drinks.  There are so many great items, the most useful thing I can do is list some of the best:  French Pastries:  virtually everything -- they are just as good as they look Baked goods:  cheese danish, almond brioche (the muffin like items are somewhat disappointing) Sandwiches:  tuna, chicken pesto, spicy chicken tomato (make sure you tell them to grill the sandwich even though it takes seven minutes) Crepes:  anything will be fine -- watch them make a few to see what they are like Candies: extremely expensive; good but probably not good enough for the price Gelato: just gelato  Great for breakfast or lunch or an after meal dessert."}
{"text":"Beautiful displays of chocolate pumpkins this time of year. Was at the Aria for a few days so tried several things.   Loved the mint chocolate gelato -- creamy minty goodness in a cup. Oh so refreshing on a hot Vegas day.  Coffee was slightly burnt and disappointing one morning  Breakfast sandwich is dismal and should be removed from the menu. I ate half only because I needed the sustenance.  Cherry brioche was to die for. Buttery, flakey, tangy.   Service at 7am was horrible. Long lines and everyone working looked like they were just as miserable to be up at 7 as I was.... and they haven't had their morning coffee yet either.  I had a mixed experience but the gelato and brioche was so delicious, it saved the experience to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I truly feel that I cannot give a completely accurate review of Jean Philippe Patisserie.  I had just dined at the Aria buffet, and I had so many desserts from there that all I wanted to do was go into a food coma.  All the desserts looked absolutely stunning.  There was so much detail and creativity put into each and every dessert.  I got to try the red velvet cupcake, the cheesecake, and another dessert that I cannot remember.  My favorite was the cupcake because it was probably the nicest looking one.  I was expecting the colored coating to be hard, and was surprised to find that it was actually soft.  It was very rich, creamy, and moist.  Again, it would have probably tasted better had I not eaten at the Aria buffet just a few minutes prior.   -1 star because I felt that the staff were irritated that my party took such a long time deciding on what desserts they wanted to get.  I could see the look in their eyes that they wanted us gone because they were taking so long.  I do not understand though, since there was no one else in line, and they did not seem like they were doing anything else anyways."}
{"text":"My bakery choice in Vegas was Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Aria. There is a second outlet at the Bellagio, but this location is bigger. This is not just a bakery though. You can find an array of things here including chocolates, gelato, sandwiches, desserts and pastries. An all out attack on your wallet.  Stuck to the pastry options here as I was in a hurry. I had an almond brioche ($3.95), a sticky bun ($3.95) and a package of sable diamants cookies ($6). On the strength of the first two items, these are two of the best pastries that I have ever had.  The almond brioche here is a circular item, unlike other places in which it takes a popover form. The softness of the pastry was like bread pudding. A lot of vanilla flavor going on here with a liberal amount of almond pieces on top.  The sticky bun on the other hand takes more of a hardworking approach. It is pretty massive with a lot of cinnamon flavor to it. I have been searching for a great sticky/cinnamon roll and found it here. Too bad that it is 800 something miles away.  As for the sable diamants. These were okay. These look like shortbread cookies, but the flavor in these is very restrained. For a cookie made with dark chocolate, pistachio, vanilla, cocoa and coffee it is missing a sweetness to them.  Aside from the cookies, this is a patisserie worth seeking out in Vegas. The two pastries convinced me that JP is on another level compared to the majority of the bakeries that I have tried."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I come here at least once.  The crepes are so freaking good, esp the caramelized bananas.  Coffee is good. And the ham and cheese croissant I literally dream about when I'm home.  Great service.  Great everything.    I love looking at the chocolate and macaroon case. Everything is so perfectly created.    There is sometimes a long line so prepare yourself for that but it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I went to this place because their hot chocolate was extremely highly rated as the best hot chocolate ever.  As a chocoholic, I was extremely disappointed when I tried it.  Starbucks hot chocolate is better, which is saying a lot because generally that isn't very good. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because their services was good.  They ran out of large cups so gave us small cups and free pastries. The pastries were actually really good!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is the master of all things sweet and chocolate! If you have a sweet tooth, an appreciation for incredible desserts, or just enjoy fine art then you have to check this place out! You will immediately notice the largest chocolate fountain in the world out in front of the patisserie which is actually a bit of a downside because most people saunter outside to look at it and block the entrance to the actual shop. Once you wind your way though the malingerers you will see unbelievably gorgeous desserts everywhere you turn. Jean Philippe provides everything...gelato in all different flavors (baileys is my favorite), brioche breads plain and filled with incredible filings (nutella is my favorite), muffins, giant cookies, flawlessly artistic chocolates in all different flavors, a beautiful display of delicate dessert tarts, pies, custards, cakes, and various other creations that you have to see to believe. Words cannot do these tasty treats justice. Around the perimeter of the shop there are incredible cakes that boast the handiwork and talent of the patisserie as well as packaged chocolates and other souvenirs that let you take something sweet back home with you.   The quality of these desserts is superb, but what makes them even better is that they do not cost an arm and a leg. Don't get me wrong, they aren't cheap; you are at the Bellagio after all. However, the prices are reasonable, and for what you get it is worth every penny. The only downside to Jean Philippe's is that it can get pretty crowded due to its fame. If you want to beat the crowds I have found that the best time to go is around 2:45pm. If you do happen to catch the crowd don't sweat it, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Beware! when you are at Bellagio, just take a pic and go. I would not recommend this place for anything really. Starbucks and other chains are more reasonablly priced and their quality is consistent, if you don't mind skipping french/belgian pastries. ____________________ We visited the chocolate fountain cafe in Bellagio Hotel. We had one of  Quiche, banana Muffin, Coffee, Smoothie.  The quality, Taste, and the selection are exactly same whether you go to Aria, Bellagio, Vdara market, and perhaps them same at any other MGM hotels. I would give at least 3 and 4 for considering 4/5 star hotel location, and the chef being European himself. I had better, when I used to live in Europe.  ____________________ The reason they get 1 star rating is:  1.unnecessarily long lines, dictating voices from Latina cashiers, poor labeling of menu, Seating  layout is really poor, I mean, it was almost like eating near a street market. 1/5  2. when it was my turn to pay at the casher, I had to repeat my additional order 3 times, but the cashier ignored my requests, and, shouting and moving the line to the other casher, if the poor old visitors did not have a credit card with them. Very self-entitled women there. -1/5  3. and, not showing the price tags for the pastry, bread is 1 out of 5. Our 2 drinks and 2 slices of munchies became almost $50 dollars.   2/5  4. The MGM hotels is pursuing the environmentally sustainable approach with housekeeping, water usage and all. Then, 4 items of food and one mug cup  I purchased came with huge amount of unnecessary plastic containers, a vinyl-coated bag and the ridiculous plastic silverware. Not even the napkins will bio-degradable. That is really big no-no. -3/5  5.. I bought a curvy white thermo coffee mug. The latino manager guy and the same cashier woman said it was not faulty, when I see the tiny little hole on the top, and the white color cap, they said, is a porcelain, and a good quality. I reminded them it is a polyurethane coated cap, and a mere aluminum body. They believed still because it was white, it was a porcelain. Their ignorance 1/5  6. Later back at home, when I pour some liquid in it at home, because of the poor design, the lid leaks and squirt the hot drink through the mentioned hole, and the side all over. They should never sell anything with faulty design, and it would become the safety issue if this was a hot coffee, and walking or driving with it. Simply you cannot put this in the bag. It leaks all over the place. -5/5 ____________________ In general, I think the experience in this Jean Phillippe Patisserie @ Bellagio was one of the rare \"annoying\" experiences at entire MGM hotels in Las Vegas, that I will probably remember,  If there is any negative rating allowed, they will get -2."}
{"text":"I don't honestly understand what all the hubbub is about. We went there and we didn't even stay long line for what seemed like pretty regular sandwiches that ended up making us both sick. We tried one of their cherry tarts and it seemed average. The bill for us to both have sandwiches, sodas and a cherry tart was $45.  The servers were not exactly the friendliest, I just wouldn't waste your time."}
{"text":"fancy French desserts, the design is creative and unique, pricey, yes, taste good, yes..."}
{"text":"I saw Jean-Philippe Patisserie when passing through Aria's casino one day. We had just eaten, but returned for desert on another night. There was a pretty long line of people ordering ice cream, but I came for the crepes and my husband ordered a lemon gelato. I love nutella crepes, and these were absolutely delicious. It was a treat to watch it being made right in front of our eyes too. Every bite of the crepe was divine (as good or better than from Paris!) and worth every penny.  There were also some gorgeous cakes on display, and they seemed to have a lot of fun candies and other little pastries. If I lived in Vegas I would stop by often to try the entire menu. Sadly I don't, so when I come back it will be for another nutella crepe for sure!"}
{"text":"I recently was married in Las Vegas. After the ceremony we took the limo to Aria for some desserts. Its a long walk from the valet into Aria to Jean Philippe Patisserie. My daughter recommended this place. No surprise after reading the reviews. I come from fairly humble beginnings. One thing that I did have growing up was a vicious sweet tooth. If Patisserie means high priced French Desserts, Then I found it. The ice cream, cinnamon rolls and pastry all tasted Ok. I guess thats the problem. The sweets here are no better than what can be found in a Albertsons, Smiths or Vons markets. There I said it. The prices at Jean Phillipe are off the chart ridiculous. I can think of 100 places I have eaten and got better. Its a stupid philosophy to impress friends by treating them to desserts that aren't worth the money, I wish I had bought it before hand. repacked in nice containers and served it in the limo with the champaign and cider we had. Wasted money and a wasted afternoon stop . Not worth the the stop. Shop Hard"}
{"text":"Im a pastry junkie and this yummy little spot is like an adult candy store. Tons of delicious temptation everywhere.  After a short deliberation I settled for the Key-lime Tart. I must say I've had better I wasn't a huge fan of the fruit inside of the tart. Overall it was okay but the presentation was excellent. There are sooo many pastry options I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing tasty milky melting on tongue ice cream and macaroons. Its probably best place in Vegas where you can get upscale fansy-shmancy desserts!!!! I recommend to try pistachio ice cream its incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place - it's one of the cheaper food options in Bellagio, the space is pretty cute and they have the universe's biggest chocolate fountain (or something). I stopped a couple of times during my conference for a quick bite and in general, thought the food was decent.   What isn't decent? Their ability to handle crowds/lines. It's a tiny space, lines always seem to be crazy long and they are slllllloooooooww. Disorganized too - there are a bunch of people behind the counter but they seem to be stumbling all over each other and not really getting people through the line. My real issue is that they know AM's are busy, yet everyone has to wait in the big line because there's only one register open. Why not open a second line for those who just want a muffin and a non-fancy coffee? That would speed it up for sure.   Of course, when I pass by at night and there isn't a soul waiting, they have like three registers open. Great planning, right there. Also, I stopped when it wasn't busy and was told it would be 1/2 hour for a crepe - hard pass.  If you can actually get some food (they seem to discourage this) it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is 5 star. Wait is 1 star.  Food: 1. Smoked forest ham crepe. Excellent 2. Italian crepe. Good 3. Nutella crepe. Good 4. Vanilla soufflé crepe. Excelllllllent!!! 5. Ham & cheese croissant with béchamel sauce. Wow!!! 6. Vanilla Napoleon. Custard was perfect and dough was crisp. Excellent!!!  Wait: Only for crepes. 40 minutes??? Why??? Because crepe making lady had to redo every other crepe because it was sticking to griddle. Ugh. A location this busy must have their stuff together even the manager was laid back and allowed stuff to get out of control where customers were being quoted 60 minute wait time. RIDICULOUS!!! You felt like they were doing you a favor serving you.   I wish I can give it 5 stars but management needs a kick in the behind to get their act together."}
{"text":"So fattening... So good! Something for everyone at this dessert heaven. Sorbet, gelato, shakes, fruit tarts and chocolates. Kinda out of the way but so worth it if your in the area. Things are made fresh here so the flavor are good. Last word... Sweet!"}
{"text":"I'd bookmarked this place for almost a year now and each time we go to Vegas we never make it here. Last trip we were even at the Bellagio and we forgot to go. This time I made sure we go to Bellagio JUST so we can try this place out.  Well, it was around 10am and let me say, this place was packed. The wait for the crepes was 45 minutes and thankfully, I'm not a crepe kinda gal. I stood in line and marveled at the wonders of the perfectly created desserts, but since I'm not a dessert fan, I didn't buy any because hubby was feeling ill and didn't want any. I ended up sharing a turkey croissant and lil guy got gelato.  The cup of gelato was almost 5 bucks. WOW hefty! The turkey croissant was almost 10 bucks, but it was worth every penny. It was the best sandwich I'd ever had. The croissant had a touch of sweet glaze which added such depth to the lovely sandwich.  My friend bought a rose macaron for a friend and that friend said it was awesome so I guess their sweets are just as tasty as they are beautiful.  Definitely will return to this place again!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to take people who are visiting vegas! The desserts are all so unique and incredible, and the service is always friendly. I also like to take them and walk to the nearby art galleries so I can enjoy eating the desserts while looking at some amazing art! I defiantly recommend visiting this place if you need something to hit the spot after dinner!"}
{"text":"I was like a kid in a candy store for a trained pastry chef like me to check this place out. Their pastries looked great and tasted great. Love their sandwiches and their butternut squash soup. The service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I have a sweet tooth and randomly crave little desserts here and there. This place hits the spot.  They have two locations - one in the Bellagio and the other in Aria.  The one in Aria is bigger and more modern, but I've only frequented the Bellagio location. They serve crepes, sandwiches, chocolate, etc..along with desserts like tiramisu, carrot cake, creme brulee, etc.. Even though their desserts sound normal, their ingredients and flavors are unique.  For example, there was caramel in the creme brulee that I ordered.   Some of the friends we were with had the sandwiches and liked them.   It's a must try if you love desserts!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a must visit whenever I go to Vegas. They have two locations - 1 in Aria and 1 in the Bellagio.  The one in Aria is bigger and nicer.  It reminds me of something you would see right out of a Dr. Seuss book.    I've tried their chocolate, croissant, desserts, and this awesome spiced chicken panini sandwich.  It was sooooo gooooood!!! I can't wait to have it again the next time I return to Vegas! I also need to try their crepes.  I've heard great things and saw a lot of people order them.    Be prepared to stand in line during peak hours."}
{"text":"Slow serves, long line, but considering my bar is pretty low as far as crepes are concerned it was pretty god damn good!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go to the omelette and crepe station. They deserve 1 star for obnoxious service and horrible food. I'm the patisserie on the other side offers sandwiches and salad that are decent."}
{"text":"wish i lived in Vegas so i could visit this fabulous place on a weekly (or even bi-daily) basis!  For those of you who have a bad sweet tooth like me, here's Heaven!!  I LOVE JEAN PHILIPPE PATISSERIE!  This location inside the Aria looks really really cool!!!!  Seriously, it's already great pleasure just by looking at those beautiful wedding cake displays hung up in the air!  All cakes and desserts look super duper cute, and the pastries taste pretty good, too!  Boyfriend went over there just last week and bought me some palmiers ($14/ box).  Oh my goodness! those mini palmiers are thin and very crispy, and needless to say, NOM!  They just rock in my mouth Oh-La-Laa!!"}
{"text":"This was a very solid place, but didn't blow me away.  It gets a lot of foot traffic, right off the lobby and near the garden area.  So, the line is likely to be long.  But, don't worry, the staff is very good at moving it along.  I started out of the store and it didn't take long at all to get through, maybe 10 minutes or so.  I was there around 10 in the morning, so more of a brunch time than breakfast or lunch.  I had a piece of quiche lorraine.  This was a good sized piece for about $8.  And, it arrives to you quickly after ordering.  I'll say, they need to work on the heating method.  The edges were quite hot, but the middle was near cold.  Not all the way, but certainly cool.  The quiche was very good, great flaky crust and good cheese flavor.  The outside had a nice crispness to it.  This place, as many note, is filled with sweets.  They looked fantastic.  The prices are decent for the strip, particularly since it's at Bellagio.  Worth stopping if you need a quick sandwich or snack."}
{"text":"For my girlfriend's birthday, she forced me to drag her around the Strip, including to the newly-constructed City Center. I thought it was going to be a long, tedious day - and in a lot of ways it was. But, some good came of it - I discovered this place.  I'll be honest, I didn't get to explore this place as much as I would have liked to or get to try as many things as I would have liked to. But Jean Philippe was easily the highlight of the City Center adventure my girlfriend went on.  The place is essentially split into several sections - a gelato area, an area that sells individual chocolate squares, an area that sells some packaged goods, and an area selling deli-type food items and other desserts, including eclairs. The place is fairly large, and even has a small dining area set aside.   As soon as we entered the area that houses Jean Philippe and began looking at the types of gelato, the woman working was very friendly and even let us sample several types (some places I have been to tend to be stingy about this, so finding a place like this, in City Center of all places, was a breath of fresh air.) I ended up getting a cup of the Oreo flavor, which was just as good as it sounds.   The place has an excellent selection of gelato, food items, chocolate squares, and everything in between. High prices ($2 per individual chocolate square) and the fact that you have to go through the trouble of going through City Center to get here are my only real complaints.   If you end up in City Center, whether willingly or not, pay this place a visit (they also have them in a few other hotel/casinos in the area as well.) It will easily be the sweetest part of your Strip adventure - pun most definitely intended."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit the Aria every three or so months. One of the highlights is enjoying treats from Jean Philippe.   So this most recent visit included my wife's birthday. She's hinted for weeks how'd she love to have one of their cakes. I played it off and acted as if I didn't pay attention to her request. Shortly after we arrived I was able to sneak into their Aria location and order a birthday cake. I was informed that this had to be done with a manage. Her name was Ruby. She Walked me over to a kiosk and we went thru the list of cakes. She asked me how soon I needed it. I told her \"4 days\" she says \"that won't be a problem at all\". We fill out an order form of how I'd like the cake to be made. My only request was not to have red velvet. I figure it's nothing special and she assured me I have plenty of time.   I speak with the hotel and arrange for the cake to be brought up to or room the morning if my wife's birthday. At 6am I revive a call from the hotel that there's been an issue with the cake I ordered but that they would delivering a different cake. There's a knock at the door and in comes a cake that looks nothing like the one I ordered. Not only was it red velvet but the cake looked old and clearly had been sitting around for a few days.   When I spoke with Jean Philippe mangers as well as one of their chefs, I was meet with disrespect. I was simply told that there was a \"Mistake\". I ordered the cake with more than enough to time to deliver. They dropped the ball and seemed to push it blame onto each other. The unprofessional attitude was shocking.   I wouldn't trust them. I'm hoping that MGM moves away from keeping such a poorly ran establishment inside their beautiful casinos."}
{"text":"great place to grab breakfast if you're staying in aria/vdara. we had croissant, almond brioche and blueberry brioche at $4 each. my fav was the almond. at 7 am, everything was fresh and crispy :-) we'll definitely be back if we're in the area. i was hoping for some cakes/tarts but maybe those are available only later in the day. long q but moves fast. coffee didn't look good so we didn't try any."}
{"text":"One of the best things about staying in the Aria was waking up in the morning, padding downstairs in my pajamas to get some pastries, and eating them back up in my room.  I love the nutella brioche, perfect with the ice cold milk that you can order. I actually enjoyed the milk so much that I ordered some and sipped it while I walked around the casino portion of the hotel. Got eyed by some security personnel who probably thought I was a kid, but whatever.. they're missing out on milk and pastries!  The cheesecake compote practically melts in your mouth. That was ~$6. The prices aren't tooo bad, ~$3 per pastry? Got the exotic crepe the first day too. Pretty awesome, just wish that one didn't cost $10. Hey, it's Vegas. You're going to lose money anyhow. Why not do it by satisfying your sweet tooth?"}
{"text":"Guys - even if you don't get anything you have to stop by and check out the chocolate fountain!  This is a great place to get a quick treat and while I haven't tried the crepes yet, they sure look delicious!  My recent gelato of choice was the oreo and it was the perfect sweet treat while roaming the hotel.  The staff are always pleasant and informative and don't look at you sideways when you want to try a sample of each gelato.  I bet they would not be pleased if you decided to not order, but why would you not order the deliciousness?!  Not much else to say about the patisserie.  Go get a treat!"}
{"text":"When staying at Vdara or Aria, this really is the best choice for a quick latte and breakfast. I visited many times for a little morning caffeine and pastry. Nothing disappointed either other than the long line and inconsistency of the lattes. When trying to get out and about as fast as possible in the morning, waiting in a line for 15 minutes for a coffee and croissant is a little annoying. Also, when you're paying a premium for a latte, you kind of expect it to not vary in bitterness and creaminess from day-to-day.   The big demand on this little patisserie really puts pressure on the staff to preform quickly and accurately on each order. Little mistakes (like the lattes) are forgivable, and for the most part those don't even appear to happen often. Overall, I'm very impressed with how the staff handles the chaos of the morning rush. I probably would be tearing my hair out after an hour of customers changing then re-changing orders, continuous bumping into other staff, and the constant stream of white noise from espresso machines and slot machines. Props to all those who can handle it.  This really was a golden addition to Aria. It fills a very specific yet prevailing need of it's and Vdara's guest; better coffee then Starbucks and more food options. I can honestly say that without JP, I would have felt there was something lacking in my experience staying at Vdara."}
{"text":"I know, I know, this place is iconic and I maybe ordered the wrong things, but I spent way too much money here to not have an amazing experience.   I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich, an iced cappuccino, and a dulce de leche brioche. I can't recall how much everything was, but I know my drink was over $6. They also charge a lot for add-ons (I think $1 extra)  Smoked salmon sandwich was just OK; nothing memorable and lots of bread. The cappuccino was pretty good, but the dulce de leche brioche was way too sweet and messy for my tastes. The bread definitely massively sticks to the paper liner and all the dulce de leche is concentrated in the middle in an explosion of sticky and sugar.   Maybe would try it out again, but there are so many other places in Vegas to try out. Definitely a nice place to stop by and see all their desserts and architecture of their little enclave."}
{"text":"During our stay at the Aria, we had the following at JP:  Ham & Cheese Croissant - excellent...best ever. Almond Croissant - ditto...never had better. Roast Beef Sandwich - nothing special Tuna Sandwich - too much mayo, but the baguette was good Crab Salad - real crab meat, but lacking in flavor Choc Eclair - excellent Fruit Tart - excellent Choc Mousse - excellent  So definitely get their pastries.  Also, get their coffees."}
{"text":"I was VERY curious about Jean Phillippe because I visited their location in the Bellagio years ago and admired their chocolate fountain and beautiful pastries, unsure if they were famous for their presentation than for the taste. Well, Yelp reviews gave JP a solid 4-star review at both their locations (they are now in the Aria) and I had to give it a shot. They are open 24 hours but I made sure to pick up pastries bright and early while they were fresh, the pastries come out at 7am.   * JP is famous for their nutella brioche and croissants * The croissant is flaky but nothing special, the best part is the chocolate which is rich and bittersweet but I wish there was more. * The brioche bread is too dense and tastes like a dinner roll with a huge gob of nutella. Very mediocre.  * Ham and Cheese croissant was overly decadent and soggy because of the bechamel inside.   Jean Phillippe has some beautiful desserts I may give them a second chance but do not recommend the pastries."}
{"text":"Love the JPP road gelato, their twist on the rocky road ice cream flavor. Also tried the dessert sampler trio which I really enjoyed, except the macaron :/ Still like traditional macarons better.  The white chocolate coated strawberries was amazing as well. Definitely coming back for more next time!"}
{"text":"there are many pastry shops on the strip, JPP stands out from all of them, tried both location at bellagio and aria, i am a dessertholic so it became a routine to visit the shop once a day during my stay in vegas, and i blame JPP for taking my time away from visiting other dessert notables like serendipity 3 and max brenner, the rose macaron is absolutely the must try item, JPP is the place to be for all the dessert fanatics out there!"}
{"text":"Walking past Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio, how can one not stop and stare at the cascading chocolate?  As you see white, dark and milk liquidy goodness spill over one pool and then land in another, you can help but wish you were standing (naked) underneath that waterfall of rich chocolate...  Sliding in right before the doors closed at midnight, the BF ordered a generous scoop of Straticella ice cream.  We wandered throughout this quaint patisserie mesmerized by the magnificent cake illusions from above and far.  We watched the video of how their lovely desserts were created and how one can wish they had the skills (and tools) to make such lovely treats at home.  As the workers, in their cute little uniforms, cleaned up and closed up shop, they didn't scoot us out at all.  I appreciated that they addressed my questions about their cakes ($3000 for about 100 servings for that pink cake) without batting an eye or appearing annoyed.   I can't say much about their other desserts or savory food offerings.  But this store is worth visiting just so you can be transported for a brief moment to that opening scene from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and that chocolate pool.    I can already feel the white chocolate flowing down my face..."}
{"text":"What can I say? Jean Philippe Patisserie located at the Aria is my favorite go to place to satisfy my sweet cravings! Whether you're craving something cold like ice cream or sorbets, something sweet, like chocolates, desserts, a pastry, coffee or a mocha, this is a really cool, hip, happening place to hang out! Everything here is just \"Yummy!!!\".  Jean Philippe Patisserie is located in the heart of Aria right off the casino floor. It's a cool place to just hang out with friends for fellowship or even people watch LOL. No time to have a seat and relax? Jean Philippe is also perfect for grab and go! Sometimes when I am on the run, I like to just walk through to satisfy my \"eye candy\" hahaha.  There are ample parking at the Aria parking garage. (Please note if you are parking, the MGM Resorts have started to charge for parking, unless you are staying at one the the MGM Hotels)  Be sure to check out Jean Philippe Patisserie the next time you're in Vegas! Trust me it's that good!! :)"}
{"text":"Have you seen this place? I MEAN SERIOUSLY HAVE TO SEEN IT?! This place is like if you took the hallways of the death star and put HUNDREDS of people looking for chocolate in it. Yeah, that actually means its awesome! Not only does this place have the best tasting desserts in all of Las Vegas, but they are also the prettiest of all the desserts in Las Vegas. Be wary, you are going to most like pay around $8-your whole wallet here, but it will so be worth it as you walk away from the table holding onto that chocolate food baby.  What would I recommend? Well that really just depends on what you are craving. Hotter than Pompeii outside and just as dangerous? I'd possibly recommend one of the many amazing gelatos they make from scratch. Or did you just wake up with a massive hangover after having a girls night out at one of the nightclubs? Croissant and coffee would make the day a little better. Or are you just a person that loves something sweet? Well then get everything they have, including the amazing triple cheesecake.   Should you go here? No, no you should not...Is what a doctor would say if you were trying to loose weight. I say, run as fast as you can to get the nummies before everyone else does."}
{"text":"Most delicious chocolate croissant in the whole entire world!!! I have tried chocolate croissants many many places and nothing comes close to this place!! Their ice cream is also good and of course best chocolate!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the CUTEST little cakes.  Cute enough that I was stupid enough to walk over from the Palazzo at 10 in the morning on a Saturday just to pick one up for a birthday girl.  They also have cute truffle boxes.  It's like a step up from Godiva.  Cute, cute packaging.  CUTE!  They had a Spongebob cake on display.  I was ecstatic :)"}
{"text":"I come here when I am feeling a little blue.  Also a place I visit when I am feeling euphoric.  It is a place which dominates the senses.  The world's tallest chocolate fountain cascades in tiers at the entryway.  Truly an enormous work of decedent art.  You can enjoy a fresh crepe or any one of the many wonderful deserts which fit into the palm of my hand; for me the perfect size; $6 each.  They also have gelato!    A certain someone once ordered me a custom birthday cake from this shop.  It was lovely and definitely a cake I will never forget."}
{"text":"If delicious food and great dessert is your cup of tea, then you're in for a real treat. If you've eaten macarons (macaroons as most would spell it) from Laduree, Pierre Herme, Bottega Louie or 'Lette (just to name a few), then you understand what a good quality macaron is! Jean Philippe's macarons are up to par with all of those!  Get their rose macaron with custard and fresh raspberries. It's an oversized macaron and not overly sweet as the rose flavored custard and raspberries complement each other very well (I know you're mouth is watering now). Shoot, grab yourself two while you're at it!  Their sandwiches and wraps are damn tasty too! If you're not super hungry and want something that isn't so heavy, grab yourself a croissant sandwich or wrap (I opted for the chicken pesto wrap).   Though not necessarily cheap (we spent more than $40 for 2 sandwiches, a cup coffee, another cup of OJ and a macaron), it's well worth your money for some damn good eats!   Have someone get in line to order while one of you grab a seat first as this place gets pretty damn packed. The line is always a good 20 minute wait. And there are 2 lines, one for their food and one just for the chocolates and smaller sized desserts, just a FYI!  P.S. - Aria offers free valet parking. But don't come here just for this place if you don't plan on gambling and hanging around Aria."}
{"text":"For the prices this place charges, you would think they know customer service. They do not. They are rude, dont know how to make a coffee beverage properly, and have the most inefficient ordering system. You just stand and order wherever you choose to cut in line, pay, then stand off on the side waiting for your overpriced dessert or drink. All the while being looked at and treated like you are not worthy of JP.  I saw two other families waiting for their orders, get wrong items, missing items, and not a single apology came from the JP employee drone. Completely ruins the nice desserts they do have prepared."}
{"text":"It's worth stopping by Jean Philippe just to enjoy the amazing Chocolate Fountain. The sandwiches, salads, muffins and other pastries are top quality. Place is almost always packed with people, however, it's simply an indicator of the quality of the food they sell."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest service I've ever experienced. We ordered a few pastries & 4 coffees, and it took over 30 minutes for them to give it to us. It was so close to our lunch reservation by the time we actually received what we paid for that it wasn't even worth it. The food and coffee were decent, but probably not worth the wait or the money. Multiple people in line were also very upset about the wait and requested the manager come speak to us. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"3.5 overall 5 for crepes first time and 3 2nd time, 3 on service, 4 on ambiance, 3 for constancy.  With 5 places to order from it is confusing.  The cool factor over took the functional in their design . Looking at about 10 bucks for crepes.  Presentation and taste vary from great to ok.  Chocolate crepe looked like it would be too chocolatey but it was perfect.  2nd time we went it was more busy and definitely not done as well.  They didn't give me mint, presentation wasn't as nice, and nothing was in the crepe just put on top."}
{"text":"Located inside Bellagio, this is an awesome dessert place to stop by before or after gambling at the casinos. We were very lucky that we didn't have to wait too long to order but there were several occasions passing by where I saw the line looped around in a long circle. We ordered the exotic crepe which contained passion fruit and other fruits (that I cannot remember) with coconut ice cream. You have to get ice cream! The ice cream complemented the crepe so well. I thought the dessert was reasonable to share between two people because it was also pretty sweet.   There are so many different types of desserts to choose from so when I come back to Vegas again, I will stop by here to try a different dessert."}
{"text":"As one of my final stops in Vegas, I dropped by Jean Philippe for a pastry, before heading out to the airport. After much deliberation, I selected a rose macaroon out of the many delicious-looking petit fours on display. The macaroon was pricey (six-plus dollars) but it was very good. A worthy extravagance, in a town with many that are unworthy. While Jean Philippe offers all sorts of sweets, I probably would stick to the pastries, which is what they know best. This place is definitely worth a try if you happen to walk by."}
{"text":"Delicious French desserts! My boyfriend brought me here for a nice dessert, he tried it before and fell in love with it. It's super cute inside and they have the larges chocolate fountain in the world! They are a sweet section and also a savory sections. The desserts are SO cute!   We ordered: Pistachio Gelato + Mint Gelato: SO SMOOTH! This is the smoothest gelato that I have ever had. They give you a pretty good portion. You can really taste the pistachio and mint flavors. Highly recommend! Blueberry Cupcake: This is one of my all time favorite. It is honestly too cute to eat. The cupcake was super creamy and it was made out of cheesecake. I loved it so much! If I wasn't so full from lunch, I think I would of ordered more.  Overall, this place is amazing and worth every penny! Their birthday cakes are so beautiful! This is like the Chanel level of desserts!"}
{"text":"The desert and Crepes are great... The waiting time sucks... They don't tell You, that you would have to wait 25-30 mins.. Waiting time sucks"}
{"text":"The fiancée wanted to use up her coupon for a free crêpe at Jean Philippe Patisserie so off we went to Aria for a late breakfast before a day at the pool.  JPP was obviously a popular choice for breakfast as evidenced by the long lines for service.  No matter.  We were on vacation so we weren't in any particular hurry.  Surprisingly, the line for crêpes was nonexistent while the line for pastries and Illy coffee was quite long.  So, while I waited to order, pay, and receive my croque-monsieur and cup of coffee, Carol W was getting her made to order savory Italian crêpe filled with prosciutto, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and topped with a basil pesto.  JPP's process for serving customers, though, moved quickly and reasonably efficiently and I received my order in the time it took for Carol's crêpe to be completed.    Seating is somewhat limited in the small patisserie off of the casino floor.  However, it wasn't difficult finding two seats since most customers just order stuff to grab and go.  As for our food, my croque-monsieur was decently sized, grilled nicely and very buttery (as one would expect from French food) and cheesy.  It was good, but not necessarily transcendent.  I fared better than Carol as her crêpe, while nicely constructed and a generous portion, was WAY over sauced with the salty pesto.  It overwhelmed everything and even threatened to jump plates and attack my sandwich.  Jean Philippe Patisserie does offer a lot of aesthetically pleasing goodness.  Perhaps, we just didn't choose items that put its best food forward!    3 stars for my croque-monsieur, 2 stars for Carol's crêpe...thankfully, it was free."}
{"text":"It was the desserts that lured me to this place.  The colors, the smells, the gorgeous displays...they were all calling my name.  \"Mel...Mel...come spend buckets of money here.\"    Desserts-good, not great.  They were pretty and priced pretty as well.    But it was the sandwiches that kept us coming back for more.  Sure, they were priced more than the usual panini, but given the convenient location and add on a scoop of gelato, and we were willing to drop the cash on this place.    Tandoori chicken panini is my all time favorite.  Chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, and a light curry sauce, this sammie will hit the spot any time of the day.   Roast beef- piled high with rare meat and topped with horseradish with some kick, this was the hb's fav.   Croque monsieur-standard recipe, good breakfast alternative.   Sandwich trio-for those who don't want to choose just one. Smaller versions of 3 classic flavors.    You may end up paying as much as you would at the buffet, but at midnight, this place may fit the bill."}

{"text":"The mixed berry crepe with whipped cream is absolutely amazing, and worth the wait. However, it was entirely too crowded and there isn't enough seating. The Bellagio needs to add tables to accommodate the amount of people trying to eat here."}
{"text":"***FOOD POISONING!!!***  We dined here at 11am today. My wife had a salmon crepe, so did my mother. I had a ham & cheese pannini. Then we drove back to LA on a 6 hour drive.  Some two hours later on the road, both my wife and my mother felt sick and had stomach cramps. The sickness and pain intensified and was at its peak sometime around 6pm. While my mother felt better by 8pm, my wife crashed on the sofa and got up at 10pm only to vomit.   I apologize for graphic details but the point of this review is to alert the management to immediately check the quality and freshness of their products.  I believe the salmon (which looked quite pale and was surely farm-raised) was not fresh. It could have also been the mayonnaise (or mustard mixed with it), or combination of both. I felt a strange metallic taste on my tongue when I was eating my own panini sandwich, which also did contain the mustard/mayo mix. In fact I still feel the strange taste in all of my mouth now as I write this at 10:30pm.  Dear management, please check the freshness of your produce, or the temperature in your fridge, or vendors you use, as our group poisonning COULD NOT have been a coincidence.   I must also add that the personnel was noticeably nervous and irritated (and this is NO judgement but merely an observation). If they worked over NY holiday and had no chance to rest this could explain their cranky attitude. To say the least, this did not help the painful food experience at all.  I hope this review will prevent further damage to other patrons of this establishment."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches and danishes! The pastries are so beautiful you feel bad eating them!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I stared at the chocolate fountain for days before Boyfriend had to drag me away and remind me of my purpose for even being there.  I wanted to buy some macarons for a friend as an early birthday gift because she'd never had the macarons from this bakery before. And, knowing her to be a macaron connoisseur, I had to oblige and buy her a box. Because that's just not right to not have sampled all that is available to be had. I bought a box of 8 macarons and delivered them to the birthday girl.  We didn't actually eat them for a couple of days. They were surprisingly still fresh -- flaky cookie and soft insides. We tried the pistachio flavor. I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it also wasn't mind-blowing either. It was a solidly average macaron. I didn't get to try the other flavors, but I can only assume that they're probably about the same. A little sad, but I guess not every macaron can live up to be absolutely amazing.  Boyfriend and I also bought a Nutella Brioche to share. The brioche was very light and very yummy, but it was the Nutella innards that made this treat. There's seriously just a pretty good sized glob of Nutella in the middle. Mix that with the soft brioche bread and the dusting of powdered sugar on top of it all, and you've got a delicious confection!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Patisserie at the Bellagio -- this one is at the Aria!  I ordered a soy chai tea latte here along with a rose raspberry macaron after a much-longer-than-I-remembered trek from the Marriott Grand Chateau. Stupid me forgot to ask for my chai to be iced, but it was still pretty decent. Tasted like your general, run-of-the-mill chai tea latte (if you like yours a tad more sweet than chai-y).  The macaron was pretty good, too, once we finally got back to the hotel room with it. The raspberries were fairly fresh (like from that morning). It was overall chewy and fairly flavorful, but we had no idea what the filling in the middle was made of."}
{"text":"Jumped for the Chocolate Crepe last night after the cirque show and it was as solid as usual.  With brownie bites and plenty of chocolate syrup, the real whipped cream put it over the top.  At just under a saw buck, it is so much more satisfying than another pull on the one armed bandit."}
{"text":"Always excellent and worth every penny. Not only are their sweets good but they hot food too. Their ham and cheese croissant was very gooey and delicious. The selection of sweets will drive you crazy (in a good way). Love their snickers cake and palmier."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Everything is delicious. Even when you are bleary eyed in the morning and want a coffee and something to go with and you just point blindly, you will end up with a happy belly. Convienent to the elevators that go to the rooms, too, so go downstairs in your pajamas. They won't judge."}
{"text":"Located just past the mock forest is a wonderful multi-tier chocolate fountain and one of the best pastry shops west of the Mississippi. To be fair I did not have a crepe or sandwich but did see hoards of people devouring both while barely stopping long enough to chew. I did however get a scoop of straccitella gelato, for the uninitiated this is similar to a chocolate chip ice cream.  We also had a few of the the signature delectables including the carrot cake and a choco-banana type of thing. The single scoop of gelato was more than enough to satisfy my sweet tooth for a while so I asked to have the treats packed up to carry them on the plane. I noticed that there are a few selections of sugar free items and had to get one for my diabetic mother. She said it was one of the best she has ever had. This patisserie is one of the best in the world. Not to be missed but be prepared to pay top dollar for top quality."}
{"text":"We stayed at the bellogio and passed by the chocolate fountains everyday. The kids enjoyed watching it so much.  They have good pastries and breakfast items too."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas my whole life, but always avoided the strip not knowing what amazing things hide inside of it. After coming here and tasting amazingly detailed and delicious pastries and desserts, my taste buds are ruined.. Must try!!  -Rare cheesecake with white chocolate outside and raspberry center -Snickers pastry has all the chocolate, nuts, toffee, and caramel like a snickers bar but it taste even better. -Gelato! Sample the flavors to see which one you like best -Crepe, don't underestimate the size of these they're huge."}
{"text":"Got here to feed my girlfriend for dessert. We had Chocolate Cheese cake as a dessert. Decoration was gorgeous. Taste..? Hm.. Sweet. That was pretty much it. I did not see anything special about the cheesecake. My girlfriend was going crazy about this cheesecake though. It was around $9 for single dessert. Since my girlfriend was happy, I would say it is done deal. If you ask me if I am coming to by myself? Nope, never will, since I am not really a sweet lover nor the dessert guy. I would choose cheesecake factory's cheesecake over this, because I feel that they have a better price with better quality.   I will give 5 since my girlfriend loved it."}
{"text":"Their crepes are orgasmical.  Instead of ordering from their menu, you can ask them to make it however way you like.  I usually ask for berries inside with brownies, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and a scoop of vanilla gelato.  It tastes like heaven.  It costs me $13 for the dessert but the smile on my face after each bite - priceless."}
{"text":"Seriously they could not design a worse ordering process.  We have stayed in two hotels with these (aria and bellagio) and dealt with the same problem both times.  There are like 10 people crammed behind the counter so you would think you would get out quickly.  Maybe I am just in the minority that I am primarily going there for a pastry and coffee in the morning and a coffee in the afternoon.  But someone approaches at the point where you have been in the line for about 10 minutes to take your order, which is fine if you are getting a crepe or sandwich but if you want a pastry you haven't actually been able to see the pastries yet.  They won't let it go though so they just try and tell you the pastry options but I don't feel like you can really order a pastry without seeing it.  One mans scone is another mans muffin.   So you figure it out and then still wait in line for another 15 minutes.  They really need to figure out a way to get people who don't need things prepared through the line faster."}
{"text":"Order the almond croissant and don't waste your time with anything else (~$4).  Well, if you're gonna linger, try to score the free chocolates that spits out of the big clock in the middle of the store every 15 minutes.  Other important info: skip the macarons and everything else there and only order the almond croissant, the big clock in the middle of the store spits out free chocolate every 15 minutes, they have a café express store a few feet away from this main store."}
{"text":"Went with my BF, brother and his BF. Late night- wanted to see if they had macaroons or get some pastries....no macaroons, pastries that were left didn't perk my interest (fruit tarts, eclair).  Bro and BF got gelatos and chocolates. Took a bite of their pistachio- nice actually, robust pistachio flavor.  We got a crepe with just custard and chocolate and chocolates and a raspberry tart BF wanted to try as well. Crepe was good, I like that the chocolate wasn't overtly sweet milk chocolate, more like a milk and dark cross, but I don't think it was priced right for what it is. I spend a lot on desserts, but it's just a crepe. Chocolates good, I liked the coconut which I normally don't but it was subtle. Tart- Alright, there was a pistachio like cream on the bottom and it was nice, but the tart itself was kinda hard, berries were fresh and sweet.   Got teas to compliment.- A-OK- just got standard greens, but were all premium tea drinkers and it doesnt wow like some of the selection at home (NO ready made tea bags, fine tea leaves).  They were yummy, but not like OMG Imma effing die this soo goood.  It was satisfying enough to curb our after dinner sweet toofs.   One big shtick I got about this place is that its circular layout makes it eye pleasing but it makes it a clusterfuck when it's busy. People just don't know where to go, they cut cuz they don't get if there's a line. Also since we were getting stuff from all their stations it was frustrating- the chocolate lady told us to order crepes from the crepes, and go to coffee to get our drinks, etc.....WTH?! Can't you ring up and charge us and ticket them our order to make?! I dont think she knew really what theyre doing....surely you dont have to line up 4 times, but whatever we just figured it's easier to split up and not confuse that lady even more.  Yeah, we 4 split up and lined up in each area. BF went to gelato, I got the crepe, brother got the chocolates and BF got teas. Crepe customers vicious, I had to tell someone to step off their order because they helped themselves to the front of the line.   Maybe I'll try it again if I'm here or Aria when it's not busy, but by all means I will walk by and forget it if it's a busy cluster. Desserts good but not worth having to tagteam to hit all the stations again."}
{"text":"We came in to grab a small treat for the BFs mom and grandma. It was their birthday and we had plans in the evening so we wanted to drop something off before heading to the Elite event.   I tried a bite of their desserts because I'm an Indian giver like that.   Mom in law has been on the search for almond croissants. It was very good, the croissant consistency is the best she's ever had she claims, but unfortunately not what she wanted. She's looking for ones with almond paste in it, this has a paste that is lighter, eggy. It was delicious, but I guess what she is trying to describe to us is probably Dutch/Swedish/German since they use the heavy paste. Never the less, I want more of this.   We also go some Blueberry Danish for grandma and it was very lovely crust and the blueberry filling was abundant but the right balance, not too sweet.   They shared a raspberry tart with pistachio cream on a buttery biscuit bottom and a nutella pastry. I like the tart- its the 2nd time I've had it and though its not my favorite tart in the world, this is not your usual kind of tart. I like that its not a usual pie pastry crust but buttery, cookie like goodness at the bottom. The nutella one is a must do! It was not too much nutella or a powerful chocolate flavor, it had such a beautiful balance and the mouthfeel with the smooth mousse, the chocolate \"wafers\" on top and a crispy bottom was wonderful. One of the best chocolate hazelnut confections I've had and I am VERY fond of that flavor combo. I was fuming that I didn't get another for my fatass to eat and not share.   I bumped it to 5 stars because the service at this location is very good.Here the people were pleasant, asking if they can help, they were quick to keep the line going. It's sad that for a long time, I would not step into Jean Philippe because of our experience at the Bellagio one.  Bellagio was confusing, the service when we went was a clusterfuck and one lady wasn't very nice either- very curt.   This location has restored this place for me as a solid place to come and get a quality treat. Sure for some it might be deemed \"pricey\", but to me any kind of sweet meltdown will be money I'm happy to spend  and feel alright about going all the way down to the strip for."}
{"text":"I love their chocolates! My bf brought me the ballotin 12-piece box ($24) from Vegas. He handpicked the truffles, squared bonbons, and the chocolates from their fruit collection. Every piece that I had was delicious. I especially loved the crunchy pralines, earl gray, grand marniere truffle, mango passion and blueberry filled chocolates (though be warned that the fruit filled ones are runny and messy). Jean Philippe(including its chocolate fountain) is on my must visit list the next time I head to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious, I actually had double-breakfast. Come for the crepes, stay for the delectable sandwiches. I had the tandoori chicken panini and it was incredible."}
{"text":"I've only tried a few things here but all of them were pretty good. A warning tho, the prices they command are quite high. The one item that really blew me away was their Peanut Butter Brittle. It's unlike any other pbb I had ever tasted in my life, which was quite a shock. I had never tasted one so light, yet rich n buttery at the same time. Nice texture and crunch. I'm not sure if maybe its because store brand brittles arent as fresh as JP's. That was the only possibly theory I could come up with why it was so different and so good. The pbb price escapes me atm, but I believe it was around a 3 or 4oz box for $12 or so. I would say its worth trying an item that maybe catches your eye or something you like. Or if you feel like splurging on some high quality confections."}
{"text":"First time to try crepes here. Loved them, not too sweet and had fresh fruits. The presentation is very different from usual crepe place. I would definitely go back for more. It is quite expensive though but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ok best salmon sandwich ever !!!! The bread also the prosciutto sandwich perfect taste !!! The palmiers cookie !! Wow incredible ! Is a most go In Vegas"}
{"text":"By far my favorite bakery in Vegas. I get an almond croissant everyday that I'm here to make up for the times I think of it back home. Great selection available. Even though there's usually a line up, it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe Patisserie; it's probably the one place that we got food from in Vegas that I actually hadn't planned on. But, boy am I glad that we did make a stop here after looking at the Christmas display in the Bellagio.   The one thing that I had seen from Jean Phillipe was their world record chocolate fountain, only I didn't know that that's where it was. However, the sheer selection of pastries and sweet treats won me over much more than the chocolate fountain. As soon as you approach the shop, it's goodies as far as the eye can see! Well, the shop isn't that huge, to be honest, but dang if they didn't make great use of the space in there.   Even with all of the different choices they had in there, though, we went for the croissants, and what a quality decision that was! We got a regular croissant and an almond croissant, but the almond variation completely stole the show for me. It was the sweetest, most decadent croissant I'd ever had, and I loved it. The powdered sugar on top and the sweet filling inside made for a delicious breakfast.   We also got a white chocolate mocha to \"share\", which was also good! Although, due to our lactose intolerance all around, it wrecked our tummies. The things we put up with the eat delicious food!  All in all, the food was absolutely delicious and the location itself was simply splendid. If I could go there every day for my daily dose of sweets, I so would. If you're in Vegas, DEFINITELY go here!"}
{"text":"Cool place, but their set-up to help customers the day I was there was very slow and I think they were understaffed. I liked the gelato, the banana's foster was mediocre."}
{"text":"I am a new yelper. Even though I use yelp often, I never get any motivation to post any review (sorry). Tonight I just got one. Since this is my first time, I will try to make this objective and useful to other yelpers.  We have been to the Jean Phillipe in Bellagio and Aria. The chocolate is great, so the bad experience is really from the service we had in the new Jean Phillipe in Aria.  This is a true story happened tonight (4/7/10). My kid bought a pack of white chocolate. She did not check the ingredients which has peanuts in there. Like many kids, my kid is allergic to it. The chocolate is in its original package and is not opened. So I thought it would be trivial just to stop by and exchange a different one without peanuts. And it turned out I was so wrong.   My wife asked the cashier if she can exchange for another one. He asked her for a receipt. But they did not give us any receipt to begin with because we paid for it at the cafe side. So of course we have no receipt. Then the cashier said the chocolate is \"broken\" because the chocolate looks like it had been pressed. My wife went to the shelf and it turned out every pack of the white chocolate look like that. My wife asked the cashier to call the manager. He called the manager. The manager told the cashier on the phone that she would not come out to see my wife, and that the chocolate was \"broken\". They would not exchange it and there was nothing that they could do. My wife gave the chocolate back to the cashier and walked out.   I was waiting for my wife outside the store. When she came out, I could not believe that they would not exchange just a piece of chocolate and that their manager would not even want to see my wife. I mean even Target could do a thousand times better than that. So I went inside with my wife and requested to see the manager. This time after about 10 minutes, a lady manager came out. She seemed annoyed when she came out. My wife was upset because of the way she was treated. Instead of being understanding and pacify her, the manager said she would call the security. To be honest my wife was indeed raising her voice but she was not yelling or using any foul language or being insulting. I thought the first rule of handling customer complaint is to be understanding and let the customers vent out their frustration first. Apparently I was wrong. The lady  manager kept saying she was going to call security. When my wife showed her that all their white chocolate look the same as the one we tried to return, she ignored that. At the end she let us picked a different chocolate. Boy, I never worked so hard for a piece of chocolate, and almost got escorted out because of that.  In summary in spite of its amazing decor, expect the worst customer service. The chocolate is good. Check the ingredients though, many of them have peanuts, so no-no for many parents. If you want to exchange something or work out any issue, save the grief. They don't care, probably because they have so much business already. Forget about birthday and wedding cakes, their customer services will not back up their products. So pretty outside, completely rotten inside."}
{"text":"The line is long and finding a eat in table is a challenge.  But the spendy pastry and pricy chocolates is worth the wait with an Americano.   The occasional spurge at Jean Phillippe is part of the Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Got two crepes and a caprese panini sandwich and the raspberry pistachio tart/cake. They were all pretty tasty and freshly made/toasted. I enjoyed the caprese sandwich with it's melty cheese, and the bread wasn't really tough to chew or eat. The crepes were consumed by my family, and they seemed to enjoy them. I took a bit of the black forest ham one, and it had just waaay too much sauce. We were just squeezing the crepe to get rid of sauce.  On the other hand, the raspberry pistachio was just the right amount of sweet, with fresh raspberries on top!   The decor is whimsical and fun to look at, but the patisserie is just so close to the casino, smoke leaks over to the eating area.    Final Conclusion: It's a little pricy for the small portions you get, but the quality is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"World's largest chocolate fountain! They have the record certificate there. 3 different kinds chocolate. Runs like water, really smoothly. You can hardly tell it's moving. Haven't tried the chocolate there yet. But enjoying this amazing scene is a quite an experience already!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after seeing the crowd of people next to the huge chocolate fountain.  The pastries and sandwiches looked absolutely mouthwatering but since we were readying our stomachs for the buffet later on, we stuck to the western salad and the flan.  The western salad was actually quite tasty. A mix of greens, sliced beef, corn, beans, peppers, tomatoes, and bacon paired with a honey mustard-like dressing was quite filling.  The flan was alright. Eggy, smooth, and firm enough. The price is standard vegas price but we wished we had tried something a bit more exciting in the end.  The crepes looked quite appealing but we passed since the line was far too long."}
{"text":"Over priced, over crowded, mediocre products. Welcome to the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe storefront is located in front of the elevators to the hotel rooms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=EXVvx1O49t64AWTO_zM0CQ).  Perfect for those who stay at Aria as one does not have to go far in order to pick up some breakfast items.  Didn't dine there as there were tons of people enjoying coffee and danishes with no open tables.  Opted to take my coffee and Nutella brioche back to the room to enjoy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=Ajg1uOP4C7Q6b1cwbwJ65g). For people that love Nutella, this is a must!  The brioche bread was light and fluffy and was filled with Nutella.  Coffee was good as well and will be back tomorrow to pick up some items to take back home with me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=G0sFpyrVp_EIrj4KdG8CHg).  Also picked up some of their macaroons....tried one and it's only ok.  Paulette and Payard's are much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"the desserts are aamazing.. For a MOF certified pastry chef they have lots of other things which the customers seem to go for like the gelato or sandwiches, but this guy is specializes  in desserts and chocolates. Hence i highly recommend trying those out and you ll know its amazing.. We had the triple layered cheesecake.. it had a tiny truffle on the top which is better than godiva or lindt! the cake itself is just pure wow! We got home a chocolate indulgence which tastes as good as it looks."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is amazing.   Every year for about three years running now, my husband and I go with the rest of my family to Las Vegas just to get away for a week.   We do a variety of things. We usually include a Cirque show in there and do the Tournament of Kings, but my husband and I have made it a tradition to always go to this particular JPP in the Bellagio and purchase treats for everyone to share. We usually get four or five of the treats, sit down with a JPP coffee and eat them.   The only thing that I'd say is a downer is the fact that the drinks are far overprice. I understand why the desserts would be 7$ (they are) but, a tropical smoothie is 9$...   That's a little nuts.  Everything tastes amazing tho."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up breakfast/lunch/snack! Super convenient if you are staying at the Bellagio in the Spa Tower. Ate a delicious ham & cheese panini (the mustard was awesome!) for lunch. Also had half a nutella crepe and a bite of a chocolate strawberry crepe, both were delicious! Throughout our stay I also tried a smattering of pastries for breakfast throughout the week (apple brioche, blueberry brioche, apple muffin, raisin cinnamon roll), all were excellent. I also bought the peanut brittle as a gift and they gave a nice bag to put it in. Avoid going at peak times, as the line can wrap around the counter."}
{"text":"After my last visit I had to deduct a star because the already high prices of their bakery have increased & they now charge $.75 for a cup of tap water. I still love the crepes but everything else is overpriced."}
{"text":"Location/Accessibility: Aria and Bellagio  Ambiance: avg noise, great for groups  Dress Code: casual  Menu options: American, sandwiches, croissants, quiche, muffins, yogurt w fruit, fruit cups, salad, desserts  Had: turkey and cheese croissant, blueberry muffin, fruit cup  Service: Staff is friendly. Food came out in a reasonable time.  Price: too pricey! but that's vegas for ya!  Overall experience: The food is good, but over priced."}
{"text":"They have the most unique cupcakes, both in shape and layers. See my photos for the red velvet and blueberry cupcakes where there is a layer of dome shaped cream cheese frosting, with a glazed layer on top. Then when you stuck your fork inside there were layers of rich cream cheese and tender sponge cake. It was rich, flavorful and not overly sweet. French pastry chefs know how to do their desserts right.  Same can be said about their cheesecake. See my photos again. It was beautifully shaped with a layer of chocolate crust on top. This was also one of the best cheesecakes I have tasted.   I also tried a few flavors of their macarons (see photos), and they were also soft, moist, flavorful and everything you would expect good French macarons taste like.  Their gelato and sorbet was great too. Oh and so are their sandwich/wraps offering for when you are on the go.  Other items I tasted: opera cake was rich and tasty. Vanilla napolean was so so but I never liked napolean cakes anyway. Chocolate eclair was not what I had expected. There was only a little, dense chocolate cream filling. It did not wow me.  They also have those standard items such as croissant, morning buns, the like. Then you can also buy chocolates here. With so much variety to choose from no wonder this location is always busy.  During that week of conference at Aria Hotel, I visited here almost on a daily basis. Prices are not cheap. So are not desserts this caliber. Desserts this exquisite are worth gaining weight for."}
{"text":"Jean Phillipe Patisserie is a bit over-priced and the service needs some work (the servers were nice but not particularly efficient...)... however, they have really delicious offerings!  On our first night at the Aria, we needed a snack when we arrived since we knew we'd be going to dinner way later. I chose the ham and cheese croissant ($7.50) sandwich and it was SO good! It was decadent, rich, and a little piece of heaven really! All of the sweets look pretty heavenly too but we were really looking for something savory.  Later in the weekend, we came back for coffee. The coffee was really good though my cafe au lait could have used a bit more of the \"au lait\" (aka milk). The seating area is super cute and everyone seemed to be really enjoying their food and beverages!"}
{"text":"Expensive (but worth it)... Crowded (for good reason)... Delicious (hence the five stars).  Before we even ventured up to our room in the spa tower at the Bellagio, we had to walk past this place, and were immediately drawn in like moths to a flame.  We had a cold bottle of champagne waiting for us, so what better to go with that than a chocolate-covered strawberry?  They are gigantic, fresh strawberries (on steroids), and we opted for the ones coated in dark chocolate and coconut.  We also could not resist ordering the strawberry almond tart.  The tart, strawberries and champagne were fabulous as we sat in our room overlooking the strip. Two days later, we decided to get chocolate and strawberry crepes for breakfast... they too were amazing.  (We like strawberries... can you tell?)  You will not be sorry for ordering something here."}
{"text":"I wish they were located by my work so I can go all the time. Very delicious and perfect for light snacks and breakfast. However, customer service is tad off- but I can understand because they do get quite busy during morning when they have to serve the business people before they head off to their convention.   I had breakfast and lunch here because I liked it so much.  Sticky pecan bun - So flaky and yummy. Highly recommend.  Spinach quiche - it is topped with olives (my fav) and light and flavorful. A great morning meal itself. It does not come in a big portion but I never liked eating heavy meals in the morning anyways.  Chicken Cesar Salad- healthy and filling. The chicken is not your typical dry chicken breast flakes. Rather, it is tender and rolled up with olives and roasted tomatoes that makes it so enjoyable.   I also really like sitting here to people watch. Their pastry is the best. The cream puffs weren't that good. The filling made the breading outside too soggy for my taste.   Be careful though as the prices do add up quickly. Things here are a bit higher than your starbuck type faire."}
{"text":"OMG Mr. Jean-Phillip you are WRONG for making desserts so incrediably delish I just want to stuff my face with everything on the menu!  (clears throat) so this is a review for the sweet stuff only =)  Jean-Phillip runs a tight ship at this vegas Patisserie of his.  His dessert are visual and taste bud estasy, and this is truely an understatement for sweet tooth like myself.  The crepes are good, and you gotta get a scoop of gelato to go with it people!   I'm definitely not a shredded coconut lover, but his coconut gelato converted me!  The intense coconut flavor is simply heavenly, best gelato ever!  The rice krispies are sweet and buttery, plus its dipped in chocolate! what can be wrong with that!  I almost fell off my chair when I bite into the macodamia nut cookies...enough said  Good thing I live only 10min away from Jean-Phillip...uhm...I'll be right back!"}
{"text":"This patisserie is located behind the beautiful Bellagio Botanic Garden. The first thing you'll see is the mesmerizing fountain of cascading liquid chocolate. JP offers an incredible selection of sweet and savory items including chocolates, cookies, cakes, crepes, salads, sandwiches and much more.   My favorites are the Ham and Cheese Panini Sandwich, grilled to perfection with melted cheese and ham, simple and yet satisfying. Sugar Brioche, a rich buttery roll topped with crystallized sugar, the crunchiness of the sugars compliments perfectly with the soft and sweet dough. Chocolate Banana Crepe, a made to order crepe, topped with warm caramelized banana, and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce, add a scoop of vanilla bean gelato, and it's a perfect dessert!"}
{"text":"I got a single scoop of gelato (maybe mine was more of a sorbet) for $3.50 I think, which I feel like is unheard of in Vegas, especially at a fancy pants place like this. While I wasn't blown away by my choice of lemon, I can't complain about the price or amount of options JPP has, so that's why I'm giving a four.  I probably wouldn't get the lemon gelato (sorbet?) again because it was super intensely sour -- to the point where my jaws hurt a little bit every time I took a bite. I love sour stuff, but this was a little too intense. This is a very nice place to stop at when strolling around The Strip."}
{"text":"This is in the Bellagio. Loved the giant 20ft tall chocolate fountain. Wonderful atmosphere. There is seating outside of the little (very little) cafe area. Great stop for dessert before a show or a light lunch or breakfast. Chocolates, cookies, cakes, crepes, salads, sandwiches, coffee, and more."}
{"text":"Every bakery should be like this...minus the lines. It's that good...or maybe  that convenient. Must be both. There are so many savory and sweet food and drink choices that we had to come back multiple times just to try more things.  VENUE: I know there are various locations for this delightful place, but I frequented the one in the Aria Casino and Hotel Resort. The seating area is very small and limited - maybe only 10 or so tables, so if you aren't lucky to grab a seat, get your food to go and find a place to sit. Because it's located right next to the casino, and because there are so many people wanting to grab a bite, the atmosphere is super busy and loud.   FOOD/DRINK: Chicken Basil Panini: Wonderful. I'm a sucker for anything with pesto. The cheese literally just pulls into string as you take a bite. Bread is crispy but not too hard.  Smoked Salmon Sandwich (served warm): you can ask for this item, even though it's a \"cold\" item, to be served warm. It's scrumptious. Perferct for breakfast - I thought I was going to be hungry after I ate it because it seems so small. But I was actually full after it. Maybe because it was still morning and I was just waking up. Either way it's a great breakfast choice. I wasn't too crazy about the hard boiled egg in the sandwich. Next time I'll have to remember to ask them to remove that.  Smoke Salmon Crepe: Better as the sandwich. Crepe itself had good consistency  Dessert Trio: Comes with a macaron hugging raspberries, a peanut butter ice cream pop, and a small shot of crème brulee. Oh and did I mention that the base these all sit on is made of chocolate? Needless to say I didn't finish this.  Fourth of July Special: Oh lord this was so tasty I'm secretly hoping that they serve it frequently but just dressed it up differently for the holiday. It's an uncle sam hat shape, covered in delicious butter cream fondant. Inside lemon vanilla cake with a butter cream and strawberries. SO GOOD. Independence day just isn't the same without strawberries.  Smoothies: We ordered one, forgot the name. It had peach, mango, pinapple, and other tropical fruit. It was really tarte (which is good for us because we like it that way) but will probably disappoint those who prefer there smoothies to be on the more sugary side.  Side note, you're going to end of up paying about $7-8 per sandwich. Desserts range from $5-10 as well. There are also other baked good options (muffins, bagels, etc.)  SERVICE: It's crowded and you're in a line. Lol. But the waitstaff and people who were taking down our orders were pleasant and patient and not at all cranky as you might expect them to be after having to deal with dozens of people at a time."}
{"text":"Just OK. The establishment itself is a grand eyeful - lots of delicate and scrumptious looking treats placed all over. The service itself could have been better. We wanted an after-show snack after seeing Zarkana upstairs, and a sweet crepe sounded perfect.   There were a couple workers behind the counter, but it took a couple minutes to get acknowledged by the staff. The crepes are made-to-order. We opted for the exotic crepe ($11.50) - a warm mango and passion fruit salsa atop a soft crepe with a side of coconut ice cream. I wish the crepes were stuff with the salsa, instead of of just being poured on top. The ice cream itself was probably my favorite item on the plate.   Overall, just an ok spot for crepes. I'd probably come back to try a savory crepe - maybe those are stuffed?"}
{"text":"When you are at the Bellagio walking around, its hard not to stop and stare at their huge chocolate fountain. Its also impossible to not be curious as to why the place is so crowded and full of people. This little shop sells tons of pastries and drinks. My GF wanted to come enjoy a snack because she has been here before. Although the line was long, it moved pretty quick. The service was super friendly. Pastries were average though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! They created the most beautiful princess cake for my daughter's 4th birthday, a joint party with her best friend also turning 4. We had the cake brought with friends traveling from Las Vegas and it held up perfectly. At the park where the party was held a few people stopped us just to ask where we got the cake! Since we are in San Diego they were a bit disappointed that the cake was from  Las Vegas, but one said they just might travel that far it was so impressive. A lot of pretty cakes don't taste that good, but this was one of the best cakes I've ever had. Beautiful and delicious, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had the tropical fruit crepe with coconut ice cream and it was AMAZINGGGG."}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is a lovely little cafe & dessert shop with gorgeous decor and a cool chocolate fountain! They have both sweet and savory crepes, gelato, beautiful desserts, pastries, cold sandwiches, hot paninis, and coffees. They also sell chocolates, candies, and other goodies that you can bring home or give as gifts.  I tried the Chicken crepe (savory) and the Exotic Souffle crepe (sweet) and was much more satisfied with the Chicken crepe, which had chicken, spinach, roasted red peppers, and a really delicious dressing. (I think there was probably more but I wolfed it down too quickly to notice all of the individual ingredients.) The Exotic Souffle crepe was basically a crepe with some melted vanilla cream inside (straight from the refrigerator), topped with a mango/pineapple sauce that was a bit too sour and used fruit that wasn't ripe enough yet, and a scoop of coconut sherbet.   The sweet crepes seem to be the most popular; there's often a crowd waiting in front of the crepe-making area. However, I think the savory crepes are more worth it than the sweet crepes, which are simpler to make (generally, Nutella and maybe some raw fruit). The savory crepes are much more filling and delicious!  I also tried the salmon sandwich, and it was quite good, though expensive (like most other things at the Patisserie). I tried one of the pastries, an almond croissant, which was amazing! It was pretty different from your average croissant; the bottom layer of it was really moist and soooo good.  The drinks are not really worth it... $5 for a small latte that tastes pretty average, $4 for a plain iced coffee that tastes pretty dilute... Stick with the desserts and non-drinks!"}
{"text":"This dessert place is located inside of Bellagio Casino. The chocolate fountain looks very stunning from top to bottom. This dessert place totally a heaven for dessert lovers. It's fancy and unbelievably good. The best dessert place I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a girls' weekend trip and we stopped here everyday since we stayed at Aria.  Between the 3 of us, we tried creme brûlée, chocolate intense, triple chocolate, sniker cake, rose macaron, chocolate croissant and almond croissant.  I can confidently say that the best items are anything that are made with chocolate.  The creme brûlée and rose macaron were huge disappointments.  My friend ordered a pumpkin spice latte for over $6 and it was only half full.  Despite the misses, I still highly recommend the chocolate pastries, pistachio gelato, and mango gelato."}
{"text":"the chocolate and macroons here are so delicious its like your eating in heaven. gelatos pretty good also. ive bought the cake for my in-laws but i havent had the chance of eating it myself but they tell me its good. You can almost never go wrong with eating anything from here!! It's fatty heaven lol"}
{"text":"We never skip our crepe at Jean Phillipe at least one morning while in Vegas.  It gets busy, so plan on coming early - I get there at 7am and get my crepe quickly.  Otherwise you're going to be waiting a while.  The line for the sandwiches and pastries is separate and it shouldn't intimidate you - it moves quickly most of the time.  The coffee is great as are the confections - our kids always get something from here when we get off the plane.  The decorated cakes, etc. are always fun to look at.  It's half spectacle, half deliciousness, but we can't stay away."}
{"text":"I'm in HEAVEN!!!!!  The most delicious pastry shop I have ever been too! They had so much to choose from ranging from sweet to savory!  We stayed at the Aria Hotel for 3 nights and you best believe we got a little treat from here everyday. We even brought some home with us.  The Nutella Brioche and Dulce De Leche Brioche were FANTASTIC!  The Key Lime Tart was amazingly good as well.  Even the salads and gourmet sandwiches they make are great!  Mmmmm.....my sweet tooth craving is kicking in!"}
{"text":"They never cease to amaze me with their colorful variations of sweet treats. Though they are pricy items, they make it up in presentation and taste. If you have a sweet tooth like me....follow your nose to JP."}
{"text":"Yeay for Jean Philippe!  I have had this place bookmarked for ages, and since I was there to check out the Bellagio Art Gallery, I finally had my chance!  We went with the Nutella Napoleon.  It was pretty good!  As Nutella lovers though, the essence was a little hidden, but still tasty!  They should really pile it on there lol.  Also tried the Hazelnut Gelato :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-philippe-patisserie-las-vegas-6?userid=tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg#k5loHzfLd_ccY3_AL0TKtw  This was the winner in my book!  Great flavor and a good way to cool off in the Vegas heat!  Probably a good thing that this place is a bit difficult to get to from a local's perspective...I would be eating here all the time lol"}
{"text":"This is always a must stop for me on my last day in Vegas before heading home. My parents love their chocolates ($2 each piece) and it is nice how they have pre-packaged boxes and also give you the option to choose the chocolates. I always hand pick since they have a nice selection of flavors.  LOVEEE"}
{"text":"The chocolates here are amazing. I always get my parents something when I go on trips so I decided to get them chocolates since Jean Philippe is known for his. My mom isn't exactly a sweets lover but I thought, hey what the heck? If they are good she'll enjoy them and boy, she did! I got them both all of the pistachio chocolates as well as a few others and they both thoroughly enjoyed them. I was so surprised when my mom said she really liked them and savored each one. Damn to desserts being so bad for our thighs and making them chunky cottage cheese!   They are pretty pricey-- $2 for a small chocolate but they are really delicious and as much as I want to gag when I say this because it's so cheesy, they are like a bite of heaven.   The help wasn't as sweet (actually the chocolates are great because they are indulgent but not overly sweet) as the chocolates. I asked if they had small boxes and the lady who helped me seemed annoyed.. then I asked if I could customize the boxes which is a popular option because they have a huge display of chocolates and she seemed even more annoyed because she had to stop her side conversation...   Go for the chocolates and to look at the amazing decorations. The guys kept gambling while I entertained myself and looked at everything. Prices are steep but it's Vegas (what a bad excuse!) and it's famous."}
{"text":"The choclates and pastries are surprisngly really good! And I thought it wouldn't live up to the hype.  But if it seems too pricey for just pastries then just go to at least see the chocolate display."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and diverse. I was very impressed. Not cheap, but not ridiculous either. I enjoyed everything I got, including the breakfast and lunch sandwiches, the deserts and the coffee. Pleasant surprise and perfectly located since I was generally running to or from a conference."}
{"text":"What the hell is wrong with me!!!!! A week has not even gone by and I am reviewing another dessert specialized business.   Lets call this my birthday treat as I do not do cakes.   Located at the Bellagio is Jean Philippe Patisserie, in which I strongly urge everyone to check out.   CALLING ALL DESSERT LOVERS I REPEAT CALLING ALL DESSERT LOVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only is their displays of different dessert delicacys look delicious, all their desserts make me want to rob the place! Not for the money either!   I order a Strawberry Gelato, which was so rich, milky, creamy, and had actual strawberry! This is by far the best birthday treat ever. I would have robbed Jean Philippe for their tub of Strawberry Gelato. Sentence me to prison, I just hope they have a fridge for me to put the tub of ice cream. Sell it in prison as if it were crack, because the inmates will definitely not be able to get enough of this hot new drug."}
{"text":"Everyone goes here for the chocolate fountain but I honestly thought it was underwhelming. It's Hard to stare at chocolate and not be allowed to eat it.   The pastries are really pretty it was very hard to make a decision.  I finally chose the imperial since I was craving for chocolate. Dark chocolate mousse w/ creme brûlée  and crispy nuts inside. The crispy nuts were in some crunchy cookie. This was delightful! I'm giving it 4 stars just for this desert! It is one of the best I have tried. I will come back again and try more next time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of a good patisserie, and this is a good patisserie.  It was a little busy/hectic around 2pm on a weekday, but I grabbed a croissant and eyed the brioche and madeleines and tarts.  Unfortunately, their butter croissant has a sweet glaze to it.  It's not overpowering, but it's definitely not the way I want my butter croissant.  Also, this is not the heavenly croissants one can find in Europe...it has an excellent texture and I'm pretty sure they're all-butter, but the flavor isn't complex/deep at all."}
{"text":"The pastries are dressed up pretty,   however the pastries and desserts don't seem to even taste as good as the grocery store bakeries.  Hard to justify these high prices."}
{"text":"Rushed through the line at closing. Paid a lot for a okay desert but didn't feel special to be rushed through and then the tables outside to sit down and eat where all filthy. I was so looking forward to coming here but we spent about 25.00 on one desert and nothing to drink and not even a clean table to sit at. I liked my desert but then I wanted a drink but I couldn't get one sense they closed and rushed everyone out."}
{"text":"An overpriced bakery in the heart of the Aria hotel, but with top quality food. We came here for breakfast and had the key lime tart and raspberry donut. Both were great, but as I said overpriced.   I've come to realize that everything is Vegas is overpriced, and this location is no exception. Still, the food is really good and you can sit back and relax while enjoying top notch desserts. Thumbs up despite the pricing here."}
{"text":"Oh my chocolate god! Their pastries and chocolate goodies are oh so creamy and delicious. I got an assortment of their truffles  and red velvet cupcake. The truffles will melt in your mouth and it will definitely leave you wanting more. It's about $2.50+ for each truffle and about $7 for the red velvet cupcake, so it is on the pricier end, but you get what you pay for at this place. Drop by for a little taste of heaven if your on the strip."}

{"text":"Love this location - conveniently located in the Aria lobby, this location is much bigger and is more organized than the Bellagio location.  Beautifully decorated cakes - really high quality taste!  Solid 5 stars for:  1. Key lime tart --- perfect blend of sweet and sour! 2. Almond croissant --- savory and sweet combination, the almond paste is delicious 3. Raspberry macaron --- my favorite dessert at JPP  This bakery is one of the reasons why I love Vegas!"}
{"text":"I normally order the Crepes here when I am in Vegas.  This location is a lot less crowded than other location in Bellagio.  It's cool to see the decorations that he made at each location.  But you really can't go wrong with the crepe here.  It always made perfectly."}
{"text":"The perfect desserts:  The Raspberry Tart and the Christmas Log!  The Aria location is better than the one in Bellagio since it is bigger, has more selection and a seating area.  Also, they make the pastries at the Aria location and ship them to Bellagio to sell.  Raspberry Tart:  Fresh red raspberries topped pastry - fourteen, yes FOURTEEN raspberries.  The base of the tart is made up of almond shortbread, layered with pistachio cream & raspberry gel combines that comes together with the fresh fruit for a bite of heaven!  I bought two of these!  Christmas log:  Not only beautiful with its white chocolate arches protecting the soft, delicate mousse, it tastes even better than it looks. Not too sweet and smiles upon smiles once it enters your mouth.  Goodness, an excellent find on the Vegas strip!  You must visit."}
{"text":"I know this going to sound a little like sacrilege, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolate- but that is not what this review is about. While staying at the Aria Resort and Casino, each morning I would go down the elevator for a great cup of coffee, rather than prepare a weak one in the room. The pastries and the coffee they had were always quick and delicious. Service was friendly as well which is half the battle when you're just  waking up and just trying to unglue your eyes and enjoy a hot cup of Jo. For a sure-to-win cup of coffee or juice and maybe a pastry, you won't go wrong stopping here."}
{"text":"I don't understand why I keep coming back here everytime I'm in Vegas.  It's not like they serve the best crepe in the world.  I've had better crepes.   It's just an ordinary crepe.  I had the souffle crepe with apples the last time i was here.  It sounds interesting does it?  Souffle crepe?! What is that?  Well to tell you the truth it's just a crepe with Vanilla custard cream.   I suggest you have someone get in line and order the crepe as someone else grabs a table.  The line gets pretty long and seats are limited."}
{"text":"So good... all the desserts looked yummy.. but I met my best friend here for our last day in Vegas to treat her for a bday breakfast... and she says the tuna sandwich is amazing (she got one to go for her boyfriend) and I tried the chicken aoili panini. I thought it was pretty good. I don't know how they justify charging me $4 for an iced tea, but you know whatever."}
{"text":"If you're craving Ice Cream, come here! They serve really good gelato which is made fresh daily and great amount of selection. You can try as many flavors as you want!   I've tried the Oreo cookie, pistachio, vanilla with chocolate, and rocky road.   But the ones I actually bought were the hazelnut and the tiramisu. Sooo bomb!  If you're more into the fresh fruity flavors, def get mango!  I like this place cos their gelato is not too sweet!  I wanted to try the crepes next time they look yummy!  But I'd stay away from their treats...I was looking and some chocolate covered pretzel was like $22  and other souvenir treat bags were pricy too! but I guess, since it's Vegas right? Lol"}
{"text":"A cute pastry shop with tons of enticing pastries I want to try that seems reasonable for its price. Plus the line to order doesn't take long and getting your food is quite fast (~5-10 mins). I had: Triple chocolate cheesecake: delicious! Tuna melt sandwich: Not bad but the tuna itself is a bit tasteless. Ham & Cheese Croissant: delicious!"}
{"text":"Always go here when I'm in Vegas, and a box of cakes to-go back home :D  love their Trio cheesecake, Triple chocolate and Napoleon :D  This time we've tried the breakfast sandwich and apple strudel, and as always, didn't disappointed us!."}
{"text":"Even though I was super stuffed from dinner, we decided to head to Bellagio to grab some desserts and to see the giant chocolate fountain. It's apparently it's the largest chocolate fountain and is even in the Guiness Book for World Records. It goes from the ceiling to the ground, but it's made up of a bunch of small shelves and the chocolate travels in different paths. There's a dark chocolate path, milk chocolate, and white chocolate, and they intertwine kind of, but they never mix. I thought it was a cool design. It's pretty awesome, and people would just stop walking when they saw it and pulled out their cameras. It was fun people-watching here too. After looking around the shop for a bit, we decided to get a crepe and some cakes. My friend made a good decision and got an \"exotic\" crepe? or something like that... it was reallllly good. The top was warm mango in a mango syrup, and the ice cream was coconut. It was super super SUPER good. Inside I think she said was some kind of berry jam or something? I'm not really sure, but the crepe was delicious. The coconut ice cream was SUPER coconuty and really really good. Twas my favorite part. We also got two different types of cakes. The first one we got was called Opera and it was like a 12-layer cake with all kinds of chocolate and coffee flavors. Oh man, I cannot describe to you how delicious this cake was. It was SO SO SO SO SO GOOD. I even ate the gold on top. The dark chocolate on top was super rich, but the layers were so moist and flavorful. Each layer was something new, so my mouth never got tired of eating it. The truffle on top was decent too, but the cake was the main attraction. So delicious. When I go back here, I'm going to have a hard time not ordering this again even though I want to try all the different cakes there. The last cake we got there, I can't remember what it was called, but it was chocolate mousse with hazelnut and banana flavors. The bottom actually seemed like it had very small pieces of banana in it. It was really good, a lot more refreshing than the chocolate one, a lot less rich, but still really really good. They used a carmelized banana on the top too. Not sure how they made it red, we think maybe just like a red cocoa powder? All the desserts we got there were really good -- my goal is to come back here each time and try all the different cakes there, because there were just so many I wanted to try. They also have other things like $22 marshmallows and good looking coffees and chocolates. Highly recommend eating dessert here. I can vouch for the crepes and the cakes being one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Desserts galore!!  This is my kind of place. Everytime I walked past it in the casino I couldn't help but stare and drool a bit. I had a plan as soon as I saw it. Wait until after all the Yelp activities are done and use pretty much all our credit at this beauty.This way I could still fit into the clothes I brought to wear.   Unfortunately my husband didnt like that plan and I got stuck with about 30 dollars to spend here right before we left for home. Blah!!   The line can look long but it goes pretty fast. The cakes, tarts, chocolates, and pastries are all beautifully displayed. The cakes are especially artistic looking. Almost like Dr. Seuss meets Paris.  I ended up trying the raspberry macaroon tart, a strawberry cream tart, and a  lemon blueberry cupcake. The Macaroon was by far the best out of the three. It was soft and the Bavaria cream in the middle was a great combo with the fresh raspberries.   This is somewhere I will definitely come back to in Vegas."}
{"text":"This beautiful little place in the corner of Bellagio Casino and Hotel is simply AMAZING!  Guinness World record for the largest chocolate fountain.  Yes chocolate fountain of 3 different cascading real chocolate from ceiling to the ground.  The gelato was YUMMY!  One cup has two scoops of your favorite flavors.  I got mango sorbet and strawberry.  Usually I stay away from gelatos because they're usually too sweet for my taste, but the gelatos here were not too sweet.  This place makes crepes too and they look beautiful.  All in all this place is a great place to take a break from the machines and have yourself a little treat.  And maybe you can find a good spot to watch the Bellagio water show from the inside"}
{"text":"Desserts at Jean Phillipe are not only delicious they are beautifully made. Really enjoyed the selection of treats hubby brought us. The key lime pie was insanely good. There is something for everyone there."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great place for a crepe, the desserts taste great and are amazing to look at as well.  I usually stay at the Aria and I eat here each day for something different whether its a snack, breakfast item, coffee, Gelato, or some candy."}
{"text":"The food and pastries here were fantastic. The service was very friendly. Their pricing is extremely high and not locals friendly."}
{"text":"Although we were staying in the Bellagio, we were unable to try this delight until the night before we were leaving, 15 minutes before closing. I am SO glad we didn't miss it. These desserts taste as beautiful as they appear.  We ordered 3 desserts (a triple chocolate mousse, the Snickers-inspired dessert, and some other one), the ones that hadn't been sold out yet. Even though they were the less popular leftovers of the day, they were all divine, in particular the Snickers dessert (which really did taste like a Snickers bar!). I can only imagine what their more popular desserts taste like. Their crepe station and gelato are also very popular, but unfortunately we weren't able to try them. If I ever come back, there WILL be daily visits.  It also happens to be a very chic little store corner, with the famous chocolate fountains on the side. Of note is during our stay, the fountain actually malfunctioned and started spilling chocolate all over the floor. That was amusing!  Just come here once (but buy some water from a drug store or something first)!"}
{"text":"I would say I eat/order from this place about once a week because I'm a regular in the Aria Poker room. This place is very will designed and elegant! Great place to take photos and bring a date, especially if she has a sweet tooth lol. As for myself, I don't eat any of the sweets here because I'm on a strict diet, so I can't say much for the gelato ice cream and other mouth watering sugar fixes they offer here, but I did try all of the sandwiches and salads they offer.  Here's a quick list to help you make your choices:  PANINIS - $10.95 - All made with Ciabatta Bread Tandori Panini - chicken/curry mayo/cucumbers/basil/tomatoes/swiss cheese Tuna Panini - tuna/mayo/tomato/fontina cheese/spinach Spicy Chicken Panini - spicy tomato spread/chicken/swiss cheese/tomato/caramelized onions Basil Chicken Panini - chicken/basil aioli mayo/fontina cheese/basil/caramelized onions Prosciutto Panini (MY FAV) - cured italian ham/basil aioli mayo/buffalo mozzarella/basil/tomatoes Ham and Cheese - ham/country dijon mustard/swiss cheese/spinach/tomatoes  SANDICHES - $10.15  Smoked Salmon (MY FAV) - Dill brioche/caper dill cream cheese/smoked salmon/daikon sprouts/egg/caper dill red onions Roasted Turkey - Croissant/butter/cranberry relish/cheddar cheese/alfalfa sprout/tomatoes/roasted turkey breast Cold Ham and Cheese - Challah bread/mayo/dijon mustard/ham/swiss cheese/spinach/tomatoes Roast Beef - Challah bread/horseradish sour cream/dijon mustard/roast beef/watercress/tomatoes/red onions  SALADS - $12.95 Cobb Salad - lettuce/grilled chicken/bacon/eggs/tomatoes/cucumber/daikon sprouts/blue cheese/blue cheese dressing Western Salad (MY FAV) - Bacon,red peppers,cheddar,swiss,corn,red onions,beef steak,black beans,southwestern ranch dressing Caesar Salad (MY OTHER FAV LOL) - Romaine lettuce/grilled chicken/anchovies and pecan filled/parmesan/croutons/caesar dressing.  Well I hope this all helps you make a choice! I literally had to type this whole menu myself and wasn't copy pasted as Jean Philippe's online site doesn't have a menu for some reason. SYOY!"}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain at Jean Philippe Patisserie is on my standard \"tourist friend visiting Las Vegas for first time\" tour. I am not sure if it lives up to its description because I think everyone pictures the Bellagio water fountain but with chocolate, and it is not even minutely close to that. Still it is cool and record-holding, and it is right around the corner from the Atrium, so why not stop by and give it a gander?  However, the real reason I love Jean Philippe are the savory crepes. I know most people go here to satisfy a sweet tooth and justifiably so, but I do not have a giant sweet tooth. I love the savory crepes. They are yum, served with a salad and a very affordable lunch compared to other Strip offerings. I always recommend it as a quick, cheap lunch for people staying on the Strip. I also have heard from a very qualified source that the fruit tart is particularly good."}
{"text":"While walking through Bellagio to catch the Tram, we noticed this amazing bakery.  The site is beautiful and it was packed with folks trying to get an sweet afternoon treat.  Everything looked amazing and there were so many options to choose from that it was really hard to pick just one dessert.  My friend settled on the creme brule' gelato and I went with the triple chocolate cheesecake.  She enjoyed her gelato.  My cheesecake was so beautiful that I did not want to cut into it.  The cheesecake was covered by a white chocolate shell.  Once you cut into it, the cheesecake was really soft and yummy.  The graham cracker crust was difficult to cut into while walking and eating at the same time, but it was really good.  Once it was done, there was a chocolate ball on top which was the perfect capper.  I wish I could have tried some of the other pastries or chocolates.  I will be back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The sweets are really good, though the cost should be three dollar sign.  The cream brûlée is absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this location in the aria rather than the bellagio . Their crepes are delicious freshly made in front of you. My all time favorite is Nutella strawberry crepe. They do charge extra for strawberry which is annoying. I have tried their savory crepes as well which are delicious too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best chocolate I've ever had.  Their milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars are so simple, but I love them the best because the clarity of flavor really shines through without the distraction of creams or nuts or other accoutrements.   JP chocolate is light, and not cloyingly sweet and full of additives like, say, a Hersheys bar would be. It just tastes expensive!   The actual shop itself is like an adult Wonka Factory. The chocolate fountain is ultra whimsical and there are beautiful pastries and boxes and specialty chocolate displays everywhere and it's just... it' s just a happy place. I'm sad that I don't have constant access to JP chocos, as I'm from Hawaii. I must stock up and nibble at them covetously in bed every night :b Rations, ppl, rations!"}
{"text":"A great place to \"AWWWW\" your friends and family with there \"world's largest chocolate fountain\" that flows from the ceiling to the floor.  I myself am not a sweets person, savory things are more my thing. I LOVE the fact that this place has both for a eater like me. I must say that the sweets are amazing, i ordered the lime tart which was just as close to perfect.   I'm a fan..."}
{"text":"The absolute best crepes I have ever had!! My favorite is definitely the souffle crepe. I personally like my crepes pretty plain but with nutella,  so this was kind of the perfect one for me. I've tried others before, but cannot remember their names since my discovery of the souffle crepe, but I do recall the others being delicious as well.  They also vend several different types of goodies which are great for gifts. Everything is nicely displayed and decorated, very clean and fancy and I can stare at their amazing chocolate fountain for days!    Each time I go to Vegas, I always try to make a trip to this place even though it may be bit out of my way if I'm not staying at the Bellagio. It is not located in the same area as the other stores and boutiques, it is actually by the guest elevators instead, which is a bit of an awkward location. Yes, the place might be hard to find, it may be a bit pricey, the lines might be long, and the place might be unorganized with several customers wandering around, but the crepes are definitely worth the trouble!"}
{"text":"Crepes!!!  If you are here, try the crepes with Ice-Cream. The pastries are all good and french authentic.  Not to miss"}
{"text":"Crepes!!!  If you are here, try the crepes with Ice-Cream. The pastries are all good and french authentic.  Lots of candies and pick a box of your taste  Not to miss"}
{"text":"Jean Phillippe was one of the most beautiful surprises a the Aria. The decoration the service, the quality of the products, the reception, everything was amazing! I especially want to mention the manager \"Sylvain\" who was extremely kind and obliging and highly professional, he gave us great advice and guidance!"}
{"text":"I swear, walking into Jean Philippe's bakery is like walking straight into french bakery heaven! Every little detail on his cakes, cup cakes, french macaroons is perfect! My first bite was like I was in heaven because it was that good!!"}
{"text":"This place is a 6***** outstanding, every dessert is AMAZING! my favorite is the chocolate mouse, the cup cakes are just mmmm...Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Pastisserie has a HUGE selection of desserts. HUGE I TELL YOU. The presentation is gorgeous as well.  Image a semi circle and divide it into three sections: 1) crepes (savory or sweet), 2) cafe food (coffee, sandwiches, etc), and 3) assorted desserts. Thats what the patisserie looks like. There's a large menu on the wall of sandwiches and crepes. I didn't try all of the food, but I make my own crepe, instead of getting a crepe on the menu.   Let me tell you...you are DEFINITELY better off getting a crepe off the menu for ~$11. Making your own crepe is $16 and all I got was nutella, strawberry, and walnuts. There are other crepes that have five items in it and it costs ~$11. I don't get it, even for the Bellagio in Vegas, I see no logic.  The crepe itself was extremely sweet and huge! I needed some coffee or something afterwards. Inside the crepe was the nutella, outside the crepe was topped with strawberries, walnuts, more nutella, and whipped cream on the side. WHOO. Sweet overload. It was good, but so not worth the $16. I'll still give it four stars for the taste, appearance, and fast/friendly service. The decor was also beautiful; they had chocolate trickling down from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Delicious Crepes & Chocolate here with a beautiful view of Bellagio Garden next door. Good place to go see & eat desert."}
{"text":"The location is small but, as mentioned before, very beautiful. We didn't have to wait in line (went at around 8PM on a weeknight).   We ordered a nutella crepe, got the dulce de leche pastry, and grabbed a hot coffee.  It was evident that the dulce de leche pastry was not fresh and the pastry was cold and hard. The nutella crepe was decent, but overly indulgent. The coffee was mediocre.  I recommend going there to look around. Try the gelato! There seemed to be a line for that. Perhaps we chose the wrong thing to order."}
{"text":"This review is based on the nutella brioches alone. I've had some of the other items before but these are really want keep me coming back.  A must whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm addicted to the nutella brioches here! They sell out of the nuttela brioches by 4pm so try to swing by before 2pm. They also open early at 6am so I sometimes just stop by after clubbing all night at Marquee and just get them fresh out of the oven and do my walk of shame back to my hotel room. Hey, at least that walk is slightly less shameful when you have the scent of fresh patries wafting around you."}
{"text":"Recently came back to JPP on my last trip to Vegas and they still have the BEST almond croissant!  Flaky, buttery top and delicious almond paste in the middle!    So GOOD!"}
{"text":"OMG... I LOOOOOOOVE this place! It's a delight for the eyes as their pastries and chocolates look more like art than food!!!! But above all everything tastes AMAZIIIIIIIINNNNNG!!!! Anyone with a sweet tooth or a taste with yummy beautiful things should check them out either in this location or at Aria. The chocolate fountain at the Bellagio is also pretty amazing to see! Aside from the pastries, crepes, and ice cream, I love their sandwiches, quiches... especially the chicken aioli sandwich!!!! It is quite expensive but it is Vegas and you don't go there everyday but it is really yummy!!! It is as close you can get in Vegas to feel like you're in a good Parisian \"boulangerie - patisserie\" :))))"}
{"text":"I came here for a breakfast sandwich so I ordered a hot ham and cheese...... It was an O M G moment when I had my first bite. It was absolutely delicious and it was so comforting. Every bite just warmed my soul. I've tried a couple of their desserts. They look amazing and they taste great. This is a repeat place! =)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the pastries were amazing - My mouth is always happy when I go here...His chocolate creations are orgasmic... If your looking for something sweet and don't mind spending a few dollars this is the perfect treat"}
{"text":"Long lines, a so so coffee, ok sandwiches and a very very high bill. The place looks like million $$$ (actually it looks way more than that) but the food is not as good as it looks. I miss Stumptown coffee"}
{"text":"On our first night in Vegas, the crew and I came here for dessert, we had to travel great distance to reach this location.  The location was clean, well kept, with great amount of goods to buy, from sweets, gelato to crepes and other pastries.  They also have a very cool chocolate fountain looks absolutely amazing and elegant, definitely of superior quality, unlike any fountain I've seen.  The service was fast and friendly.  Overall an excellent experience, so if you into sweets this is definitely the place to visit."}
{"text":"I am impressed but not impressed by this Patisserie.  I am glad there is a quick breakfast place in the Aria.  Sometimes you are just not in the mood for a huge meal.  My friend and I had the apple muffin and the croissant.  The apple muffin was moist and had chunks of apple in it, but it just didn't knock my socks off, the croissant was a bit of a mess to eat.  A thick honey glaze made up the top of the pastry and almost made it too sweet to eat.  The lattes are pretty good here, but a little on the expensive side.  For two people, expect to spend right around $25 to $40 depending on what you are getting."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain will delight young & old alike!   The cakes/pastries/gellato here is  what my family likes to call a \"special treat\". Normally we dont like to spend that much(okay, so not that much - $4-$6 each) on a cake that can fit in the palm of our hand  but these ones are just...so worth it.   lick your plate worth it!!!  (I suggest ANYTHING with chocolate!)"}
{"text":"Huge chocolate fountain! How do I know?  It has a plaque stating it is the biggest.  Comes from the ceiling and flowing behind glass, a huge stream of chocolate goodness.  If that does not inspire you, maybe the carefully crafted cakes in rotating display cases.  The cupcakes and deserts are a huge draw, plenty of tourist gather here to oo and aww over the deserts.  Cameras flashing, the deserts are picture perfect.  I could not find myself to buy one, since they are almost art. I did buy the Gelato however and it was excellent.  Yes I had to have a waffle cone also to truly enjoy the experience.  It was a great ending after some spicy Thai food, really cooled my belly.  If you need some soothing Gelato or just looking for great deserts check this place out."}
{"text":"i come to aria just to have the cheesecake here. one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"OMG, I loved this place and their mouth-watering \"chocolate fountain.\" So cool! I decided that I had to get one of their fancy desserts and it was not only beautiful and tasted amazing, it was well worth the pretty penny that I paid for it! Hands down a must see and do while in Vegas, if you have a sweet tooth or are trying to impress a lady. I'm just saying :)"}
{"text":"This is usually my first bakery stop when I visit the city and I prefer this Aria location over Bellagio.  I got giant macaron with rose petal, chocolates and coffee on my memorable first visit.  Everything was perfect!  On my recent visit I got trio cheesecake chocolate and imperial cake.  The imperial cake with hazelnut is so light, beautiful and yummy.  The cheesecake is just okay compared to the chocolate cake~but still good compared to the other bakeries.  It's hard deciding what to get since everything is so beautiful.  There is always a line but it usually moves pretty quick.  I never leave this place without a smile on my face even though I lose all my pennies @ the casino.  5 stars!!  My favorite dessert place in Vegas.  Jean Phillipe Patisserie is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Someone went to Vegas and brought me goodies.  I have to go to this patisserie the next time I go to Sin City.    Treats I got: -Coconut truffle and pistachio truffle: They melt in your mouth.  5 stars. -Rose Macaron: The best macaron I've had in my life.  Its HUGE and had real rose petal covered with sugar on top.  Very creamy and yummy.  5 stars. -White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookie: 4 stars.  Whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  I would go to Vegas just to go here.    5 stars treats!! Jean Phillipe Patisserie is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Be warned - these crepes are not handheld crepes.  They are so large, they are in a full takeaway container! I had expected to be able to carry my crepe from the Bellagio to the Cosmopolitan.  Whoops!  I got the Italian crepe - which had proscuitto, mozzarella cheese, and pesto.  It was good - hell, I was starving, so anything would have been good - but there wasn't too much to it.  Since the crepe was so large, I got sick of the taste after a while.  The BF got the Exotic Sweet Crepe, which had mango and pineapple pieces in a sauce on top of the crepe.  The crepe was finished off with coconut ice cream.  It was delicious and definitely much better than the \"savory\" crepe.  This is definitely the place for a quick coffee and breakfast if you don't want to head to Starbucks, which I do in addition to my patisserie stop!  They also have gelato too and the famous chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"Very nice place that sells some awesome pastries!!!  We had the Nutella and Dulce de leche crepes.  They were amazing!!!!  The creme brûlée was great, but not as good as I expected.  Still, this place was 5 stars.  The one downside is that it is so popular that I get pretty busy. It is in the busy part of the Bellagio. It is right next to the garden center."}
{"text":"Some amazing crepes here!!!  We loved the dulce de leche and Nutella toppings.  The service was friendly and approachable.  Only downside is that there is limited seating available.  However, you can always find seating in the vicinity, in other restaurants."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely stunning!  However, ordered the FLAN, and it had so so so much rich cream in it (should NOT have been so rich) that it gave me a huge stomach ache.  Same for chocolate eclair, it was SO SO rich, would have preferred a less rich custard than a creamy mouse-like filling.  Just too heavy.  Also wish they had DARK chocolate Santa's, not just milk.  Obviously a huge draw, the displays and foods are absolutely gorgeous, just not digestible for the average person."}
{"text":"AH-MAZING gelato. Plentiful flavors and you can taste before you buy. Fantastic presentation of dishes. I've onIly ever had various gelato flavors but I have never been disappointed.  This location is inside the Aria and there is seating. I love the displays around the Patisserie, I did take a picture of all of them.  In addition to the desserts, they also offer sandwiches and salads. I feel this is the best place to get gelato in Vegas!! Hope to be back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"I will never be in this place again  Service was inexistant  I waited more than 45 for my order  Manager was not friendly  NEVER AGAIN  I think they are lucky to be on the strip"}
{"text":"I feel like taking a plunge into the pool full of chocolate after looking at the chocolate waterfall at the entrance of this bakery shop, it is one of a kind.  Yeah this place probably figures in the top ten most touristy places. I went here with my friends in the morning to grab some quick breakfast. It was bustling with people and activity during the early hours too. I tried one of the crepes and my friend tried the croissant. Both were ok nothing very extraordinary. But I recommend to visit this place atleast for the chocolate watrefall."}
{"text":"Yeah, this is as good as it gets unless you are in Europe! We were here for a Yelp Event and was so lucky to be walking by when we saw their unbelievable desserts. We had no intentions of eating, we just finished huge burgers at Holsteins in the Cosmo, but we couldn't resist. I ordered the Cinnamon Bun and my girlfriend got the chocolate croissant.   Wow. We tried a little of each others and before we even bit into it your mouth will water. I am a huge fan of cinnamon buns and this was by far the best I have ever had. The cinnamon was plentiful and the frosting was obviously a cream cheese frosting. The dough was very light and airy, like a croissant and melted in your mouth.   The Jean Philippe Patisserie will be a must every trip to Vegas!! Mouth is starting to water again just thinking about it. Wonder if they deliver"}
{"text":"Since we stayed in Aria, I thought I would give this place a try.  The morning before we were going to leave, we stopped to get couple crepes.  To order, we had to go to the cashier and tell them what we wanted to order and pay up front first.  Each crepes is about $9.  We got the Apple Sensation and Berry crepes.  The apple sensation was ok , but the berry crepe was delicious."}
{"text":"It's such a cute desserts shop!   Caramel Twist (5/5) - I got it iced and less sweet...oh it was delicious! French Macaroons (3/5) - It was a disappointment Ice cream (5/5) - They have so many flavors and the scoop they give you is pretty big."}
{"text":"I've been eager to see the infamous chocolate fountain and it was awesome. I want one for my birthday!   Since it's a tourist spot, of course it was the line was ridiculous, need I mention the pricing? Overall, the chocolates they produced was just okay. Definitely did not blow me away and definitely HYPED up.  Been there. Done that. Onto the next chocolate hype. Worth it or hyped up... we shall see!"}
{"text":"Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing.  My fave is the fruit tart."}
{"text":"Remember on The Simpsons when Homer hallucinated \"The Land of Chocolate\"?  It's a bit like that when you see the giant choco-fountain.   Mmmmm...   You seriously can't go wrong ordering here.  Nothing is bad!  All is good!  Maybe not calorically, but it's Vegas and a chocolate shop! SURPRISE!   A strawberry gelato in white chocolate cone?  Deliciousville.  Your head may explode into confetti and sparkles."}
{"text":"This location is so much easier than the Bellagio location, when you get dropped off @ the Aria taxi stand, write inside that foyer to the right is Jean's counter.  There's so much you can get there & you'll never be dissapointed.  There's a ton of stuff that is prepackaged but I love picking a few chocolates and a cake, super easy & always fantastic."}
{"text":"This is where I have trouble rating an establishment because of that delicate balance between quality and value.  Desserts themselves were overall 4 star quality but the prices are definitely touristy.  I tried two scoops of gelato in a cup -- coconut and pistachio -- for something like $8.  The pistachio was to die for.  I mean they got the flavor right on and it even has chunks of real pistachio nuts infused in the ice cream.  I love that.  The coconut was okay but probably a little too sweet for me which means it's way too sweet for the average Joe.  My friends each bought an individual-sized dessert for $7 each.  Add on tax and it's over $8.    Are the desserts beautifully crafted and delectable to eat?  Of course they are.  Is it worth $8 a pop?  Practically, no.  Unless you're on vacation and spending mode, which we were.  But you can also have all-you-can eat at the Wicked Spoon for $35(?) and eat just 5 equally impressive dessert services and make your money back.  Or maybe I've just been jaded by my gluttony at the buffets... someone please help me."}
{"text":"The shop design is atrocious. The wait is questionably worth. Try somewhere else where you're not waiting in line for so ling"}
{"text":"Must try the macarons. Super cute store. They were getting set up for Halloween. And the lines moved pretty quickly. They were pretty busy at 7am already."}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind is: OMFG.  I have never, ever had a dessert this amazing.  First they make me drool with the chocolate fountain, and then they please me with the yummiest effing thing that has ever been in my mouth (no jokes, please).  It cost about $11, but the dessert was humungous.  I ordered a souffle: a crepe with vanilla creme inside, chocolate and powdered sugar poured on top, tiny chunks of brownies on top of that, and vanilla gelato on the side.  Whatever you pay and whatever you order, I can guarantee you it will be more than worth it.  I will have fantastic dreams about this place for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Yummm we saw this place just walking around waiting for O back in Feb 2012 and when we came back Aug 2012 we made it a point to try to find it again and try it.   It was pretty good.  Wish I could've gotten more than just a crepe to share with my bf but next time I will take some lil treats back home for my family."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts! Beautiful and delicious. So many options -- it took me a while to decide what I wanted. Thankfully, there was no line when we stopped by in the mid-afternoon. Most of the cakes and desserts are in the $7 - $9 range, which seems reasonable to me considering the quality and presentation.   I treated myself to the Sweet Trio, one of the larger desserts, as I assumed that my husband would want to share it with me. (Turns out he didn't want any dessert, so it was all mine!) The Sweet Trio comes with vanilla crème brûlée, a raspberry macaron, and a caramel peanut cakepop. It's served up on a little tray that's made of chocolate. Everything was delicious and perfect with a glass of sparkling wine.   Jean Philippe Patisserie is a must try when you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed berry crepe here the other day while I was at the Bellagio. Disappointing, I thought, as it tasted like an ordinary plain crepe with pre-mixed fruit. And I paid ~$10 for this! La Creperie over at Paris is a much better place for crepes."}
{"text":"Best Tiramisu ever, both the frozen and the cake versions.  2 trips to Vegas, two wonderful tastes at Jean Philippe.....if I lived in Vegas I'd be broke and fat.....but happier for sure.  :-)    Next time the Nutella Napoleon has my name all over it."}
{"text":"Chocolates ordered include Canelle, Rustic, Crunchy, Earl Grey, Gringo, Tahiti, Piemont, Caramel  ...suffice it to say that neither time nor a second location has diminished the quality of Jean Phillippe Patisserie, a second visit to the larger Aria location proving every bit as good as the first as I shared eight varieties of chocolate presented in a jewel-box display with a friend.  From the bright aromatics of the cinnamon Canelle to the simple pairing of chocolate and salted caramel each of the two-bite squares was beautifully crafted with subtle nuances and with well sourced pure-bean chocolates both dark and milk providing the backbone every flavor and texture proved remarkable; the coffee spiked Gringo and rum soaked Tahiti my personal favorites, and all the better enjoyed at the restaurant's counter overlooking the casino floor and the scene that is Sin City on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast! The salmon dish, the Lorraine quiche and the croquet Monsieur are the best!!! The cashiers are a tad rude though."}
{"text":"Secondly best crepes I've ever had. I prefer the ones from sugar factory down the street by the Paris Hotel. Pastries are good too I got the Dulce de Leche muffin."}
{"text":"400th Review!!!!   Love me some almond croissants!!!  This place has Yummy pastries!!  Located inside Aria hotel, very cool looking bakery / cafe.  My group and I shared almond croissants, raspberry donut, blueberry danish.  It all tasted amazing almost like Paris.  It was unanimous we agreed the almond croissant was the best out of all three pastry.  Just the way I like it, flaky on the outside but soft buttery goodness on the inside.  The latte was good.  If I didn't have my mind made up before coming here I would have ended up with a lot more than I had planned.  Everything looked delish!!  The line was long but worth the wait, but it's dangerous while in line you might be tempted to buy more than planned, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Convenient location in Bellagio for a quick to-go breakfast.  The pain au chocolat and cheese danish were both nice, but the prices were sky high as expected.  At least it's home to the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain...."}
{"text":"Wow, fantastic set-up!! I didn't mind waiting in the long wrap-around line because I got extra time to check out the exquisite pastries, chocolates, and the chocolate fountain!!  I didn't have the stomach space to try everything, but the croissant was so flaky and buttery and the quiche was perfect.  The staff was also very pleasant, considering how many hungry customers were waiting anxiously to enjoy the treats."}
{"text":"What a stunning bakery! Selection is beautiful, sandwiches, pastries, chocolate, gelato and a crepe maker, just narrowing down the options is already a task. I went with an eclaire as that is one of my favorite French desserts and so hard to get right, I figured if someone in the US, then Jean Phillippe, plus the line for the gelato wrapped around the store. I do appreciate that they have different lines depending on what you are getting and the service is nice. and my eclaire was pretty much spot on to how they taste in France. Very good creme filling, the batter the correct taste and texture, a bit pricey at $7, but very good. The hours are fantastic, I would recommend coming early or late to avoid the crowds as it gets very very full here."}
{"text":"I kept passing by this darling patisserie en route to and from my hotel room while staying at the Bellagio. There was always a line, which was discouraging, but it kept me away from the high caloric crepes, and luscious looking desserts. Anyhow, I was in Vegas to run a half marathon, so the last thing in the world I need is to consume these fattening pastries.   That is what I kept telling myself all weekend.   And so the last day of our trip rolled around, and I agreed to meet a few friends for breakfast before our massage appointment. Trying to be healthy, I ordered the berry protein shake, which was very delicious, but not as good as the Nutella crepe merely looked. I held off from ordering one, and only indulged in one bite of my friends.   Here I sit at home.... thinking.... dreaming.... CRAVING.....that delicious hazelnut and chocolate Nutella crepe.   Trust me. Do not refrain. You'll regret it. I am."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much from here but every time I'm in town I have to stop here for the Almond butter croissant! It's so flakey and moist all at the same time! Soo good!"}
{"text":"I think the bakery here is just a hype. This place is located in Aria and a plus side is it opens from 6am-2am, super fit for the vegas scene. Like all vegas places, this place has a long line. Really hate when you have to wait for 20 min to get a pastry...   Taste wise, I tried the brioche, the muffin. I should say they taste good, but there are many pastries in LA that taste same good, or better, but no need for such a long a line and pay such a high price. It's so vegas. I feel like if I were not staying in Aria, I would not come just to get a bite. But it is convenient if you live in the hotel."}
{"text":"I love chocolates. This place has variety of pastries, dessert and chocolates. It's awesome and everything looks pretty. Too pretty to eat.   By the way Seth from Jean Philippe, yes I am fully aware that they are meant to be enjoyed and to be eaten....duh.....thanks for your smart a$$ comment."}
{"text":"For someone that isn't huge on dessert, I went totally berserk in here. I was already impressed by the Aria, and once I rounded the corner and JPP was in sight.. I was in heaven.   The entire section is a feast for the eyes. I could pretty much stand there all day and watch the folks making those beautiful crepes. We tried the chocolate crepes, but everything else on the menu looked great also. My friend, who took us there, couldn't stop raving about the coconut macaroons. And anything on display with Nutella on it got a thumbs up from the rest of us.   Sure, its pricey, but what the heck."}
{"text":"on yelp Ben F. found this marvelous place of chocolate fallin from the ceiling and i made it a MUST to stop by bellagio to check it out! as our last stop before we had to head home we came here. if you selfpark you walk in make a LEFT and it will be on your right side if you valet you walk straight pass the check in make a left and then a right down all the way and it will be on ur right....  just follow the smell of sweet chocolate and the sight of gelato, crepes, frozen/hot drinks, lil desserts and seriously a CHOCOLATE WATERFALL!  i admit i was a little dissappointed to see how small the place was but still very happy  carolyn c: hannah!! look at the chocolate hannah s: oh yeah okay... .....30seconds pass.... hannah s: OMG OMG OMG CAROLYN!!!!!! CHOCOLATE!! CHOCOLATE!! LOOOOOOK!!!!! take MY PICTURE!!!!!!   hahahha seriously a dessert lovers fantasy! we were all too full for much...altho i was eyeing the crepes we all stuck with the gelato. we had berry, strawberry, and i got dulce de leche...mymymy they were superb! great texture, perfectly sweet, Ben even got huge chunks of strawberries in his cup and these arent even those dinky cups u get at other gelato places these were BIG. 3 gelatos + 1 napolean for a lil over $20 is gooood with me!  so worth the stop & the ridiculous traffic we ended up being stuck in!!"}
{"text":"Plastic coffee stir? Really? How about bamboo for a greener alternative.  Shame on you. I will give you your 5 star back next time I m here & find greener utensils."}
{"text":"First off, the guy who works here with the mustache is a douche.  [1] Your sign telling us where to go to buy pastries is facing the register. To read it, we'd already be standing in the right place.  [2] Don't interrupt me when I'm telling you what I want to buy. Maybe then, you'd actually get it right.  [3] Don't presume that I want my dessert for here, just to give me the stink eye when I ask you to box it up, smashing my macarons in the process.  At any rate, the macaron with rose infused cream is delicious. It gets soggy at the bottom, though. So you probably want to chill it at your room if you can.  My girlfriend got the raspberry cake with pistachio cream and she enjoyed that as well.  I also got a pack of four macarons which cost $8. They were delicious, however, and my girlfriend who normally doesn't like macarons enjoyed them as well.  Overall, good pastries, great looking wedding cakes on display, but generally unpleasant staff.  ====  Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again"}
{"text":"Talk about being in heaven. Anything you choose here is good..from crepe, gourment sandwiche, pastry, chocolate, and even gelato. I tried the Almond brioche, basil sandwich and prosciutto sandwich..utterly delish. Can't wait to go back and try more items!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place looking for desert before 'O'. The orange caramel ice cream was just insanely good. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great find that my Fiance and I stumbled on to when we were exploring the Bellagio after checking in.    We ordered a berry crepe and tiramisu.  Ordinarily I would not get Tiramisu, I hate it, it's on the bottom of the barrel of my dessert list, but my Fiance loves the stuff and their tiramisu actually looked fantastic ... and it was!!  Easily the best tiramisu that I have ever had .. which ultimately will make me hate any other tiramisu desserts not from here even more... oh well.  The crepe was okay .. nothing special."}
{"text":"We got gelato after dinner at the Wolfgang Puck Italian restaurant.  The gelato was decent, but the whole place is kind of confusing.  After we got our dessert we were directed to pay at 3 different registers before they herded us back to the original register we tried to pay at.  It was also a little pricey for gelato, but it is Vegas so that's not really a big shocker.  I got the cookies n cream gelato and it was pretty average - nice to have on a hot (108*) Vegas night!"}
{"text":"Huge chocolate sculptures greet and entice you as the voices inside your head say, \"go ahead, it's ok.  Diet tomorrow\".  The displays are enchanting...attracting tourists (and locals as well) for a photo op.  Once you get past the crowd and actually make it to the counter, you see the many beautiful yummylicious options you have: gelato, pastries, cookies, sandwiches, etc.  You find yourself in a huge dilemma: what should you get?  I've been to this place many times but I still go through this process over and over.  So, I always end up getting the same thing: 2 scoops of gelato and a crepe then I get some macarons to go.  I start daydreaming about those beautiful cherry blossom cakes as I'm eating my crepe, \"what would be a good occasion for me to have that cake? Hmmmm...\"  You know that feeling when there's a really cute person in front of you and all you could say is \"hi!\" and you're too pre-occupied daydreaming?  Yup, the food here has that effect on me.  One of these days, I'll muster up the courage to ask for a Nutella napoleon.  Be bold!"}
{"text":"Between the two Jean Philippe locations in Vegas, this one in Aria is my favorite.  Sure, Bellagio has the chocolate fountain but there's something about this particular location that I like more.  The layout?  The pretty cakes displayed all over?  It just seems that the food and desserts here are better and I enjoy coming here more often.  Right outside JP, is a window display of chocolate sculptures they change every so often.  One time it was huge flowers made of chocolate then it was sakura and a dragon (that was my favorite display so far).  They have sandwiches, salads, gelato, macarons, brittles, chocolates, marshmallows, cookies, pastries and yummy and pretty desserts!  You can order special/custom cakes.  They have a display of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" which is quite scary actually and I doubt I'd want one.  I've gotten macarons from JP.  They come pre-packed in a box with a plastic \"holder\" so you can actually transport/ship them without crushing the delicate macarons.  They come 8 in a box for about $2 each.  They're ok.  Last night we had a Triple Chocolate, Imperial and another chocolate cake.  The labels were a bit off so we couldn' tell which one was which but we're sure about the Triple Chocolate and the Imperial which were amazing.  The Triple Chocolate has a green macaron on top - it's half shiny with chocolate and half matte with cocoa powder and inside is a chocolate mousse and I believe a white chocolate/vanilla mousse.  Then the Imperial...a chocolate sponge cake with hazelnut, vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse...mmmmm... My sister got the chocolate cake with a pink macaron shell on top - it was so not exciting that nobdoy remembers what it's called."}
{"text":"This is a cute crepe place located in the belagio hotel. It's quite hidden because it's to the left of the belagio garden with the giant flower shaped animals. I got the egg/ham/cheese/spinach (in other words a salty crepe) for breakfast. I came with a small salad on top. It was quite good and light! It was about 10 bucks for the crepe. They also have a unique chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"We went in to get chocolate and ice cream, but the guy behind the ice cream counter was rude and seemed unconvinced when we asked which ice cream was allergy friendly. We walked out!"}
{"text":"Impressive food as art at Aria. Sculpted chocolate a draw but also Inviting well prepared to go food. Excellent sandwiches, perfect cupcakes and muffins. A welcome addition to Vegas food."}
{"text":"The desserts was good but the service was bad, all the servers there were very grumpy and seems like they do not want to be there.  Everybody knows that good service will make the food taste better.  Seriously I think people who work in the boba tea station will have better smile & service!"}
{"text":"Really cool pitstop at bellagio. Beautiful decor and rich chocolate flowing through the fountain. Was just too busy and jam packed to really enjoy it all."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and desert. Friendly staff and good coffee. I would highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Willy Wonka left England and moved to Vegas!   The triple chocolate fountain miracle extravaganza is every bit as amazing as wherever you heard about it said it was. OMG, I want to go Augustus Gloop on this thing, which will probably result in much shattered glass pieces poking out of my skin as it's not exactly a river. No, scratch that. I want to shower in all that liquid chocolate!  So after you're done gawking at the fountains like a hillbilly in front of his first TV, you turn around and confront the United Nations of Pastries. Every color, flavor and texture is represented. Might I suggest the vanilla eclair? I could make a foodgasm joke about how it's long and delicious white cream comes out of it, but that would take time away from you getting to this place and ordering one."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the other location in Aria. The wait here is dreadful and long. The lines don't move fast enough especially when the line wraps around the beautiful displays of pastries. Such a tease! This shop is cuter in style than the one in Aria because it has the famous chocolate fountain, but it's smaller and more cramped.  The first time I saw this little pastry shop it was love at first sight. Everything looked so darn cute, but there was always a line. The boyfriend and I decided to ride the line and after 20 mins we were able to make an order.  EXOTIC CREPE- pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and coconut sorbet I was really surprised by the way the crepe came out at first because I was so used to the ones in Houston where the crepes are filled with all the fruits, but this crepe had all the fruits on top of the crepe instead of inside it. The crepe was a nice soft texture and the fruits provided a nice tart flavor. I liked the sweet creamy coconut sorbet most.   CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES The strawberries weren't sweet, but sour and the chocolate was really sweet. The white chocolate was too sweet for my liking and the dark chocolate would've tasted better with the strawberry if the strawberry wasn't too sour.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll head over to Aria instead of waiting in the long lines here, but it doesn't hurt to look at all the pretty displays they have on the way out."}
{"text":"Eating at the one in Bellagio wasn't enough. I had to come here and eat some more! It looked so cute here as well. It felt more spacious here than at the Bellagio. They had the same pastries for the same prices, but there was no line.   TIRAMISU- coffee kahlua biscuit, mascarpone mousse, and chocolate pearls This was one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. I really like the taste of the coffee kahlua. It added a nice liqueur flavor. The mascarpone mousse was smooth and light. I especially found the chocolate pearls so delightful because they added a nice crunch in contrast to the smoothness of the mousse.   I definitely recommend coming here if you want the same pastries for no wait. It's literally in the casino area of Aria; so you could either people watch or partake in the gambling as well."}
{"text":"this place is amazing, it's pricey but worth every $. I got the brulee w/mixed berries and a Stracciatella gelato. Hands down best gelato i've ever had"}
{"text":"Yes, the prices may be on the high side for coffee and, yes, the lines in the morning are horrendous but this place is worth the hassle and the money every now and then.  The pastries always have me mesmerized - I can stand there and look at them for hours debating which one/s I'll leave with, and trying to convince myself that no, I can't have them all.  I've never tried something I didn't like here.  And, no matter what I wind up with, or what I had in mind when I stepped in line, I always wind up leaving with a chocolate croissant too.  Do yourself a favor and just try it.  It's a soft and flaky pastry sent straight from heaven.    Of course if you're one of those people who MUST eat breakfast or your blood sugar will drop and you'll get cranky and wish you went elsewhere while waiting on the line... then do just that.  It's not one of those deceivingly long but quick-moving deals.  It WILL drag on and on."}
{"text":"I just saw someone's review about the savory crepe with chicken, mushroom, cheese & bacon, lol, which was described as tasting like mushroom soup. I ordered the same thing and I guess it kind of did now that I think about it. I liked it though, tasted pretty good to me and hit the spot for me but I can't understand where that person was coming from. The crepe was about $12 and for that amount, yeah, I want it to be less \"soupy\" and it would have been nice to see the cook stuff the crepe in front of me instead of crouching down into a \"fridge\" to wrap it up.  Fruit cup was average and the sandwiches were good, just way overpriced for a walk up joint. For the same amount we spent for this place, we could have gone to a French restaurant-but its good if you are just trying to order and go. The line is a bit long but staring and looking at the pastries and chocolate fountain can help distract the time.  I personally wouldn't make this a destination but might consider it again if I were in the area.  They have a general seating area that is on a first come first serve basis next to the counter."}
{"text":"The best french pastries I've ever had. I went here twice for breakfast during my stay at the Aria since everything looked so good. It does get very crowded in the morning's, but it's worth the wait. I tried the ham and cheese croissant, which was amazing. The bechemel sauce makes this dish. I also had the pain au chocolat, which was really rich and filling. On the last day, I had to try one of the cakes, so we tried the nutella napolean. It might be one of the best things I've ever tried. The filling was creamy and the crust perfectly flaky and chocolatey. I would go back and have this again if I could. It was very filling, so even though I had maybe two-third's, I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Elegant French pastries and desserts that are a delight to the eye and the taste buds. The triple chocolate mousse combines layers of dark, white and milk chocolate on top of a delicate shortbread cookie and covered with a decadent ganache and topped with a macaron. The description may sound like it's too much, but each component perfectly combines with the others into a symphony of chocolate pleasure!  Even the simplest things like brioche or croissant are done extremely well. Break apart the brioche to find a caramel surprise that oozes over the flaky goodness.   Live a little and indulge in a little sweetness."}
{"text":"Typical gelato flavors. I think what stands out is definitely the texture. It's extremely creamy and rich. Bf got the creme brulee and it was delicious! It even has bits of the hard caramel in it. I got the lemon sherbet and it had a good balance of tart and sweetness!"}
{"text":"Like most other french pastry shops, you want to get Everything on Display!!! I came here 3 times in my two night stay at Aria.  CROISSANTS are amazing!!!  ALMOND - 10/10 prob my favorite almond croissant ever!!!  BUTTER - 8.5/10 needed to be a bit more crisp but i'm glad its not super buttery   HAM AND CHEESE - 7.5/10 they do heat this up as a breakfast sandwich... good amount of cheese...but i've had better  Napoleon - rich and creamy!!!  Latte with Coconut syrup - was too sweet so i asked them to add a bit more coffee to it  NEED to slowly try everything else!!"}
{"text":"The lines are a bit confusing. There's one that starts by the pastries. Another that starts by the large chocolate fountain. And a third line that starts in front of the crepe making. I think things would move much faster if there was only one line.  Expect a 30 minute wait to order and another 10 minutes to get a crepe.   Otherwise, everything tastes authentic here (I studied at the Sorbonne). A true Parisienne patisserie serving delicious crepes, croissants, and macarons. Yes, it's a bit expensive, but cheaper than traveling to Paris."}
{"text":"chocolate fountain is gigantic! we only went there to take pictures of chocolate fountain and crazy cakes they had! everything was way too expensive to taste! but it's a good place to stop by to look around and make your eyes happy! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome pastries!!! And absolutely horrifying prices. I paid $8 for a very small piece of cake and then had to come up with a strategic plan on how to extend the wonderful experience as long as possible! When I was finally done, I wanted another one, but couldn't really afford it. I wonder what they do with their unsold pastries at the end of the day? If they are throwing all that away, I volunteer my mouth to be their dumpster!  Highly recommended if you are filthy rich."}
{"text":"I am not a big dessert guy, but this place was fantastic!  I stopped here several times for coffee to start my day, a couple of times for Ice Cream, once for a Banana's Foster Crepe and once for a Key Lime Tart.  Everything was wonderful!   The lines were a little annoying, but I guess that is just a sign of a popular place.  They are wheelchair accessible in a very cool way. The ramp to access the dining area is integrated into the design so it isn't even noticeable!"}
{"text":"I wasn't allowed to eat any sweets...especially the weekend that we came here but you know what? EFF THAT! I'ma indulge! Especially if it's a bakery that's open LATE! Whoo hoo! Thumbs up baby!!  This is one fancy pantsy bakery located in the beautiful Aria. I hear the original one with the chocolate fountain gets way more packed, thank god I didn't go to that one...I'm not a fan of WAITING, especially for sweet, decadent treats!  I ordered myself the Nutella filled Brioche Bread and split that in 1/2 with IFBB Pro Frankly Shredded. He split his delicious Almond Bear Claw in 1/2 with me too. So we shared. :) Oh! The SBBF had a sugar free blueberry muffin and he only ate 1/2 of that and gave the other 1/2 to Franky & I. Yes, we're fitness fanatics with the sweetest TEEF eva!  My fave outta all 3 was the Almond Bear Claw fo sheezy. I liked the Nutella Brioche Bread but...there was just something about that bear claw...making me wanna claw my way back to Vegas and order a dozen of those!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 3 times. We always come here when in vegas.  Their dessert is awesome, we get the nutella crepe. Even savory crepes are good.  This is an informal place, so you have to find ur own table/chairs. The only negative is, it's always crowded so sometimes it can take up to 45 minutes here."}
{"text":"OMG THEIR DESSERTS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!!!!! I got sugar happy when I saw the chocolate coming down from the ceiling!!! Wow!!! Even more excited when I saw all their delicious desserts.  I tried the tiramisu shot cup, it was soooooo good!!! I wish it was a bigger cup for $7.00. Def. going back next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Totally unadulterated indulgence.  Beautiful pastries, chocolates and that world record chocolate fountain! A must visit for any sweet tooth.  I had the best Ham and Cheese Croissant here!   If you love Nutella, the Nutella Brioche could be your thing, thought it was a bit much for me.  Just the smell of the store, butter and chocolate is enough to get you mesmerized.  For photos and full reviews please visit my blog."}
{"text":"After our breakfast at their Bellagio location, we stopped for afternoon tea here.  I had the Trio, which was a good way to sample a couple desserts. But the real winner was the Strawberry Tart. Flaky, light, buttery and had a champagne like gelee.  Delicate and not too sweet. Loved it! The bite took me all the way back to Paris.  The chocolate dragon outside is quite a sight too. Everything is grand in Vegas, and this was no exception.  For photos and full reviews please visit my blog."}
{"text":"Rose Macarons with raspberries and rose custards has made it onto my list of favorite deserts. With the rose cookie melting on your tongue combined with the custard and its essence of rose... The chocolate nutella cake was also very delish. The macaron was $6? But get there early bcs we tried to go back around 8 and there was barely anything left! :("}
{"text":"Just the best chocolates in Vegas.  There's a reason why they leave the Jean Philippe chocolates in the SkySuites at Aria- it's heavenly.  It's sooo good.  It takes you back to the chocolatiers in the St Germain neighborhoods in Paris."}
{"text":"Everything in this place is beautiful. I didn't want to eat the pastries, I wanted to keep them. Everything was delicious, I just wish I could have tried one of everything."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Jean Philippe located in Aria.   I love sweets so I had a blast looking at each of the displays here. They had a giant dragon made entirely from chocolate! AMAZING! The level of talent is very good. They have almost everything here: gelato, pastries, breads, etc. Mini 3-tiered cakes were so pretty (not sure if they are worth $70-80 each for 3 bites).   We tried a ham & cheese croissant which was good, and a giant palmier that was delicious and probably one of the best that I've had."}
{"text":"Just go. I stayed at the Bellagio this weekend for work and stopped at this bakery each morning for a coffee and butter croissant. Each day I found fairly lengthy lines, but don't be deterred -- it moves very fast.   If you're a lover of croissants that you hope taste like the ones in France, you won't be disappointed. Flaky, fluffy, fresh goodness. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite part of the Bellagio, hands down.   After a friend and my mother had recommended this place, I decided to swing by since both generally have good taste in food. OMG. AMAZING!  First off, this place is awesome to look at - they have a chocolate fountain that runs along the wall and a counter that wraps around their pastry selections - all options looking decadent and sinful.   This place was so good, I came here twice. The first time for lunch and the second time for breakfast.  For lunch, I had a turkey crepe with spinach, cream sauce, and parmesan. While I didn't realize that this crepe would be creamy, it was so good, I didn't care what it had in it. It came with a great salad with some kind of creamy balsamic dressing on it - all insanely good. My husband ordered the same thing and we were both extremely happy with our choice.  The next time for breakfast, I had Quiche Lorrraine and my husband had a breakfast panini. My quiche was really good - it was unsettling how much grease it appeared to have on it, but when you were eating it, it didn't detract from the taste. Sadly, it made it way better. My husband seemed to like his breakfast sandwich, too.   Out of all food options at the Bellagio, this one has the best value out of them all. Hands down. Come here often and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is a zoo. But then again, the entire Bellagio is at peak hours. Came here for a light dinner and ordered the \"Intense\", a chocolate mousse with half a macaron on top, along with Stracciatella gelato. Tasted nice, but not the price tag. At $7 (pastry) and $3 (gelato), you pay a 25%ish premium. Be sure to check out the fountain though!"}
{"text":"Love the huge chocolate fountain, but this place is always a zoo. So many people! Well, I guess I could say that for the Bellagio in general... Desserts are stunningly beautiful, and their price tags are marked up 20-30% than what I felt would be appropriate. We had the \"Intense\" ($7), which was chocolate mousse with half a macaron on top. It was delish, but very rich. We also had a scoop of gelato ($3), the Stracciatella, which was average. Thought about returning for breakfast, but then decided against it b/c the breakfast items (muffins, croissants) didn't look too special and I couldn't justify paying that kind of premium for it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their croissants!  It's light, flaky, and a little sweet on top.   Pricey at $4 a piece, but even better than Bouchon's!"}
{"text":"Good for lunch, good crepes. Pastries were OK. Chocolate croissants, while very large, had a miniscule amount of chocolate. I did a cross section cut just to prove the point...it was like a pinhead inside a softball, if you can imagine that.  Only other complaint, is their line up/ordering structure. Very confusing. Walk up here, line here, no line here, wait, who's next, where do we order? That needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"We stayed at Aria on a trip to Vegas and this place was mine and my fiance's go to spot. We had lunch here and their salads are excellent. The flavor and freshness was the best I'd ever had at any restaurant or lunch spot. I am not a huge fan of gelato but their gelato is spot on. It was by far the best I'd ever had. I tried the cheesecake and tiramisu gelatos and they both tasted the like the actual desserts. The only thing I did not enjoy was their actual white chocolate covered cheesecake which I felt lacked flavor. However, my palate may have been jaded by all of the other sweets I had that weekend. Their biscotti was also the best I'd ever had. It was chocolate with white chocolate covering it and almonds baked in. I sound like I should have diabetes with all of the stuff we tried but we couldn't help it, it was SO good!"}
{"text":"Wait, I'm totally surprised by the number of reviews here for coffee, lunch, etc. -- people actually order real food here?! Next to the overwhelming selection of visually astounding desserts and pastries, the assortment of outrageously overpriced cold prepared food items including croissant sandwiches, salads, and mixed fruit cups (for a ridiculous $7.50 - WTF) just looks plain sad.  I sampled the dessert trio ($9.90) consisting of scaled down versions of the creme brulee, peanut \"lollipop,\" and raspberry rose macaron -- all served atop a plate made of solid milk chocolate. It displayed a full spread of dessert flavors -- tart and fruity from the macaron, rich and buttery from the lollipop, light and creamy from the creme brulee, and, well, chocolate. Though it was perhaps too saccharinely sweet, the crème brulee was lusciously silky and creamy, while the bland macaron exhibited hardly any discernible rose flavor. The ultra buttery, tender, and completely one-of-a-kind peanut butter \"lollipop\" was my hands down favorite of the bunch, and I'm hardly a peanut fan. I can't even begin to describe the explosion of fluffy, creamy, and rich so unassumingly concealed in a tender chocolate shell, let alone tell you what exactly is inside -- but it was certainly decadent, to say the least!  I also sampled a handful of rather unremarkable chocolate truffles. I would only recommend the fruit jellies, which are an absolute must if you're a fan of fruity chocolate! They may appear dubious, but the blueberry jelly was hands down the BEST piece of chocolate I've ever had. Unlike the bland chocolatey-ness of the other truffles I had, the \"jam\" -- which is closer to an ultra rich syrup in consistency -- packed huge fresh blueberry flavor; thickly layered atop a white chocolate-infused mascarpone cream and wrapped in a thin dark chocolate shell, it was a perfectly proportioned bite of fruity tartness, intense cocoa, and creamy sweetness. I wish I ordered 10 more of these!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best Desserts on earth.  The selection is 2nd to none.  The Chocolates melt in your mouth.  Coffees are typical. The torts and sticky buns are just ok.  If your looking for a chocolate fix. This is the place.  The gelato is fresh and the variety is good."}
{"text":"The chocolate and pastries are the freshest!  Had the chocolate muffins and cheese danishes ( you won't taste anything similar)-special place with chocolate fountains! Yummm! Finally, the breakfast breads are right on point"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe Patisserie is located inside of the Bellagio Hotel. Home to the largest chocolate fountain in the world, Jean Philippe has something to satisfy every sweet tooth. The chocolate fountain is absolutely beautiful and will have you staring at it for a good few minutes. All of the pastries here are beautifully displayed and all of them look delectable.   They create amazing cakes and chocolate sculptures here too. They look so fake, but are definitely real. If you really want to appreciate how beautiful it is, just look at it, but don't look at the price... Everything here is a little pricey, but you are in Vegas, right? Just live a little and enjoy!  I decided to go with the Rose Macaron. I think I chose the most delicious dessert possible! It was a raspberry macaron filled with rose water cream and fresh raspberries. It was beautifully topped off with a sugar coated rose petal. It was almost too beautiful to eat...I said ALMOST. The raspberries were fresh, the rose water cream was rich and silky smooth and the raspberry macaron itself had a perfect texture. I can honestly say that it was one of the best macarons that I've had! Absolutely delicious!  I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are craving something sweet. They have plenty of different pastries, gelato, chocolate, and crepes (savory & sweet)."}
{"text":"It was good, but from the outside looking in, I expected more.  I'm just saying!    The pastries were more like filling or a custard. I wanted something more cake like and fulfilling.  Took a bite and it was lovely, but way to much and not what I was expecting.  Kind of disappointing, but for the price.  I ate it!"}
{"text":"The Crepes were defiantly worth the long line!! The deserts were very good too!! The fresh orange juice was good too! The chocolate fountain was smaller then expected. And you can watch them make the crepes. Was def worth the time and the trip!"}
{"text":"The gelato here is def better than most other places, in fact, probably one of my favorites in California. My taste in gelato is comparing the flavors to that which I've had in Europe, particularly Spain. The coconut, pistachio, and straciatella are my favorite flavors and it's been difficult finding similar types of gelato for those flavors which were matching the tastes in Espana. Here, they've done it just right with the pistachio and coconut--the only thing I didn't like were the coconut shreddings, I always prefer my coco without the shreddings. Seriously, who wants to chew on all those strings? My only other complaint is that although the staff is not mean, they're not very friendly with letting you have samples. Usually most other gelato places I've been to are super friendly when giving samples. Maybe it was just the girl employee...."}
{"text":"Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #23 - #365  If you're looking for that Vegas experience with seductive desserts, than I suggest you go to Jean Philippe Patisserie inside the Aria casino. I was craving for some dessert and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg on the strip for some sweets. So, I went on to MyVegas page and bought a Crepe coupon for 10,000 points and I ended up saving myself $10!   How sweet was that!  Very very tasty and it just melted in my mouth. I ordered the Chocolate Crepe with Raspberry sorbet and added some fresh strawberries.Mmm Goodness, I was in Crepe heaven, it filled me up to the point where I had to skip dinner.   Next time I'm at Jean Philippe, I'll try those savory pastries and some sorbet while I'm at it by using MyVegas points to comp my meal."}
{"text":"Highly recommend somebody one dessert or breakfast this sandwich over there is amazing the chocolate one of the best in Vegas the coffee is good this sandwich tuna with a friend but it is very good"}
{"text":"Great crêpe, we had the Berry one and a couple muffins that were fresh and delicious.  Try the chicken pesto panini, very good!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place you are going to find to have breakfast or COFFEE (other than room service) in the Aria.  So, expect long lines.    Sandwiches and coffee are very good so it's worth the hype there. I think I gained weight just looking at all the tantalizing selections.  I just wish the lines were shorter....I hate waiting....I have the patience of a 4 year old."}
{"text":"They make amazing crepes like no other bakeries in Vegas!! Yum yum! Go for the chicken and spinach crepe (cant remember the exact name,but they have chicken and spinach and cheese in it,hmmmm :P), you will not regret!   Also, they make amazing dessert, cheesecakes,cupcakes,fruitcakes..you name it. They all have excellent taste.   Tip: You'd better be there 10 minutes earlier, otherwise you will have to queue there with the extreme patience."}
{"text":"Super cute little Shop love the fountain wish they would of had prices shown for items in the case the cookies and cream Gelato that my daughter got was yummy."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  I love desserts and this place is great for it.  The pasty is light and fluffy and buttery and just YUUUUUM!!!!  The bf even liked it here and that's hard to get for a dessert place.  I can't say much more aside from the fact that I wanted to try EVERYTHING here...  definitely be back when I visit vegas again."}
{"text":"It's located inside the Bellagio. I found it online  by accident while looking for a Starbucks at the Bellagio. The place is small with limited seating inside but with extra tables and chairs right outside.  The lattes are great and the pastries out of this world. I have made a few trips there already! Yum yum!!! Had a latte, cappuccino , almond croissant, Nutella banana crepe ( they did not skimp on the nutella ). They have different types of hot and cold coffees, drinks, pastries, deserts, sandwiches, crêpes etc... The beautiful chocolate fountain outside is a major hit with all the tourists. Anyone in Vegas should try this place! For those diehard Starbucks fans, I saw a \"coming soon\" sign on the lower level (street exit ) towards the Caesars bridge but you will be saying \" what starbucks?\" after you try this place!"}
{"text":"I second what Kim B. said.  OMG OMG OMG their crepes are TOO BOMB. Definitely worth the $12 you spend on a crepe loaded with fresh strawberries, bananas, nutella, etc.  Amazing cakes, chocolates, and pastries.  As an aspiring pastry chef, I would step on my colleagues to work there someday. Hey, the culinary world is cut throat, I'm just trying to stay in the game =]"}
{"text":"It's still 5 star but this trip I was able to experience my first birthday cake from here.  absolutely a beautiful cake! It tasted as wonderful as it looked.  I also purchased some espresso and it was strong and delicious.  They do have a neat little seating area to enjoy your coffee or snacks where we shared one of their panini sandwiches..they were tasty. Almost everything is pricey but so worth it and I enjoyed all they offered."}
{"text":"My ultimate guilty pleasure whenever I'm in Vegas. Everything your heart can want and desire In the dessert world. They have it all.. Gelato, pastries, cake,crepes, chocolates, the list goes on and on..."}
{"text":"Definitely the best french bakery I've experienced yet! Everything I tried here was very delicious and perfectly made. The macarons were very light and fresh and had very accurate flavor interpretations. There are so many pastries, cakes and tarts to choose from that it will make your head spin! I didn't have the opportunity, nor the stomach capacity to sample everything I wanted to, but I did try the ones that stood out the most to me. Yummay!  I decided to try one of their many lunch options on one of my visits here. They offer about four types of paninis as well as various sandwiches on Croissants. I believe they also have a few salad options to choose from that would satisfy your appetite. For anyone who doesn't want to indulge in the various cakes or pastries, they have a large variety of Gelato flavors to choose from which can also be made into shakes if you'd like. They have various flavors of chocolate Bon Bons as well! The Banana was my favorite flavor And I recommend everyone try at least one.  Overall, I would stop in here everyday that I'm in Vegas again in the future. There were a bunch of other items that I still would love to try. One thing that kinda bothered me but didn't ruin my experience here, was that some of the employees, working the registers n such, are not very friendly and have this miserable demeanor about them, as if they don't really care for dealing with customers. Put a smile on your face and at least look as if you are happy to be there for goodness sake! lol."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place around 9 o'clock in a morning. There was a line, but it was moving really fast. We did not spend more than 10 minutes in it.  I ordered an espresso, nutella brioche and a pastry called Intense. This pastry really lived up to its name!!! It was super sweet. I think it was the sweetest thing i have ever had.  The espresso was very strong.  It was so strong that it went right into my brain and it kept me up all the way back on my drive to LA. Nutella brioche was nothing special. I don't think i would buy it there again.  The next time i am in Vegas i will be back to try their crepes and ice-cream."}
{"text":"I love the chocolate fountain here, and one of these days I am going to splurge and buy a piece of it- I swear! I come here whenever the seasons change and holidays to see what new awesome cakes and chocolate models they have.  Prices are high, but the food is great. We just recently came here and got the Nutella Nepolian and almost died of its awesomeness. It was not overly chocolatey,  and surprisingly very light.  We came here again and had the Trio Sampler this time- AMAZING! It comes with one bright red macaroon with raspberries (so fresh!) one cup of Creme Brulee (with a mini spoon, and smooth creme!) and the best, for me, a pudding/cake/snickers (according to the cashier) pop covered in chocolate and nuts. All three are on a solid brick of creamy milk chocolate, so for 10$ this is a great dessert!"}
{"text":"Best almond chocolate croissants I've ever had so flakey buttery and airy! :) Post work out session at the gym hehe I sauntered on over to Jean P Patisserie which opens @ 6pm daily.  Completely satisfied with being bad and ruining my work out lol.  The Black Forest crepe choose 3 items, I got ham mushroom spinach with sunny side up egg recommended by the guy working there ..delicious and on point!  In addition I got the Nutella crepe yes I have absolutely no regrets :P I've also tried the Apple brioche, Nutella brioche and plain croissant all were good.  I look forward to trying their macaroons, tarts and truffles which I will update my review once I do :D"}
{"text":"Having a gunnies book of world record doesn't help when they can't even prepare a cake in less than 24 hours"}
{"text":"Beautiful and sumptuous crepes. The chocolate crepe as well as the exotic soufflé are excellent options. The chocolate crepe has brownies and ebony dark chocolate sauce. The fluffy soufflé with the added exotic mix (pineapples and passion fruit) has a balanced play of creamy tartness. The sweetness is perfect without being cloying."}
{"text":"I came here so many times! I was either buying gifts or trying food, but mostly gifts and I tried them. There are so many things that you can buy here, but they're all not labeled so you'll catch yourself asking, \"What is this?\" a lot. Here are my reviews on the different products.   1. Gelato (Coconut, pistachio, and mango) - Meh... Too sweet and rich. Half a  scoop is enough for me and I'm a sweets junkie. Also, the pistachio hardly tasted like pistachio. 2 scoops for me and 1 scoop for my friend = $9ish.   2. Carrot cupcake - It was very weird. They baked it in a cup and had some kind of divider on top and topped it with dome-shaped frosting. It was tasty though. (They have complimentary candles if you need them). Be aware that they do not look like cupcakes so you will walk pass them without even knowing.  3. Chocolate mousse - Very rich, but what do you expect? It's mousse!  The cupcake and mousse = $13.   4. Marshmallows - I got it because my bf loves marshmallows and I had to try it because they were $22!!! Anyway, my opinion on it is that it's nothing special. Don't get it.   5. Butterfingers - Yummy, but they don't taste like Butterfingers. The taste is not as distinct.  This was $18 and overpriced."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place and wish I was there right now. I don't think there's a better place for sweets in this entire town and I hope everyone with a sweet tooth tries it out for themselves.  They have a chocolate fountain here too and there's a glass between you and it so you can't stick your mouth into it. I hope they let us one day, lol. I've tried a few things from here like the crepes and gelato. I really want to try the regular food as well because the sandwiches and salads look very good. Expect this place to be busy because it's at the Bellagio and I've never seen a short line here. I can tell you that the line is worth waiting in."}
{"text":"Very convenient, right next to guest elevators, which makes for a quick trip for late night grub , say around 3am? Ordered the roast beef sandwich, $15 , which I believe is standard for this caliber of hotel. Coffee was great, free refills too!"}
{"text":"There isn't an item  in this man's shop it is absolutely delicious. It's all expensive as hell, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Okay, any place in Vegas that you visit twice during a trip has to be good.   This place was fantastic. We had lunch here on our first full day in Vegas, I had a croque monsieur and the boyfriend had a ham & cheese croissant. We finished off with a nutella napoleon. All were amazing. The seating area is lovely and comfy; an oasis in the middle of the gaming floor.   The next day I went down for breakfast. I picked up a chocolate croissant and cinnamon bun for breakfast. I inhaled mine. I really, really wish there was one of these near me. They do pastries and chocolates right and it shows."}
{"text":"First if you are just considering the crepes alone , they are amazing. I've had the Berry and Vanilla Soufflee and it made my mouth water just looking at it. The mochas are way better than the corporate giant, rhymes with (sucks). But why three stars? It's a breakfast shop and the wait is miserable. You pay a crap load of money $13  a crepe and have to stand and wait for 40 minutes ? C'mon now ! Meanwhile one gal is doing all the work and the manager daintily arranges  the chocolates?! They need help for a rush --- very disorganized for the Aria."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  The desserts are SO pretty and everything is absolutely amazing.  Best part about this place?  They have sugar free options for diabetics like my daddy so we can all enjoy as a family.  Oh yeah... and they also happen to have the biggest glass chocolate fountain in the world."}
{"text":"I stopped here several times during my stay to get some refreshing and delicious gelato!  They offer single and double scoops.  I found the single scoop option to be enough for just me - double if I was sharing.  They had fruity flavors and rich chocolatey/creamy flavors as well!  Really enjoyed the tiramisu flavor!  In addition to gelato, they also have crepes, smoothies, breakfast pastries, chocolates and small mini desserts.  Excellent location right next to the elevators so you can grab something to bring to your room, or enjoy as you are heading out for the day."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. I wanna try everything there. The service is a little slow. I tried a very berry smoothie, a rose macaroon, pistachio and rocky road icecream. The smoothie is a little blend, but the others r excellent"}
{"text":"I don't know who this Jean Philippe is, but he is a dessert genious. We came across several of his little patisseries through out vegas, but we frequented the one in ARIA many times. Zomg were they delicious little pastries and chocolates. Long lines, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The pastries were very nice to look at, but that was about it. We had the intense and the napoleon. They were OK. The highlight of the place was the video they played showing the pastry chefs at work. After you see how much effort it takes to make every single pastry look pretty, you almost understand why you just paid $7 for that tiny thing on your plate.   The food on its own is maybe worth 4 stars; docking another star for the ridiculous price. I mean, I know we're in the Bellagio and not some dingy corner of the Mission, but still...I wouldn't come here just to pay so much for mediocrity."}
{"text":"I finally went to the location in Bellagio to see the chocolate fountain.   They say it cost 1 million to build it.  Interesting.   This guy is famous because he's one of the World Pastry Champion.     I tired a bunch of items.   Good but hmm... I've had better at some other places (eg. Chantilly Patisserie In Lomita, CA).   Nevertheless, there aren't that many dessert choices on the strip (Serendipity comes to mind).  If I had to choose, I would choose this place."}
{"text":"Much larger location than Bellagio.    Love the pastries, would pass on the chocolate and crepes.   Are there other places that have dessert like this.... no.  Rather than going to a starbuck and getting something you can get anywhere else, suck it up and just buy some."}
{"text":"Lovely pastries and coffee.  The prices made the sweet older midwestern couple ahead of me freak out.  $16 for a croissant and coffee?"}
{"text":"This girl has a sweet tooth and this place my friend was heaven.  I visited twice in one day and wasn't disappointed!  The first time I had a dark chocolate mint truffle and then I had a nutella brioche...AMAZING!  Not overly priced either.  It was in a great part of the Aria to just chill out, people watch, listen to music and enjoy great eats."}
{"text":"I feel bad.  I've passed by this Jean Philippe Patisserie inside ARIA countless times, but I had never tried tried them until this last trip to Vegas.  I always knew they had some awesome sweets and desserts, and that they sold various types of pastries and croissants.  However, if I had known their paninis were so good, I would have come here so much sooner!  Although they aren't always busy, there's usually a crowd on Sunday mornings.  Like my friends and I, a lot of people drop in to grab something relatively quick before heading to the airport.  However, don't be scared off by the line; it may look bad, but it actually moves rather steadily.  Finding seats when they're busy, on the other hand, can be a little tough.  While a couple of us secured a table, my buddy helped me order the PROSCIUTTO PANINI (~$11).  It looked good on the menu (Cured Italian Ham, Basil Aioli, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomatoes), but it tasted even better.  Prosciutto and mozzarella are two of my favorites, but I really liked the aioli and how the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted.  It's a little messy to eat (it drips), but it's delicious!  Based on my sandwich alone, Jean Philippe Patisserie is easily worth FOUR AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of price.  As good as it was, the portion was just a little too light for the money.  Still, it beats the food prices at the airport though.  Now I just have to make my way back to try some of their sweeter treats!"}
{"text":"Leave it to the French to have the absolute best desserts even in sin city.  Jean-Philippe was amazing!  The fruit sorbet was very smooth and tasted just like the fruit it represented but wayyy better. The tiramisu was decadant. The dark chocolate powder layered in between the cream was so rich.  My only compliment is that J-P needs to serve up some 5 star service with his 5 star desserts.  Perhaps the servers need to be given a daily dose of the desserts to put on a smile :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but expensive.  Also got a chocolate croissant from here and it was closer to a plain croissant, they were very nice and gave me a different one, but same result.  They put like 2 choc chips in the whole thing, its absurd"}
{"text":"I didn't try the chocolates so my review is just for the paninis and macaron.   I had the sweet basil chicken and chicken tandoori sandwiches. Both were good but the basil one was really good. Greasy though, as most paninis are.   Macarons were good.   Really pricey for what it all is, but I guess that's how it is in Vegas."}
{"text":"Walked past this place and had to stop by. Me and my friend shared the triple chocolate mousse cake. The best mousse cake ever! It had white chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse and dark chocolate covering half of it. With a tiny green macaron on top. THE BEST EVER. highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"Ton of selections to choose from. Decided on the lime ... tart? It was beautifully presented and it caught my eye!  Anywho, it was yummy but I did not like the hard sugar piece atop the dessert. TOO SWEET. I took it off. Overall, the inside of the dessert was good, the presentation was good--- full execution? Needs to be worked out. Thing I liked most were their awesome napkins :) I took a few home! Hahahha."}
{"text":"If you love pastries and are in Vegas this place is a must... It's like a little piece of heaven... All of the pastries look delectable..my favorite Rasberry tart ... Yummm"}
{"text":"Get the crepes! They're bomb! Try and get there when there is no line. There are two lines, one for the pastries and the other one closest to the exit is the line for the crepes.  I decided to get the savory crepe that was made with buckwheat flour. It added a nice element to it. More filing in my opinion. I got the one that had cheese and ham with chipotle cream on top. Yummy!  I also came another time for their gelato. It is pretty good. Not the best, but still good."}
{"text":"Located in front of ARIA's elevators for guest rooms, Jean Phillippe offers a BIG salad in three or forum varieties. combined with a croissant sandwich, feeds two very well. Prices are good, location allows for people-watching.  Yes, spectacular sweets, but also excellent luncheon fare.   Please note that some visitors do not clear their tables (twice on two visits). You may need to hustle something off a good spot yourself to grab it, but do it.  STRONGLY SUGGEST: Play MyVegas for points that can be used for all sorts of things, including something from HERE. It's free gaming with a purpose!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive and not really that good. I'm not sure why the reviews are so good, maybe people are eating pastries while drunk or after winning lots of money?  Shared-  - almond croissant- this was super sweet and kinda soggy - nutella brioche- probably the best thing we had, but small and kinda dry - vegetable quiche- just ok - 2 \"large\" coffee ~ tall coffees at starbucks  $26 total which to me was kinda a lot for what we got, but I suppose it confirms the theory that everything in Vegas is overpriced.   Anyways, if you are staying in Aria, its not a bad place to go for some pastries but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I walked the whole strip following the marathon and i was beat once i got my runner, i know, boo hoo for me.  Anyway we stopped here just for a rest and get our sugar up.  Try the tiramasu ice cream, made with real alcohol.  I savored every bite.  $6 worth it all day."}
{"text":"Shut. The. Front. Door.  You need to try the savory crepes here for breakfast or anytime of day.  I'm sure the rest of the menu is delicious but I'm still dreaming of the Forrest Crepe with the over easy gooey egg on top.  Seriously the best crepes I have ever had!  Everything else here looked amazing, too!  Especially the gelato but we didn't try it.  Unfortunately there isn't a smoke free area to eat your food inside the Aria :-(  So we took the crepes to our room and enjoyed eating in a smoke free space."}
{"text":"had to stop by Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria Hotel.  The patisserie is a small \"kiosk\" near the casinos serving up tons of sandwiches, pastries, and other treats.  On display were gorgeous cakes and chocolates.  After debating over at least 3 desserts, I decided on the Nutella Napoleon (I can never resist Nutella).  It definitely had a strong hazelnut/chocolate flavor, but lacked the creaminess of a regular Napoleon.  It was worth the visit though as I love seeing desserts displayed as art."}
{"text":"***I think it's gonna be one concise review after exhaustively riding back from The Meadows on St. Patty's Day.  But we shall see***  There I saw an array of tourists easily gazing upon all the colorful, vivid sweets--plus some sammies--in an equally whimsical & eye-catching ambiance. For maybe 10 or so min of both waiting in line & post-order we ended up w/ a Fruit Tart ($7.50), a 5-in, pie-looking Blueberry Danish ($4), and three coffees (about $13 for drinks).  Admittedly, regardless of the wait, if you can handle a delay of caffeination for maybe an hr or something, then I do suggest forgoing the cha-chinged brew (albeit smooth) & either go to ubiquitous SBUX (on its own, not so much inside these resorts) or anything w/ \"Illy\" engraved.  As for the pastries, the fruit tart exactly had the superb qualifications of being a delicious semi-healthy indulgence.  The price, though, was considerably steep, especially when you just have to compare it to the sweets in dessert-centric SoCal--which might sound ironic, if you think about it =P.  On the other hand, I had to save this little paragraph awarded for one half breakfast, perfectly suited for this blueberry-enamored little lady.  The flaky dough was just-right soft with a perfect tinge of butter, and I extol Monsieur Phillippe for using wild, teeny tiny, and outstanding yummy-ness & tartness of this antioxidant-rich delight so magnanimously that I just happen to not bother taking a pic of it =P.  In brute seriousness I think the one that's blue all over earned a solid four.  Encompassing all others, though, I wouldn't expect so much by not getting too carried away with the long lines--it was quite crowded on a very early Saturday morning--but had very efficient & quick order-by-counter service.  3.5 stars overall, but I absolutely wouldn't mind returning for at least what's on the aforementioned paragraph.  ***Okay, it looked like it may not be xP***"}
{"text":"Large selection of sweets from crepes gelato candy & pastries. I got gelato, which is 2 scoops for 6.50...a little more than I would want to pay... but it had good flavor and the scoops are well sized."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I just wish I had tried it sooner so I could have come back every morning for breakfast.  What we ordered: Nutella brioche - Sooooo good. It's a brioche dusted in powdered sugar and filled with nutella. How can you go wrong there??  Nutella crepe - Good. I mean, it's a Nutella crepe. It's not as good as the ones I've had in France, but it's the best I've had in the US, so no complaints. I'd order it again since I'm addicted to all things Nutella.  Royal crepe - Good if you like creamy savory crepes. I probably wouldn't order it again just so that I could try more sweet crepes, but I recommend it to those who prefer savory.  Pain au chocolate - TO DIE FOR. It's everything a pain au chocolate should be. The croissant is flaky, buttery perfection, and there's just the right amount of chocolate in it! Now I'm going to have this hole in my heart where the Jean Philippe pain au chocolate should be since I won't be getting anything of the same quality for a long, long time.  Jean Philippe is a must! The wait doesn't seem so long when your eyes are glued to their marvelous candy decorations, and the food is divine. It's like being transported to France."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to have a snack before our show and decided to have gelato here.  Their gelato is very tasty!  I had the stracciatella (chocolate chip) and coconut.  My mom had dolce du leche and strawberry.  I really like both of my flavors.  The coconut seemed to have actual flaked coconut in the mix so it gave it a nice texture.  They also have chocolates and crepes, plus a separate sandwich/salad counter.  Definitely a nice place to get a snack or light meal when you don't want to go to a sit down place or regular food court.   They have a nice seating area that overlooks the casino so its great for people watching."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The gelato (mmm, coconut gelato), the chocolate, the crepes.  My cousin and i frequented this patisserie several times a day.  The only real CON is that this place is always packed.  So the wait time can be long and there are tons of tourists looking at the chocolate fountain....so its kinda chaotic.  But still... a fan.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is BEAUTIFUL.  We went here and had pastries and desserts and chocolates and ice cream.  We went here about three times.  Each time, the staff man-handles the product, thowing them in containers and bags, ruining the presentation of the pastries... scraping off the tops of the pastries... I'm sure Mr Jean would frown on this.  Uh yeah... its tasty but you're paying for presentation and art.  Don't just throw my pastry in a bag. Don't just scrape my chocolates taking off all the sea salts from my caramels.  UGH.  Yeah, i'll stick to the Bellagio location."}
{"text":"amazing desserts and PRETTTTYYYY. pretty fast. prices not OUTRAGEOUS considering the skill and freshness. worth it just to check out!"}
{"text":"not only does this place look like a chocolate wonderland, but it is OH SO GOOD! yam yam! my papa spent 50 buckaroos here and got us about 10 yummy pastries (so yes, not cheap). a few to highlight: the 'cinnamon roll', which is exactly what it sounds like, but untraditionally, they goop the cream cheese frosting in a circle on the top, making it resemble... i dunno. something else. something non cinnamon bun-y. delicious though. they also have a nutella stuffed croissant like thing. i just really appreciate the originality of this place. its different, and cute, and delish! i just wish the prices were a little less 'vegas'."}
{"text":"The banana foster crepe was tasty, but there was nothing special about it. The bananas tasted way too ripe that I couldn't taste any caramel. If you like crepes that really taste like plain pancakes, then come here."}
{"text":"Very pretty place.  My camera just went out of control with the ceiling decoration and sugar flower sculptures =)    Yummy yogurt and delicious desserts!  My boyfriend tried the pistachio flavor yogurt and I did my norm - strawberry flavor  =)"}
{"text":"Decided on a gelato pit stop. If you see an old man manning the station, move on and come back. It appears he doesn't know how to multi-task with the LONG line of people at the counter.  We came back and no line! The younger Asian guy took our order:  2 scoop gelato with chocolate mint and caramel hazelnut ($5).   It satisfied the sweet tooth before the big dinner for the evening. They had lots more selection, but the lines were too long. They had displays everywhere of interesting looking creations. They were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I ever had. How can you get a ham and cheese croissant wrong? The presentation was a flat burnt croissant that was soggy on the bottom. The breakfast panini was a dried up egg sandwich. The famous nutella brioche, well, it was nutella wrapped up in a day old bread. The only thing that gave it a star was the berry crepe and fast service. We came here at 8am on a Wednesday so maybe the experience would have been better later in the day or week. We definitely not come back. Over hyped."}
{"text":"I discovered Jean Philippe Patisserie during a previous trip to Las Vegas.  I read about the chocolate fountain so I checked it out and ordered Gelato for a snack.  I always try to visit Bellagio to see the garden which changes every season.  Now I've added on a visit to Jean Philippe for a scoop of Gelato.  I don't indulge often because I need to watch my sugar intake, so when I do, it has to be the best.  This time I tried the Crème Brule Gelato.  It tasted just like Crème Brule which bits of the crunchy caramelized sugar in it.  It was so good!"}
{"text":"It's got the world's largest chocolate fondue under its belt, and the desserts do look quite extravagant.   We tried a chicken basil sandwich, chocolate crepe, and two scoops of gelato. All delicious, most notably the sandwich and the gelato were more standouts.   Give it three stars, but if possible would give them 3.5 stars, due to the fact that the crepe was unfortunately a little dull in its complexity - purely chocolate and the texture was alright. Gelato was great, but my local ice cream stores offers close to similar quality. Sandwich as well. All in all, it's got a name to it, and the packaging allows it to sell very well!"}
{"text":"The Nutella crepe and chocolate crepe were just like the ones we had in Paris.  The bacon, egg, and cheese crepe (not available in France) really hit the spot for breakfast.  The incredible cakes on display and the world's largest chocolate fountain were amazing - if only we could taste them.  \"I love crepes...\""}
{"text":"2 scoops of gelato in a cup for $5.25.  Pistachio lacked flavor.  Hazelnut was nice.  Creamy texture.  Cool chocolate fountain display."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled. Everything about this place looks as kitschy as can be. You stand in a longish line, cafeteria-style, at any given time of day and order from employees dressed in patisserie type uniforms as if this were a Disney joint. It is brightly lit and clean...far from any realistic Parisienne patisserie I might envision. We checked into the Aria three days before leaving Vegas because they gave us two comp nights.  JPP sits at the bottom of the guest elevators...which probably explains its constant flow of traffic: genius location.   The first day after checking in, I needed a quick fix. My husband wasn't fond of their $11 price tag for a sammie but it is the Aria and I figured this might be the best we'd get.  I wanted a ham and cheese croissant but they had \"run out\" so I got the turkey croissant instead. Holy fartballs...I will never ever ever regret paying $11 for it. That one sandwich alone made me (and my cheap hubby) a captive audience.  We went back repeatedly in the remaining 3 days we had in Vegas and literally having just devoured my last JPP bites, the thought of not having it again for some time makes me ache.   They offer this super cool service called Gourmet to Go. For $20, you choose a sandwich, salad, and a dessert pastry. You place your order before midnight the day before you travel and they pack it up in a hand carry tote box. Beats airline food by a million miles and considering the high quality and large quantity, I thought it was a pretty good deal.   I got my turkey croissant again with a Cobb, and a Snickers cake. This was all great but the salad is packed really tight into a cup that can get a little tricky to eat without spilling. Still, i appreciate the portion size they managed to get in there.  The Snickers cake tasted exactly like a Snickers but I think there was about a 2mm sponge cake at the bottom.  It was more like a mousse than a cake. I'm not critiquing the great Jean-Pierre Maury at all... simply warning anyone who is looking for a cake in the Snickers cake.    The hubby got a smoked salmon sandwich, Asian salad, and strawberry lemon cupcake. He ate his salad first, was saying how good it was, offered me a bite and before I could lean in to get one, he had finished the whole thing! From what I could see, it had nice sized shrimp and roasted red peppers in it. He did let me try his smoked salmon sandwich and his cupcake. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that they are the best I've ever had. Ever. Ever.   And that seems to be how they do things there.  I bought a croissant there. It was $4! But it was life changing. Best croissant I've ever had. Ever.   Best cupcake. Ever.  Best smoked salmon sandwich. Ever.  Maybe best sandwich ever--definitely top 3.  Best croissant. Ever.   I can't wait to get back to Jean-Phillipe."}
{"text":"Now I'll walk the length of the Strip to get these tasty treats when I'm not at Aria.   Sticky Bun....Sticky Bun....Sticky Bun.... This is by far the best breakfast pastry I've ever had.  To me, this is a perfect Sticky Bun.  The other pastries are just as good.  You can't go wrong here with whatever you order.  So, please do, and enjoy your morning."}
{"text":"Here's a place with ooh and aah, beautiful displays, much potential. Fairly well executed pastries. Just really need to iron out logistics.  For all that Jean Phillipe always seems to have a hundred employees behind the counter, ordering process is slow and painful.   On this most recent visit I came right before closing and stood in gelato line for good 10 minute because sign specifically said that's where I need to go for pastry ordering.  Low and behold, that's just a gelato line. Pastry cravers, charge ahead and ignore the sign, you can order from an entirely different employee.   Came back next morning and ordered my apple brioche in peace and quiet at 7 am. My party wanted a crepe. The menu advertised Duce de Leche- um no, apparently \"we haven't had that in a loooong time\". I am no crepe chef, but I can whip one up at home and crack open a can of La Lechera Dulce De Leche in a flash. Or...I could reprint menus.   Anyway, the whipped cream machine was broken, so crepe orderers were walking away with a giant scoop of gelato on top of their crepe. They all seemed giddy and excited, so I guess it's a good thing...  All in all- it's a fancy bakery that has everything going for it, but seemingly struggles with operations, which is inconsistent with an overall Bellagio experience."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high but we always come here after checking out the conservatory.we always get gelatin but last night we decided to try other things from the menu. I wanted a smoothie but didn't know what to get with lemon sorbet. The cashier was very helpful,  not codes in the least bit and didn't bat a last when I asked if the fruit was organoc. He didn't k ow and"}
{"text":"The only reason why I always stay at the Aria Hotel!!!  This place is the best!!! I love their crepes, pastries, sandwiches, and everything else!!!  It is a little on the pricy side, but what isn't in Vegas?!"}
{"text":"The BEST Gelato in Vegas, as well as amazing Crepes and great Mocha.  Our normal stop on a night out.  Slightly expensive, but it's the Bellagio, so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast the other day.  This rating is for the breakfast and not the desserts.  Price is quite high $12 for panini.    Order Priscuitto Panni- It was alright.  Nothing very fancy.  COmbination of cheese, meat and veggie was good.  However, bread was hard.  Given the price, I expected more.  Chicken Panini- Same as above.  Vegetable Quiche- Decent.  Tasty.. Good combination and it taste good.  Again for the price of $10, i think its abit lacking.    Had the coffee.  The coffee won my heart.  They use good beans with awesome machines.  If you dont mind the 30 min of line and then another 20 minute for food, id say this place is alright for your breakfast."}
{"text":"There are two Jean Philippe Patisserie:  one in Bellagio and another at the Aria.  Both are beautifully decorated and display various mouthwatering sweet treats.  However, food actually looks better than it taste here.  Do not get me wrong, food here is not awful.  It simply does not have that WOW factor as its presentation.  I actually prefer getting their savory sandwiches.  But then again, I think their sandwiches are a bit overpriced.  As for their price for crepes, you certainly would think that they are made with fresh fruits, but they are not.  I have had a lot better crepes in Denver for a fraction of that price.  I do, however, like how sanitary and well upkeep the place is.  Workers do routine checkups on the temperature of their food which is a plus in my books."}
{"text":"Cappuccino gelato and triple chocolate cake. I'm going to try other pastries again for my snack."}
{"text":"I may have only had the gelato -- and chocolate for that matter -- but my eyes took in everything else while I was waiting. Fresh and tasty, great service with a smile, and, at least to me, pretty reasonable pricing. Go here -- you will not regret it, then again maybe you will after indulging but that regret will come from the fact that everything is so good it will leave you wanting for more."}
{"text":"They make the most beautiful desserts and they are to die for....go on an empty stomach!  Pros: I absolutely love the raspberry rose flavored french macaroon, the Napolean and the flan(the flan is a fantastic deal at $3.95 a piece and it's huge!).  I also found the video being played on their TV to be really interesting to watch. It shows how they made some of the beautiful and delicate decors that went on their pastries/cake. It made me want to go home and try it myself!  Cons: Not a fan of the crepes here. I tried a savory one with ham/spinach/mushroom/cheese and it had WAY too much ham in there. I guess Vegas is all about excess....but sometimes less is more!   Another downer is that I found the workers there are just always in a rush to get through the line which makes it not as charming as it could've been....  Overall, I found cake/pastries divine and would definitely come back and try them all!"}
{"text":"So it is not France. It is nowhere near France. I simply do not like Vegas. Have been here a dozen or so times for varies reasons and I can't stand it. But...I've grown older and my taste in food has changed. I chase Michelin star restaurants and chefs around the globe. Apparently Vegas is great for that.   I find food that reminded me of adopted home from time to time here now. This patisserie reminded me of Eric Roy in Auxerre, near my adopted home in the same region of Burgundy. And while I don't generally care for sweets, I have my eyes set on a pain au chocolat.   Quiche Lorraine for breakfast. Coffee to go. It beats the convention center conference food. Must endure the gambling crowd while standing in line for your quiche to be heated up. Think this would be a much less expensive flight than to Charles De Gaulle.   Don't miss."}
{"text":"The chocolate croissant the husband and I shared was one of the best I have ever had... and we ate it a day after buying it. The chocolate used in it was dark and flavorful in addition to being well spread throughout the pastry. The pastry itself was light and flaky... so good. At around 4$, the price was similar to any bakery. I would definitely get this again."}
{"text":"Anything chocolates! Gourmet sandwich selection here is good, oh save room for the ice cream too!  This time the chocolate in a stiletto shape was my FAV, got to have it!  It's such a dangerous shop, right next to the guest elevator!"}
{"text":"This place was so yummy..we came here 3 times on our trip! How ridiculous.  I would highly recommend the crepes. I liked the \"gelato\" but I wouldn't really consider it gelato..it's more like ice cream with stronger flavors. If you want Italian gelato then you can find it at the Venetian or Palazzo.  However, their crepes are super soft and yummy. And they have the cutest little dessert cakes. Prices are around $6 each for those though and the crepes are about $6-$11...more on the pricier end for sure..but what do you expect in Vegas?"}
{"text":"During my last visit to Vegas as I stayed at the Bellagio it became a nightly ritual to visit Jean Philippe Patisserie. They are always busy so even at 10 in the night expect a big line. Ordering a bit confusing as there are multiple payment stations placed around a circular counter so you need to know what you want and then queue up in the right line.  During my first visit I decided to kick things off by getting some gelato. They have a bunch of flavors that look good so I wanted to try a couple before deciding but looking at the large line behind me I decided against it. I was certainly not offered any samples as I stared at the display case nor did I see the customary containers for dumping used spoons that are placed on top of the display counter, so I'm not sure if they hand out samples. Anyway I decided to go old school and get a scoop of stracciatella (which is a fancy name for vanilla and chocolate chips).   Taste-wise it was good but it lacked the silky texture of gelato. This gelato has to be the closet to ice-cream that I've ever had. If they could somehow keep their flavors intact but get the texture and consistency of gelato from Cafe Gelato it would be the best gelato in the world. Anyway I am not a purist and I like ice-cream as much as I like gelato so I enjoyed it a lot. During subsequent visits I came back and tried some more flavors that I don't recollect and found them all to be good but not great.  Pricewise it is in-line with what you will pay at other similar places on the strip (Large Gelato around $6, Pastries around $8 and crepes around $11). Overall I liked Jean Philippe but I feel that both their gelato and service could use a little improvement."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Bellagio so this seemed like a convenient place to get a quick breakfast before we checked out. We spent about twenty minutes in line waiting for a sandwich and a quiche.   The staff was very unfriendly including the woman wearing business clothing who seemed to be the manager. The line was unorganized when it came to receiving your food and paying. They didn't smile and seemed bothered when you ask questions like \"where can I find napkins\".  My friend didn't enjoy her quiche at all. Said it was just bland. I actually really enjoyed my spicy chicken avocado sandwich. It was very flavorful. The experience was very lacking though."}
{"text":"I loved it. Everything, I loved it. But on my last day I placed an order for pastries to go and while I paid for all of them....two were missing. Tisk tisk."}
{"text":"Maybe only the best shop to buy something here in the Bellagio.  The world's tallest chocolate fountain was worth seeing: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate circulating tons of chocolat (french)...sheesh how eye candy.  We got us a box of macaron's, a box of chocolate dipped biscotti's and an Iced Mocha latte drink.   First off, those chocolate biscotti's were awesome! they were still crunchy even pre-packed and there weren't too sweet.   Second. the macaron's we got came in 8pcs. two of each of coffee, raspberry, pistachio, and chocolate this were pre-packed as well and were not cheap! they tasted good and we finished them in one sitting. Also to add about those macaron's they even stayed fresh and didn't even melt or crumble while we had it sitting in our trunk, through the hot desert we traveled going home. I can't forget these were soft, chewy and delightful!  Third the Iced coffee we ordered wasn't bad at all, it tasted better than what you get at a Cinnabon!   We had a disappointing stay at the Bellagio but this place was a golden nugget find!"}
{"text":"This place is decadent. Everything about it screams sweet elegance. The interior (if you could call it that) is beautiful. While there are no walls closing off the dining area from the casino, the metallic arches encompass you enough to provide some separation. The desserts seem to match the overall design of the restaurant; they are really quite beautiful.  I decided to try the tiramisu as it's one of my favorite desserts. It was perfectly portioned and had the exact combination of creaminess and coffee that I like. The ladyfingers were so well soaked, it seemed as if a little pool of coffee had been left at the bottom. It was moist and astoundingly delicious. I highly recommend it.   I also tried the chocolate cheesecake. After spending a moment figuring out how to actually consume the dessert, I found it to be tasty, but lacking the overall excitement of the tiramisu. It had the creaminess I expected, but the flavor was comparable to any other garden variety cheesecake. And while the presentation was unique, it was difficult to eat. In this instance, perhaps function over form would be preferable.   I would love to return to Jean Philippe to sample the crepes. Unfortunately it will have to wait until my next trip to Vegas. I am happy that I stopped here before leaving though. It's a great place to grab something to satisfy a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Gelato is fantastic!!  And the pastries are as good as you can get them in Paris.  Out of the four I tried, I loved the Cheese Danish and some kinda flaky vanilla pastry.  Out of this world!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I am a fan of muffins and this place has the best Muffins ever, also very good sandwiches and yogut parafait"}
{"text":"I love Jean Philippe Patiserrie at Bellagio so it's only natural that I would fall in love with the bigger, better, newer version at Aria! This place is amazing! The vast number of desserts for you to choose from will make any heart skip a beat!  I came here for breakfast (they don't call it sin city for nothing! gotta live it up!) with a few friends and stood in line for about 10 minutes until we made it up to their cases upon cases of delicious desserts. We opted for a raspberry macaroon, a trio cheese cake (milk, white and dark chocolate cheese cake with an oreo cracker crust) incased in white chocolate topped with a milk chocolate truffle, and a scrumptious nutella cake thingy (sorry not to be more descriptive - look at the pictures to see why I was so distracted). All of the desserts were scrumptious, especially the nutella cake!  Bottom line, best. breakfast. ever. I love Vegas!"}
{"text":"Gelato is good...particularly the rocky road! Overall though, I found the quality of the chocolate to be better at Max Brenner. It's also a nice place to hit up breakfast because they have killer iced coffee."}
{"text":"Holy Crap, can I just move in here?  Stayed at the Aria for a few nights and needed a light breakfast. The patisserie is right next to the guest room elevators so it was quite and convenient and I decided to give it a try.   I ordered the ham and cheese croissant which was hands down the best ham and cheese croissant I have ever had. I also had to get something called the Chocolate Intense. Wow! Just wow! It was amazing and very well named.  Later in the day I was checking my bill at the front desk and discussed a couple of the Aria's restaurants with him. When Jean Philippe Patisserie came up he recommended the almond croissant. One guess what I had for breakfast the next day? And it was equally awesome. I also bought a muffin and cookie for the road home. Both were massively yummy.  Also, there is plenty of seating. Considering the number of people there, I thought I would have a hard time finding a place to sit, but I quickly found a seat and despite the constant flow of people, I didn't see anyone struggle to find a seat.  Okay, now the downside. It is a little expensive, but what do you expect, you are in a 5-star Vegas resort. The ham and cheese croissant, chocolate intense and large soda cost over $20. I had a resort credit so I didn't care. Had I not had the credit I might have docked them a star, but considering the location and how good it was, I'm not complaining.  Also, the service leaves a little to be desired. While fast enough, they weren't friendly at all and when people asked questions they seemed more than a little put out to be answering them.  Still, with food this good I have to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Barely drinkable espresso, servers who wish you really weren't there, but a beautiful display of pastries.  Located in the bowels of the Aria Casino, you drink espresso and eat you B- pastries amongst slot machines and smoke."}
{"text":"I was told by a friend to check it and once I did I was hooked, really great almond croissants !! The line we went was a bit long but well worth it. If I had a faster metabolism lol this would be a great hangout spot, but unfortunately it must stay as a occasionally place"}
{"text":"Overpriced for some mediocre fancy chocolates. Not worth spending money on. Go to Godiva or Hershey's."}
{"text":"A visual delight of beautiful pastries and sandwiches. Purchased a three pack of mini sandwiches for our ride back to Orange County. After spending a couple nights at the Bellagio to celebrate our wedding anniversary, this topped it off perfectly. Looking forward to having a french macaroon for dessert tonight. Lovely, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really do not have a sweet tooth, so I can't say I've actually eaten any of the treats JPP has to offer, but I am writing this review because I am pretty sure the coffee I had was the BEST EVER!!  I really needed a \"pick me up,\" so I stopped in JPP to order something strong. I decided on the large iced white chocolate mocha with an extra shot of espresso. Now, this is not cheap coffee, so don't expect any McDonald's $1 menu prices. The extra shot of espresso alone was more than $2.  There seemed to be an issue with their coffee machine and the young man making my drink had to step away to complete my order. There was quite a bit of a delay (which is not good when someone is in dire need of coffee, LOL), but when he returned he sincerely apologized and mentioned that he wouldn't charge me for the extra shot since I waited so long.  Now seriously, this was the most delicious coffee I've had. And I am not just saying that because I was in desperate need of caffeine.   The staff are all great and put a lot of love into everything they make. I had my eyes on those crepes and will definitely be back - maybe even for something sweet!"}
{"text":"Jean, Jean, oh Jean!! It's great that they're here...right by the guest elevators - how can you not stop by and induldge on the world renowned pastry chef's creations?? Great place to grab something quick, satisfy your sweet or savory cravings~ Great crepes made to order. You can totally taste fresh & quality ingredients! Love the fresh fruit cups - all of the fruits in the cup watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple & berries (packed separately on top  - strawberries, blueberries, & raspberries) are so good!!!  If you want something fast & easy before hitting the casino or after - great place! So go and try the pastries or anything on the menu, you will like what you get! C'est magnifique!!!"}
{"text":"now the first thing that caught my eye were the metal tins full of gelato. my friend ana and i hurried over here, weaving in through a sea of people in the casino. i tasted the papaya something or other flavored one, and opted for my defaults: pistachio and cappuccino (any coffee flavor would have done). the gelato was nothing amazing, but it was tasty. a perfect midnight snack as we were strolling through this new spot in vegas. i'd say that 5.something is a bit expensive for two scoops, but that is what i should expect for some jean philippe, one of the best pastry chefs in the world. i will say though that the displays throughout the rest of their joint were nice to look at."}
{"text":"Taken Jean Philippe Patisserie's popularity in Vegas and Hong Kong into consideration, my friends and I were excited to visit Jean Phillipe at both Bellagio and Aria. While I was fascinated by the chocolate fountain at Bellagio, my friends preferred the large variety of food and the modern decor of Aria. We considered the food at both stores consistent.   My favorite pastry was the rose macaron - it not only contained fresh raspberries, but also had light cream and a moist shell. However, it tasted artificial and sugary. Furthermore, the rose flavor could be strengthened. In comparison, Laduree's macarons' ginger and rose flavors complemented each other. Laduree's macaroons are better than Jean Philippe's overall.    My friends shared the intense chocolate cake, which was creamy and soft, and recommended it to Yelpers. However, in their perspectives, the chocolate crepe was overrated, as it tasted no different from homemade crepes.   I would love to try Jean Philippe's chocolate and other flavors of macarons in the near future. Yelpers, any recommendations?   P.S. Jean Phillipe, your website is not working. Please ensure that the site runs smoothly to meet customers' needs."}
{"text":"Great dessert spot with tons of options to satisfy your sweet tooth, especially if you're feeling some rich and pricey chocolate. The location of this place is somewhat on the backside of the Bellagio just behind the floral gardens. The service is solid and the decor is fantastic anchored by the larger than life chocolate fountain. This place is a bit on the small size but worth a peek of you're in the area and have a sweet tooth.   Pros- Selection of sweets  Service  Chocolate fountain  Coffee   Cons- Pricey Crowded  Line is awkward"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool little patisserie located within Aria. The selection here is a bit on the pricey side but the options are delicious and indeed unique. I would recommend the cupcakes here as they are always moist and delicious. Overall, recommend for meeting you need for sweets.   Pros- Selection Location Uniqueness Friendliness   Cons- Pricey Sometimes sold out"}
{"text":"Finally checked this off my food bucket list! I'm like a little kid in Willy Wonka when I saw the patisserie. The chocolate fountain was a huge tourist draw--I love it! The pastries were amaaazing, I got the raspberry tart, chocolate cake, and opera. We also ordered the crepes. I wasn't really blown away with the crepes nor the coffee. With 3 crepes, 3 pastries, 2 coffees, and 2 bottles of water, our bill was hefty ($96), a little too much for desserts. Having said that, I can still see myself coming over. It's a feast for the eyes!"}
{"text":"Heaven, pure heaven.  I LOVE crepes, and their berry crepe was sweet, light, flavorful, just delicious!  The chocolate fountain was a cute novelty, and I'm still trying it decide if it truly is the largest chocolate waterfall in the world.  (Alaska's Wild Berry Products in Anchorage makes the same claim about their waterfall, btw).  The desserts look absolutely decadent; I knew I couldn't take that calorie bunch, so I satisfied my curiosity by taking lots of photos. (Cheaper and longer-lasting, I'm telling myself.)  Their mochas are delicious, better than your Starbucks variety.  I wished I lived in the Bellagio just so I could come here every day!"}
{"text":"I always make this a MUST stop during my trip and I have been known to come here more than once on the same day.  Everything is great about this place.  Sure it's a little pricey but it's not Dunkin Donuts.   I especially love the Tiramisu and their delicious Hot Chocolate! Now with their second location there are 2 reasons to visit Vegas again! YAY!"}
{"text":"I was in heaven with the almond croissant, apple brioche and bold, rich coffee served at Jean Phillippe Patisserie!  Wow, the croissants couldn't have been any more buttery or flaky, with just the right amount of sweetness ---very authentic to French style for sure!  There are two locations...one in Aria and the other in Bellagio...I visited the one in Aria which was underground right near the casino...I wonder if the Bellagio location has more natural light.   The only thing is that it feels like a dark dungeon eating in this patisserie...the patio overlooks all the slot machines...which isn't ideal.  THe crepes are supposed to be very good, so next time i come to Vegas I will check out the Bellagio location.   Try the croissants for sure, they know what they're doing if you like French food."}
{"text":"For my birthday had them deliver 4 pastries to my room to share with my friends and they where all A++"}
{"text":"a little surprised..Better than I expected. All good and especially I loved italian crepe & sticky bun."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely rude and the food is overrated. At the prices they are charging, the customer service should be top notch."}
{"text":"If Jean Philippe put as much energy into high level service and quality food as they do in the nicely designed dessert and space presentation, this place could be a winner. Fancy uniforms do not make chefs, and, unfortunately, the world's largest chocolate fountain can only offer Las Vegas style misdirection from the reality that here is a dressed up diner with fancy looking desserts. The simple veggie omelette we ordered was not only so-so, it took an actual 50 minutes from the time we entered the order line to the moment we got to sit down and eat it. 15 minutes was how long it took to get to the place to order, the rest was waiting for the food. When we asked why the people far behind us had gotten their ham and cheese omelette before us, the woman at the register apologized and said orders sometimes get mixed up when they get busy. OK, but sorry, the price for a small 2-egg omelette and a single slice of in buttered toast should have been comped or at least offered at a discount for the unreasonable wait. While we were waiting the coffee machine overflowed onto the floor as the stressed manager tries to relieve the pressure by filling cup after cup after cup with no success. Dark comedy behind the counter for sure. At least the entertainment was free."}
{"text":"Big fan! Although the lines can be long in the morning the food is always good and I always love it. I got the quiche this morning and it was wonderful but a little heavy. The pastries are amazing and it just feels good to eat here when you're a bit hung over from the night before."}
{"text":"i. love. this. bakery.  bakeries are one of my favorite places to be and after looking at everything here i was so excited to order!  i got the key lime pie for myself, fruit tart for my dad, and tiramisu for my mom.  all three not only looked beautiful, but tasted oh so wonderful.  even my parents (who like typical asian parents don't like sweets and will only take a bite to be polite) loved their treats and didn't leave any for me to finish for them like they usually do.  yes you read that right... my parents usually end up finishing my food that i don't like and i usually end up finishing their desserts that they don't like.  it's a system that works well for me =)"}
{"text":"My mom and I was just checking out the holiday decors at the Bellagio, when we saw a crowd going on in here. It was already about 11pm, but there were long lines for the crepes (average $11.75) and the gelato ($3.75 for single scoop).  Curiosity got the best of me and we decided to check out the gelato.  Had the mango, which was good and citrusy. My mom had the strawberry which was a little bland. Personally, it was just okay, not so special. I wish We tried the little pastries and cakes instead (all $7 each). But we were still full from the late lunch we had at The Buffet at Wynn so there's not enough space left in our tummies! Hehe.  I think one of their specialties were the french macaroons, but they were expensive so I didn't get it. A box of 10 teeny bite-size macaroons is $18!  They also had a display of the \"world's tallest chocolate fountain\", which was interesting. Do check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, modern, place to grab a bite to eat or some sweet desserts. Not the cheapest place in town, but it's Vegas right?  Nice selection of sandwiches, sandwiches, paninis, salads, crepes, coffees and sweets/desserts/pastries. Almost enough seating but tables can run in short supply due to the hordes of people you find inside the casino.  The place can get a little cramped around the pickup area especially during morning/brunch/lunch hours but the system works pretty well.  I ordered a Spicy Chicken & Tomato Panini ($10.95)and a small (12oz) Cafe Au Lait($4.25) for a grand total of $16.43 after tax.  Definitely not cheap but the quality of the food seemed decent and it tasted pretty good.  Afterwards I kind of felt like I should have ordered a crepe though since that felt more like a breakfast/brunch item.  I didn't try their sweets but they did look very tempting.  Anyway, this place is a nice, clean option for food if you're in Vegas or just in the Aria Casino in general."}
{"text":"If Las Vegas is about excess, a great way to splurge is at Jean Philippe.  If you're particularly friendly, you can meet some great people while standing in line here. And the day I visited, they were quite busy but it was ok as a nice Texan lady and I oohed and aahed over some of exquisite delicacies in the pastry case.   I kick myself now as I should have bought some Macarons and chocolate that were in gift boxes along the walls, because the thought of the decadent treat I enjoyed there puts me back in my cloudy state of desert bliss. There is limited seating inside so I took my treat to a table just outside JP, right by the windows overlooking the pool.  The Bellagio was a crazy mess of tourists that day, but each bite of the dessert trio sent me into a state of total relaxation.  The dessert trio comprised of a mini creme brulee (with the cutest little silver plastic spoon), a raspberry French Marcaron, a Chocolate cake pop with a bit of nutella and caramel.  All served on top of thin plank of milk chocolate. This is so rich, but so awfully good, every bite to be savored.  The flavors so delicious and fresh, textures are perfect.  Well-executed in every way.  Service is friendly. Take some time to check out the world's largest chocolate fountain in the glass case."}
{"text":"I never start or end a vegas trip without going crazy here...  I always get the same thing, a Pecan Sticky Bun and a Cinnamon Sugar Crepe with a scoop of Oreo Cookie gelato.   ~$15 never bought soo much happiness =)"}
{"text":"Cupcakes in Vegas Baby!   Everything at Jean-Philippe Patisserie looked wonderfully delicious! There were even little mini wedding cakes just in case you had one of those quickie Vegas weddings for $20 bucks a pop.    We tasted the Triple Chocolate cupcake and the Red Velvet cupcake.  The cupcakes were so pretty ya almost didn't want to eat them...almost.  Both cupcakes were super fabulous.  I had never tasted a cupcake quite like it.  The frosting on each cupcake was more like a rich chocolate mousse and the cake was just so incredibly moist. Next time I am in Vegas I am going to try this little set up called a Sweet Trio. It has a rose macaroon, a mini creme brulee, and a peanut cake pop.   A bit pricey for a cupcake at $ 5.50 each but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Turkey & Cranberry Croissant- Yummy Turkey Crepe- Yummy Blue Powerade $30 something for a simple lunch @ Jean Philippe Patisserie  The serving size is good for an average sized French person.  However, in the land of Super Size Me, A sandwich or a crepe may not fill you up.   There is so much to look at and drool over at this place. The desserts look so pretty, but everything is pretty expensive.  I was eyeing a pack of marshmallows until I found out it was $20 something dollars!!! I would probably go back just to try out more things on the menu and to try the desserts."}
{"text":"Their desserts and drinks never disappoint! Love to grab a cup of mocha to start the day!"}
{"text":"I had tried the JP at Aria a few years ago, and since I stayed at the Bellagio this time round, I thought I'd try this place out....especially as the outlet is a really awesome looking place with crepes being made before your very eyes, and beautiful display of artfully crafted pastries, and quite a mesmerizing floor to ceiling liquid chocolate fountain out front....for some reason I couldn't get my eyes off of it. Anyway, I had tried to come here for a crepe or breakfast, but the place was always very busy and the line was always crazy long.....so I skipped it. Then on the way back to my room after dinner, there was no line.....and the sorbets looked pretty yummy and seemed to be a perfect after dinner finish.....so I went ahead and ordered the mango sorbet......I tried to get a mix of 2 flavors....mango and coconut, but they're treated just as though you're ordering 2 separate scoops.....and each scoop in a cup came to more than $5 each....ok, this is Vegas, at the swanky Bellagio, and this is some fancy French dessert place, so these prices should be expected.   Hmmm, the sorbet actually tasted like fresh mangoes were used to make it, but the sour'ish type.....however, I thought it was really sweet!!!......a bit too sweet for my taste......I'm sure I got a sugar spike after the second scoop.   The other thing I noticed about this place is that while they have a good selection of coffees, I didn't notice any decent tea offerings on the menu....all I saw was chai tea? I ended going to Starbucks all the way at the other end of the hotel.  Nice place....definitely worth checking out....and I will try to get me a crepe one of these days when the line's not too long.    ***** Next day: at the urging of my friend, we returned for breakfast the next morning and decided to get in the line to see what all the buzz was all about.....it took us about 12-15 minutes to get from the end of the line to where they started taking orders around the other side where the pastries/sandwiches were.....then you keep following the lline to the cashier, pass them your order, and just wait for your food.....it's all take away style. Warning.....there's usually a long wait for crepes and omelettes as there only two crepe hot plates and it takes time to make....especially when there are so many orders before yours.....so be prepared for another long wait yet again.   We ordered the veggie omelette, chicken crepe, a cup of mixed fruit, a croissant....coffee and TEA! In my initial review I didn't notice the tea selection because it was only on the overhead screen angled toward the inside so it's not visible from the outside....I only saw it once I reached the pastry/sandwich display side.  Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed the very yummy omelette which came with a skewer of melon and whole wheat toast.....but it tasted wonderfully with their freshly baked, finely crisp and light and fluffy inside croissant. The chicken crepe was delicious too......so now we got a taste of what all the buzz was about and will most likely be back again for sure. Oh, the almond croissants looked oh so good! I definitely have to try one before I leave here!"}
{"text":"Chocolate, pastries and the sweets are very good! However, the service is slow and not very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"All I kept on saying when I came here was \"What a Place!!!\" because of the quality of food. My girlfriend and I came here on the second, third and fourth day while in Vegas sometimes twice a day (breakfast and lunch) and I wish we found out about this place on our first day because we would have been here.   We tried the crepes, sandwiches, desert, pastries and cold drinks and I know I say I enjoy a lot of places I go to but this place deserves more than five stars.   What makes a great sandwich is fresh bread with all of the proper fixings and this place definitely knows how to mix and match ingredients in your sandwich to get your pallet wanting more.   Their deserts are fresh with quality chocolate   Crepes are not soggy and small but moist and full of whatever type of meat of sweets you order it with.   The only downfall about this place is the price. On an average for a party of two the bill can easily come out to $30-$40 bucks and that's with out waiter service. But heck I would spend that type of money for the food they make."}
{"text":"Seriously good chocolate. I'm holding them to four because they're quite pricey but this is legit delicious, high quality chocolate. The desserts stand out more than the beverages. The crepes are probably very good."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the crepe station.  Unfortunately, they did not live up to my crepe standards.  I ordered the bananas foster crepe, which had caramelized bananas and whipped cream.  I don't think I've ever ordered bananas foster anywhere else before, but when I've made it at home, my bananas are actually CARAMELIZED and not smashed mushy.  These bananas?  No bueno.  Super mushy and the caramelized part?  Just some caramel tasting sauce.  They add the banana sauce to the top of the crepe and don't put it inside like I'm used to.  My mom liked her chocolate crepe that had vanilla creme inside, but I thought it was wayy too rich.  If you're a chocolate lover though, I'd recommend that if you must come here.  I wouldn't bother in the future."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy Jean Philippe more when it was located in Bellagio. The desserts (i've tried everything!)  were so well-balanced and well-made. I was really excited when it first opened in Aria and the dessert were also consistent. After few years (2years?), i've noticed that the quality is not the same anymore. I visit Vegas about 2-3 times per year and this bakery is always on my go-to list. The red velvet cupcake is beautiful and is really good. However, the chocolate decadence dome shape dessert that I usually order is no longer the same. The chocolate wasnt as smooth and the overly sweet. I'm not sure if the decline of quality is due to  mass production? The line may seem long, but it moves fast. There is also fancy disposable silverware at the end of the counter."}
{"text":"The coffee was excellent but unfortunately the pastry I got was quite stale. It was a honey roll with pecans and was totally unacceptable for a reputedly good pastry shop. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was so cute and the desserts like pieces of artwork.  My tiramisu did not taste like the typical tiramisu, in that there were no ladyfingers as far as I could tell but had little chocolate balls in the layers that were an unexpected surprise.  Definitely a place I would visit again!"}
{"text":"Having been to the older and smaller location at the Bellagio for many years, this was my first time at the newer and bigger location at the Aria. It was great to just look around, oooh and aaah at all the items (and the sky high prices), and figure out what to eat for dessert.   Of course, each and every cake is a work of art. You almost don't want to eat it. We eventually tried out both the pumpkin cheesecake and the triple chocolate cake. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, especially when it comes to dark chocolate, but the cake was good for a few bites. It was light and not overly sweet. I do like cheesecake, and I liked the subtle flavors of pumpkin.  I'll have to drop by again on the next trip and try something different. I have my eye on some pastries and breads, perhaps some drinks as well. One thing's for sure, I'll have to win some more money at the blackjack tables to be able to afford more dessert!"}
{"text":"With Sweet treats a-plenty, this is a great place to grab a quick yummy on your way back to your room.   I went with the gelato and couldn't have made a better choice. With lots of flavors it hit the spot on pretty much any hot Vegas day."}
{"text":"I had the tiramisu and I was good, not too sweet, but would had liked a bit more alcohol flavor. And sitting area would be nice."}
{"text":"Great place to stop if for dessert if you're staying in Aria. Love the late hours. Tons of options."}
{"text":"Ahhhh. Love this place. I go once a year around the holidays when we go to see the Bellagio garden. This is my favorite place for an over the top fluffy creation.   Sometimes the line is long, but its worth it. You can get gellato, pastry, or crepes.   Las time we went we got a cafe au lait, a beautiful christmas log pastry that was nothing I expected to be , it was wonderful. A light mousse with the taste of guava, with a  rib cage of white chocolate. We also tried a key lime tart, very fantastic as well. All this plus a small piece of candied orange peel, came out to about 20.00 bucks.  Its once a year that I come here so the price, wait and experience is always worth it. Yummy x-mas treat to myself. Along with a nice seat to enjoy it by the balcony.   Love the chocolate water falls."}
{"text":"I've been to the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio Hotel a few times, and I can't believe I didn't write a review of this wonderful dessert shop!  Looking for a decadent treat? The Jean Philippe Patisserie is the place to be! They have an array of sweet treats that will satisfy any sweet tooth fan. Not only are the treats very pleasant to look at, they are also deeeeeeeelicious!  They sell crepes, fresh salads, delicious cakes, pastries, paninis sandwiches, & gelato. They also sell drinks like coffee, tea, hot cocoa, & soft drinks.  Looking for a gift for a friend or loved one? They got that too, as they have pre-packaged gifts.  On the day I had came to Jean Philippe Patisserie, I had to exercise some real restraint, as the sweet treats served here are so amazing! But since I had some sweet treats earlier at breakfast, I had to pass on the sweet treats served here, and just get a cup of hot coffee.  I must say the coffee that they serve at Jean Philippe Patisserie is very rich & flavorful, and can easily rival any Starbucks, Peets, Philz, Seattle's Best, or any other designer coffee joint.  The shop is very bright looking & clean. At times this store can get really busy with long lines, but lucky for me on the day I came here, it wasn't overly busy, so I was able to get my coffee & was in and out in no time.  There is no seating inside this shop, but just outside of the shop, there are lot of tables & comfortable chairs (inside the hotel) to sit & eat.  Looking for a sweet treat, or a nice hot cup of coffee? Give Jean Philippe Patisserie a try!"}
{"text":"Overall: I'm usually wary of places that seem like tourist traps, but Jean Philippe Patisserie makes some pretty good sweets.  Food: 5  Croissant was flaky on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It doesn't taste overwhelmingly of butter, which I prefer, but it might not be right for those who want a super buttery croissant.  Unsweetened Blueberry Muffin was packed with blueberries and just the right amount of sweetness for a morning muffin. If you have a serious sweet tooth, get the regular one.  Gelato & Sorbet: We got a double scoop of Rocky Road and Unsweetened Strawberry Sorbet in a cone. The Rocky Road was intensely chocolatey and contained brownie bites and marshmallow. I'm not a fan of marshmallow normally, but I thought it was nice in the gelato. However, this is definitely a super sweet choice, so I suggest you balance it with something less sweet. In our case, the sorbet was perfect with its tartness.  Service: 3.5  The staff member who helped us with our gelato order was super nice and very patient with all of our requests. She didn't mind letting us try a bunch of flavors, and she gave us an extra cup because we got a double scoop on a cone. However, the staff member who helped us with our pastry order did give us some attitude. My mom requested a different croissant from the one that he originally grabbed for us, and he aggressively dumped the old croissant back into display.  Ambiance: 5  This particular branch of Jean Phillippe Patisserie located in the Bellagio contains the snap worthy chocolate fountain. The store is divided into a section for pastries and coffee, crepes, ice cream, and tarts and cakes. We stopped by a night before New Year's Eve, but there wasn't a long line for any of the sections. Perhaps we were just lucky?"}
{"text":"Double Cappuccino Cafe au Lait Flan Dulce de Leche Brioche  Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is really good. Went here a few times while on vacation. Prices are a little high, but pretty normal for the area so it's easy to swallow. It certainly is busy in the mornings, but well with the wait."}
{"text":"Their strawberry tart is the best thing I've put in my mouth. I've never had a bad choice there when trying new options. I go out of my way to travel to the strip for the desserts."}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast. I like everything they have. The only thing that I don't understand is every time we go there and after we wait to have our order. Some of the items are missed some how. They always give us the missing stuff after we show them the receipt but seriously it happened  every time we go there.which it weird. Anyways I recommend it for everyone. And I will go there gain and again every time I'm in Vegas. Just one advice, please check you items once you receive them"}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Sometimes just to look because the shop is just so beautiful! My favorite is the Nutella Napoleon yum!!!"}
{"text":"It's a fancy pastry shop for sure, it's more instagram friendly than tasty though. However I do really like the tiramisu ice cream and I would come back just for that next time I go to Bellagio."}
{"text":"23 dollars for banana crepes and apple fritter. The banana crepe tasted like the bananas had been out for 3 days before putting it on top of a crepe, I got nauseous and wanted to throw up, speaking of throw up, the apple fritter tasted salty and it looked like someone had a big hangover and threw up inside of it. The 1 star goes to the latte I ordered that wasn't that bad, but it's not the best I've had, which you should expect from a 10 dollar small coffee."}
{"text":"Saw this place as my mom and I were checking out the hotel this past weekend as we were guests this past weekend...  The first time we walked past here, I spotted the Passion Mango Sorbet, and told my mom I have to get that, simply cuz it sounded really good.  But after the buffet dinner upstairs, I was too full to get any.  But the second night I made it a point to get some...  Got 2 scoops of this wonderfull tasty treat...  Gave one scoop to my mom and I ate one, and the only problem was I wished I had more...  I hated to see the bottom of my cup, which meant I had no more...   I'm definitely gonna try another flavor on my next visit back here to Sin City..."}
{"text":"I love gelato..they have so so many choices..the nutella crepes are amazing..and key lime pie is the best!  U must try everything"}
{"text":"This is a very nice patisserie at the Aria in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed everything I ate here very much. The sandwiches and pastries are fantastic, fresh and delicious. The coffee and cappuccino is near perfect."}
{"text":"Let's start the new year with a *sweet* review!  Happy 2016, y'all!  It's always a pleasure to stop into Jean Philippe whether it's at Bellagio or Aria.  Since I've already written a review for the Aria location, let's write one for Bellagio's!    As previously mentioned by hundreds, this location features the world's largest chocolate fountain with 4,000lbs of chocolate.  That's a lot of cavities!  This is definitely a tourist trap so if you want to take pictures, try to pop in at an obscure hour like 11PM or something.    The pastries here are excellent.  I can't speak for their crepes or gelato at this or Aria's location but I do enjoy me an almond croissant here and a white chocolate mocha with soy milk.  Their macrons are decadent as well.    So what are you waiting for?  Pop in and get some grub!  This place is amazing!  They were decorated especially adorably during the winter season!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome gelato. My favorite is rocky road and mango. A bit pricy but worth it. I had it almost every day.   There's also a smaller version at Bellagio. I also tried red velvet cupcake. It was very creamy , rich and delicious.   Aside from cakes and gelato;  they have crepes , sandwiches, croissants , muffins  and coffee.   Omelette and tea was average."}
{"text":"It's always a treat to stay at Aria what with their modern and chic rooms to all their amazing dining options.  Jean Phillippe Patisserie is amongst another great reason to stay at Aria!  JPP serves up and sells some of the most decadent treats ever.  From little pastries like cinnamon buns and cake pops to boxes of gourmet and fancy chocolates, what can't you get here?  They have delicious crepes, a wide selection of gelato, sandwiches, salads, et cetera.  After a night of drinking and such, it's always an amazing treat to buy yourself a sweet and devour it in the comfort of your room.  The lines are ridiculously long here especially on weekends at breakfast.  If you're smart, buy your pastries the day before and hide it in your room because the wait can be pretty ridiculous.  If you got to have their quiche though, brave the wait.  It's worth it!  Also, don't forget to check out their display/exhibit at the side of their store.  It's always changing and always huge, detailed, and made from chocolate!  Their Bellagio location features the \"world's largest  chocolate fountain\" as well so hop onto that monorail and head over to Bellagio for a peek."}
{"text":"Chocolate fountain/falls are pretty cool and makes sense why all the tourists take pictures next to it (not sure why though).  So yeah it's appealing.   The pastry display is pretty impress. As it should be since it's in the Bellagio.   We had the Vanilla Neopolean and chocolate chip ice cream.  They were both pretty good, but not $16 good.  If I were to shave off a Hershey's chocolate bar and mix it with vanilla ice cream. I'd charge $2.50 for a double scoop.  That's pretty much what it tasted like.  Just because the add a name to the chocolate, making it a designer chocolate is a complete fraud.    Can't blame the staff, they just do what their told, but the price is atrocious!  Oh yeah that too, they don't put a price on the items.  So it's all a complete surprise, but if you do manage to get any attention and ask for a price, they staff does looked bothered.   Just count your loses and eat the chocolate whatever's and enjoy the money you just spent on it. Other worse save your money and buy a gallon thrifty ice cream and a Hershey bar and make your own chocolate chip for a whopping $4.50.   My wife liked the cappuccino though, but it made her sleepy...."}
{"text":"Our orders: Snicker- Beautiful presentation, but a tad too sweeet to my liking. Didnt finish it Opera- not bad! Rose Macaron- Do not waste your money on this. Forest savory crepe: yums! Pabana: delicious smoothie  If we stay at Bellagio again, we would def come back to try their Nutella Brioche and gelato?"}
{"text":"Omg sooooooo yummy! I tried the crepe and Nutella Mille and I'm really sad I didn't go there every day I was in Vegas. If you're into Nutella or chocolate, I highly recommend. It is a little pricy but what isn't on the strip ;)"}
{"text":"The desserts are beautiful to look at, but as someone with an egg allergy, there's very little here that I can actually partake of and the workers seem unwilling to try and figure out if there's anything that doesn't have egg in it. (Even the gelato does, apparently.) I managed to pick up some coffee bean chocolates, which are shaped like coffee beans but aren't actually chocolate covered coffee beans, to share with friends back home.  My companions on the trip, however, partook of a couple of the pastries and seemed happy about the taste, if not about the price. It's Vegas, so I expect everything to be priced a bit ridiculously. (A $7 small cup of carrot juice? Really?) Apparently the coffee is not particularly good, though. I didn't try the coffee myself as I wasn't feeling like coffee at the time, so that's really just hearsay. (But they have drip machines in the back if that means something to you.) It would appear they use Valrhona chocolate.  As mentioned above, the workers really don't seem willing to bother looking things up for allergies and the like, so while I'd normally give the place 3 stars, the service kind of warrants a demerit. Also, a janitor lady started ranting at us because we were still sitting in the area talking after finishing our food and I guess she didn't like where we were sitting? Not entirely sure, but she basically just came at us and started yelling at us for continuing to sit there :( Not exactly a welcoming experience.  Overall impression: pretty but also pretty pricey, and decidedly unfriendly."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain is really cool (and wisely encased in glass to avoid any Willy Wonka-esque mishaps), but the confections seem a bit over-priced to me. Full disclosure, I didn't get to taste any of the bakery items or gelatos as I have an egg allergy and those items all contain egg, so this is based largely on the chocolate and coffee.  The chocolate is decent--they use Valrhona chocolate as the base on the smaller chocolates that I had, so you know that's going to be nice for pretty much any chocolate fan. A fellow customer recommended the chocolate coffee beans, which are chocolates shaped like little coffee beans and flavored with coffee, too. The coffee, however, seems a little off in flavor. Mr. Piano had a crepe and liked it, however, so it might just be that everything that they do well is the stuff with egg in it that I can't have. I'm also a little appalled by the miniscule $8 cup of fresh carrot juice? Did I misread that somehow? I know Vegas is expensive, but dang...  We were there near Halloween, so the décor had that theme going on, and I have to say, the presentation of both the decorative confections and the actual sale confections is really great! Everything looks fantastic--and at those prices, they had better be. The place is fantastic as a spectacle and visual treat, for sure, even if what I was able to have did not live up to any hype. Also, it would have been nice if the workers had a little more knowledge of what did or did not definitely have certain allergens in it (and if the gelato worker was a little less dismissive).  Overall, not a bad place to come and look and maybe grab some souvenir chocolates, but let's say no to the coffee, at least."}
{"text":"Great pastries!  I can personally vouch for  the cheesecake in white chocolate, Chocobana (chocolate mousse, caramelized bananas, dark chocolate cremeux, hazelnut dough), Opera (chocolate ganache, coffee butter cream, almond biscuit, espresso syrup), and the Pecan Tart (pecan caramel, espresso cream, pecan buttercream, hazelnut dough).  The gelato is good, but not in the same league as the pastries.  There are also crepes, breakfast pastries, and chocolate.  **UPDATE as of October 2007: The only thing I haven't liked is a Nutella crepe (Nutella is a chocolate hazelnut spread). The crepe itself was fine, but it came slathered with much too much Nutella. It was sickly sweet and rich - and this coming from a guy that likes greasy food."}
{"text":"I went to Jean Philippe Patisserie yesterday, as my boyfriend and I wanted a quick meal before our flight. This crepe/chocolate stand was on the way to our room in the spa tower. They boast a very cool chocolate fountain at the entrance!   We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes before we finally received our crepe. This is why this place only got 4 stars instead of 5... More workers or more efficient ways to make crepes are necessary for this place. What you think may be a quick bite to eat is not at all.  Otherwise, the food was delicious. My boyfriend and I split the forest crepe with black forest ham. It was very, very tasty.  For $13, it was a decent spend (as it is Vegas!), but elsewhere in the world this price for a crepe would be ridiculous."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their palmier. I really love palmiers, so that's the only pastry I got from this place on my first visit.  The palmier from Jean Philippe Patisserie is the best palmier I ever had. It's flaky, crispy (still crispy even after being stored in the fridge for 3 days), and buttery. It's not too sweet, and not too buttery. They used high quality butter because the palmier doesn't leave any greasy/fatty aftertaste unlike some other palmiers I tried before. It's perfect for my taste.  I regret I only bought two giant palmiers because I didn't expect the palmier is that good. I will surely buy more when I visit Jean Philippe Patisserie next time.  I like the location in ARIA better than the one in Bellagio. It's more spacious. The decor is so modern, and it has lots of seating area.  At both locations (ARIA and Bellagio), I saw people lining up at their crepes station. I bet their crepes are delicious, so I will also get their crepes next time."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked a few places I wanted to check out in Vegas before my trip and Jean Philippe was on the top of my list.   I almost screamed with joy when walking into the bakery. Everything was perfect. From the pastries, the chocolates, the baked goods, and even the gelato looked pretty. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jZqViN77-gIVUxT62EFE9w&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww Although I would have liked to try a crepe I had already bought an Earls Sandwich and was just looking for a dessert to bring on the plane.....   There are many pastry options whether you are a chocolate person, a fruit person, a custard person, they have it all. They even had extravagant macaroons. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VOFgHdstzzjhi3S1gq38dQ&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IQmkc5uyqdw6THBDerkyvw&userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJwwThe prices on the pastries is where unfortunately Jean Philippe loses a star in my book. Close to $7 for a pastry is ridiculous. I don't care how good it is - and yes it was good but not $7 good. I have eaten perfect pastries similar to this in Japan and even those aren't $7.    I was eyeing the Napolean but it looked like it had a little too much custard cream so I went with the fruit tart. It was beautifully deorated with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, slices of apples, kiwis, and pineapple and some mandarin oranges. I know that Jean Philippe aims for quality over quantity and I completely respect that but the tart part seemed a little thin. This was my only complaint as the fruit was perfectly ripened and the custard cream wasn't overly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=QkQLnujuiBDP1mNChJYJww  I also grabbed a croissant which was $4 which was a better value than the skinny tart. It was buttery, flaky and oh so good with some homemade strawberry jam the next morning.   Would I come back? Yes, of course  Would I get the tart again? Probably not.   I love bakeries especially high quality ones..and I know it in Vegas but I just wish their pastries were a LITTLE bit more affordable. I could have bought 2 Earls sandwiches with the price I paid for the tart and the croissant.   YELP 365: 161/365"}
{"text":"Wow what a place this is! It is amazing to see the Chocolate fountain. When in Vegas this is a must stop at Bellagio. We always seem to end up here, sometimes just to walk through and look at the amazing cakes they make.  I am serious they are the best I have ever seen. Chocolate too shaped into different things.  Sometimes if you have a craving for some ice cream or treats they have it here. They make it so hard to pick! Everything looks so good. You will be in Sweet heaven here.  Yes it is a little pricey but if you have a sweet tooth and want to try some amazing desserts you have to look at the selection they have.  Very dangerous place to go but you will love it!"}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain-wall sculpture is amazing and the stuff is totally delectable."}
{"text":"While it may be on the pricey side their desserts and pastries are big, rich, filling, and very attractive. The lines can be long at times but in my opinion it's certainly worth the wait for the quality you are getting. The lines forms a circles around the round main counter so this will give you time to drool over the pastries in the cases to make you decision. There are also cakes on display that look so could you can't believe they are real. They clearly invest a lot of time and patience in their work.   Not only that but they make sure they are always fully staffed. There are several employees on duty ready and willing to help as soon as it's your turn. There is a bit more of a wait if you are ordering breakfast, lunch or crepes so just put your order in and have a seat or come back and pick it up later. You can always go visit the gorgeous Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens or nearby shops to pass the time.   Don't bother with any other places in the area that claim to be Patisserie's. You will be disappointed. Jean Philippe is the top contender!"}
{"text":"Holy chocolate waterfalls!! Can I please have an Mlife moment where I can dance in them and hold my mouth open under the falls and consume as much liquid deliciousness and I want. No? ....pretty please?  This is my go-to sweet spot after checking out the Bellagio Conservatory & Gardens. I frequently bring out-of-town guests here to share in this jaw dropping experience...or I'll bring my little mini me for some sweets. My fav treats are the chocolate covered strawberries. They offer them in white, milk & dark chocolate...some are even dressed in little tuxedos ;)   If fruit is not your fancy, they also have a wide selection of gelato flavors (the cookies & cream and mint chip are high ranking on our list), sweet or savory crepes, a ton baked delights (think mini cakes, éclairs and croissants) and yummy sandwiches & salads. I also love their lemons meringue tarts and key lime cakes. MMM MMM!  Some of the items are a little pricey, but it's understandable because JP's desserts truly are works of art. They also have a lot of custom made cakes on display behind glass. I could only dream of being able to afford one of these multi-tiered cakes for my impending wedding.  P.S. check out Jean Philippe Patisserie during Christmastime to see a life-size Santa make out of chocolate. It's stunning!"}
{"text":"Love how this place is decorated, I found the chocolate fountains especially mesmerizing to look at. They have a wide variety of sweets to enjoy: crepes, gelato, pastries, cakes, desserts and candy.   I got their creme brûlée. I thought this was just okay, it was a different take on the usual creme brûlées that I eat at other restaurants. They had this chocolate cookie on top of it, but I wasn't a fan of it at all. It was extremely expensive, around $9 for a small cup of creme brûlée.   I also got their white chocolate covered strawberry, it was DELICIOUS! The strawberry was sweet and tasty, the white chocolate was drizzled with caramel (which is my favorite thing to eat). It was good but also very expensive: $4 for ONE strawberry. Jesus ! That's the only reason why I docked off a star, the desserts are not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"On our trip to Las Vegas it was my BIL first anniversary. We wanted to make a superb experience so decided to stop at jean Philippe patisserie and get individual desserts for everyone in our group of 6.  This patisserie is inside Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.      We bought snicker mousse, tiramisu and strawberry muffins. Each dessert was artistically crafted and tasted delicious. We enjoyed this experience.   There is a world tallest chocolate fountain here, white and dark chocolate is flowing in a perfect angle and collect on beautiful glass dishes. To me it was divine to observe the chocolate flow and silkiness.   They have variety of chocolate and cookies gift boxes and savories and coffee.  Everything is priced more as compared to other patisseries but every bite is well worth it.     A very incredible experience and a must stop for us in Vegas."}
{"text":"Indulge in their gelato. Love saying g-e-l-a-t-o.    I nibbled on hubs' chocolate gelato (in waffle cone) and 'twas creamy smooth. Good pick guy.   Their ganache-filled macarons were par but I'm glad I had the opportunity to sample some flavors w/their 8-pack.  This spot always grabs my attention w/their free-falling liquid chocolate fountain. It's hypnotic and lured me in. Got me every time.  The longest line is usually for the gelato. But I understand why. Don't be surprised and pack your patience -_0"}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain is amazing and one to gawk at...and like a tourist I took a picture with it. It was conveniently located on my path to my room in the bellagio. This crepe making, gelato serving, pastry making little store is busy...but worth it. If you get gelato at venetian, I want to say you are wasting your money and tastebuds and get it here. The pastries are great to get and eat poolside. It's fun to look at all the treats and the cake creations."}
{"text":"This place is highly over rated... the wonderful part was the chocolate fountain display... the lady at the crepe station looked like she had no idea what she was doing and she had made a few crepes wrong... I got the Oreo cheesecake and it looked pretty but the flavor wasn't what I thought it would be.... I will not go back just because it wasn't the best dessert I have had but the fountain is beautiful."}
{"text":"Tasted like thick rich ice cream that left a not so pleasing after taste. Didn't see what all the fuss was about"}
{"text":"How do I NOT have a review for this place? ABSURD!   I have a major sweet tooth and this place just calls to me every time I'm in Aria. Yes even as I pass by the place dressed in my clubbing clothes, 5inch heels, full makeup, nails done, hair did (yeah I'm fancy huh). I look longingly at the cookies, pastries and other sweets, hating how I can't eat any at that very moment bc I don't want to bust the zipper of my dress.  HOWEVER, I come back the next morning wearing my fat pants/shorts/pjs/whatever clothing that allows me to indulge... and buy several pastries... Several meaning at least 4. I think last time I bought 6-7 things. MMMM! Craving satisfied! =)"}
{"text":"Expected great things from this patisserie but it did not deliver. The pastries and crepes were ok but not the quality I would expect from a French patisserie. I have been to Paris many times and know how they should be. The sandwiches and salads were also disappointing. A street vendor in France has much better baguette sandwiches hands down."}
{"text":"the desserts are soo rich and delightful!...the chocolate fountain is pretty cool! the gelato is very delicious as well...everytime we visit this place, long lines to order!  a must if your visiting bellagio!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the blended mocha drink. The chocolate fountains here were quite an amazing sight. I sometimes wonder where that milk chocolate goes and comes from. Is it recycled? How do they clean that thing? Anyways, a cool sight indeed and a no-fee place to visit if you're in town. Now, I'm not a big crepe fan, so despite that almost every other person was ordering it, those pancake things didn't \"look\" appetizing to me. In any event, I wanted to try something here, so I got the overpriced blended mocha drink. Too sweet for my liking. I prefer more of a bitter chocolate taste, but the drink tasted like a cheap food distributor-level chocolate syrup mixed with ice. I would not order it again. Overall, the experience was interesting cause of the fountains, but I'll pass on menu items. Also, this place could be a nice hang-out spot to avoid the casino scene, but I've always had difficulty finding a place to sit. I think people come here to look at the fountains and relax, and some don't even order anything. I wouldn't make this a destination spot."}
{"text":"Slowest service in all of Vegas. Waited over 20 minutes in line and there was only 2 people in front of me. This was at 6:30am also. I couldn't imagine during a rush. Good choice of pastries is their only saving grace."}
{"text":"I love dessert! This shop is so pretty. All the chocolates, pastries, and gelato are on full display. The strawberry gelato is fantastic; creamy, flavorful, and not too sweet. The chocolate covered strawberries are also really good. The fruit is really ripe and delicious, and the quality of chocolate is nice.  I would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to visit the Bellagio gardens and chocolate fountain at Jean Philippe's. I've always ogled over their fancy pastries, but never tried them. On Saturday, my mom and I decided to get the vegetarian Mediterranean crepes and a dulce de leche brioche for breakfast. Later that night, we even went back for gelato!  I am not a big fan of crepes, but all the vegetables and sauce inside the crepes were good. A lot of food, I couldn't even finish my brioche! Prices are steep and I hated being rushed when I didn't know which pastry I wanted (so many to choose from!). The line was very long when we went for breakfast, but luckily there was a separate line for gelato when we went back later that night."}
{"text":"I come by here every time I am in Vegas.  I guess it makes me think I'm back at home in my birth county France.  I was there this morning and ordered the Black Forest crepe with a small OJ.  $20.  The crepe does not look huge but they are super fulfilling.  I was only able to eat about half of it.  But you know, everything they serve in Vegas are in HUGE portions!"}
{"text":"This is my to go place to get dessert when I come to Vegas. I stop here once a day to get the chocolate Verrine. What's that you ask? Well first it comes inside a mason glass cup. Top part is wheap cream, just below the wheap cream is chocolate penuts and oreo type crunchy drizzle, below that is gooey chocolate syrup, below that is chocolate cream. Perfect for chocolate lovers. A must try for anyone. In short if you are in Las Vegas come by Jean Philippe Patisserie its a must try. You will find something for everyone. From fruit tarts to chocolate heaven. Keep up the amazing taste and great service!   FYI: If you want a little bit more spacier atmosphere Aria Hotel has Jean Philippe Patisserie as well. Its a bit bigger with tables to sit right at the cafe. Also according to yelp it is open 24/7 so you can get your chocolate craving anytime of the day"}

{"text":"I usually order the Mixed Berries w/nutella & chocolate on top w/their Cheesecake gelato on the side. It's awesome! The crepe is good for 2 ppl. It's a good size portion. I think for both the gelato and crepe together is around $13-14. It is pricey but it's really good."}
{"text":":(  we went specifically for the macarons but alas they had completely sold out and it was barely into the afternoon!!  So my friends and I got gelato instead (yummyy) and saw that wonderful chocolate fountain and oohed-and-ahhed at all the pretty desserts and crepes they were making.   We will try again, but it really is a sweets-lover's fantasy!"}
{"text":"Of all the places I had to visit in Vegas, this was #1 on my list and I am so glad that it was! Beautifully displayed, a variety of different ice creams and gelatos, another section full of artisanal chocolates and macarons, french pastries, coffee, and baked goods -- this place is the best! Will definitely come back again. Maybe next time I'll try the one at the bellagio :)"}
{"text":"Awesome cakes! Very creative and great detail. Great Macaron selection. They have a Halloween theme going right now and it's pretty epic. Was worth it for me to just see the cakes."}
{"text":"Nohing beats the smell of freshly prepared crepes cept I didn't feel like waiting in line but for my girlfriends sake I should have. Instead we went to the pastry side for paninis and bagels.   The prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and tomato on a French roll was fantastic. The aolli was a decent condiment. I would have liked to have tried it untoasted. I think the complexity of the ham and the texture and simpleness of the cheese would have been a great in it's natural form.   The bagel on the other hand was raw. Cream cheese and jam on a raw bagel is horrible. It was as if they put it in the mocrowave for 10 seconds."}
{"text":"Sorry excuse for gelato. I ordered the pistachio flavor and it didn't even taste like pistachio. Not to mention, I found a hair in it! Ew I was so grossed out!!!"}
{"text":"Superb pastries and a great stopping spot for a quick treat and coffee while taking in the Bellagio sights. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The food preparation is a spectacle in and of itself!   Follow me on twitter! www.twitter.com/edsonhong"}
{"text":"Opera Cake - always fantastic quality and rich enough to share between 2 people.  I come here every other Vegas trip to stop by and have one.  Crepes - french style obviously with a soft crepe underneath warm fruits with gelato.  all the fruits have powerful flavors and the gelatos are of great quality, however I think their baked goods are better.  I'd rather stick to the crepes where all the stuff is on the inside and the crepe itself is a crispy shell"}
{"text":"A not so quick tip + some quick tips!  1. FREE STUFF TIP: if you have Facebook, get the app MyVegas. It's a slot game that allows you to earn real rewards. Here, if you earn 10,000 loyalty points you can redeem either a \"Signature Pastry\" or a \"Crepe.\" While that is interesting in itself, the best part is that these two rewards generate a voucher that is good for about $10 in food & beverage credit at Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria!  2. Jean Philippe is located next to the elevators leading up to the Aria hotel or really close to Haze nightclub.  3. Jean Philippe is best known for their pastries, but they also serve delectable sandwiches and gelato!  4. Try the chicken panini's they are awesome.  5. JP is also a chocolatier and has many different confections and chocolate available.  Jean Philippe is my favorite stop in the Aria. Not only is it \"affordable,\" it is also part of the MyVegas rewards program. Every time my girlfriend and I head to Vegas we will farm loyalty points on MyVegas and purchase the two rewards to use at JP for a free lunch/brunch/breakfast meal. The savings actually add up!  Now beyond the free stuff spiel, I must say that the sandwiches there are excellent. Among our favorites are the panini's. Particularly the chicken ones that they have. We have tried their pesto panini and it is pretty damn good when it comes out fresh, hot, toasty and crunchy.  They also have a variety of diabetes inducing pastries. If after looking through their delectable mixture of desserts and pastries you cannot decide, I recommend trying their sampler. It comes with a chocolate peanut butter cake pop, a creme brulee, and a raspberry macaron.  Speaking of macaron, across the way and past the pastries, there is a crepe making station as well as gelato and an area for chocolate and other delicious confections. Their gelato is pretty excellent, though a bit pricey.  If you are a fan of regular breakfast foods, don't fear they do have muffins and donuts and the like. As well as stuff on the healthier end such as salads.  I have never had a problem at JP with service. It gets busy around the area and it may be difficult to find a seat, but the service has always been friendly and efficient. The reason why I also like this location better than the one in the Bellagio is that it is less busy. This is primarily due to the fact that they don't have the world's largest chocolate fountain running through their store, which means that there are not a lot of people milling about as a tourist attraction.  Anyways, this is a great place to relax, refresh, and eat a nice breakfast, lunch, or light dinner. As a side note, this place is also open til 12 AM!  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Gelato is heaven.  Every.single.time.  Cannot go to the Aria w/out stopping by here.  I love the seasonal items, too.  Chocolate pumpkin lollipops are a must for the babies.  4 Stars because they never seem to have enough people working there.  Worth the wait, tho."}
{"text":"On one day, I had the hazelnut gelato. On another day, I had the exotic crepe. Both were absolutely delicious! The coconut gelato that came with the crepe complimented it so well. The warm with the cold and the different textures made it so delicious. I will definitely crave the crepes and gelatos from there."}
{"text":"The chocolate fountain and all the desserts looked AND were so decadent!  The Italian savory crepe and the Forest savory crepe were so delicious as breakfast and were made with buckwheat. Be warned however that it takes around 20 minutes to make and not for the rushed. We also ordered the almond croissants- these were flaky, light, buttery, and the perfect amount of almond cream. The creme brulee and the cheesecake were light and delicious.  We ordered a large americano but I would skip any type of drinks here and just go for their desserts. Everything is pretty pricey- we paid over $70 total but I'd totally come here again."}
{"text":"4.0 Stars  SMOKED SALMON SANDWICH why are you so delicious?  With your caper dill cream cheese, daikon sprouts, red onions, and sliced hard boiled eggs you are one sexy, tasty sandwich that I couldn't put down.  A drug perhaps? How can I be addicted to a sandwich?  It must have been your buttery smoked salmon pieces between the soft, pillowy brioche bread that made my taste buds dance with joy.  It's okay, I'll ignore your $10.15 price tag (wait, did they increase the price?) because you're worth every cent!  FYI: Be sure to check out the amazing chocolate fountain that holds a Guiness World Record at this location.  == A MUST TRY! =="}
{"text":"It was our last day in Vegas and wanted to grab some breakfast.  The breakfast sandwich my hubby got, he didn't like.  He said it was ok, but wouldn't get it again.  I ordered the veggie omelet and I have to laugh, because they gave me a crepe instead and it was Devine.  I devoured it.  I didn't even care that it wasn't the omelet I ordered.  hahaha  I would totally get it again.  The coffee was good as well.  I loved it and would eat there again.  haha"}
{"text":"This place is eye candy.  You could gain 5 pounds just looking at the joint.  The world's largest chocolate fountain is a feast for the eyes, the multi-tiered cakes hanging from the ceiling are gorgeous, yet look like they'd taste just as good as they look.    The only thing I actually tasted with my mouth was the mango gelato.  Perfect texture, strong mango flavor.  Refreshing.  Totally hit the spot on this 100 degree day in Vegas.  Cost a whopping $5.50, but they give you what seems like two scoops.  One scoop at the Venetian Gelateria in St. Mark's Square is much smaller and costs somewhere around $4...."}
{"text":"I make sure to always make a stop by Jean Phillipe every visit to Vegas. Their desserts are as beautiful as they are scrumptious, though they can be sickeningly saccharine.  I try something new every time, and I've loved everything I've tried.  My favorites have been the vanilla napoleon and the nutella opera cake. The chocolate cheesecake is a bit too sweet, but still amazingly rich and delicious.  Their gelato is great, I LOVED the strawberry, and I'm usually not a strawberry ice cream kinda gal. I've also tried the mint chocolate chip (yum!) and the pistachio (good, but have had better).  I've only tried one of the breads, the dulce de leche on the recommendation of yelp. I asked the worker which was better, the almond brioche or the dulce de leche, and she recommended the leche, with a heaping cup of attitude on top. Whatever.  I found it severely lacking. It was both too dry and waaaaaay too sweet. Not a fan!   Still, I go back for the beautifully decorated and meticulously made desserts. My goal: try their whole menu!"}
{"text":"we came here for a \"light snack\" because we were going to hit the bellagio buffet later but needed something to hold us over the pastry and sandwich displays are beautiful and the chocolate fountain is stunning we decided on the crepes (2 savory and 1 sweet) for 3 of us. the royal had very tender chicken and was tastier than the forest which had ham). the savory crepes all come with a side salad with nice dressing.  the nutella with banana was great (they list nutella only on the menu but you can ask them to add the bananas when you order). it's fun watching them make the crepes (especially if it's yours). there were a lot of people on the weekend as expected). the crepes come in plastic plate that is perfectly shaped to the crepes which is funny.  it was a great \"light snack\" before the buffet later =)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Proscuitto Panini and Strawberry Lemon Cupcake.  The panini was delicious. It was grilled perfectly crispy and flaky. The mixture of the prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato and pesto sauce were well balanced - seasoned well. I would eat it again!  The cupcake was ok. It was very sweet. The cake itself has a very strong almond flavor. The topping is a very tart and sweet lemon flavor. I would not get this dessert again as there was nothing that made it stand out. It was just an okay dessert."}
{"text":"Everyone that passes by this pastry shop is usually mesmerized by the chocolate fountain behind the glass. I come here for the fresh macarons and the gelato! The lines are long throughout the day. My friend Kim and I came here when they were just about to close. So worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Just pretty much like most things in Vegas that is selling its Look rather than the real thing, this place is no exception.    With such a high rating on Yelp and so much talk about their crepes, we set out a special trip to Bellagio to try it.  But the result is one big disappointment.  The store decor and food presentation are 5-star but the actual food taste is 2-star at best.  Reckon yelper \"Vi Y\", did anyone actually eat the food before they commented?? or did they simply commented on the decor?    Being crepe lovers ourselves, I had a mixed berry vanilla crepe and my husband had a classic savory ham and cheese crepe & a glass of grapefruit juice.  The bill came out to $32, which was rather on the pricey side for crepes, but it was nothing much by Vegas standard (noted their sitdown area is a small, self-served corner with limited seating.  Like a food court).   Unfortunately both of our crepes came out bland.  Nothing extraordinary.  Nothing to write home about.  My sweet crepe was covered completely with too much overly sweetened berry sauce and the vanilla melt in the middle was too much & thick, making the layers so soggy with little to no texture.  My husband's savory crepe was little bit better than mine.  It was severely lacking cheese but at least the buckwheat crepe batter balanced out better with its ingredients, brought out a little bit more flavor and texture.   But overall, both crepes were subpar-mediocre at best, not made of high quality, fresh ingredients.   Both tasted rather pre-made, pulled right out of a fridge.   Given so much expectation and hype, we felt like both our bellies and our pockets got jipped."}
{"text":"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100  I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.  It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!  I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.  One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the \"biggest chocolate fountain in the world\" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.  Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!  Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).  The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.  I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.  Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!"}
{"text":"more for their $$$ desserts, I mainly come here just to marvel at their chocolate fountain. For all you instagram aficionados, it's picture worthy. If you have the money to splurge on desserts do try their coffee and almond gelato with the waffle cone. Might as well go full out if you're going to spend almost five dollars on a scoop of gelato."}
{"text":"This place was cute, and kinda pricey of course. The miniature decorated little cakes were so cute, but at 20 bucks a pop..that is like way overpriced, especially for it just being chocolate. The rice krispy balls were good though, especially the pistachio one, also the chocolate was good. The cookies were soft and yummy as well. It's easy to spend 70 bucks here like nothing!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe is delicious, I use to go here often for the macaroons. The past 3-4 times I have been there haven't been any for sale. I asked the sales person why macaroons aren't available anymore and she said they only make them on select days now and they sell out almost immediately. Why not make more of a product that people want and you sell out of?  Bring back regular macaroons!!  The strawberry rice crispy treats are pretty yummy as a substitute."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed by the sights didn't know what to pick out. Everything looked so amazing. Had gelato and a couple of treats. You can buy some chocolate confections to take back home with you. But make sure you don't walk on the strip while it's hot outside or it will melt.   It's the home of the worlds largest chocolate fountain. Employees are on top of their game in the fast paced environment. It's always super busy here. So pack you're patients ok. The place is not very large so deal with it. Just enjoy what's around you. You can order a custom cake also."}
{"text":"Pricey pricey pricey this place is. For a cup of geleto is $5.75. They have selections of choclates, crepes, pastries, and salads that looks like an artful garden in a circle container. Stay away from the fruit salad that cost around $7.00 bucks forget that it's a rip off. They have good take home food gifts to give out. I suggest don't try and buy the chocolate home due to the heat outside unless you have something cold with you to keep the chocolate solid. Otherwise it will melt in the Vega's heat. Trust me on this."}
{"text":"To be honest other than ice cream and some chocolates and candies I have no idea what this place sells LOL. I woke up super hungover that morning and really really really wanted some ice cream so we Yelped \"ice cream\" and randomly picked whatever came up and looked good. We figured in this place is in the Bellagio so it had to be good XD   This place has really cool décor. There was a huge chocolate fountain and many other statues--definitely an attraction for the kids!  The ice cream was pretty awful... For some reason it melted super quickly...even though we stayed indoors and it was pretty cold indoors. I think it has to do with Jean Philippe because I saw the server take out a tray of Cookies and Cream ice cream and it was already melting. The ice cream itself was alright--it was creamy but the flavors were average. Pretty disappointing, actually. Either way, I got my ice cream fix that day and I was a happy camper :P"}
{"text":"My first experience at Jean Philippe was getting coffee. It is the closest coffee available to the rooms at Aria. We stood in the slowest moving long line.  Coffee is available in two sizes, small (12oz) and large (16oz). My large Americano was with flavor was over $5. They charge $1 for flavor and they consider honey a flavor. The most expensive coffee I have ever had! I was ready to be very pissed about my coffee, and then I tasted it. Delicious. Hands down one of the best tasting coffees I have had in the states.   Food and desert here is also delicious. They make crepes, just about any concoction you can think up. I had a breakfast crepe and it was to die for good. We split a nutella crepe.. you can never go wrong with nutella! And the nutella brioche is FABULOUS.   I am willing to bet that you cannot go wrong with anything you order here."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for coffee. The selection of pastries is amazing. They also have sandwiches when one wants something a bit more substantial. Often we're not at the Bellagio because we usually stay at the Total Rewards properties, but it's worth the walk to here or Aria."}
{"text":"This is the Jean Philippe Patisserie that is in the Aria.  It's much bigger than the one in the Bellagio and the line moves pretty fast.  They have sandwiches, crepes, panini and many other treats.  We always stop at both locations for our morning coffee, but like this one as it has more seating and faster lines.  Both have the most amazing treats.  My favorite is the flan.  I get it all the time."}
{"text":"Located in the Aria hotel, the patisserie has a lot of great dessert options. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll be in sweets heaven. There is also ample seating and cute decor. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could give this bakery more stars I would.  I adore coming to Jean Philippe Patisserie! I always come here when I am in Vegas. Why you may ask? because it is so worth it!!!! This location is on the Casino Floor at The Aria Hotel and Casino. At Jean Philippe you will find a huge selection of pastries. There is something for everyone. I personally enjoy their coffee. My favorite is the iced white chocolate mocha.    If I am in Vegas any time soon you will for sure see my check in. Guaranteed!"}
{"text":"By the time I stopped at this branch of the Jean Philippe Patisserie, I had already visited the one at the Aria thrice in one trip.  ___________________________________  DATE/TIME: Saturday, March 30, 2013 // 6:15pm  PRICE: +/- $10/crepe, $4/donut. VALUE: A bit pricey, which increases expectations a bit. AMBIANCE: This branch is somewhat smaller than the one at the Aria, and due to it's circular set-up, can be a little confusing. For crepes, you get in the line to the left hand side when facing the store, order your crepes, then wait for your name to be called out. Seating is not directly within the Jean Philippe and looks a bit like somewhat outdated Bellagio-themed random tables and chairs, unlike the modern set-up at the Aria location. There is, in fact, a chocolate fountain. SERVICE: A bit on the slow side.

The banana foster itself was so runny that it made the crepes soggy, and had a rather strong flavor.] * VANILLA SOUFFLE CREPE w/NUTELLA - $9.95              http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JYoxXb6fiFVQRMnmrCt7hg&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg              - [3.5/5 - Tasty. The vanilla cream was not too sweet. We opted to pair it with Nutella, which we found added a perfect amount of sweetness to the crepe.] * NUTELLA DONUT - $4.00              http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RXD7V047i0u8PygrLcNZFQ&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg              - [4/5 - We were looking for the Nutella brioche, but they had sold out by 6pm on a Saturday afternoon. The Nutella donut was really good, with a nice ratio of Nutella to dough.]"}
{"text":"Gelato was great.  It actually was cheaper than some of the other Gelato places we stumbled upon.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I grabbed an above average Ice Coffee on the way out that cost $4.70!  C'mon, that's way too much for plain coffee poured over ice cubes."}
{"text":"Service was a definite 5stars, but I had to down this rating tremendously because I bought some chocolates for the girlfriend and there was something very wrong.  My girlfriend ate it and told me something was not right, then looked at it.  Look at the picture, it looks like there was a piece of plastic inside the center of the heart shaped chocolate, very disappointed at such high quality chocolates."}
{"text":"This patisserie just wows your eyes. When you see it from afar,  it makes you curious and when you walk in, you just wanna look and  touch everything you see. It's cute and elegant at the same time.  We came here by recommendation by three different people, and I applaud them. Thank you! I took some goodies home for my family, mainly for the kids, and I gotta say, the chocolate was on point. It makes you feel like you will never eat another drugstore bought chocolate ever again.  My friends and I came here for a quick lunch after a tea party. If you know tea parties, then you know that you eat like a pigeon but drink tea like a fish. So we came here to give ourselves more sustenance and the paninis we ordered were delicious.   It's located in the Aria hotel in a good spot where you can sit and people watch. TRUST, we were people watching. How can we not? We was in VEGAS, BABY!"}
{"text":"I had the Imperial. A creme brulee covered with chocolate and a crunchy wafer. I have to admit that it was certainly a special dessert.  Not too sweet and very rich. It costed almost seven dollars. You get a cute plastic plate and a gold plastic fork. Expect awful service. There are several lines, all of which is for a specific purpose. You start off in one line to order then you go to another to pay. The girls behind the counter are young and inexperienced. As we finished eating the last bite of our dessert, one of the young girls came over to our table which is rather far away from the patisserie itself, apologized and swiped everything off the table.  I didn't even get a chance to wipe my mouth with the napkin. She threw it away before we even had a chance to clean up.  Also, this place gets more crowded as it gets later."}
{"text":"Such wonderful chocolates and desserts...but it wouldn't hurt if the prices would reflect the proportions.  I love their white chocolate mocha, but it was $7 a cup. As a daily coffee consumer who drinks Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, $7 is definitely a bit of a splurge.  If you're stopping by Jean Phillippe, whether here at the Aria or the Bellagio, I recommend their gelato. I've only tried the strawberry and coconut, but I'm determined to try them all. The texture is unlike any other gelato I've ever had. So smooth and milky!  Their selection of cookies are good too, but a small package is like ~$18. Still, their sweets are delectable and the exquisite packaging would make fantastic gifts!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Disneyland of gelato and pastries - literally! I was so impressed when I walked into this cute little patisserie. The gelatos are definitely eye-catching and picture-worthy, as they are draped with toppings in a very presentable way. The pastries are all packed with color and look beautifully placed side-by-side each other. If I didn't have to board the airplane that day and actually lived in Las Vegas, I would have totally bought a bunch of these little cuties. They also make your standard coffee drinks here.   However, the crepes have DEFINITELY won my heart here at Jean Philippe Patisserie. My friend ordered a Chocolate Souffle crepe. Basically, they poured the fresh crepe batter on to the sizzling stovetop, moved it to a clear plastic plate, and added custard to the insides of the crepe. Then, they drizzled it in chocolate syrup, chopped brownies, and powdered sugar. Um, YUM! One bite of this crepe and I was addicted! I never had custard inside of my crepe before, and that was what definitely stuck out to me about this crepe! The portion size is definitely shareable, unless you love your sweets all to yourself, heh.  I also ordered a Iced Caramel Latte here, which tasted like your average drink. However, I would highly recommend ordering the crepes here at Jean Philippe Patisserie! I cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful desserts. Literally the best eclairs I've ever had. Get a chicken pesto panini. Take a picture of the largest chocolate fountain in the world."}
{"text":"I am a cook, and typically cooks do not like sweets or bakery type things. However, I bow down to the simplistic artistry in their chocolatiering. 2 of my favorite casinos is the Aria and the Bellagio, they both have Jean Philippe, I'm in heaven!   My first experience was their coffee, amazing drip and amazing mocha's. So I had to try their other items. What got me was their crepes. Simple I know, the best is the Nutella crepe. I have had this many times from many other places. Jean Philippe by far dominates all the chocolatiering newbs!   They use the most perfect batter, firm yet chewy, soft and delicate. They top this warm gooeyness with fresh scratch made whip cream! The mixture of the crepe with the warm hazelnut chocolate smothered in cool freshly made cream is to die for!   This is food porn at its best. We loved this place so much we bought a box full of Jean Philippe goodies to take home to family and friends. This is now one of my first and last Vegas stops!"}
{"text":"The almond chocolate croissant was excellent. Super flaky, buttery pastry and plenty of almond paste filling and crunchy chocolate crisps for decoration. Forgot to take a photo but it was beautiful. Expect a wait. There's no clear line and this place always seemed to be crowded. Worth it for a snack."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas with a large group of friends and a few of them wanted something sweet to snack on. We liked the Bellagio location but since we were near Aria we decided to check out this location. The desserts looked just as beautiful at this location. Couldn't walk away without getting something so we decided to share a gelato cup. It was delicious. Worth a stop if you're nearby as they have some great chocolate art pieces that are stunning to look at. Afterwards, you can enjoy a creamy gelato, chocolate dipped strawberries or yummy chocolates."}
{"text":"What was supposed to be just a simple stop for coffee turned into a paparazzi moment for desserts. They had so many options and each one looked so beautiful. It was like going to a museum and each dessert was an art piece on display. You couldn't help but stare and drool as you pass by the cases containing these delicious looking desserts. How could you not take a gazillion pictures? Of course we all pulled out our phones and started snapping a ton of pics. The chocolate fountain was amazing and who knew you'd be able to view a Guinness Record at the Bellagio? We were with a group of friends and after mulling it over for what felt like an eternity we decided on a few to share. We ordered the Rose Macaron, Chocolate Éclair, Raspberry Tart, and Nutella Millefeuile. They were all good with the macaron being my least favorite only because I'm not a fan of rose water or anything roses. Worth a stop to at least look at the stunning food art but it'll be hard to walk away without ordering something."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this week and had to stop at Jean Philippe's. Once again it was amazing. This location is wayy better than the one at Aria. Aria employees are rude."}
{"text":"Such a delicious place, but visually and \"get in mah belly!\"-ly. Wonderful breakfast/brunch place, and great snack place as well. Pastries, desserts, and savory crepes all day!  Forest crepe: Order it with a sunny side up egg and it's really pretty! Also amazing and tasty...cheese and other goodies in every bite! Wasn't big on the salad dressing, but I didn't order the crepe for the veggies!   Breakfast ham and cheese sandwich: Something like that. It had a whole egg inside, which was cool to look at and also delicious. Wish the egg actually spread to the whole sandwich instead of just the middle, but still good.  Fruit parfait: There's this crust separating the fruit from the greek yogurt which reminds me of a soggy (but delicious) crumble. It was actually very good and different from most other parfaits!  White chocolate mocha: Very sweet, but you can definitely taste the white chocolate with just the teensiest hint of coffee! Great for white chocolate lovers!  Chocolate crepe with oreo gelato: The crepe was not bad, but OH MY THAT GELATO! Delicous! I had never had such good oreo gelato OR ice cream OR yogurt! AHHHH SO YUMMY! Each bite was like eating 7 oreos as it was so full of flavor and the texture was smooth and creamy and oh man. I need to stop before I drool. But yes, try the oreo gelato. You won't regret it!  Jean Philippe, I love you so!"}
{"text":"I always come here for breakfast. A nice fruit cup or parfait for me, ham and cheese panini for the bf. White choco mocha for him, double espresso shot for me. Then there would be the times when we see pastries we just HAVE to have--their pumpkin cheesecake is good, as is their dessert trio (rose macaron, PB lolli and creme brulee on a milk choco tray YES PLEASE). There hasn't been a dish I haven't liked and it is still my fave breakfast place so far (beats out Payard, which is my second fave breakkie place).  Desserts and coffee...COME HERE!!! Note that it CAN get pricey though."}
{"text":"Besides getting to take a look at the largest chocolate fountaing in the world you get to have some great tasting dessert crepes.  We make it a point to stop here and have a crepe everytime we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is beautiful and has delicious food! We stayed at the Bellagio (6 friends and I) on our trip to Vegas and frequented this place for brunch/breakfast almost every day.  I tried the vegetable crepe, which I wasn't the biggest fan of, but it wasn't bad either. I'm not sure if I didn't like the buckwheat crepe part of it, or the filling- I still ate it and enjoyed it... just don't think it was the best.  Coffee- delicious. I just had regular coffee. A friend had the caramel iced coffee (I can't remember the name, but it's on the menu) and said it was a bit sweet but good.  Quiches - delicious! I had the asparagus one and a friend had Lorraine (twice each) - really good and tastes fresh!  Sandwiches - I had the caprese once and although the sauce is a bit oily, it was wonderful to have while hungover at the pool.   Blueberry muffin - moist and delicious and fresh!   Unfortunately I didn't try the most mouthwatering items on display - the DESSERTS!! While I was gambling, two of my friends went to grab food and I asked one of the guys to grab me one of the desserts, but he had no idea what I wanted so didn't :( Oh well, guess I have to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would have desserts at Jean Philippe everyday. They have this amazing chocolate dragon on display in front and the whole storefront just looks like a pastry wonderland. My friends and I could not help it and went crazy buying up most of their cakes. Yes, they were THAT good. The Lemon meringue tart, intense, and cheesecake are a must try."}
{"text":"You don't need another yelp review telling you that the pastries here are amazing. There's 234873293 other reviews to tell you that. The reason I like THIS Jean Phillipe over the Bellagio one is that this one actually has place for you to sit and enjoy these before mentioned amazing pastries. I like how they have places for you to sit and chit chat or people watch over the casino. The Bellagio Jean Phillipe didn't think it through. The pastries are bomb but SUPER rich. I have a ginormous sweet tooth and I still couldn't finish my creme brulee. Speaking of which, don't order the creme brulee. I am a creme brulee purist, and this one instead of burning the top layer of sugar, separated the custard with a piece of white chocolate and then put a layer of the flan-type caramel on top. You get the same \"crack\" of a proper creme brulee, without the yummy burnt pleasure. Me no likey! In fact, it was quite disappointing. I hate to say it, but even the creme brulee at Yardhouse is better!"}
{"text":"Prettiness - 5 stars  Price - 3 stars (like everything else in Vegas, OVER PRICED) Taste - 3 stars (these desserts are for look not taste for sure!) Coffee - 4 stars (expensive, but better than any \"hotel\" coffee) Sandwich - 4 stars (good, but over price; can get same quality at Panera or Corner) Environment - 5 stars (relaxing, clean)   They also have one over a Bellagio, which has the world's largest chocolate fountain.  That one; however, is always extremely crowded, and very difficult to find seats.  So, you'll have a better chance finding a seat here than over there."}
{"text":"So many yummy goodies here! Gelato, chocolates, baked goods, salads and sandwiches. We wanted to grab a sandwich to take with us on our flight home so we stopped here on the way out. Unfortunately they seem to make all their sandwiches at the beginning of the day so unless you ordered something in advance you are just stuck with whatever they have. Our flight was in the evening so it was slim pickings by then but we were still able to find a couple sandwiches that sounded good. Saved us from eating airport food!"}
{"text":"Jean Philippe, je t'aime!  Je rêve de vous!  No, I don't speak French.  However, after a visit to Jean Philippe and 5000 calories later, I feel like moving to France (well, actually, The Bellagio in Vegas) just so I can wear my chiffon dress and eat creme brûlée and croissant everyday.  Jean Philippe Maury is a world renowned pastry chef for a reason.  His creations are the finest in the world.  From the looks on the outside to the heavenly taste on the inside, everything was perfection.  This is the closest to perfection I'll ever find."}
{"text":"I have not had anything that I have been disappointed with yet other than their blueberry cupcake that although delicious, tastes nothing like blueberries. I've tried the raspberry jelly donut that is light and airy with loads of tart purée raspberries in the middle. The key lime pie is not that tart and has small diced peaches or apricot at the bottom of it. Their almond croissant is mind blowing. Their crapes are just \"ok\" in my opinion. Their spinach quiche is the best I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Expensive delicacies are served here.  Honestly though, (for the price) I felt the products should be better.  The presentation of the desserts was fabulous.  Unfortunately, they looked better than they tasted.  A-Ok best describes what we've gotten here.  On the positive side, the Chocolate Fountain is very cool!  It is worth coming here just to check it out.  I would have to give this masterpiece 5 stars.  Also, my niece absolutely loves the place.  She says that the crepes are the very best that she has ever tried.  I would have to disagree.  So, although, she would give them 5 stars overall.  I'm writing the review so only 3 stars from me.  Will I continue to return here?  Yes, because it's always cool to see the largest Chocolate Fountain in the world.  As for the bakery items....Hmm...one of these days I'll probably try something that simply \"Wows\" me.  Until that time, only 3 stars."}
{"text":"The dessert here was out of this world! I ordered the rose macaroon and it was so good that every time I took a bite, it was like I forgot how good it was and was impressed all over again. I also bought the marshmallows to take home. I had food allergies and this was the first time I've seen marshmallows without corn syrup -- they were so light, airy, heavenly, and unlike any \"marshmallow\" I remember having 10+ years ago. My friend got the chocolate gelato, which was also amazing. On top of this, the service was stellar and the store had beautiful displays. I wish they would open a location in NYC!"}
{"text":"The desserts are out of this world and they have excellent customer service! I placed a large order after visiting in person. There was a shipping problem but Jean Philippe Patisserie responded immediately and rectified the problem. I highly recommend this place when you visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place in Las Vegas. It's a have to visit in my opinion, the coffee and pastries are to die for. It's not cheap, but a real indulgence!"}
{"text":"I never heard of jean philippe until my husband mentioned that it would be one of our stops when we visit vegas on a business trip. couple of days later, my husband surprised me by ordering few samples online from Aria resort.....it was mostly chocolates. I am sorry to say, that i am disappointed.  the chocolate were missing a lot of flavors, they were bland in my opinion. I tasted better."}
{"text":"I came for the coffee and stayed for the crêpes. The bakery items looked tasty but sugary, and I needed something healthy on this particular morning. The coffee was OK and the crepes were light, fresh, and a welcome change from many of Sin City's unhealthy food choices.  There was a long line while waiting to order, then another wait for my crêpe. Although I'm happy to have fresh made to order food, everyone was waiting to pay for pre-baked items except me. The engineer in me was slightly frustrated with the inability to start the crêpe or cappuccino while I waited in line, but I was also fascinated with the massive real chocolate fountain while I waited.  Although most prices were comparable to other cafe and bakery prices, the gift prices for items displayed throughout the periphery of the long line were sky high."}
{"text":"The pastries look/taste delicious! However, the crepes are average. The service was terrible! They rush you through the lines, don't have the answers to basic questions..\"what flavor gelato do you have?\" If they wouldn't have rushed me through the line I would have been able to see for myself. Prices are reasonable, I paid $25 for a crepe, iced coffee, pastry and gelato. Two starts because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Great gelato. Macron shell is in perfect consistency. Fillings are delicious and fresh. Need to improve service though."}
{"text":"I've only had two things from here.  They have an assortment of little desserts you can purchase and I've had the raspberry tart and the chocolate intense.  They were both amazing.  Pricey for their size yes, but I did not mind it once I took a bite of each and accepted that I was indulging on some very good sweets.  If you like amazing desserts, splurge a little to go here and try one (or two!) of them!"}
{"text":"We walked upon this bakery while walking through the Aria casino. They had made sculptures of cakes of chocolate that were zombie heads and full body sculptures that were located close to the bakery. So awesome!! We were so impressed that we assumed the baked goods and confectionaries would be as good. They were decorated very nicely but the taste was somewhat off for me. They were ok, not what we had built in our heads after seeing the amazing sculptures. It also took some time to get our order even though to order it is set up cafeteria style. Furthermore, the seating in the bar area is a little cramped and quickly filled with two to three people. To be honest, the best thing we got here was the coffee. I will come check out what they create next, but probably not eat anything the next time I visit."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back to the room for a little late night munchies.  I got the ice cream, it looked better than it tasted."}
