{"text":"Nice  bartenders and servers, great for after work drinks and snacks, to unwind with friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I stopped in for their Halloween looking for something to eat. I asked the bartender what he recommends and he said the blacken chicken Mac and cheese was really good. I usually get their pizza, but this time I wanted to try something different. The Mac and cheese was amazing! Bell peppers, bacon, mushrooms, and shell pasta all topped with chicken breast. Simply delicious! This is definitely not your typical bar with typical bar food."}
{"text":"They have the best gaming promotions. Their last gaming party included FREE Prime Rib it was so good. I wouldn't game anywhere else.  I go there to Watch all the games on the weekend! They always take care of me! They save my spot when I call ahead no matter how busy it is.... Ima the server always remembers me and what I order. I don't even have to to tell her.  They have $10 beer buckets, comfy place to seat and watch games with your crew, ALL YOU CAN DRINK Bloody Mary Special only $11 AND I had the Waffle and Berries during breakfast happy 50% OFF. Yummy. The daily Happy Hour is cool too. The $5 sliders yum."}
{"text":"Great breakfast special. Katie is super friendly and a great bartender. Clean environment. Been here before and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunched at  BJ's today with colleagues. We were all in the mood for breakfast. Our server, Vanessa, was absolutely terrific. I ordered a dry spinach egg white omelette with a little feta and it was one of the best I've had in Vegas. Just had a great spice on it. I asked for avocado on the side instead of potatoes and toast and they accommodated me. No brewed iced tea w/free refills - just bottled tea, which was a negative for one of my lunch-mates.  My other colleague loved the steak and eggs -- a great deal at about $5! Dinner/lunch/happy hour menus all look great too.  Seemed a bit smoky the first time I was there, but it was fine at lunch-time today. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and try the salmon entree.They also have happy hour and late night food deals."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local.  It is walking distance from the MGM Grand.  The exterior is not representative of the interior:  granite counters, new bar stools, a lounge area, two nice pool tables with enough room to play.  The bartenders we had were HOT.  The drink prices blow the shit off of the casino (assuming you aren't getting comped drinks for gambling)."}
{"text":"Wow. Went in there for lunch today and it was awful.   Service was SLOW and food was cold !  Had to beg for a check.  They separated the check between the food and drink so I had to run my credit card twice.   When they brought my food out, another customer grabbed some fries off my plate as the waitress was walking out. They just replaced the fries and not the entire order. This made my food cold while the fries were hot. AWEFUL !!!  Then the same guy that touched my food was so drunk he slipped and busted his chin on the bar that required the police, fire and medics to come help him out.   #1) The bartender should not have given the other customer so much to drink.  #2) Once another customer touches my food while she is walking to me - the entire order needs to be redone.  #3) Service was slow and the bartender was giving away free drinks.  #4) Don't give me two checks to get a bigger tip on a single meal. That has never happened before.  Someone needs to clean house over there - it was a disaster today."}
{"text":"I'm actually a new employee, and I have worked in several bars and restaurants in Las Vegas from nightclubs to fine dining. I am impressed with how clean the bar and kitchen are. So far, I have sampled a few of the menu items and must recommend the quesadillas and the buffalo wings. These two items are my favorite so far.  All of my coworkers that I have met so far seems to have great drink knowledge and fantastic personalities. Don't take my word for it ,  come on by  and I'll let you peek in the kitchen  and I'll introduce you to some of the bar staff.  My name is John, I work graveyards. Don't be shy, come in and get to know me. I'll make an effort to remember your name face and what you like to drink. Don't forget happy hour late at night is from 12 a.m. to 2 a.m.   I haven't seen anybody hit a royal flush yet but it's only my first week, I am ready to fill out a taxable form for you.  :)"}
{"text":"I have to start out that this is one of my favorite bars..  I am just sick of all the other places I go and there is crappy bar food.  Its all greasy and tastes the same.    The food at BJs always tastes great and they are always changing up there menu.  I never have a dish here that looks like all grease.  The drinks are always great and I love the staff.  If you are looking for a great local place look know further."}
{"text":"Sunday bruch is AWESOME! All you can drink minosa or bloody marry! Yum."}
{"text":"The women are hot, I agree but they suck as bartenders. The service is just mediocre. This place is tucked away in a small office mall by the freeway. A little hard to locate sometimes. The food was OK. It is a typical local bar that caters to the local gambler. Very dark inside."}
{"text":"My experience at BJ's has been nothing but satisfying. Not only is the food perfectly cooked, I didn't have to wait long for it to be served. My waitress was awfully kind and brought up the whole table's mood with her high spirit. I will definitely be coming to this restaurant more for the amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek pizza. Service was slow but good! It was BCS national championship so it was a bit busy. Besides the chain smokers next to us and lack of ventilation it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"BJs is a cool place.  Has a very upscale loungy feel to it.  Great group area with leather seats and coffee tables to sit with friends or colleagues while enjoying a few cocktails.  The food is fantastic.  They get some of the best salmon around.  Always pleased with quality and portions.  Bartenders are awesome at this location.  Not only are they scantily clad and easy on the eyes, they actually have great personalities and sense of humor.  They remember regulars and provide exemplary service."}
{"text":"Friendly.  Good place for to go food - maybe not a good place to put your money in a machine.  Ordered margarita pizza - yummy ... a little bothersome that there were people doing a fitness boot camp in the parking lot, while I carried my pizza and wings out."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings and on Thursday for football special they have a prime rib dinner that is incredible . The service and general manager chris are all very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"BJ's is a great place to stop in and enjoy an afternoon beer, lunch, or beer/cocktail with lunch.  There seems to be a local crowd but BJ's is fair with attention to all patrons.  My memory escapes me when I first visited with a buddy.  However, I remember the service was friendly and the food was tasty.  On my most recent visit, I did not dine but still found the service to friendly and more then capable of handling the lunch/afternoon rush."}
{"text":"I love how close it is to my house. And they always have all the NFL games on. And they can put the ones you want if you ask. Great bar food. And CUTE cocktail waitresses. Please come here. Dont miss out"}
{"text":"Ok, I normally wouldn't give a bar 5 stars if I didn't get a drink but the salad, wedge that is - and the service were excellent. She had just started and I think she said her name was Lisa or Lindsay or something close to that. The salad had all sorts of flavor. I'd drive back over here for that on a regular basis. I just might."}
{"text":"Holy OMG!  After coming here 6 times in the last 6 months for the amazing nachos, I met Matt! I mentioned that I come here specifically for the nachos because they are fantastic. I mentioned I was considering straying and he  (with amazing enthusiasm) \"introduced\" me to the rest of the menu! Wow! So impressed with his appreciation for the kitchen and their amazing creations. He recommended the Cajun Mac and cheese... It was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life! The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection and the sauce was made home made. This is not your typical bar food people!"}
{"text":"Great food, great bartender, just an awesome place. Chill atmosphere where you can relax and enjoy. A must in Vegas for locals."}
{"text":"Nice friendly little neighbor hood bar. Probably because it's in a friend's neighbor hood, and it's a bar, and i lied about it being little.   If i still lived in this side of town i could see myself coming here a lot more often for late night eats and maybe a drink or two. If only some geeks took over this bar and system linked a few PS3s or Xboxes to take advantage of their mounted TVs and couches they have on the right side of the bar the place would be absolutely perfect.  They have two happy hours going on. For those times please take a momen to take a look at someone else's review cause i dont really remember what times. Just know the early one ends at 7pm and the late one starts at 11pm.  Overall the food is pretty good. A serious step up above normal bar/cocktail lounge kitchens."}
{"text":"Awesome bar food cute bartenders this is a great place to go to grab a drink or get some food after work or on the weekend. The happy hour specials are awesome I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Why I haven't been here before?  Came here with a drunk friend, yes, I had to babysit. It was a Sunday night and three of my roomies were fiending for alcohol. Sad. Came here, it wasn't very busy but busy enough to keep the server and the bartender going. Yeah, there were only two of them.  Ordered one beer, a Stella. Tastes like any other Stella out there. Service was good. Ayumi? Aime? Aira? Whatever the server's name was, she was great. I felt sorry for her cause my roomie kinda gave her a hard time.  Other than that, the decor is nice. Very nice. It's like a lodge/tavern with \"bar scene\" paintings. It was kinda smoky cause there was a guy next to us heavily smoking a cigar.   Would come back here to try out the happy hour which is from 11 pm to 3 am. Oh yeah, if you're a chick you get 25% off during non-happy hours."}
{"text":"Great place to come for one or two drinks.  The staff is friendly, the drinks are poured great and the ambiance is pretty good.  A few times I have a gone there is one awkward guy there trying to get in the bartender's pants, but he's not a nuisance to anyone besides the bartender.  Typically, the bartenders are nice about blowing the guy off and its a nice added humor to go along with the alcohol.  There is also Golden Tee and the gambling machines at the bar.  All in all, great place to hang with a few friends and grab a drink to relax and destress."}
{"text":"I've never been to a gaming bar that does not comp drinks for playing. I know the standard rules for gaming to be $20 per drink 5 quarter minimum, per bet. I play black jack on dollars and bet up to 20 dollars a hand and I get a tab every time for literally everything. The best discount I've ever gotten was going 100ft to Wahoos fish tacos across the street. It's a ghost town in BJ's it seems all the time."}
{"text":"CARLO is GREATEST bartender! Came to meet some friends late night and Carlo was super friendly and took good care of our crew!"}
{"text":"I use to look forward to coming here with my coworkers.  After the last couple visits, especially this morning, we have decided to switch bars.  When we first started going almost 2 years ago the service was amazing, now it's a joke.  Every time we order the bartender has to ask what we ordered again...when only 2 people ordered.  Ask for my tab and the bartender won't give me the check, just tells me an amount.  Then when he ran my card it was for a different amount.  When I was ordering Johnnie black he asked if I wanted blue instead, I said no, and his reply was to say it must be too steep for me.  When did bartenders start insulting customers.  Then throw in the female night bartender sitting there ignoring us, when she does talk to us it's about how she use to do meth.  I'm also amazed that when they run out of a liquor they can't restock it because they don't have access, what bar doesn't let their bartenders restock?  They're always out of tapped beers, I assume for the same reason.  What use to be a great way to end the work week has turned to be us walking through the door with disappointment because we know it's going to be shit service and no selection.  Last year they didn't run credit cards for a month and then back charged them all at once.  A couple weeks ago they stopped accepting credit for tabs less then $10.  It's one thing after another and now we are over it.  Having worked in the bar industry for 10 years I'm amazed this place stays open, they must do good on the video poker because it definitely isn't based on their bar business and customer service. On to Scooters, maybe PT's."}
{"text":"They have amazing food! I had gone with my family when we drove up to Vegas for a few days. I had the chicken flautas and they were AMAZING! I also got to try small pieces from the other dishes and they were also very tasty."}
{"text":"My recent bar of choice lately. Its on the way home from work.  Close to the house.  Pretty bartenders. Great happy hour specials. Pretty bartenders. Good food. Oh and pretty bartenders"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place. I came here for my 1 year anniversary with my love. This girl ( i rephrased the actual thought) said They couldn't change the channel for me to watch ANYTHING but spots.  I'm pretty sure it's call Bjs cocktail lounge not BJ'S spots bar. Wtf . We came here everytime we had free time. The guy that used to be here when we came doesn't seen to be here anymore now they have a bunch of little girls working here,questionable if they are even old enough. . But any way I don't think I'll be back laterrrrrr"}
{"text":"New Seahawks bar! Good beer/food specials for all fb games.  Chris is the GM he takes a real \"owners\" approach and is sure everyone is having a great time."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and happy hour specials.  You can get breakfast happy hour 1/2 off before 10am and they have weekday specials for Monday Night Football and Thursday Night.  The food is very decent but I enjoy the service.  Their couches and setup is extremely comfortable.  If you're a die hard NFL fan that wants to see all the games, you may want to go to Buffalo Wild Wings.   I like to come here for Monday or Thursday night games for the happy hour and for the service and relaxed atmosphere.  I'd rate 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for a divey type bar. Kobe sliders are a must. Bartenders and servers are great and definitely more of a local feel then a lot of bars near the strip. The night I went it was an older crowd 40 somethings- it reminded me of a bar I used to go to in Denver. Complete w/ pool tables and an old guy in plaid shirt trying to pick a fight with a guy in our group."}
{"text":"lately I've only been going for lunch.  gone are the late night drink fests in days past.  I must say, as the girls have come and gone, what has been a constant is the food.  some of the best bar food I've had in town.    the menu items I have found to be just out of the park homeruns are the salmon tacos, prime rib sliders, and prime rib dip.  first time I went in for lunch was during the USA v Germany world cup match.  this place was packed with just 1 waitress, Megan.  let me tell you, this woman handled the entire room.  she was running around the place taking orders, dropping off food, refilling drinks, everything.  she never missed a beat.  I've seen waitresses do way less with 1/10 the crowd.  very good service.  the last few times I've been in for lunch it isn't busy.  but the service is always excellent.  Megan is top notch.  with the nice you get a little bit of sassy, in a good way.    there are several beers on tap including guiness, blue moon, and shock top.  typical local bar with about 20 video poker machines all around the square bar.  there are also plush seats with big screen tv's in front of them on one side of the bar.  perfect for watching your favorite game.    soon as you walk in you'll get a hello and a smile.  makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Went for a bite and some beer.  Tried the gyros which were the best I've had in Vegas and I love gyros.  I would go back just for this delicious dish... And as always the beer is cold and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"So this place is just down the street from my studio so it's certainly convenient to run off to for a quick bite or to satisfy that sudden craving for a Tanqueray and Tonic at three in the afternoon but... the smoking gets to me.  I do like the food - it's pretty tasty considering it's bar food and they have quite a selection for a great price.  I guess I will rewrite the review when they finally nix the smoke."}
{"text":"In our search of a nearby bar with a good happy hour, Yelp led us to BJ's Cocktail Lounge.  Not to be confused with the restaurant, this BJ's is a small sports bar and grill tucked away on the west side. We came in for the happy hour a few days ago and were pleasantly surprised. There a nice list of $5 food specials: spinach dip, sliders, wings and more. The gyro sliders were pretty unique and delicious, and the spinach dip was a sizable portion.  For HH the drinks were half off, my three draft blue moons only came out to about $7 which is a great deal. Unfortunately they really need to update their draft selection. BJ's only has a handful of beers on tap and most of them are domestics, no crafts or seasonals =(.  Service was great. The ladies at the bar were attentive and on point with their recommendations. The lounge area over to the side is great for large parties that just want to kick back and hang out. Plenty of TV's everywhere making it a perfect spot to catch the game. Overall I'm glad to have found a great alternative to Sierra Gold."}
{"text":"My last review was for a BJ's at an alternate location. Stopped here to have a Friday cocktail before my hair appointment next door. I can honestly say, that after going to two separate locations that this one is probably worse than the last not even worthy of pictures and, it is truly the Wal-Mart of chain bars.  In closing, I would just like to comment on the fact that one of the waitresses has a lipgloss pressed between her extremely augmented breasts  Not that I have anything against augmentation. However, it's tacky as fuck. And I grew up here, so I f****** know tacky."}
{"text":"Katie is awesome! The best bloody Mary's and finest ass in town..... I'll be back over and over again"}
{"text":"Great time meeting up with friends, Beer was flowing and Jager in big glasses.  Amber and Rachael were great and my wife said they were very friendly.  She suggested we go back.  I love my wife and she won."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing! I heard great reviews and I always wondered what was inside so a friend and I came here to check it out. We happened to come in during their happy hour which started at 11pm.  The service is awesome, the atmosphere is perfect to have a conversation between friends, and the decor is pretty classy. If you are a red wine fine, I tried their pinot noir and I instantly loved it."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas Iowa Club met at BJ's every Saturday for Hawkeye football and we couldn't have been happier!  Vasili and staff were absolutely incredible every single week without fail. Great, comfortable atmosphere and the friendliest staff around, and AMAZING food as well!  Definitely way above your average bar food!  (Including the breaded pork tenderloin sandwich that they made specially for us!)  I highly recommend BJ's for sports watching, dining, or just having some drinks. You'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had to take a minute and post my review on every location because me and hubby have been too them all depending on where we are when we're craving them . (Yes we love these spots that much! :)) Ok so you would never guess it but they have some delicious ahi poke!!! Comes on a bed of greens it's so fresh and delicious !!! Best place to go for late night happy hour . Classy decor and cheap drinks nice combo. Never had a bad bartender! Me and hubby are night owls and they always take care of all our needs! Nice lil lounge been too many times to count. Get there !!!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much Ashley great bartender. We came for the Thursday prime rib dinner special awesome it was really good and has price happy hour drinks"}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by and I'm glad we did. The bartenders and waitress were super friendly and the food was amazing. It is refreshing to go to a Vegas bar and not deal with attitude. Bartender Hugo told us the food was great and he sure was right. We had mild grilled wings and a fried veggie appetizer. I signed up for a card that gives 25% off all the time for girls. They also have food and drink specials for happy hour from 3-7 and again at 11 pm. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A bit smoky, even though there were no smokers while I was here. Place is on the dark, drinking bar, side. Plenty of screens for the big game on Thursday nights and Sundays via DirectTV. The place was light on customers, only 4 other people here at 1:30 p.m.   I ordered the BJ's BLT with a fried egg. And a side salad. Spring greens with a side of balsamic dressing.   Overall very tasty. Great bartender and service!   They also offer free wifi!"}
{"text":"The flautas are amazing. The salads are fresh and delicious. The French fries are the best in town. On their catering order make sure to get the chicken skewers if you're catering for a party"}
{"text":"I've been going to this BJs Cocktail Lounge since about May 2013. I've been going there at least once a week since then (sometimes up to four times a week).   First of all, the wait and bar staff is extremely friendly and personable. I really like going there because of this. They will definitely remember your name if you frequent this place enough (of course, I'm sure they're paid to do so). Nevertheless, they seem very genuine about it and I always feel very comfortable going there.  For a bar that is themed like many others in Las Vegas (fairly dark, video poker machines, many televisions, some times very smokey) BJ's doesn't have a dive feel at all. It definitely is very clean, new and nicely decorated and I consider it much more upscale than par for Las Vegas.  A friend of mine and I frequent BJ's for lunch and happy hour. They have deals for both times. At lunch, they have a $10 lunch menu that's actually, for the most part, worth the $10. I've had pretty much all of the burgers offered on the lunch menu (they're generally always cooked to preference). All have been good. The BBQ bacon burger is very good - thick patty, cooked to order and the bacon does not disappoint. The personal pizzas are also very good as well and more than enough for one person to eat. The only time I was not pleasantly surprised with my meal was with the mushroom burger. The mushrooms tasted a little too \"wild\" for me and under-cooked. However, this could be that I just don't like mushrooms that much since I rarely eat them. I guess you learn something everyday.  My favorite item on the menu is the Prime Rib Dip sandwich. This is offered on the $10 lunch menu. It's a very sizable sandwich with juicy roast beef on a baguette roll smothered in onions and Swiss cheese. Additionally, it comes with a cappuccino cup full of Au jus, an excellent garlic horseradish sauce, freshly cooked potato chips and is really quite amazing.  The happy hour BJ's offers is also extremely good. All drinks are half price from 4pm to 7pm. They also offer a decent assortment of $5 appetizers. A Dogfish Head IPA will run you only $3 at happy hour (opposed to 6-8 bucks at the few local places that actually have it). A Coors Light (or equivalent) will run you under a $1.50. I've really only eaten the chicken wings at happy hour, but they are pretty good as well. They're not breaded or fried, but grilled and slightly charred (different but a nice departure from basics).  All in all, I would probably give BJs 5 stars, but I'm still reserving that for a place that I would deem \"perfect\". However, I don't think I've been to any place like that yet."}
{"text":"Best chicken flautas ever. Love this place. Good drinks and food! Convenient location and quiet plaza. Lots of parking"}
{"text":"A nice place for drinks and food in a relaxed atmosphere. The lounge is dark with many comfortable nooks for privacy and a modern style to the decor with big comfortable sofas and smoking chairs where you can sit for hours. There are TVs are everywhere so you don't miss any action but its hard to pay attention when you have lovely waitresses attending to your needs. The food was delicious like the pesto chicken pizza, bruschetta and chicken wings. To sum it up BJ's is like a gentleman's club without the \"entertainers\" and brass poles that serves excellent food."}
{"text":"It was dead in here when we came to watch some college basketball. The service was good *they didn't have any other customers hello* and they did turn on our game with sound. The food quality is very good - I ordered ahi tuna and my boyfriend got the gyro with sweet potato fries. The ahi was lightly seared and very fresh, and was a nice presentation. They had decent red wine as well. The only thing we didn't like was when we got the bill - I was playing video blackjack the entire time and I was playing more than $20 but this place won't tell you that they don't comp your drinks. I rarely play so I don't know the rules about comping but I swear I have been to numerous places in Vegas that will comp you as long as you are playing $20 and a dollar a hand. Ah well. It was an expensive bar tab learning experience but overall it was OK."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the BJ's Cocktail Lounge on South Decatur. This one? Not as much.  The positive is that they do serve the same Thursday prime rib dinner for $6.99. They also have half price or two-for-one drinks during 4-7pm happy hour (all I know is that I had two 60-minute IPAs for $6). The prime rib was decent--great for the price anyway.  The negative is that our server wasn't quite there. She took a long time to come around, which wasn't so bad since we were watching the game. But she brought out our dinners without any silverware and when she brought my second Dogfish Head, it magically turned into a Miller Lite. In both situations, we just bypassed her i.e. we grabbed our own silverware from another table and I just went to the bar to get my beer replaced.  Overall, an A-OK experience. Nice big place to watch the game with solid food and drink specials."}
{"text":"I went back a couple of weeks ago. The food & menu have taken a major hit. Their food is just average now. On the good side, all their service staff, including the cook, were very nice & friendly. I guess, my new go to late night bar is Edge of Town. BJ's is still a good locals bar with food, it's just far from my house."}
{"text":"Service was slow and impersonal even though the bar was mostly empty when we arrived. Half of the beers on tap were unavailable. We did not try the food, but I suspect it would not be much better.   Bar and lounge was clean and well lit. Extra star for the fire pit in the back.   I have been to other BJ's locations where the service and selection was MUCH better."}
{"text":"Over the past few weeks this has become my neighborhood bar.  Probably because it's in my neighborhood, and is also a bar.  And, the employees remember who I am!  Sure, they all call me \"Mr. Manhattan\" because I order that drink most often, but still.  They recognize me!  Happy Hour occurs on weekdays from 4pm-7pm, making it the perfect after-work pitstop.  Long day at work?  No worries, BJ's has 50% off drinks and $5 appetizers to keep you going.  I've had their Tempura Calamari and one of their chicken sandwiches, and both have been tasty.  A step above average bar food.  Be sure to try their herb-infused fries, they're an addicting side to have while enjoying a few drinks.  The decor, staff, food, and friendly atmosphere have kept this spot in regular rotation for me recently, and I don't see that changing any time soon.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Of course the girls are nice to look at...... But it dosent stop there.  All around great service,drinks and food. Always have a goodtime.Great food deals after 12am. Thanks girls."}
{"text":"After asking a local for a cool place to hang out at i was directed to BJ's. I told the wife and off we went. The suggestion was great and right on the money. The chicks were hot and sexy. All were wearing lingerie and very friendly. the drinks were made well and food is good. If you ever have the chance to check this place out while in Vegas it is a must. Heck who doesn't want to look at beautiful woman while they eat food or have a drink."}
{"text":"BJs is a nice place to hang out, eat, and drink. I have gone there many times with large groups and they are very accommodating and even gave us a free bottle of wine and a round of shots. They have flat screen TVs everywhere and the food & drinks are great. My personal favorites are the potato skins and the pear martini."}
{"text":"I came in tonight... Steve and Sadie were working. The service was incredible. The food was good, the drinks were even better.   The location is out of the way, but so catered to locals. Thanks for a great night!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to go somewhere that does not look and feel like a sports bar, then you may want to try here. I absolutely love the atmosphere in this place. It's dark and loungey with music playing at a generous volume.  The service and staff has always been very friendly and although I have not eaten here very often, the food I have tried was good. They also have specials going on during the late hours.  This is my favorite place to go if I want to tune out for a while with a few beers and some video poker."}
{"text":"My beer had sat empty for 10 min. Customer service used to be outstanding. Steve was the best. Time for a new bar. Good while it lasted. Food not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Cute place. Mostly locals and not tourists as off the strip. Girls where very little clothes lol. Free drinks when sitting at the bar playing videos machines. Very tasty chicken appetizer. Medium sauce was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Woot! Woot!   The woman here are HOT and serving you good food and great drinks while wearing lingerie.......................what more can you ask for???   The only thing was at the time we were there I smoked and they  basically said I had to smoke at my own risk because there is food served and they have a \"No Smoking\" policy where food is being served but now that I don't smoke its all good, my hubby and I will definitely go back and check this place out again and again our next trip to Vegas baby!!!"}
{"text":"This is our new neighborhood bar/grill. The nighttime staff is WONDERFUL!!! After only one visit we were greeted by name on our 2nd visit!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean local bar. A little hidden but worth it! Katie is an awesome bartender! The food is good and extremely well priced!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the food is not the best for some reason at this location. The other location behind MGM there food is really good. But the service is always really good and the drink specials for happy hour is half price everything, if you can drink it its half price. The deals are pretty damn good. But this review for the food is only this location but like I said behind MGM the food is good there."}
{"text":"great place to watch almost any game & the friendliest & hottest bar staff....I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The bartenders and waitresses are always great here. Meagan is my favorite, she is so nice! Don't misjudge her, just because she looks like a prima donna, she's not, super down to earth cool woman. The menu is a more refined version of a bar menu. I am always happy with my food. They have a great chef back there for sure. I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because I get the feeling that the owners of the place don't actually care about it. Its always empty or near empty in there. Staff turn around is pretty high, and why don't they advertise, anything , ever, anywhere? If I didn't happen to be in that area for other things I would have never known that it was there."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty awesome ..... The bartender Andi (some hot Italian broad) looks full of herself but she's not and she's hot AF!!! Pretty sure she's the best bartender that's ever served me. But I am a hater and I'll say she's \"OKAY\" ;) I'll def end up in AA now, thank you Andi.                                       sincerely,                                      The Hater"}
{"text":"This was my reaction when I walked in yesterday and found out that Amy had quit. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6Bes4Ja9v-V4abG_lH53ag&userid=JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg  Without Amy this place just isn't the same. I don't think I'm gonna go outta my way to come here anymore. It's pretty far from my house, and it's become a f*cking sausagefest of horrific proportions. Aaron K and I used to come here about once a week to perform our weekly womanizing, but that just ain't possible anymore. In the words of a NW Vegas local: \"I am a frustration and dissapoint\".   Bobby is still the coolest guy in Las Vegas. My advice for all you guys is to come after midnight when Bobby is working. He is the kitchen manager, and he makes sure the food tastes excellent. The burgers here are way better than Steak & Shake or Stripburger. Don't get me wrong, I love Steak & Shake, but somehow Bobby's burgers are light years ahead of them. Also, like I mentioned in my previous review, Bobby knows everything! He is like the real life Dr. Manhattan, I mean he can see into  the future and stuff. You can literally ask him about anything and he will know the answer.   I bet a lot of my Yelp friends and followers are wondering: \"Why is RP hanging out at a bar? I thought he was straight edge.\" Well, I don't drink here, I just come for the food. And believe me, the food on graveyard is way better than any 24 hour coffee shop at a Casino.   Now, if Bobby quits I am gonna give this place a 1-star review."}
