{"text":"Came here for lunch today, it was pretty good and the cost was $7.05 taxes in for a small chicken shawarma plate. It was more than enough food and you get a choice of pop or soup and I got the lentil soup. 

It was clean inside and the lady who was serving was very sweet."}
{"text":"Tasty, generous helpings, and very cheap. The first time I got the small shawarma dinner I was ready to argue with the lady when it came time to pay because no way was that the $6 meal I ordered but my god it was. They could EASILY charge $10 for that plate of beautifully assembled incredibly delicious food. The staff are a very sweet Syrian family and the service is quick and I'm just so happy we have such a great middle eastern restaurant in Greektown."}
{"text":"$7.05 (tax-in) for a small chicken shawarma platter that comes with your choice of soup or drink? I'm in!

Fresh food, chicken shawarma was well seasoned and cut right off the spit! Their housemade white garlic sauce is to die for! Their lentil soup is simple and light. Very tasty and heart warming. I love how the salad is comprised of mixed greens rather than generic iceberg lettuce at most shawarma spots. Service is friendly and they even bring your meal to you! 

2 big screen TV's playing CP24 so you can watch the news during lunch/dinner. Lol.

If this place does not offer you bang for your buck, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are big fans of Middle Eastern food and have tried many falafel places in Toronto over the years. We are thrilled that we can now get excellent falafel in our Pape Village neighbourhood thanks to Shawarma Frenzy!

The falafel was freshly fried and crispy on the outside - perfect! The salad was fresh and the rice and sides were tasty. 

We highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The large shawarma platters are large. I came with friends and we had large shawarma platters and a couple of sides and it was a bit much even though we were hungry. But it was a good mix of food so you could get the large without sides and annoy it that way.

The fries were nice with a little herb/spice powder on them. The falafels took time because they were cooked fresh for us and were very tasty. 

Enjoyed the food, will come back."}
{"text":"I was actually going to Mr.Pide. Luckily, there was construction there and I accidentally found shawarma frenzy.

This place has the best shawarma in GTA.
The shawarma had such a distinct taste.

Best shawarma in GTA.

I wish they had a location in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Any lunch that leaves me satisfied under $8... you will probably get a 5 star rating.

The shwarma plate had lots of vegetables, from the fresh salad and pickled sides. The rice was flavorful, the meat and sauces on top, to die for!

It gets busy around lunch time during the work week (I've been twice), so be prepared to wait a bit for your meal.

If you are north of the Pape and Danforth area and looking for shwarma, this is the spot, just go."}
{"text":"We grew up eating Asian food, but enjoy all different kinds of cuisine.  We found Sharwarma Frenzy on Yelp.  Lucky for us, we live close by.  The chicken shawarma is delicious, service is friendly, restaurant is very clean, and prices very good.  Portions are generous.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly owner. Fresh and crisp lettuce and other veggies. Flavorful and moist meat. Right amount of sauce. He toasted the wrap which really made it tastes so much better. One chicken wrap was more than enough food for me. Spacious dining area with napkins available for each table. Accept credit card as well. No complaints about this place!"}
{"text":"$7 tax in for a Chicken shawarma platter and lentil soup? Wow!

The salad is amazing.  Mixed with all type of veggies and very healthy.  After finishing the meal I did not feel heavy or bloated.

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma place in town. The people who work there are very friendly, the restaurant is clean and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"The sign above the entrance of this restaurant features a flaming googly-eyed shawarma.  Not sure how this is supposed to be appetizing, but it caught our attention nevertheless.  The house salad, which comes with both the falafel and chicken shawarma platters, is a lightly dressed blend of baby greens, shredded cabbage, onions, cucumbers, red peppers and tomatoes -- nice deep red tomatoes rather than the pale, mealy ones you often get in the typical house salad.  The mains, which are prepared to order, come with a generous heap of bright yellow rice pilaf and dollops of other sides.  The falafel were flavourful and nicely crunchy on the outside and tender inside.  Everything seemed to have been made with care.  Most customers seem to come to this place for takeout, but if you dine in, you just might experience the gloriously surreal combination of UFC on the big screen TV and the strains of beloved Egyptian music diva Umm Kulthum playing on the stereo.  Friendly staff and good value.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food at low price. I got frenzy fries, chicken shwarma and a chicken plate. The shwarma and chicken plate came with 2 lentil soups. Everything was less than $20 after tax

Shwarma was great, packed with meat and ample toppings. Frenzy fries is a must try, its a wrap with freshly fried fries, coleslaw and very saucy. 

Chicken plate had 2 sizes. Small is plenty for 1 person. 

The lady making the food. Took her time and made sure she assembled the toppings perfectly and evenly. She was very pleasant and took her time to explain everything on the menu to me. 

Overall 5 stars! Great people, great food, low price. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious! Generous portions, fresh ingredients, and just right by my home. A small shawarma platter runs you $7 tax in including salad, rice, meat and a soup."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Shawarma Frenzy, and she absolutely needed me to check them out - she literally asked if I had been on a weekly basis. So finally, on a Sunday afternoon, I decided to give them a shot. 

When I walked in around 1pm, the restaurant was completely empty and the staff were in the back. Within a minute one of the owners came out and asked me for my order. I asked her what each size looked like because I have found that not all small and large plates look alike. When she showed me the size of the small (looked like a medium to large to me), that's the size I went with. I also ordered a side of falafel. Each meal came with the choice of a drink or soup, and since I had heard great things about their soup, I just had to try it. 

The Good:

Ingredients are fresh
Care is taken into plating and quality
Very reasonable prices 
Great portions
Tasty food
Friendly service
BEST SOUP EVER! 

The soup was so delicious that I ordered one to go - large container for $1.99.

 The Not So Good:

The soup was so flavourful and layered with flavors, the falafels not so much. I offered some to a friend that loves falafels and she did not care for them either. 

The shawarma plate was tasty, but not memorable. It needed a kick of flavor. After the soup, everything else simply did not meet expectations. 

The takeout container was flimsy, so my soup leaked all over the bag even though I held it upright the entire time. By the time I got home, half the soup was at the bottom of the bag. 

Even though I asked for no onions (hate them!), I ended up finding some in the dish. 

All in all, this family owned restaurant offers tasty food at very reasonable prices, and you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday on a whim, around 3 pm the lady who was working was friendly and the place was clean.  I was originally thinking of getting a french fries but then I asked her about the frenzy fries , they are a fries and a sort of coleslaw with various sauces wrapped in a pita. 
It was tasty! Only thing I personally think it could have used is some veggies however it waas very filling and only $4.
I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here. We were looking for a quick place to have lunch, and the name suited us. We had 2 shawarma sandwiches and one pop, came in under $15. Great value. The sandwiches are filled as you like it, and the meat was particularly moist. Friendly service. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Great shwarma large portions and very clean also great toppings available l, I've been here multiple times and it never fails to disappoint"}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff and delicious shawarma. Good price for a delicious meal. Recomended"}
{"text":"Standard shawarma fare. I've had the chicken wrap, dinner and falafel wrap before. Nothing to write home about, wish they put more meat in the dinners. It's not bad at all. I will be going back, but only cause I'm very close to this location in a sea of Greek restaurants."}
