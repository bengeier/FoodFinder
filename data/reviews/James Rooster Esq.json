{"text":"MUST GO!  Best food my wife and I have had in Montreal in a long time. Great concept of small portions let's you try several dishes. Doesn't matter what you choose, you can't go wrong! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Down-to-earth dining spot with a touch of elegance and smart stylistic choices made by restaurant owner.  The price for very mouth watering entrees are extremely reasonable ($14 for salmon dish) and the servers are very nice.  Would definitely recommend for people looking for a meal around old Montreal area."}
{"text":"We were here for some causual drinks on a Saturday afternoon. It wasnt terribly busy, but the service was DREADFUL! The server disappeared for 30mins on end ... but other than that, the atmosphere and drinks were very good."}
{"text":"Decent pizzas but I like my pizza to arrive hot rather than luke warm. The worst part of the meal was the CHEAP BEERS. If you want to serve micro brewed beers get some interesting beer. Old Milwaukee, Pabst and the so-called micro brews I can buy at Costco are the reason the restaurant is empty on a summer Thursday!!"}
{"text":"Cute little terrace restaurant. Great for a quick bite while walking around old Montreal. Got the oysters and charcuterie. The oysters were fresh and charcuterie had a nice spread of prosciutto chorizo and coppa di parma.

Also!  There is menu with a decent selection of local beers. So grab a seat outside and just enjoy Vieux Montr√©al!"}
