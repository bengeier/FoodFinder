{"text":"Having delicious Taiwanese popcorn chicken minutes from my office is going to wreak havoc on my fitness goals. I've already been here twice in one week.  Obviously, the popcorn chicken is stellar. It's just a winner every time. The fried chicken bento is quite good, with a decent amount of veggies and a ton of rice. I could only eat half of it and saved the rest for later. The spicy beef noodles isn't quite to my taste, I think I prefer the Shanghai style. It had a sweetness I was into.  This is a great takeout spot with seats for about 8 people. Service is very friendly and the food comes out quick enough, so it's easy to come here for a quick lunch. There's a lot of parking. For now."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick lunch. This is decent place to go to.   Got the chicken teriyaki bento. It was filled with vegetables and chicken was cooked evenly and not over sauced. Which was great"}
{"text":"Big fan of Papa Chang's food. I used to eat at their Markham & 16 location quite often. For the most part, this take out location has almost all the menu items as a normal papa Chang's location.   It's a great place for quality and authentic Taiwanese food. Definitely get the popcorn chicken if you get a chance.   Note that the place is very small and while it can seat about 8-10 people, it's not the most comfortable. Take out is preferred"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this store and it will be my last as well!!!  1. Chicken Skewer was undercooked! I am having a huge stomach ache as of this moment and it went on for an hour already.   2. There's hair in the intestine vermicelli  3. The pickled cabbage in the sausage & minced pork w/ rice is rotten/spoiled and it stinks, it is not the normal ones I have eaten in any other Chinese restaurants    Overall, the foods are NOT FRESH and I am concerned about the cleanliness and food safety of the place!   Also, I checked Papa Chang's official website and I don't see this address being listed as one of their locations.  NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN! I wished I can give a 0 or a negative rating."}
{"text":"5 stars because 1) Papa Chang's Take Out succeeds brilliantly at what it aims to be and 2) I already referred it to 5 other people and they all like it  Target Market - PaPa Chang's serves authentic, homey Taiwanese/Chinese food.  It strongly favours takeout businesses.  The pricing reflects it, as majority of the entrees are priced at or below food court prices.  It tugs in the middle to Warden and Alden as it targets the industrial and commercial clients nearby, which might order catering as well.  When the business started, it distributed over 5000 promo flyers to the businesses in the area, but none to Hwy 7.  I interpret that it intends to avoid the retail competition on Hwy 7.  Food - I visited 3 times by now.  Every time, the food was delicious and authentic.  The flavor and plating were as bold and homey as I would have made at home.  It didn't have the pretty presentation for Instagram, but none of my friends, including the non-Asian ones, minded once they tasted the food.  The unapologetic homeyness actually makes it stand out and give it an edge over the competition on Hwy 7.  However, if you like the refinement of restaurant food, the food here might not be your cup of tea, even if you enjoy the deliciousness.  Prices - The pricing is one big reason I rate Papa 5 stars.  I first visited in 2017 then returned in 2018. The minimum wages in Ontario had increased starting January 2018.  Yet Papa's prices remain unchanged from 2017 as of February 2018.  The least expensive rice entree costs $5.50.  Noodle entrees start at $7.  Bentos cost $7.25.  There are snack sized side dishes at various prices.  The portion of rice and noodle entrees is sufficient for most females diners.  Male diners with above average appetite may want to order the bentos or noodles.  In short, the food is very affordable.  I think the lower rents of a industrial/commercial complex help keep the prices down.    Ambiance - no nonsense, clean.  The small seating is not uncomfortable, but you will feel awkward to linger longer than the minimum.    Services - The cashier is friendly and helpful.  You can pay by cash and debit.  You are welcome to tip, and the debit machine prompts for tips, but the cashier doesn't get upset if you don't, even if you dine in.  In short, the owner of Papa Chang's has a targeted geographic focus for this location.  The marketing and prices strategies match the business focus brilliantly.  Me as a retail customer outside of the geographic target benefits from the lower prices.  The food is good enough for lunches and not half bad for a made shift takeout dinner.  The food and premise are not of dining quality, and it is a non-issue since the store closes at 6pm."}
{"text":"I was surprise to find this Papa Chang's hidden away in this area. This is more of office/industrial area, not a place where you would normally find eatery's like this.   Anyway, I was happy to have found this place to have lunch that icy cold afternoon with my wife. The food is very tasty and every bit like the other Papa Chang's. I especially like the fried popcorn chicken. They only have seatings for a few people, it's mainly for takeouts. So if you have a large group, be warned.  Hidden gem here, if I'm in the area I would drop by.  Taste **** Price **** Portion ***"}
{"text":"First few things this place is well hidden and very easy to drive past.   Primarily a takeout joint - but they do have seating for about 8 people and that's about it.   Currently they are only accepting cash only payments.   The service is friendly and they answer the bell promptly once, if it has been run.   With the select menu they have it is pretty easy to not get stuck on what to order. I am a little bit disappointed in the fact that they don't offer their popcorn chicken in a bento style.   Pricing is pretty reasonable.   So far I have only order their teahouse snacks -  popcorn chicken and their fried squid balls. But they were quite good and wait time was reasonable and not overly arduous."}
{"text":"I love this Papa Chang's location!  Plenty of parking, especially on Saturday around lunch time! It was a nightmare finding any parking at their Markham/16th Ave location!  Friendly staff and always ready to help.   Same good food as their other locations.  The interior is cute with some Taiwanese motifs and decor. There are a couple of tables if you do want to eat in.  Call ahead for pick up to minimize wait time."}
{"text":"Ordered crispy pork chop bento w teriyaki sauce. Great food not too salty.  Pork chop was perfectly cook, crispy outside and juicy inside.  Few small tables good for single diner. Cash or debit card only."}
