{"text":"The food is good. The service has never been slow for us. It's great Pad Thai, Curries, etc. If you're looking for Thai food, and you're in Robinson, this is it."}
{"text":"Entirely mediocre, all around. We had the Spicy Basil Fried Rice and two fairly standard sushi rolls.  The fried rice was nearly flavorless - not at all what I expect for that dish. It was neither spicy nor did it contain more than two small pieces of basil. The sushi was almost inedible, as the rice tasted like it was hours or possibly days old, and very mushy. The Spicy California roll was unlike any I'd ever seen or tasted before, and not in a good way. I never leave uneaten sushi at a table, but neither of us could finish these.   The bubble tea was yummy, but that's pretty hard to mess up.   The space and decor are lovely.   That said: Overall, really disappointing, and definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered carry-out this evening with the weather being so bad.  Another great meal from Papaya.  We had the Thai baby spring rolls which came fried and with two sauces.  A spicy sauce and a sweet sauce.  Both were delicious!  We had red curry with tofu again.  Just as amazing as the first time!  And we tried their Super Pad Thai without bean sprouts.  Great dish.  Very tasty, filling and a very large portion!  Had a wedge lime garnish.  Very tasty and very full, again!"}
{"text":"When we walked in to this restaurant, we didn't have any expectation as our last visit to a nearby Thai restaurant was a disaster...we love silk elephant, coriander, spice island and we just added papaya to our favorites :) Amazing service and delicious food..General Manager Joe Looked in every detail our order and made sure there were contended ... Great place and will go there again for sure. FYI .. This place is in Robinson near super walmart"}
{"text":"Decent food, not the best, staff is friendly but can be slow at times. They always dont have a sushi chef which kinda of stinks."}
{"text":"I came here this evening on a recommendation from a co-worker. I was in the mood for Thai food but mixed it up a bit. The restaurant sits atop \"The Point\" near Robinson Town Center right of 376 in a strip mall. However, I found the inside to have a nice modern, somewhat upscale atmosphere and I couldn't argue with the \"Fine Asian Cuisine\" marketing on the front window. Service was excellent (although it should be considering there were only 3 tables seated as of 730 PM -- that should have set off an alarm). Unfortunately, my accolades stop there. The prices are high compared to competitors like Thai Foon in the nearby Giant Eagle Market District, but I was willing to overlook that for the right food and setting.  I started with a classic Wonton soup, but this was anything but classic. They must've forgot the salt, chicken or both in the broth. It was terribly bland with only a subtle hint of cilantro that has no business in any wonton soup variant.  Next I had some fried dumplings. While they weren't terrible, they weren't exceptional either. All 5 of them looked nearly identical, giving away that this \"fine dining\" restaurant uses pre-packaged dumplings. A real disappointment.    For my entr√©e I had a Thai classic, Pad See Ew, which is typically a dish comprised of wide noodles, a choice of meat, broccoli, bean sprouts and eggs, in a brown sauce. Papaya's rendition of thin noodles looked more like a Cantonese style lo mein, but hey a noodle is a noodle I suppose. Their offering was with broccoli and carrots (??? bizarre), so I had the chef add bean sprouts and napa cabbage to help it out. Unfortunately, the \"dark sauce\" was nothing more than a half bottle of soy sauce which overpowered the dish to the point of wondering whether I might suffer middle-of-the-night kidney failure. Bottom line, this Pad See Ew had an emphasis on the Ew.   My bill of $27.15 for the above and a small white rice (not included with the meal) was, in hindsight, mind boggling for this poor showing of food. I don't see this place staying in business much longer.   For those who gave this a high rating, please let me treat you to some quality Thai food in P'Burgh."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Phoenix and Live in a very Asian area there. This was delicious. I had the Thai param.  White chicken with peppers, broccoli and carrots in a peanut curry. Was quick and yummy. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I saw a review from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about how Papaya was serving up \"authentic\" and delicious Thai out in Robinson. As a person constantly bemoaning the current lack of authentic Thai food in Steel City, I felt it was my duty to cancel my current dinner plans to head out west to try out this Papaya place.   I'd have to agree with the reviewer. I didn't get very adventurous on this trip and simply got Tofu Pad Thai (at a 7/10 spice level) with Thai Ice Tea. It was divine and had no random non-traditional vegetables thrown in. The heat of the dish was good and I was provided with extra peanuts and chilis (not ground, but I'll take it). The lime wedge added that little extra sour to the dish that really set off the other flavors.  The noodles were the perfect balance of soft and firm. The Thai Ice Tea was that excellent sweetness that took off the edge off the heat.  I was very pleased.  Fortunately, I left room for the Banana Roti- a desert I have previously not encountered. It is AMAZING.  If nothing else on the menu tempts your tastebuds, stop in for this desert. Roti are wrapped around sliced bananas and then fried and seasoned with chocolate and cinnamon. Simply a divine dish.   Two aspects of the meal were disappointing. The speed of the service was slower than I would have liked, but as there were ten tables (two of which had parties of six) and a single waiter, I will give Papaya a pass on this, especially when a second server appeared obviously late to work. The other aspect is simply a preference. I like my Thai food prepared in Thai exclusive restaurants as I am able to satisfy my cravings for the less popular dishes.   In a more competitive Authentic Thai market, Papaya might have have something to worry about, but right now, as it stands, those who love Thai should venture out west."}
{"text":"This place is really close to the office so I'll probably come here more than I would otherwise.  I ordered takeout via online ordering.  Steamed Pork Dumplings:  Excellent.  They are fairly large and the filling is flavorful, the dumpling itself is very soft, and they're served piping hot with a soy based sauce.  Hot and Sour Soup:  More sour than anything else.  The texture is kind of gelatinous; not generally what I expect from a good soup.  The bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and tofu in it are standard fare.  Massaman Curry: The menu describes this dish as a sweet curry and I ordered it to be moderately spicy.  It is definitely sweet and there was no spice on my lips or in my throat.  The potatoes are undercooked and crunchy. There is also no depth of flavor that you usually get with a nice curry.  It is also the most greasy curry I've had; the grease was not contained and got all over the takeout bag and shortly thereafter my hands.  It is just okay.  Service was good - my food was ready at the estimated time and was still hot when I got back to my office to eat it.  Another positive is the price - the lunch portion of curry was $7.95."}
{"text":"We showed up 20 minuites before it closed. Apparently that was a big mistake. Waiter definitely let us know they were closing and we should quickly order. He was not very hospitable. The food was less than satisfactory. I teased him about hanging out there while we waited for some friends to meet us after closing. He really found that unamusing.  I thought gay waiters were more cordial than that as a rule."}
{"text":"Despite being in Robinson Twp. on a regular basis, I just discovered this restaurant. The server was very attentive. The soups (Tom Yum and Tom Kha) were both very delicious. Shrimp pad thai was very good as was the massaman curry. My only complaint is the beef in the massaman curry was sliced and tough, rather than being in chunks like stew and cooked until tender. I'll definitely have the curry again, but not with beef."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best pad thai and general tso. We have tried a coupke of other thai places and none of them make it as great as them.They have good bubble tea too. The workers are very nice and respectful."}
{"text":"The food is nicely served and the staff are very friendly.  The experience is a lovely surprise."}
{"text":"This the first visit and I was glad I came.  We got the Papaya Platter and all the appetizers were good I really liked the crab rangoon, although I didn't taste any crab they still had a good taste and the right amount of filling. The sauces were good too.  I got Spicy Basil Chicken no spice I know sounds crazy but I hate to \"guess\" what spice I''m going to be able to tolerate and I hate to waste money on food I can't eat.  It was very good, alittle salty but I got it with the noodles so it all worked out.  My niece got the Sesame Chicken and it was also good, I will try that the next time.  I got the sweetened green tea expecting it to taste somewhat like at the Cheesecake Factory but it more tasted like Lipton Citrus tea, still not bad.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch on a rainy October Saturday.  Hot & Sour soup was perfect and the pumpkin curry was a real treat.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Overall I'm not sure how to feel about Papaya Thai. On one hand, it's above average for the area. On the other hand, a lot of their foods are fairly bland, which is highly unusual for Thai food.  When I went, I got the spring rolls, Panang curry with beef, and Pad Thai with chicken. The spring rolls were perfectly crispy, but unfortunately had no particular taste to them. The dipping sauce was also fairly bland and, although it had peanuts in it, tasted more like Sriracha than anything else. I didn't try the spicy sauce that they come with.  The Panang curry was probably the weakest part of the meal, which is unfortunate since it's generally my favorite. In short, it was just coconut milk and grease/fat, as if they forgot to add the actual curry. For this reason it wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't curry. It also had very little spice to it, despite it being a supposed 7, although that really makes me wonder if they just genuinely forgot to add all the spices to it. The meat and veggies were pretty much perfect, though I'd personally like a little more kaffir leaves. That's a personal preference though, I'm guessing most people wouldn't agree.  The Pad Thai was the definite winner here. I got it with a spicy level 4, which ended up being exactly what I was going for, with just enough kick to make it interesting. The taste was great and the consistency was just about perfect. The only specific thing I could point out that it could use would be a little more egg, though that by no means takes away from the dish. While not the best Pad Thai I've ever had by a long shot, it may very well be the best I've tasted in the Pittsburgh area.  Overall, Papaya probably isn't somewhere I'll be going back to. While the waitress I had was very friendly and all-around great, the Pad Thai was really the only other thing that was exceptional about this place. While nothing is particularly bad, it's not good enough to choose over any other place, especially with Thai Foon so close by. Ultimately, if you want Thai in the Robinson area, you're better off going to Thai Foon. And if you feel like trying this place anyways you won't regret it, but don't walk in expecting something amazing.  Side note: How boring of a person do you have to be to go to a Thai restaurant and order General Tso's Chicken? Even mediocre Thai is vastly better than the best Chinese food."}
{"text":"I will say that the price does not quite make up for the food quality.  I also will say that the service for this place was rather slow even during slower times.  I have had both sushi and thai cuisine from this place.  Again, pretty average but at least 2 dollars more than you would pay for each item at a quality place.  If your looking for a some decent sushi or thai food for lunch in Robinson only, I would recommend this place. For any other times, go venture to Ichiban or Saga for amazing food :-)"}
{"text":"We had soup and curry and both were excellent.  The won ton soup was fresh and sweet and the pumpkin curry very flavorful.  Excellent service and nice environment!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for the first time last night from Papaya. I had never eaten here before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Other people had said they liked their food but it depended on what you ordered.  I placed my order online which was an easy and quick process. I was able to choose the exact time I wanted to pick up my order as well.  I went with the Pad Thai (standard spice level) with chicken. My order was ready exactly at the time I had planned and came out piping hot (I was very happy about this since I had a 25 minute drive home). And when I got home it was still hot.  I thought the Pad Thai had a good flavor to it and they gave you a really large portion which was nice. Not the best I have ever had, but I thought it was pretty good. I would definitely order from Papaya again."}
{"text":"Papaya crispy noodles was a let down. There were only a few noodles amongst a bucket load of ridiculously salty \"Thai gravy.\" I had to order white rice to compensate and it wasn't enough. Pad Thai was also too salty. Although the curry and sushi were actually good. Bubble tea was like liquid laffy taffy--too sweet! And they put in probably 6 tapioca pearls total. The waiter was not attentive at all."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the different types of food that are available. This is one of the best Thai places around. The sushi was alright but it wasn't anything too special. The pad Thai, Kung pao, and general Tso dishes are all good but the Thai Param is my newest favorite. They also have a brand new app to try out."}
{"text":"Bumping them up.  We keep coming back here and as I try more things I am always pleased.  Super friendly service and a super cute place to relax in after a hard day at work."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice.  During my first visit I got the yellow curry with chicken, which was VERY nice.  A good heat level for what I requested and a well balanced amount of goodies in the curry.  Second time I decided to try some sushi.  I ordered the sweet potato roll and three pieces of nigiri.  I initially wanted one piece of tuna, but there were out (argh), so instead I went with two pieces of smoked salmon and one piece of hamachi.  The sweet potato roll was yummy, but it  is verrry much on the small side, so buyer beware if you're on the hungry side: You may want to double up.  The nigiri was pretty disappointing.  It was much smaller than its pictures led me to believe and the quality was just meh.  I was especially disappointed in the smoked salmon.  It definitely didn't have any smoky quality to it at all.....and it almost tasted pickled (???).  Overall I do like this place, but perhaps just keep in mind that this is a restaurant in SW PA and order accordingly."}
{"text":"Dinner and service were excellent at Payaya a Thai resturant.  Dancing seafood combo, orange chicken, tom tha soup (mushrooms, coconut milk, lemon grass, galangal and chicken) Fried Icecream were all really good."}
{"text":"Tom Yum Soup was extraordinary - right on point.  I enjoyed my experience here.  It was a little tough to find with all of the sprawl - but worth the search to get away from the chains.  Server was a little tough to understand.... but we got through it.  My papaya salad was a little spicy, but that was user error on my part.  I had a sushi roll, which is risky at a Thai joint, but I inspected the sushi bar in advance and the chef had some skills.  The rice was good and the fish was fresh.  Worth it."}
{"text":"YUM! Big fan of thia food and sushi! Casual atmosphere, yummy food! We realized too late that the sushi roll could have been a meal in and of it self. $12 for a shrimp tempura, mango roll. Great deal and delish! I should have left my order there and skipped the curry. I am so stuffed!"}
{"text":"Went here and maybe the worst service ever. Food was okay. Disappointed I was charged for extra rice when proportions weren't done well. And I wasn't told I would be charged for the extra rice.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Server caught an attitude even before we ordered. Too add egg to brown rice they wanted to charge us $5.00. I found that a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"The reviews were good so I was surprised at how bad my food was. The rice used for the sushi had no flavor. The fish used in the sushi had a \"mealy\" texture...clearly not fresh. The pork dumpling was in a thick casting, not the usual thinner dumpling wrapper? I threw away my dinner eating grapes instead. The only reason I gave two stars was because the Tom Yum soup was delicious (though I paid extra for shrimp and only got 2 of them) and the waitress was a delight."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and have had really good meals and a few not so good.  Went last night and our meals (me and my husband) were excellent.  I had mango Curry with Shrimp and he had Spicy Basil shrimp.   Only downside, and to me it's major, was it was very hot in the restaurant.  No air conditioning, no fans, and the hottest part of the day with the sun shining on their front window.  Very uncomfortable, especially with spicy food.  Definitely will go back but next time it will be take out!"}
{"text":"Small portions, food was so-so...  Ordered pork dumplings and calamari as appetizers. Dumplings were about average, and the calamari was tasty but overpriced for the portion. $7.95 for 8 smallish pieces... I ordered the panang curry with chicken, and while it wasn't bad per se, I was definitely underwhelmed.  The bowl of curry was mostly made up of some root vegetable that I wasn't fond of and a few pieces of chicken, peppers, and carrots. The curry sauce was very good at least. It was served with only a small cup of rice, nowhere near what you would expect for a dinner portion. I'd hate to see the lunch portion. Same with my husband's cashew chicken entree. We both left kind of disappointed and slightly hungry, not ideal after a $43 check. The waitress never returned for refills, and the restaurant didn't even seem that busy. If you're looking for good Thai food in the Robinson area, check out Thai Foon."}
{"text":"This place is an MSG nightmare.  i really liked the place when we walked in and it had a nice atmosphere and was very clean.  However, our waiter gave us serious tude when we asked questions about the menu and acted like we were imbecils because we didn't know what the bubble tea was.  Their food made me and my coworkers sick, so I'll be stickting to Thai Foon in the future."}
{"text":"Not likely to try this place again. Ordered some kind of noodle soup and some sushi. The sushi was ok and the soup incredibly bland. Not that it mattered though because I thee it all up later."}
{"text":"This place was quite mediocre.  The \"alligator\" roll was the best roll that we got.  It's hard to go wrong with broiled eel. Though the eel was partly cold. Another one we got was the \"King California\" roll,  which advertised blue crab instead of the usual fake krab.  What we got was obviously just krab, with the signature uniform shape,  rolled texture,  and red-colored outside.  False advertising! I guess this is about all that can be expected from shopping mall sushi.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good, service was excellent, but the Thai food was not so great."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for lunch with our young children on a Saturday. The service was excellent and the ambiance is quite nice.   We ordered the five mini spring rolls to start and LOVED them - delicious! We also ordered two bowls of soup (Tom Yum and Hot & Sour), which were flavorful, but a little spicier than expected. Our entrees were generous portions, though I'll say that their Thai dishes are much better than their Chinese ones."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday.....was not too busy so service was fantastic....ordered the Tom Kha soup w/Shrimp and it was good....just lacking depth....also ordered the ordered the Red Curry Chicken lunch special....this was also good and the spice leval I ordered @ 7 was spot on!....prices are deffiantly good also"}
{"text":"What happened? I have been here three times in three years. First trip had grilled squid and it was so good I've never forgotten it. I also had the chicken pad thai and it was very good. I would have rated it a 4.  About 6 months ago I came for lunch on a weekday and it was 'okay' nothing memorable but just fine, probably gotten a 3. I went this past weekend and it was disgusting. The pad thai was cool and the noodles were all stuck in one giant lump. The chicken was barely even in the dish. No wonder the place was practically empty even though it was a Saturday night at dinner time. The waiter was nice, seemed forced but maybe he knows the food is so nasty he was hoping we'd not take it out on him with the tip (which I'd never do). Stick to Nicky's."}
{"text":"I'm really not a huge fan of Asian food. I think I say that for most Asian places I visit. Now with that said I LOVE Thai. In fact I would eat it every day. This night I ordered one of the specials pumpkin curry. I like my curries thick and creamy. That is not what I got here. It was more of a 1% milk consistence. On the positive side it did taste fresh and was served pipping hot. Also the flavor was good but would have been much better if it was condensed more. Service was ok but seemed very slow to me. This might have been due to my hangryness. This isn't a place I would come back to. I will continue to search for a creamier curry."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Living out in Robinson, we don't have much choice when it comes to Chinese food. Yai Fei in Robinson Town Center is amazing but other than that your choices are limited to the criminally mediocre PF Changs or the mall. I love Ya Fei, but I was really hoping for another Chinese/Asian restaurant to add some variety to my life. Sadly, this was not the case.  When we walked in I was very impressed by the atmosphere. The restaurant has an upscale, modern look. Everything was clean and the layout was open and well thought out. All of the staff were pleasant and you got the feeling that they genuinely enjoyed their jobs.  Despite the staff's positive attitude, the service wasn't that great. We waited a very long time for out food, my dish came about 15 minutes after my wife's, and the server forgot to bring us our appetizer but didn't forget to put it on the bill. I would've been willing to overlook all of this as the regular hiccups you face when opening a restaurant, if the food had been good enough to justify it. It wasn't.  My wife got two different rolls of sushi. The first one had shrimp and papaya and she said it was alright. The second was the alligator roll, and she barely touched it. She eats a lot of sushi and has pretty adventurous tastes so I'm going to trust her on this one. Oh, she also tried the bubble tea which they were promoting heavily and really enjoyed that. It tasted like a smoothie with tea in it so if that sounds appealing to you definitely check out the bubble tea.  My dish was very bland and the chicken seriously tasted like McDonalds chicken nuggets. Correction: 13 dollar McDonalds chicken nuggets. And that brings me to my biggest complaint. The prices here are pretty ridiculous based on what small portions you get, especially when I'm pretty sure that nothing on my plate was prepared from fresh ingredients. The whole meal had a processed, prepackaged taste to it. Before we had our missing spring rolls removed from the bill the total came to $52. I've gotten twice was much food with ten times the flavor at Ya Fei for around $30.  I'm sorry, Papaya. I was really rooting for you guys. I genuinely wish you were better. Well, at least I still have Ya Fei."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best pad thai. I decided to get something different this time. I got the bangkok lo mein with rice noodles and chicken, delicious! I tried some sushi as well. Kegie out roll can't go wrong, love cream cheese! Papaya dynasty was pretty good the mango wasn't as great. Over all never disappointed."}
{"text":"Non-chain restaurants in the Robinson area get a pass for me and a bonus star and while Papaya may not be the best Thai place in Pittsburgh they have tasty curries that make this a regular place for me to visit."}
{"text":"Dividing my review into two parts : Food and Service  Food    Food is excellent. Have had Thai food at many restaurants in nearby cities but nothing is as authentic and tasty as the ones had in Papaya .   I have had Thai Basil fried rice (chicken) , Penang Curry (chicken) ; chicken satay. These r the same dishes I tried at other restaurants too , and find the one served at Papaya is very flavorful .   Good choice of deserts too . Try fried ice cream or fried crispy banana .   Service :  Not up to the mark as it's  slow but not super slow ."}
{"text":"Very good.  Not an overly exotic menu, but very good Thai food.  Waiter was a little excitable, though.  I thought he was going to break into a rendition of Happy Birthday for me, even though it was last April :)  I chose Yellow Curry with Chicken, a very ordinary Thai dish with at 5/10 spiciness.  Delicious.  The Dragon Boat Roll (Avocado & Eel) was very nicely prepared.  ADHD waiters aside, I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"If you are looking for excellent Asian food that has not had all of the flavor and heat removed for general American pallet this is the place. Great friendly staff and owners - John & Amy are the best"}
{"text":"Oh, Pittsburgh. How you disappoint me with your Asian food. I swear this Pad Thai was made with ketchup."}
{"text":"On the way to the airport and thought we would stop in for a late lunch. We walked in a few minutes before 3pm. We were pressed to hurry and order because they close at 330. The waitress was so anxious to get our order, her tension was palpable. We decided to order a lunch special to make it quicker, since they were dying to close. She made a big deal out of the fact that since we ordered the food after 3pm, we could not have a lunch special. Okay, fine. I ordered a spicy basil fried rice and my husband ordered lo mein. I have never, ever had had more greasy rice in my life. Boiled chicken pieces tossed in last minute, and disgusting overall. 3 bites, and out the door. Never again."}
{"text":"This was officially the worst curry I've ever had.  My girlfriend and I both ordered curry, and although we ordered different kinds, we were served the exact same thing.  Both dishes were tasteless and the curry had the consistency of chicken stock.  It tasted like someone poured coconut milk into boiling water.  It was also covered with globs of oil just sitting on top.  The watery consistency caused it to run right off of the chicken and peppers and the temperature scalded my mouth on the first bite.  I can't believe anybody would serve it to a customer with a straight face.  When I told the waitress how we felt, the owner offered to cook up a new batch of herself.  About 5 minutes later, yes 5 minutes, I got a takeout order which looked completely different than what I was originally served.  I appreciated it, but I don't know how someone can possibly prepare an entirely new batch in 5 minutes, and it was a dark green color despite the fact that I ordered red curry.  The service was fine, but the food was a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"So I want to give it a 4 star review because of what's available in the area but comparatively from the best and worst that I've had, it's right in the middle.  I've been coming here for lunch and it's consistent, anyway. The sushi isn't top notch but again, it's very consistent and I haven't had anything go wrong. If you order takeout, make sure you make a point to ask for ACTUAL soy sauce, because they do give those \"vegetable protein\" generic food colored packets to you in the bag.  The Thai food like basil chicken and green curry were pretty good. Hits the spot when you just need some simple Thai food that isn't going to go wrong. I'm pretty sure my green curry was either red or panang curry but it was still good.   Eat here if you feel like some Thai or Asian basics and it's convenient."}
{"text":"Alright...I haz a sad, but I have to write a less than \"good\" review of the place.  Caveat:  This is takeout-related only.  I have dined in the restaurant and had a few good experiences.  Like...3-4 star versus the 2 I'm adding.  But it's been a while.  Okay, so the thing is this:  I love pad thai.  So I order it a lot.  There was a time when I worked at a previous location where I would literally order pad thai at minimum once per week.  I've ordered it here at least four times.  It's been consistent, which I guess can be considered a good trait.  But consistently bad, which I suppose isn't.  Today's experience, like the past experiences was characterized by the following (in order of decreasing importance):  dry food, attention to detail, and tail-on shrimp.  The food seems like it's been overheated (all four experiences).  Or heated too long.  With takeout, I understand that once you prepare the food you need to keep it warm, but in this case, I arrived before my food was ready (though it was difficult to tell if that was genuinely the case since the servers were slammed.  Was it ready and sitting because there was nobody to bring it out?  Or was it still being prepared?) and got the same thing.  Dry over cooked food...which...inexplicably...was cool to taste.  The shrimp was borderline cold.    Regarding attention to detail, they were super busy today, so maybe they got hasty and forgot the lime.  Personally, I love the taste of a little lime juice squeezed over shrimp pad thai before I eat it.  And I recall getting it in the past...just not this time.  Regarding tail-on shrimp...Okay maybe it's just me.  And it's certainly not restricted to my experience with Papaya versus...any Italian place or steak place or anywhere else that they serve shrimp with pasta or my meal.  The tails were on.  With a dish where you're expected to pick up the shrimp to eat it (friend shrimp/shrimp cocktail/grilled shrimp) that makes sense.  But in a pasta or noodle dish it means digging into your sauce-covered dish and employing the \"grip-it-and-rip-it\" technique so you get all the meat.  Yeah, I guess you could cut it (though my takeout bag did not include a knife) but then you lose some of the tail, which bugs me.  And I've heard people say...\"it's about presentation...it makes the dish more attractive\"....no.  No it doesn't.  It's the tail of a insectile animal...it does not beautify or enhance the dish.    The ray of sunshine is the hot and sour soup, which has been amazing everytime I've had it.  I'll go back, but only because it's the closest pad thai in town.  And I'm lazy.  But not so lazy that I'd leave the tails on my shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"Had a meeting in Robinson and didn't feel like eating Panera or Chipotle so we tried out Papaya. From the outside, it looks cheap but on the inside it is very well decorated and cozy.   The menu is small and somewhat limited but the food was tasty. I had the tom yum soup which was spicy but filled with flavor. I had the pad thai which was a huge order and enough for me to munch on for lunch the next day. My husband had curry chicken which was spiced well and soaked up the rice!   Prices are reasonable and the waitstaff was attentive. The food came out quickly and it was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and am confident in saying it's worth a visit.   On my first visit we ordered chicken lettuce wraps, pad thai, basil chicken, and fried ice cream. One the second trip we ordered yellow curry, garlic chicken, and banana roti.  I was very pleased with ALL of these dishes. Some folks complained about a potential lack of authenticity, but good food is good food and their food is delicious. I never expected to find awesome deserts at an Asian restaurants, but I almost think those dishes were the best ones!  Our waiter, Beau, was super knowledgeable and friendly. For all I know,  the guy might even own the place, as his table-side presentations had us discussing all sorts of stuff about the restaurant. Also, the food came out QUICK and was piping hot."}
{"text":"This place is very average, more on the low side. I eat a large amount of Asian food so I like to try new places when I am close.  Here is what we ordered:  Spicy tuna roll- this roll was not what I was expecting, plain rice with tuna wrapped in seaweed with a spicy sauce. Tasted almost like it was taken from being sat in a fridge for a day or 2  Tom yum soup appetizer - I am one to always clean my plate whether a food is lousy or amazing and this was a soup I did not finish. Flavors were spicy but watered down with an overwhelming flavor of lime juice and cilantro, would not recommend.  General tsos- I got the general tsos based on a review on here taking about how great it was. It was only about 6-8 pieces of chicken and a cup of rice. The chicken I'm pretty sure was just the sweet and sour chicken with general Tso sauces poured on, chicken was a little tough on the inside, decent but probably would order something else next time  Pad Thai- again ordered this off recommendation on here, noodles were a little over cooked and sauce was very mild with a weird after taste. The Shrimp was good but not so much the chicken.   Overall dining experience was okay but I will not return to this one by choice  Update: also had stomach issues and watery bowel movement for 12 hours after this meal"}
{"text":"Really good! Excellent pineapple curry tofu. Great presentation. Download the app for free appetizer! Very friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"I consider myself a thai food expert. This place is delicious and I love the fact they also have asian dishes. I've never had bad food here and really enjoy the service and the people. I like to get red curry and ofcourse the crab angels and the spring rolls. Everything here is delicious and when I get takeout its even good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's nice to have Thai food nearby whenever I happen to go over to Robinson to go shopping, like many Pittsburgh shoppers. Even better is having a choice between Thai, Chinese, and Japanese/Sushi in going to Papaya.  However, my last experience here was so terrible that I won't give them repeat business.   But first, the things I liked about Papaya.  The ambiance of the location is very nice; I quite like the internal decor, even if the exterior doesn't make it stand out any more than your ordinary Asian food restaurant. I also like how there's a variety of Asian fare, making it easier to please a group of friends. Because they don't specialize in each type of food, the selection of each leaves something to be desired, although I find it to be adequate. And I haven't been disappointed by the food I received.  Unfortunately, the owners of the restaurant gave me a terrible time when I attempted to redeem a voucher from Google Offers (which went through CBS Local Deals to list Papaya). The owner of the restaurant claimed that somebody had been cheating by listing their business on Google Offers, and steadfastly refused to honor it. Not wanting to cause a scene, I figured there was simply a lack of communication between the owner and Google and/or CBS Local Deals, so we exchanged personal information in hopes of resolving the situation in the future.  That same night, I emailed the business through their website, and submitted a complaint to Google. Google replied to me within three days and offered to give me a refund for my vouchers. Papaya's owners to this day have yet to get in touch with me (it's been a month since I've been to their restaurant).  It's one thing to not keep up with the promotions that are floating around the internet regarding your own business, but to punish customers for your own negligence and make no attempt whatsoever at finding a solution to the problem is incredibly unprofessional. What was originally going to be a night out of me treating my friends turned into an embarrassing situation where I had to pay more than I had budgeted for myself."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised.  With all of the other restaurants around, I'll be honest, I didn't know what this place was because I had never been.  The staff is exceedingly nice and helpful, I definitely would recommend asking them if you have any questions.  My husband had the mango curry with chicken and I had the duck pad thai soup because I wanted something light and different.  I'm not a thai expert by any means, but if I knew the soup portion was going to be so big I probably would have split it with the hubby. It's BIG and filling, but pretty delicious. The duck was pretty good too.  To drink I ordered the jasmine tea, which was really refreshing, but probably not the best to drink with soup. It was like transferring from hot food to hot drink.  My husband's mango curry was good. With the curry you determine how spicy you want it, and he ordered a 6. We like spicy food, but what I learned from thai food is that it's a different type of spice than your normal cajun style or mexican food. For some reason the mango seemed to retain most of the spice, which had our nose running a bit more than eating spicy crawfish. So just be careful on how spicy you order your meals!   I took the rest of my soup (of course I didn't finish) to go, but their plastic bowl was flimsy. Thank goodness I asked for a plastic bag to hold the to go bowl. I probably live 5 minutes away from the place and by the time I got out of my car the soup leaked so much I had to throw the remains away.    In all, would I come to the place again? Yes, but I think next time I'll try it for lunch during a weekday.  They have lunch specials on the back of their menu, and it's probably better portion controlled than their dinner options."}
{"text":"Without doubt, the best pad Thai west of downtown. The Tom yum soup is made fresh every damn day and you can tell. The servers are always friendly and remembered our names every time we walked in. We recently left the Pittsburg area and this was a sad point in our moving."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Sunday for lunch with my girlfriend and her parents.  We we happy to have stumbled upon this nice little Thai restaurant after our first lunch choice was closed due to it being Labor Day Weekend.  The outside of the restaurant belies the inside since it is situated in a strip mall.  The inside of the restaurant is great though with cheery Red and Yellow decor and a feeling that you are in a nice place.  We decided to start off our lunch with the appetizer of grilled squid.  The squid came out not only as some rings as expected but also as some smaller pieces with the legs still attached and with a side of chili sauce.  It had some good flavor and even though I am not a fan of the texture (nor of much grilled squid) I still ate up a couple of bites.  For my entree I debated between getting my normal red curry or branching out into some other kind of curry before ultimately deciding on some beef red curry.  I had decided to be adventurous and order a spice level 10.  That was put into check by the waitress asking if I had even had a 10 before at their restaurant before.  Since I had not, I finally relented and went with a 9 instead.  My large portion curry came out with the normal accompaniments of baby corn, bamboo shots and kaffir leaves with a side of rice.  The beef in my curry seemed a little slimy but everything tasted ok and I enjoyed the spice level of the dish even though I could have definitely went spicier.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here in the future.  The food was priced right and it tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  I recommend the edamame, it's fresh and really tasty with very little seasoning.  The fried pork dumplings are great as well.  The general Tso's  chicken is crispy and cooked very well.  It's never too busy there and the service is always pretty fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here this week and I have to say it's definitely a new favorite of ours! I got the mango curry chicken and we split a crunchy roll. Both were absolutely delicious. He got the general tsao's shrimp and it was one of the best Chinese dishes we had ever tasted. We will definitely go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited here with my mom one afternoon. I had the pad thai, which I found pretty tasty. They give you red pepper flakes on the side so you can control the spiciness yourself; I kinda like that I guess. The inside of the restaurant is very attractive and warm, with some Pier One-style \"Asian\" tchotchkes thrown in. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I don't know of any other Thai options in the Robinson area so I'm sure I'll visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I have had nothing but positive experiences so far.  I like to take my dad here because he likes the Chinese dishes... and I usually go for the Thai food -  I really like the green curry/ tofu and Thai Tea.   I also like the spring rolls & calamari. My husband frequently gets the Pad Thai.   They also usually have the game on in the bar if it's a Sunday & you don't wanna miss the game while you grab a bite to eat.   The servers are very accommodating. And I really just enjoy the low-key atmosphere.   My only con:  I hate the parking.  The traffic from Burgatory & Walmart nearby are usually insane. Ergggghhhh!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved from Austin Texas (the sushi capital of Texas) and have been spoiled by amazing sushi, this has been the best place I have gotten sushi since I moved here! Great food and amazingly nice employees very happy and would go there again, only reason I couldn't give 5 starts was the decor is defiantly needs a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"Not the worst Thai I have ever had, but it was definitely lacking in a few areas. For one, the Tom Yum Soup had microscopic pieces of tofu floating in it that tasted freeze-dried and the ginger tea hot pot came out lukewarm borderline cool. Bummer, because my nauseous tummy was craving ginger, or at least something hot to put it out of its misery. My Basil Chicken, which was supposed to be a 5 in the spicy meter was waaaaaay too saucy and not spicy at all! I mean, I can dig a saucy meal most if the time, but this sauce left me painfully searching for the bell peppers, basil and chicken slices. There were no chopsticks offered to us as well.   The waitress was very nice and attentive with the water. That was the most positive part. But if you are really craving Thai and cannot venture any further into the city, give it a whirl. For an area bombarded with chain stores and fast food joints, Papaya provides a more unique dining option."}
{"text":"Sushi is low quality and expensive. $2.50 for one small slice of sashimi. The sushi rice in their rolls lacked any flavor. The sushi at the Grand China Buffet in Washington, PA does a better job in quality and taste. That should tell you something.  The chicken pad thai isn't that great either. The breast meat is overcooked, lacked flavor and other ingredients such as bean sprouts and eggs. The pad thai from Thai Foon in Settlers Ridge far exceeds this place, and they are priced competitively. In fact, Thai Foon may actually be slightly cheaper.   The restaurant itself looks nice, but aside from that, save yourself the trip and heal your hunger at Thai Foon or the Grand China Buffet."}
{"text":"Great service, real tasty food odered a Pinnaple Curry Shrimp it wast delighful would order it again"}
{"text":"Middle of the road Thai place. To draw in the non adventurous crowd they also have the popular Americanized Chinese /Japanese favorites. Got the Pad Thai and a Red Curry. Both were decent. Nothing to write home about, but good enough that if you have an Asian craving you could satisfy it here. Pad Thai had good heat (we asked for it spicey) but just average, and curry could have used more coconut flavor. Service was good, the waitress was super friendly."}
{"text":"In the past this was my go to for Thai in the area but I stopped in for lunch today and ordered my usual spicy vegetables with basil and was extremely disappointed. Usually the sauce is light and flavorful but today it is so thick and salty, I Cant taste the basil at all. I will think twice before eating here again.  Update: after not eating here for a few months and trying it again I know for sure I will not be eating here again. The sauce was really dark and thick and didn't taste like a Thai basil sauce at all, more like generic Americanized Asian food with basil leaves in it. I haven't tried the sushi here so I can't speak on that but I don't recommend the Thai food."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago. I didn't like it then and I didn't like it now. I travel all over the world and get authentic Thai food in other countries. We have some authentic places in Pittsburgh and this isn't one of them. I had the Red Curry and it was not flavorful in the slightest... I should have taken the drive to Thai Tamarind like I had wanted too .... lesson learned. The staff was VERY nice however.... Won't return"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. It's always fresh and very delicious. Service has always been good and they are always attentive. Their ginger tea is really good too. I have tried their Thai food and other items in the menu and have always been satisfied. Just watch out with the heat. It can get very spicy."}
{"text":"We decided to grab dinner and take a break from Christmas shopping. When we entered there was only one other table that had people dining but when we left the place was full. Our server was very sweet and was constantly checking in on us. We ordered the Crab Angels, Chicken Satay and Kung Pow Shrimp.  The King Pow shrimp has a very light crust on it that was nice. The shrimp were huge and there were a lot of them. We had asked for a level high heat but it was more like a two.  The Crab Angels were crispy and the filling was delicious. The Chicken Satay came with two sauces-a Peanut sauce and a sweet sauce (like a duck sauce.  We would definitely go back to try their sushi and Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I just re-read my review and honestly I had the same experience with the same dish. I guess that's what I like!  I want to update my review because of the great service.  I was alone this time, needing a break from my co-workers, and was seated quickly.  The service was flawless and quick yet not rushed at all.  I was out of there within 30 minutes but I could have stayed 60 if I wanted to.  Great lunch spot especially if you are on your lunch break!"}
{"text":"An excellent choice for Thai and other Asian fusion cuisine. Also BYOB is a bonus with NO corking fee for now."}
{"text":"We stopped there on the way back from the airport and has a very pleasant time.  I absolutely love summer rolls (they're wrapped in rice paper and not deep fried, soooo refreshing and yummy!) and theirs were pretty good, nailed the taste with the basil leaves, etc, but missed the mark with peanut dipping sauce instead of a plummy sauce----but still good enough to order again.   We ate family style so I got to try the green curry, beef and chicken satay, and the mango stir fry.  The mango stir fry had a little less mangos than you'd expect from the name, but then again we are very far from where mangos grow so that was easy to let go.  The satays were crusted with more seasons than I've experienced before and the kiddos, usually big fans, didn't like them at all though the grown-ups thought they were good. We all also ordered the Tom Kha soup which despite being loaded with mushrooms (my nemesis) was absolutely wonderful.  The  broth was coconutty and spicy and just hit the spot.  I left a pile of fungus in the bowl and was perfectly happy.  Overall we were quite pleased with the meal and would go again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Good food but the service is slow. Like really sloooooooow. We ordered, no problem, but they have no clue how to end your meal here. Finished eating and it took almost 20 minutes for someone to get our check. I don't mind a wait but-man!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that I am disappointed with papaya. I've been here twice and both times I was not impressed either their food. Compared to the other Thai places I've visited in Pittsburgh (Nicky's Thai kitchen, green mango and Thai me up) this place falls very short.   My has been ordered pineapple curry I ordered the lemongrass soup with noodles. I didn't really like it that much because the lemon flavor was really lacking I had to add practically a whole lemon sliced up to get it to be a nice tangy taste. Also my soup didn't have any coconut milk in it  which took away that delicious fatty taste a coconut aunts to Tom Yum soup itself. His curry although the taste was familiar it was still very subtle compared to what I've had in the past.    I also had ordered a mango bubble tea which was a lot more different than all the other bubble teas I've had in the past. This one taste like it came straight out of a bottle or carton.  I'm a little bit sad at this place wasn't as great as I thought it would be because I love Thai food at this place just isn't hitting the mark."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not live up to expectations at all. Ordered the basil fried rice and it was flat and tasteless . Would never go back to this place"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Robinson for sushi and Pad Thai! The servers are very nice and the food is excellent! We've lived here for 7 years and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Note: Papaya specializes in Thai cuisine but also offers Chinese and Japanese fare, including sushi of course.   I dunno gang, when you go to an Asian restaurant, learn that your server is an Anglo guy named Beau, and find the food to be of excellent quality, authenticity becomes meaningless as far as I'm concerned. Papaya has thrown yet another layer of sod onto that casket.   Not one, but two appetizers graced our table; Chicken Satay and Steamed Pork Dumplings.   The Chicken Satay's (4 to an order) succulent tenderness took us to a Strip District street corner on a Saturday afternoon, the attendant peanut sauce adding a rich sweetness to these skewers of grilled, yellowed meat.  We liked the Pork Dumplings almost as much. The potstickers were adequately filled and absolutely sang when dunked in the soy sauce. I've definitely had superior pork dumplings (Tong Garden in Brookline is the place to beat), but Papaya does these competently.  Kay and I both ordered from the \"Thai Chef's Specialties\" section of the menu. Kay got the BBQ Chicken with Papaya Salsa, and I ordered the Spicy Basil Soft Shell Crab.   Soft shell crab is something I've only eaten rarely. My early experiences with it were underwhelming until Yama in Beaver, PA made me a believer. Papaya's version was a lesser triumph. The duo of crabs were just a touch over-battered and greasy, but the flavor of the crab shot through, and the hot 'n nasty basil sauce (when you see the seeds, you know your tongue will be set ablaze...) spilled generously all over the plate, turning it into a Zambelli fireworks display for the palate. The heaping helping of white rice was a thankful respite and proved useful in soaking up the excess sauce.   A quiet, enjoyable lunch was all we craved yesterday afternoon, and Papaya provided it with a smile and a laid-back vibe. May Papaya survive and thrive in the cruel, corporatized, chain restaurant-dominated realm of Robinson."}
{"text":"I was staying near the airport and found this place while searching my options on Yelp. The possibility of  a sushi appetizer and a Thai entree really struck a chord.  This establishment was tucked away in a moderate-sized strip plaza near a Wal-Mart in the Mall at Robinson commercial area. Using the GPS, it was not too difficult to find though you should not necessarily expect to easily spot it from the street.  One of the attractive things about this restaurant was the fact that I was getting a late start on dinner and it was open until 10 PM. I arrived between 8:30 and 9 PM on a Tuesday night and nearly had the place to myself when I came in. Two gentlemen walked in just ahead of me and we were it. That held true for my entire stay. The quietude was actually a nice change.  The dining room was rather spacious and pleasant enough. It seemed almost cavernous with the sparse crowd. That, combined with the fact that it was a bit dimly lit, might have bothered me on other occasions but did not that night. I was seated right away and my server attended to me relatively quickly. The service was fairly good during my visit.  The menu offered several Asian favorites including Vietnamese and Chinese options. But I had come for the sushi and Thai. I started with a spicy tuna roll and, if I am to be honest, it was only average. It was satisfying only because I had been looking forward to sushi. My main, however, made up for it as I opted for the Thai Cashew Chicken and was very happy with it. They gave me an option of 1 to 10 on the heat and 7 was a spice level that was perfect for me. They also offered several different types of hot tea. I tried the Ginger Tea and liked it very much. It did, however, have a strong taste so be forewarned that it is only for ginger fans.  I finished with the best reason to go to a Thai restaurant...mango and sticky rice. It was excellent and a great finisher.  The prices were not bad. I got out of there with a final cost of $35 that included tax and tip. I also walked away with part of my entree to take back to my room.  In general, I was reasonably happy with my experience. The sushi was just OK, but the entree was excellent, the mango and sticky rice was lovely and even the tea was unusual and memorable. If you like Thai and are in the area, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and never left disappointed. I have always had great service and enjoyed the amazing food. I wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"Friendliest service, fun and accommodating service with best tasting dishes possible. But today chicken was a little bit stale."}
{"text":"Never go there big liar!!!!! The owner is Thai people????never been the restaurant like that so disappointed"}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday night, it was not so busy and we were seated right away.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  The restaurant is classy and comfortable.  I had the Tom Khah soup with shrimp it was delicious, I loved the taste of the coconut milk it was a perfect balance with the spicy red pepper. Then I had the Volcano Roll yum! Great place, I'd come back again"}
{"text":"I stopped in with one of my co-workers on a Friday afternoon. I ordered the house salad and tom yum soup. The house salad was much larger than expected and had fried wontons on top. The ginger dressing was delicious. I also ordered the tom yum soup, the large size with just vegetables & noodles, spicy level 5. It was huge! I ate it for lunch three times. The tom yum was fabulous. The best I've had in the area. Spicy 5 was a little high for me, so I'll back down to 3 or 4 next time. There were quite a few chilies in there.   My coworker ate sweet and sour chicken. He didn't eat all his rice but didn't say he didn't like it.  I have a work meeting next week and I will recommend that we come here!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short:  I was reminded of sushi I had back in the day from my college dining hall.  Yes, it's worse than supermarket sushi. You cannot taste any fish in any of the rolls. The menu is a bit funny. For $6, you can get an eel and avocado roll, or for $12 a Black Dragon roll: an eel roll with avocado on top. Uh, sorry, I don't think it's justifiable to spend the extra $6!  In other words, avoid."}
{"text":"Well.... they have some great food such as the spring rolls but we got the worst calamari ever....   the absolute worst.... first it was cold in the middle.... then they put it in the microwave.....   so then it was rubber.....      Server should have known better."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I've found outside of California (they also serve Chinese and vegetarian dishes).  The service was very good, the food great, and a quiet atmosphere (tho other reviews say it can get busy and noisy). The Crab Angel appetizers were delicious and the orange sauce was mild, which complimented the appetizer nicely.  The Eggplant Thai with chicken was great with perfectly cooked vegetables, tender chicken, and the right amount of spices.  The Panang Curry was also great. The portions are generous and prices reasonable.  For 2 dinners with the appetizer we spent $31 and took leftovers home."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and I loved it! I always come with my family and they love it as well. It's a very nice classy atmosphere with dim lighting and calm music. It is a very clean restaurant as well which is great. The last time I came here I got the general Tsao chicken, and it was the best general Tsao chicken I have ever had; not a single piece had cartilage, and the way it is made is different as well. Instead of being covered with breading, it has a light crisp layer that makes my mouth water! I got it again this time, and was not disappointed! I always get the 3 spice, and it's perfect! Maybe next time I will have to boost it up some!! The sushi was also delicious, I ordered a California Roll, and it was great. I believe the cost came out to be less than $1 a piece which was a bargain in my opinion! And it came with 8 pieces so it served me well as an appetizer.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for Thai / Chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. I WAS DOUBLE CHARGED by this establishment.I tries to fix this before leaving. He told me that he system was down and nothing he could do.  He was very  rude throughout our conversation.  He siad he would  be able to fix the issue later. I called back as i was instructed to do.  Then I was told that my card declined.  While i was at the restaurant I showed the manager my account and the two charges.  After  I brought  that up he said it was pending still. Then i siaf so you just said it was declined but now it is pending.  I told jim i will call my bank and handle this issue and will never return.  I would  never go to this establishment ever again."}
