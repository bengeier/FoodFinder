{"text":"Food is decent, but does not live up to it's reputation. However, bring a book because the service is glacial, and the waiters completely unapologetic when your simple souvlaki arrives cold and 45 minutes after you order it."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times I've ordered delivery during the winter and received it warm! The prices were solid; for two people, we ate comfortably with a 2 pita combo (with chicken and gyro) and an order of spanokopita. 

The spanokopita are why they lose a star, but they're still edible!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. Service is fast and efficient. Our family of 24 took the combo A and we all enjoyed the great food."}
{"text":"This is a gem! We went for lunch, and members of our group ordered the soups (lentil and creme of brocoli) and Greek salad as starters, then had the chicken pita, prawns, salmon, octopus and calamari. Everything tasted great and the portions were generous! Plus the service was fantastic. It was very easy to make a reservation and we were seated right away. Our only regret is that we didn't leave room for dessert. Just means that we will have to go back to try it!"}
{"text":"Really liked the fried octpus, not rubbery and great sauce.Sebun liked their house salad, but the Greek salad has too much tomatoes for him.

The grills (chicken, lamb and pork) are not too impressive to me, wouldn't go back for that. The sea bass is ok-ish, neither texture or flavor impressed me. 

Occasion: casual lunch with baba and ayi."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once every 2 weeks. Special Greek chicken and the lose chicken gyro meat is always delicious. Unfortunately we are often let down with the Greek salad especially the tomatoes but really all the vegetables in it are no good."}
{"text":"Just awesome, nice atmosphere. Delicious meals and generous dishes.
Very good service. Quiet as well."}
{"text":"I go here way too much! The food is delicious and the service is quick and friendly! 

They have a variety of meat options including chicken, beef and lamb as well as several vegetarian dishes. The feta cheese here is a must-try!

The nice greek music playing in the background adds a little something."}
{"text":"This place makes a mean gyro, I'll say that much. A little on the pricey side, but the portions are ample and the chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"Fraîcheur, qualité et service merveilleux. Les meilleurs calmars en ville et que dire de leurs viandes, WOW!"}
{"text":"This is a very pleasant surprise, we ordered 3 dishes from the appetizer menu - spanakopitakia (spinach and feta cheese in phylo), calamari, and gyro (shredded lamb and pork)

For the spanakopitakia, I didn't really taste the feta cheese in them, and there's a distinct taste like some kind of herb that was a little strong for my taste. I've had better ones in Calgary.

Calamari was great! Batter was crunchy yet not too hard, and calamari was soft yet not mushy. The sauce was sweet and spicy, it was too spicy for me but I still had some coz it was very good.

Gyro was good too, even though they were just shreds but they still tasted really good with the herbs that they put in.

It was well worth the money, the portions were really big!

One thing though - the calamari and gyro were quite greasy. We had to absorb some of the oil with our napkins to eat the last bits on the plate!"}
{"text":"Ordered twice and been once

The meat is pretty good, the tzaziki is extremely salty but nice. 

The salad has massive chunks- like tomatoes cut in four- but is generous quality.

Avoid spanikopita, feels like you could do better at costco.

The first time I ordered they took forever, the second time they forgot something and got it to me 20 minutes after everything, ice cold.

Its not bad and I might go again buts its not the best."}
{"text":"Consistently great greek food in a fun atmosphere. Great service.  Grew up less than a mile from here, and am a student of the souvlaki. For reference, villa de souvlaki on Sherbrook is a favorite. Great tzaziki (tingly!) well balanced souvlaki, crunchy tasty calamari, a bar and a terrace. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Greek food and decided to come here. One person had been previously and really enjoyed it, the other, wasn't impressed so I went in with an open mind to see for myself.

Their outside terasse was full and the restaurant was pretty busy overall. We were greeted by Manny, who was a jovial and gracious host. 

There was a lot on the menu to choose from and we all enjoy a variety of choices to nibble on so we chose a few dishes so we could satisfy a variety of cravings.

Our waitress was quick to arrive with water, and a basket of warm, crispy flat bread and butter. Decent...

We then ordered sardines, grilled octopus and a Greek salad for starters.

I never liked sardines before and generally do everything to avoid them. I do like smoked fish etc and decided that these looked and smelled pretty tasty, so I decided to give them a try.
Crispy skinned, flaky, smoky flavor, delicious! Surprised me!

The grilled octopus was amazing! They were beyond tender unlike the chewy, rubbery ones many restaurants serve. They were drizzled in olive oil, oregano and a hint of garlic with a few capers mixed in. I'll definitely have it again.

As for the Greek salad, fresh and crisp, an abundant amount of cucumbers, tomatoes and sweet red onion, and a nice  amount of feta which was topped with a tasty, traditional dressing.


By the time we finished eating all this, I was already too stuffed to even think about our main courses but they soon came...

I had the souvlaki pita platter which was served with more Greek salad, rice, fat French fries and a dollop of tzatziki. 

The meat was nicely marinated but it was on the tough side, might have been an off night but I won't be ordering it again. The rice was bland and the fries were tasty.


My other 2 dining companions ordered a half portion of chicken. Very very moist, very flavorful, beautifully marinated and a plentiful portion.

All in all, a great dinner, I will be coming back again!

Obviously not in the Mythos category but a great family style restaurant with good food and a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch trio. For $8, you get one skewer of souvlaki (beef, chicken, or pork; or lamb for an extra $0.50), fries (which I changed to salad for an extra $2.50), and a non-alcoholic beverage.

The souvlaki (I ordered pork) was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of char, but could have been more seasoned (more lemon, more herbs). The Greek salad was decent, with a good amount of feta. However, the feta was quite mild and the salad could have used a touch more salt or briny-ness from the feta. Also, the cucumber and tomatoes were cut on the larger side and, as a result, a bit unwieldy. The star of the dish was definitely the tzatziki, which was perfectly balanced in its creaminess, yogurty tang, lemony acidity, garlic, and herbaceous-ness.

With respect to the service, we were promptly greeted at the door and seated (we arrived towards the end of the lunch rush). Our server was friendly, but virtually disappeared after our food arrived and he wasn't replaced by anyone, so my friend's water glass sat empty for about 2/3 of the meal and our empty plates sat in front of us for a good 10 minutes at least before it was clear that nobody was coming and we would need to flag someone down for the bill.

So to sum up... decent food for a good price but service that leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and it seems it only gets better and better. Portions are generous prices are reasonable and food is amazing ! This time around I had a quick bite because I was in a rush . I've never been a big fan of gyro but like I said , I was in a hurry . If their calamari and octopus and tapas are anything to go by , I should be good with something simple. The server took my order and I forgot to ask, not to make the pita too big. My food arrives and by the time I'm done , I'm grateful that I forgot to make it smaller! I will be coming back again soon !"}
{"text":"I just got home from this restaurant and I thought of giving it 5 stars . I had the authentic gyro which is lamb and pork ! Nowadays you only find pork cause lamb cuts the profits ! One of the best! 16$ for a plate with rice fries and salad . 
I also had an entree of calamari . The quality of food and prices were excellent! They had a large selection of Greek wine and beers .this is a family run restaurant with excellent service ."}
{"text":"The decor, the staff, the Greek music, the food and the desserts are excellent! I am a regular at this place because of all that. Nothing more to say except try the Key Lime Pie and the Galakto Bouriko desserts! N"}
{"text":"Good Greek food at a reasonable price. Nice location, plenty of parking on the side streets. Good service. Wine is really expensive, $20 for a half liter."}
{"text":"A good Greek food experience. Cretan Moussaka was delicious and complete as a portion. Meat, vegetable, rice, layers over layers and topped with cheeeese. The meal is too big to finish and we brought some back home.
I did not like the Espresso though! Why espresso in a Greek restaurant? Needed some to swallow the super sweet baklava. But the cup was so tiny and half fam before I reach some drops of the bitter dear :)
The baklava is much bigger than what you get in Arab or Turc restaurants. I would like it more if It was crispier.
In sum, I would definitely try Greek food again. I left with many untried items on the menu. 
Staff: friendly. 
Service: slow for a Sunday night and a half full restaurant.
Prices a bit inflated but I say the big portion make up for it.
Parking was plenty when we dined here.
Ambiance is casual, good for children, medium level of noise."}
{"text":"Shrimp was not properly cleaned. Intestine still intact. Possible Ciguatera neurotoxin. Don't eat here. 
  Also, staff not accommodating to simple requests. Better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"When they say they deliver, they deliver: quality, quantity and speed. Love this place, it's just too pricey from which to order too frequently."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and welcoming ambience. Their food comes in big portion for a very fair price. Would love to go back for more of that souvlaki. I do think their food is on the salty side so perhaps they should cut down on salt."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times, ever since the restaurant first opened and I have to say it has never let me down: delicious, perfectly cooked Greek food complemented by the most amazing and friendly service.

Last time I've been here, I had the fried calamari appetizer, which was excellent as always. We also tried the grilled octopus, lamb chops and chicken skewer, and all three dishes were full of flavor and cooked to perfection. The octopus was the real winner, a clear 10/10. Their Greek salad has nice big chunks of vegetables and the most delicious olives.

I also have to add, most of their dips and cold appetizers really set them apart from other Greek restaurants I've tried. The taramasalata really stands out, compared to some other Greek restaurants where it feels very cheap and tastes of only potatoes and starch.

I will be back here many more times, and I hope their quality always stays on top."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, bon rapport qualité-prix. Les portions sont généreuses et il y a in bon choix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in Montreal. The place itself is beautiful. There is a good menu for drinks with options for everyone. The main menu is thaughtfully designed. There aren't many vegetarian options but other than that you have options to choose from seafood or chicken or lamb. Their desert menu is attractive but I have tried better baqlava."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food with an expansive menu, including desserts/coffees. The wait staff are very friendly, positive atmosphere. If you're popping by for lunch or a quick bite, there is a bar with several seats and two big screen TVs."}
{"text":"I love Greek food but this restaurant is my new favorite in Montreal. I've tried almost every Greek restaurant and this one takes the cake! Friendly staff and good decor. I will be returning shortly!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek resto close-by to my home. Can't go wrong with the gyro pitas but if you've got a hankering for grilled octopus they do a pretty good job."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Food was awesome, I had the table d'hote, tried the lentil soup, spanakotiropita, chicken brochette, and carrot cake for dessert, everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. I'm only holding back from giving 5 stars as the service was ok, but not as good as I would have liked. My food came out but my side of tzatziki only came out a good 8-10 minutes after my main meal had been served, I had to flag down the waitress twice to remind her and kept getting an 'it'll be out soon'. The restaurant was only half full so I'd expect my food in one shot rather than seeing the waitress respond to me and then go re-fill water glasses, wipe down tables etc before getting my remaining item. Other than that, this was a restaurant that gave great value for the price and I would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Quick fast delivery.

First time ordering.

Chicken pita was better then the gyro one. 
Depends what you like but the chicken was thin pieces not huge chunks like most restos serve.

The pita is soft and yummy would be better with a bit more sauce but I won't bash them for that still great !"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a place other than Marathon for greek food. I found this one. I must say, it did not disappoint me! They give you a basket of pitas with butter. My friend and I ordered a chicken stick plate. It actually comes with salad or soup. I took the lentil soup and it was really warm and delicious. My friend chose a cesar salad. Let's say that we were pretty full after our diner. Staff are nice and courteous. Great for first dates, birthday celebrations, 5a7...the ambiance is classy.  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"RIP my favorite souvlaki place, used to be my go to place over the last few years but has slowly been getting worse and worse each time and now I just can't justify ordering from here again. First off, I asked for my plate to be mostly French fries and even specified on the phone \"not a lot of rice, mostly fries\" but they obviously don't listen or don't care enough because my plate was at least 80% rice.  Second, the chicken I got tasted like it was defrosted and thrown in the microwave on 100% for 30 seconds, just disgusting. Finally, I even got an allergic reaction right after eating the meal - and I'm not allergic to anything that I was served. So obviously there is some cross contamination in the kitchen and if you are allergic to anything I would recommend ordering from a different place on those grounds alone. I haven't had a good order from here in years and never know what to get because it might just be awful, for instance the last time I tried their skordalia and it was 99% oil and 1% potato. I felt sick after eating one bite of it, and tossed the almost full container in the trash. All in all just another terrible experience as I have come to expect from yiasou, and I'll probably just order from arahova from now on and would advise anyone to do the same. 

Shocking that a place I would recommend to everyone has become so horrible, press F to pay respects to this once great Greek place."}
{"text":"Service at this restaurant is terrible. Owner Is rude and disrespectful. They do not deserve your business."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the beautiful and careful presentation of all the food and the delicious grilled octopus, moussaka, chicken gyro and souvlaki. Casual elegance!"}
{"text":"100% Highly recommended Love to eat delicious tasty fresh food for a good price with impeccable service? I'm Greek and I  to authentic Greek food. Yia Sou is the best place you want to be in a lovely atmosphere. It's one of my Top 3 Authentic & Impressive Greek Restaurants in Montreal that you must visit before you die -- You feel your in Greece but you don't need to take an airplane to get there -- its right next door :) Service is always quick, they treat you like family and portions are always generous. I go to Yia Sou often with clients, family and friends. They have a big menu (from seafood to deli meny) octopus, calamaris, chicken, gyros etc -- are you hungry yet? lol -- I wish I had Yia Sou next to my house  

To the owner & staff: You guys rock - Thank You so much for the great service and delicious authentic food!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you eat IN at. You'll love the decor, staff and food!
The fried calemari is the BEST I've had in a Montreal restaurant.
The prices are good, the food is amazing. If you get the chance, get the house salad with their house dressing, super yummy!!! 
No complaints here :D :D :D"}
{"text":"went there for my birthday.  Ordered lamb chops, grilled portobello, Caesar salad, baklava.  Lamb chops were very fatty, chewy and hardly any meat.  I've had lamb chops in other places and they were delicious so I can make the comparison.  Portobello mushroom - I've had better.  They don't know how to make it properly.  The veggies that came with the meal were mostly peppers that should be grilled a little longer but that's not what I expect when I order grilled veggies - no onions or broccoli.  They did throw in a few zucchini slices but those too were still pretty much raw.  Did not like the Caesar salad.  I've had much better.  Baklava was not a \"melt in your mouth\" one - it was nothing special, although it was \"on the house\" since it was my birthday.  The only positive is that the waitress was very efficient and very nice, even though she was really busy.  Sorry to say that I will not go back there again."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great greek restaurant. The food is fresh, and really generous servings. The Calamari is simply the best I have tried. I could not believe the price! Yiasou has the best prices compared to other restaurants in the city. 

The only complaint is the service. The people are nice, just slow. It took over 25 minutes before we started being served."}
{"text":"It has a nice ambience I love their rib steak and oven potatoes
I've had other dining experiences where the lamb souvlaki pita had pretty dry and hard lamb meat 
I will say that service is usually good
It is an average place overall"}
{"text":"Usually the service is good but this last time it took over an hour and a half to get the food and it was cold.
Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic, High quality, Greek cuisine! However, I find the food excessively SALTY. (This is probably the same as most restaurants; usually too much salt is added to the food)."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Yia Sou for the first time on Sunday this week, picked up gyros on Tuesday and brought coworkers for lunch on Wednesday. I think I'm obsessed! Melt in your mouth calamari, fantastic Greek salad, fresh and delicious tzatziki and a huge mound of pretty good octopus. Everything I've had so far has been fresh and portions are generous. I'm looking forward to trying just about everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal the other night. Ordered a souvlaki plate...fries were crispy like I asked and the sauce was delicious. Will definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Just ordered Combo B from here: Four souvlakis, two chips, two cokes, for $25.

It was really good. Food arrived warm and yummy. Everything was nice. It seems like a good clean Greek restaurant that does things right.

However, as I live on Sherbrooke, I will probably stick to my regular place Villa Souvlaki. They have the same things really, but there is something extremely unique to their tatziki and the way it tastes, better than anywhere I've ever tried it. And it's next door. I just wanted to try something else.

But if I was closer to Snowdon, this would probabaly be my go to place."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on. Might be the best gyro in the city. Prices were fair for the quality of food we were being served.
The only negative was the ditsy blonde hostess who was stressed out of her mind and giving us grief for making reservations at the last minute. 
But if you can avoid her, the rest of the staff was great.
10 on 10."}
{"text":"Tried it a month ago for the first time when I wanted to try something near work and then got hooked. Very good food and excellent staff and service. Now I am there any chance I get. tried many Greek restaurants around Montreal and New York city and this one is one of the best if not the best amongst them so far as far as casual Greek restaurants go."}
{"text":"A nice Greek restaurant. We went on Tuesday night. Service was good. We ordered grilled octopus, salmon and souvlaki with lamb and pita. Food was all delicious. I ordered pina colada, which was ok. Will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the quality of the food, because I found myself in Montreal with the cold front - 18 degree C and did not want to go out.  So we ordered in.  My friend orders from this place from time to time,  The restaurant offer free delivery on any order over $10.  I had a souvlaki with lamb, other friends ordered souvlaki platter (chicken and lamb).  It comes with salad and rice.  I don't find it particularly good, my wrap was slightly cold, but then it was very cold outside.  I tried friend's platter, it was an OK for me.  Nothing extraordinary.  I was tiold that there is outdoor space in the summer and is a big hit in the hood."}
{"text":"They make a mean gyro and their terrasse is pretty nice in summer.  I find their portions a little on the big side though so much of the food goes to waste."}
{"text":"Their steak &fries is just so damn good, I eat their regularly, the food there is always awesome with good quality, so does their service, once you ordered for a few times, then they will memorize you as a loyal customer, they also give birthday discount on your email as well! Great resto!!"}
{"text":"I came to Estiatorio Yia Sou for the grilled octopus but I ended up falling in love with their giant shrimps! Simply wow with their seasoning and perfect mix of flavours, a bit of lemon juice makes it perfect, and the portions are so huge! With the amazing appetizer and lovely dessert that come along with la table d'hôte, I am stuffed and satisfyingly stuffed!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best-hidden-secret souvlaki place in Montreal!

I came here after reading about this place on Chowhound, on a discussion thread about the best lamb souvlaki in Montreal (read: not pork, not chicken) and was blown away. First of all, the servings here are Old Skool, meaning there's enough to feed you and your family for a week. You will have no choice except to ask for a doggy bag afterwards (which is great, because you then have lunch for the next day at work). 

The side salad is large enough to be a meal in itself, then on top of that, you get baskets of bread and that doesn't even touch on the amount of fries and rice which will come with your main dish. The lamb souvlaki platter was stellar, moist, flavourful and zesty. I haven't tried their other dishes yet, but based on the photos which other Yelpers have posted, I think a follow-up visit is in the works.
Service is pretty fast and you won't feel rushed at all. They have dinnertime specials during the week, so if you can get to Snowdon metro and walk the two blocks and the Decarie overpass , you're in for a cheap but tasty night out.

It's too bad they don't deliver to my neighbourhood because I can totally see that developing into a habit."}
{"text":"I will try to be objective but the food was truly bad... so my experience was definitely tainted. I must say that I had high expectations after reading the online comments. We drove a long way to try this restaurant, especially the moussaka and taverna grilled chicken. Here is what we had:

Lentil soup: ordinary but still ok

Fried calamari: there was more oil than actual calamari and they were not cleaned properly. Horrible.

Fried zucchini chips: they were thick and extremely oily... like leaking oil in your mouth when taking a bite. Horrible.

Saganaki: the show is nice, the cheese isn't. Not good at all and I usually love saganaki.

Tzatziki: ordinary, store bought

Greek salad: almost no dressing... so basically just cubes of tomatoes and cucumber

Fried: generic frozen fries, but good. 

Rice: good

Slouvaki stick: ok

Grilled half chicken: looked good but was undercooked! We left it all there. 

Roasted potatoes: stale... must have been made a few days ago

Moussaka: the béchamel was rock solid, the meat was \"beasty\" (inedible) and the taste was just off. I will say that it was my first time trying this dish, so I don't know what it's suppose to taste like.

Service: our waitress was very nice and polite... we can't blame her for the food right?


Needless to say, most of the food remained in our plates.

I didn't even have the energy to discuss with management... if they are ok with serving this food, well there is not much my comments can do... so I just paid the bill and the tip and left."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant on the face of the planet (and I eat out 5 days a week). I used to live in Montreal and whenever I go home for a visit, I try and eat it daily. It's that good! I never get sick of the chicken gyro platter, it's out of this world. The food is consistently good, the service is always quick and friendly and delivery is also quick. The prices are beyond reasonable and the food is fantastic... I recommend this place to every person I meet. Marathon, Souvlaki George and other Montreal eateries, don't even compare to Estiatorio Yiasou! You will not be disappointed!"}
