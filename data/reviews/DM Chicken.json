{"text":"Super gimmicky and pricy but the chicken itself was actually very delicious. I like how there's some veggies and rice cake mixed in with the chicken. We ordered the 7.5 which allowed us to choose two flavours - we got spicy as well as the sweet flavour. Would recommend both. It does come with side dishes - salad, chicken wings, yam or potato fries, and beef or pork patty. The salad that came with it had way too much dressing. The yam fries were regular. The beef patty was just basically a burger party with some sweet mayo sauce drizzled on top - meh. Thehe chicken wings though, were really crispy and juicy. Definitely a bonus highlight to the meal. 
Given that we spent $75 for this, I can probably go to a Taiwanese restaurant and get something similar. Still a unique experience and definitely a place to go with friends though. 

Service was alright, servers don't really speak English well and menu is in Chinese."}
{"text":"great taste, the fired chicken wings are amaziing and the sauces are so good. the portion ia huge. liked it A lot"}
{"text":"This place is actually a franchise store for a chain in asia. I believe it may be the first in toronto. The theme they are going for is korean inspired chinese style chicken joint. So we ordered the hot plate as seen in the pictures. basically what they are famous for. and boy was the price expensive. the smallest one we can find is 38.80 before tax and tip so your looking at 40 something dollars for what turned out to be not a lot of chicken, fries, salad, or food. However one would hope that the quality would take over, this however is not so much, the chicken is a little overly salty, even with the rice (which was made soggy) it was a bit too salty, the basic flavour is okay mixed with the cheese sauce, but it is still too salty in general. the salad was flooded with sauce wayy too much sauce, you actually needed more lettuce to supplement it. and the fries was not crispy. Although there was sweet potato fries, you can tell that they had pre-fried these a long time ago, and just re-heated it, which is kinda crazy considering fries aren't that expensive and your charging 40 something for a 2 person meal.  

the interior is nice looking and clean, and the service was okay, however the food was just not that great, and the price was way too expensive for what you get. overall i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, as it isn't really worth the price. and the experience is not unique. there are tons of korean joints that can do the same thing in toronto. 

i realize this place was built for a mainland chinese audience in mind, as the promotions and the staff don't really know english. i dealt with a server who spoke zero english, and promotions for discounts are all in pure chinese. unless you have a chinese friend even if you wanted to try this place, you best avoid it."}
{"text":"First day of soft opening! They don't have all their menu items ready yet, but they do have some. They seem to be a Chinese owned restaurant trying to do the Korean fried chicken/dakgalbi and cheese/toppoki route. The interior is rather nice. It's clean and chic and they've got some cute decorations like lamps shaped like chicks. Some of the menu (dalkgalbi/combo platters) is only in Chinese.

Supposedly, they have a 10% off deal, but you need to scan a QR code into Wechat and post something on their behalf first. The details are on the table, but they're all in Chinese as well.

They have these three very unusual items called hand pilaf. Basically, it's a bowl filled with rice and topped with things like kimchi, tuna, or caviar. Why a hand pilaf? Because apparently, there's some sort of allure in being given a glove so you can mix your rice by hand. Um...okay then. Or I could eliminate the waste of plastic gloves by mixing it with my spoon.

We ended up getting their white chicken ($12.99). They also have red chicken ($12.99) and black chicken ($15.99). There are no descriptions for any of these things, so it's a tad difficult to know what one is ordering. White chicken, based on the picture, was fried chicken tossed in grated white cheese. We received a basket of 10 wings, topped with a spoonful of grated white cheese, and a handful of fries on the side of the basket. If I order white chicken, I want my chicken to look white all around. The way they did it, all the wings on the bottom of the pile didn't have cheese. That being said, the wings were very juicy (just cooked) and crispy, but they could have been crispier still. The fries were very crispy. There were no condiments on the table, so we ended up having to ask for ketchup for our fries. It's a decent deal at $12.99. The whole thing left me rather thirsty, but thankfully, they had a jug of water with lemon slices on the table. 

Service was decently friendly, but two things were a tad odd: 1) I asked for plates so we could share the food we ordered. They told me the plate was the saucer under my cup. 5 wing bones on that plate and there was no space left. 2) We asked if we could pay an up charge for sweet potato fries, which are on their menu. They declined. These aren't huge deals, but they were surprising, and not in a nice way.

I know the clientele they're aiming towards, and I know I'm not a part of that group. Still, I might consider coming again if I'm craving wings. I also want to try their toppoki, but we'll see if that ever happens."}
{"text":"Best chicken I've ever had. The DM stands for decimeter, we had the 5.0 DM chicken so it's 50 cm long. 

The taste is very similar to three cup chicken, and you get unlimited rice refills. Come early because it gets packed very quick, service was great."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????2???????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"March 15, 2018 - the food here was good. But the prices are a bit high. It was a nice place to try for the first time. The flavour of the chicken dish was good. It was spicy. The sweet potato fries were good also."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice. I gave it four stars because the service is great. They gave us 10 percent discount for my friend's birthday. I appreciated their friendly offer. The chicken tastes soft and juicy. The rice box tastes even better. The menu is restricted, so u don't have too many choices other than chicken. You even don't have too many choices for the flavour of chicken. I got depressed about it because I like honey garlic flavour or bbq flavour. However, I do think the prices of food are comparably expensive. Just enjoy the unique experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for an early dinner and the place was quiet.  It was kind of empty and so we requested for a booth. The waitress gave a snarky look and pointed over to a booth.  The food arrived and I requested for a plate.  The waiter pointed to the tiny black plate which the cup was sitting and said, \"That's the plate.\"  How tiny?  It's 1ish DM.  We didn't have their signature chicken and opted for chicken wings, caviar hand pilaf and drinks.  Chicken wings were mediocre.  Rice was soggy.  Drinks were good.  Small menu. Place is cozy with cute setting.  Service is bad!"}
{"text":"This review is based on its current promotion price of $38.88 / 5DM chicken.  There are bigger/longer chicken orders on menu.

DM Chicken is a little hip eatery that specializes in chicken, Chinese/Western fusion.  I ordered \"sweet spicy\" 5DM chicken.  There was a LOT of chicken bites, and a lot of garlic, onion and other fillers.  It came with 2 bowls of white rice and a small fries. The chicken was drown in a sauce that tasted like Thai sweet chili sauce mixed with chili oil or some type of chili sauce. For reference, I usually eat mild to medium spicy food; this sweet spicy sauce tasted very spicy to me.  It was obvious that the chicken, garlic, onions and spices had been cooked together for a while, as the flavors melted together.  The food was delicious because of the bold flavors and the oil.  Hence, I strongly recommend that you order the flavors you enjoy, because it is all that is going for it.  The 5DM is supposed to be for 2 people, but the portion can feed upto 3 people, 4 if you also order some sides.  It will be more economical if you come in bigger group to share a bigger chicken order.

The service was fast and sufficient.  The decor is casual, hip and young.

I rate it 4 stars partly because it is $10 off now.  It is quite expensive at regular prices"}
{"text":"I honestly wouldn't have came here especially after reading the reviews, but my friend really wanted to try it so here I am now writing this 1 star review. My friend threw up twice that night after we ate here, and my stomach was hurting for a few days after too.

The customer service here was absolutely terrible. All the female employees just seemed like they woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I never understood why these people choose to work with customers if they hate people. The restaurant was pretty empty when we came in here, but yet the employees were so impatient and really wanted us to order asap. The menu was only available in Chinese and there were just a few words I wasn't sure of so we had to ask the waitress to explain the menu to us but she was so reluctant to do so. Then we tried to get another employee and we realized that nobody here spoke English. I don't have a problem with people not knowing how to speak English but if you're opening a restaurant in Canada, can you at least have an English menu? Overall, they were just so irritated and it made us feel very uncomfortable. 

Anyways... We ordered the 5DM Chicken ($40) in the original flavour which was like a honey garlic or something like that. The fries were COLD and the chicken was slightly cooler than room temperature.. even with the tiny candles under the platter. The cheese didn't taste like normal cheese you would get at korean bbq places. It had a weird consistency and tasted like.. plastic?? and it just didn't melt. The chicken pieces were very tiny - like an adult had to cut up food so it's bite-sized for toddlers. The entire time I was eating, I had a gut-feeling I was going to get sick."}
{"text":"Soft opening. So get this, it's braised chicken with special sauces, heated with candles! So when we ordered long story short I asked if the garnish was garlic or not. Waitress tells us that it's garlic, turns out it's peanuts. I'm allergic to peanuts. The deathly kind. So we ask to get this replaced immediately, luckily I was suspicious of the dish from the get go. Didn't eat any of it but at least no one was hurt. But still, it's not acceptable to get something like that wrong."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special.  Spicy beef noodle had more ham pieces than beef and noodles were very soft. Soup was okay. The red chicken advertised as spicy was literally fried chicken with jarred sweet thai chili sauce drizzled on top. At least there were 10 pieces? Fried squid... two little tentacles served up when the menu picture was clearly something different. 

Service was horrible. I tried to tell our waitress we didn't understand mandarin and as a response she completely ignores me and tries to get someone else in our party to talk to her. Very rude attitude."}
{"text":"Saw this on IG and developed a fried chicken craving, so decided to check the place out. Located at the Midland and Finch plaza with QQ Thai ice cream, Chatime, etc.

Came here with mom and bro. Menu was pretty restrictive. The DM hot plate, which assumingly was what they are known for, had limited sizes with the smallest one starting at $38.88. Because we wanted the hot plate (this is what I came for), we were forced to pick that and be left with little else to choose from. (IMO they should have smaller sizes to cater to smaller groups if the DM hotplate is their specialty. Great way to force an upsell.) Also, the menu did not have a lot of English descriptions so you'll most likely have to ask the waiter for clarification on what it is you are ordering. For example, the English description would literally just say the name of the item, e.g. \"5 DM\", while the Chinese description clearly calls out ingredients such as rice cake, carrots, etc. I can sorta read Chinese so it isn't a big issue for me. Just calling out the concern for people who can't read Chinese and may have allergies or adverse to certain ingredients.

We ordered the hot plate which came with Korean style spicy chicken. Came with salad, fries and unlimited rice. It wasn't bad but I've had better sauces at Korean restaurants. Overall the novelty of the hot plate is really what you're paying for. Also got fried chicken on the side and at the end of it that was way too much food. Saw many tables leaving food behind because the portions were too much.

So should you try this place? Definite yes if the following apply to you:
A) Your motive is to Instagram the hot plate
B) You're with a large group (so that you can really try everything and not feel like you're wasting food)

Otherwise, it's an okay choice if you're looking for chicken."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Ordered the 5DM chicken w/sweet potato fries and chicken was original flavour (honey garlic) $38.88.  Shared this with a group of 3 people. The hot plate came with cheese dip, refillable rice, caesar salad, rice cakes, carrot, onions, potato, peanut garnish, and garlic cloves that look like rice cakes.  The hot plate itself is heated on top of tea lights, but don't expect it to be like teppanyaki. 

Pros:
- Great for groups
- Discount if you post a picture on social media, no tax if you pay with cash. 
- They offer take out containers if you don't finish (saw a couple tables leaving food behind)
- Most importantly: great for the gram!

Cons:
- Menu is predominantly chinese, but most of the people there are going to order the hot tray anyways.  They give you the option to pick the spice level and type of fries.
- no a/c, we went on the day where it was 30 degrees.   

There is better chicken out there, but if you're into the \"experience\" this is for you."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. 

The fried chicken is pleasantly not bad but everything else is just sub par. The service is dreadful, slow and inattentive servers, while one order from the same table was served in a timely fashion the other order was served 35 minutes later after reminding them some of the guests were not served.

extremely over priced, $100 for 5 pieces of fried chicken and about enough food for 2, dish was served cold despite having the gimmick of candles under the serving tray. Pork chop was drier than dog chew. It's pretty much having frozen food served for you for 15 times the price.

Feeling adventurous? This is perhaps the worst adventure you could have."}
{"text":"Lines up for nearly an hour of in a small vestibule space. We had their 5Dm I think. The chicken was good with unlimited rice refill.
We also ordered the starry night since we saw everyone ordered one,  but it was too sweet for my taste.
I would definitely go back with more friends to try the bigger DM so there are more varieties.
Maybe next time have one friend can wait in line while the rest can wait at home until there is a table."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Got the 5dm chicken w sweet potato fries, squid and black chicken. They are all really good, and I especially like the black chicken! It looks awful but it's really really good! You got to try it. Soft, crispy, smooth. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We got their sweet chili spiced chicken for 2 which comes with either fries or sweet potato fries, salad, and unlimited rice. 
There's onions, chicken, garlic, potatoes, and rice cake in the sweet n spicy chili sauce which I really enjoyed. The cheese dip was soso not too big of a fan. 
The rice was the chewy Korean rice which I really like. 
The salad was nothing special and the sweet potato fries weren't crispy enough. 
They have a special going on which is 39$ for the plate instead of the regular 49$. 
Also if you post a picture on instagram, they will give you another 10% off. 
With after tax and tip being around just under 50$ which can easily feed 2-3 ppl, the price isn't too bad for what you get."}
