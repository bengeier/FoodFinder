{"text":"I can be a curse coming from the UK. I grew up on excellent fish and chips wrapped in newspaper with a lovely picked onion as a bonus.  Captain's doesn't even get on the radar. The batter is bland, tasteless, and the fish, well I'll leave that up to you do decide, for me it was terrible.  Certainly nowhere near, not even close to an authentic fish and chip experience.

{"text":"Good was just okay. Fries weren't hot and the portions were a bit skimpy. The coleslaw was good though."}
{"text":"I've driven past here many times and never stopped before. Today I tried it and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It's part of a chain, so I won't lie and say that it was the best fish and chips I've ever had. But it was very good, tasted fresh and the price was right.  Service was friendly and attentive and quick. If your inclination was to stop nearby for a quick, fast-food lunch at one of the big names, I'd recommend stopping here instead and eat something enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out family meal of fried and grilled fish. Grilled pieces of fish were incredibly small - do not order. Was told on the phone that the pieces were bigger which is why it costed more but the pieces were much smaller than the fried pieces. Taste was OK, family was still left hungry."}
{"text":"Really, really great place.   It is family run and it really shows. You can tell that this place is frequented by regular customers who come here for the great food and the friendly service.   I don't even really like fish but this fish is phenomenal! It melts in your mouth, the batter is so delicious! Before eating there I hadn't even liked tartar sauce but I have been converted!   Really worth it to stop in here for lunch. They have take-out as well as sit down but take-out may be the best option as it is not a big restaurant and is often pretty busy since one large group pretty much takes up the whole place."}
{"text":"No stars I had the worst experience ever, the fish tasted like jerky paper thin even a knife couldn't cut it than worst of all they over charged our credit card $20 never gave a receipt. Don't let a senior pick up food they may try to charge you extra!!! For disgusting food. Terrible customer service. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I alway get the fish with shrimp and sweet potato fries. While the fries are ok, the fish/shrimp itself is amazing. The batter they use for the fish is light and flaky, not greasy like a lot of places. And the serving sizes are fairly decent. I'm always stuffed after a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fish and chips is delicious but the service is really nice as well. The lady who has taken my order on several occasions is always smiling. The first time I went there she asked me if I had been there before. When I said no she recommended the halibut and chips off the menu. So I went with that and have never looked back. I always order that. I usually do takeout here and after I order, they make it in front of me and it's ready in about 20 mins. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best fish and chips in the area. As noted by other reviewers, they are a little sparse on the tarter sauce but are happy to bring more if asked. I normally get the Greek salad which is exceptionally good. Portions are large. Prices are reasonable. Decor is middle of the road. Staff can be hit or miss but the owners do get to know the regulars and can be quite accommodating."}
{"text":"This place should be called Captain George's Sushi! This place serves the worst fish n chips! When you call yourself a fish n chips restaurant at least try to cook your fish! I stopped into this place on the way home from work. Thought I was going to get nice golden crispy fish and fries. Was I wrong! I ordered take out and when I got home and open the box I was shocked at what was in there. 4 pieces of small fish and a little chunk of fish, that was white and no crispy batter. My wife and I tried the unappetizing bits of fish and was totally disgusted in the flavour and undercooked fish. The fries weren't any better! How can a restaurant not even be able to cook french fries!!?? Save yourself money and possible food poisoning and go to No Frills and buy any Captain Highliner frozen fish and cook it yourself. You be much more satisfied!  I returned to the store the next day, as I was working in the area, and showed them the fish n chips they served me the day before. At first the owners, I am assuming they are the owners, tried to deny that it was their fish n chips I was bringing back. Which is funny. Like I went to another store to buy fish n chips, They finally acknowledged that it was their fish n chips after I raised my voice. They even admitted that they added a chunk of fish because they realized the fish portions were small. I told them I wanted my money back and that their food was unacceptable. They refused to give me money back and became belligerent! This ranks as one of the worst take out experiences of my life! I am sure this place would do well on Gerrard Ave. These owners need to go to a real fish n chips place and see what real fish n chips should be!  Totally awful!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife. Fish was great. Chips seemed reheated and not fresh. Overall, a good fish and chips."}
{"text":"Like the cod here. The batter is so light and not oily. The fries are fresh cut and slightly crispy so not bad. You can upside your fries to poutine as well. The place is small but it's a good size for fish and chip restaurant. Service is good and food is tasty so I'll come back again"}
{"text":"So we ordered a family pack and one kid meal and asked to substitute some things she was rude. Then we found a hair in the salad and she blamed us for it. I have red hair and the people I was with have black. Also my hair is longer then my butt. The hair I found was short. She didn't do anything about it. Their very rude here wouldn't recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant after driving by it on the way home from work every night. I was not able to sit down and eat this time, so I just ordered take-out.  However, I was impressed to learn that every plate is fried on order, which did result in a longer wait time for my meal. I ordered their regular Haddock & Chips (my usual go to) and was pleased at the generous portions. The haddock was quite soft and the batter was crisp, but it was quite brittle and fell apart easily. Like other reviews have mentioned, it has quite the \"fishy\" taste which could throw some people off, but I was satisfied with the overall taste of the fish. The fries were soft and had the homestyle vibe, although my batch at times tasted as if it was just plucked from the stash I keep in my freezer at university. As I ordered take-out, I received a generic packet of tartar sauce, so a in-house sauce would have been better. Overall, it was a good quick bite and the place has potential! It might not be The Golden Union in London, but it's a great choice for the fish and chips lover looking to satisfy their cravings!   3.5/5"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, but (just my point of view) I don't see anything special.. the fish was tasty (got a halibut) and the fries were good..   by default everything on the plate is \"Gold\" nothing green, that destroyed the plate (visually talking).  the price I think was fair, the taste of the fish was excellent but just don't see myself coming back after a while.. or unless I REALLY REALLY REALLY FEEL LIKE DEEP FRY FISH"}
{"text":"Simple sit-in and take-out place. Attracts a lot of local elderly residents.   Korean family owned. Very friendly folks. Provides a fairly welcoming environment.  Menu is simple and straight-forward. Food is not bad. Fried pretty well. However, IMO my Captain George's Special wasn't really worth the price for a platter of fries, onion rings, garden salad, two pcs of Halibut fish, two mini morceaus of scallop, and three pcs of shrimp. There was more salad than fries. Still...fairly tasty and a bit better than the competition across the street."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant. Good variety of seafood to choose from.  Service is very slow. Prices are reasonable  Found it by accident"}
{"text":"Haddock had nice crispy batter, albeit a bit greasy for fish as well as chips and onion rings. A bit dark as well, perhaps oil was old as it was near closing time. Service very friendly and it was a nice place."}
{"text":"I love fish 'n' chips but life hasn't been the same since H. Salt Fish 'n' Chips pulled up stakes in Canada. Last couple times I've tried to go to a better fish 'n chips place in Toronto, it's packed. Asian burrito fusion joints take heed, fish 'n' chips is going to be the next big wave. Mark my words. Kickin' it old school. Represent. Word to your tartar sauce. Wine vinegar is blood.  Anyway, my neighbor and I took a Sunday drive out to Stouffville to visit a house bound friend. We were delighted to find Captain George's. Really friendly staff. Huge plate of fries, fish, and salad. Reasonable prices. Lots of parking. Nice clean restaurant with lots of natural lighting.  The only thing I can knock is your huge plate of fish 'n' chips comes with a little thimble of tartar sauce."}
{"text":"This Stouffville Fish & Chips Joint is owned by a friendly Korean Family. It's a small diner style kinda place.  What we ordered:  Haddock Dinner (with salad, & chips) $10.95  The fish is really fresh, crispy and moist. The batter was very airy and light.The haddock was a fair size. Salad was ok and fries were ok too.   Captain George's Special $22.95 Halibut Fish with Scallops, Shrimps, Onion Rings, Salad & Chips. In my opinion I don't think this platter was worth it. There was more chips than seafood. There was only 2 small pieces of scallops, 3 pieces of shrimp, & 2 palm size halibut. But taste wise it was pretty good.   I would come back to try some other items they have. :)"}
{"text":"We use to really like this place, but has gone down so much in the last 5 months.   Becareful with take out, as the items order sometimes never make it in the bag. We have missed a couple upgrade items.   Always double check your bill with the menu price. Ive caught over charging me for items. When confronted they say the menu is the old price or they are learning the new cashier system.   Such as same as the food is good. But Never will go back."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of east doing west food good.  The outside and interior decor of this stand alone store looked traditional British, so I was surprised that the cook and cashier were both Asian.  At 2pm on a Sunday, this place was not quiet!  We ordered a Captain George's Special to share.  The order was made to order, and we got it fresh off the fryer.  The halibut fish fillets was fried light and crisp.  The batter was not too thick.  The onion rings and fries were fresh and fried nicely, too.  The fried shrimps and scallops were average.  The only complaint was the tiny cup of tartar sauce that came with the order.  They gave us 2 additional cups free of charge upon request.  The services was friendly.  The place was clean and well lighted with natural light."}
{"text":"I live in Montreal now but when I went to visit home in Toronto, I drove the 40 minutes to eat here (so that I could introduce it to my boyfriend because he argued that nothing could be better than fish and chips in BC, he admitted that he was wrong!) because it's THE BEST fish and chips I've ever had! I've had fish and chips in Victoria and this is still better! I with they would open a location that it more south and accessible to people from Toronto or even Markham because everyone who I've introduced to this place has to drive all the way to Stouffvile to satisfy their craving. I get the halibut always, the fish is obviously better in BC but the batter is what makes this taste sooooooo much better! It's perfect and unnaturally crispy and light and flaky and not heavy or oily.. I want some now! Too bad it's 540 km away from me :("}
{"text":"I must say...I've been living in Stouffville for about 6 months now and I was a bit sceptical of this place.  But I was pleasantly surprised!  There are different types of fish that you may choose from and different combinations.    The batter was actually really good and the fish was fresh.  Fries were also great as well.  Salads were typical fast food salad...nothing special but hey, I'm at a f&c place.  I'm really just looking at the texture of the batter etc.    Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips. Their halibut is delicious and I don't even like fish. Everything tastes extremely fresh. I've tried almost everything on the menu but the halibut fish and chips is the best. The chips are not what I go for, and their like a 3/5 fries wise but the fish is so good it does not matter. Its a nice little place, nothing fancy. You can also call in and order and pick up about fifteen minutes later. I think they recently changed management from the first time I've been, but the food is still the same and the quality of service is as well."}
{"text":"I am in love. As someone who doesn't enjoy fish much, I find myself craving them days after my first visit. Service is EXTREMELY slow, fish is fried on order and they have a long line of take out with limited staff. After an epic wait, we finally got our fish and it was worth every second of waiting. To try more variety, we got all 3 fishes - halibut, haddock and cod. Not a fan of the fishy taste myself, but I was absolutely in love with the cod. Batter was crisp and not too thick. Fish was silky and moist. It tasted fresh and very well balanced. Haddock and halibut were a touch dryer but you definitely still love the freshness of the fish. The family verdict was Halibut, Cod, Haddock, but we would happily eat any of these. Tartar sauce lacked a housemade flare, but the fish was good enough for you to look past the generic sauce. Fries and salad weren't bad but nothing to write home about. I want some more just writing this review...if only they have locations not in the suburbs!"}
{"text":"I found the two halibut I ordered to equal one normal sized piece.  The chips were more like thin french fries.  People running the place are really nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while driving aimlessly for a spot to eat, decided to try this mom'n'pop style fish and chips spot   I actually can't remember the last time I had fish and chips before this, but it wasn't too impressive.  I mean, it tasted good, the service was good, the restaurant was old school but decent... but nothing blew my mind. Maybe fish and chips just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place. 8 fish and 2 chips for only $30. And tasty as can be!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this resturant. The staff was very friendly. The portions are generous. The prices are fair. The decor is OK. If you are seeking fish and chips... this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We have been driving from Scarborough/Markham to Stouffville for 3 years solely for captain Georges Fish and Chips!! We have tried a few of the popular fish and chip restaurants in the markham area however none compare to Cpt. Georges.. Not only are the prices great, but also the fish and chips are tasty and prepared with fresh ingredients. We usually get the halibut family pack, with lots of fish and fries. The poutine here is mediocre. Service is great, very friendly staff. When you make a request/order it is usually quickly acted upon."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday on our way back from the Stouffville farmer's market. Located off the main street the place is a glass fronted box with a small parking lot. Inside it is themed in shades of ocean-inspired blue with lots of sunny photographs of Greece. A few tables face sit against the glass windows looking out to the parking lot and the main street. There is a counter with a kitchen and all the cooking in the back. The menu is extensive and features a selection of fried and grilled fish and seafood options. The also feature sweet potato french fries, a welcome addition to any chip place. Our table ordered an assortment of dishes, including some fried clams, shrimp, cod, grilled fish and sweet potato french fries and everything arrived hot and delicious. The dishes are generous and what one would expect for the price. The batter is a light tempura like batter that is not heavy making for a delicious lunch. Recommended for anyone with a craving for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Delicious fish and chips. We usually get take out fish and chips from there. Restaurant has been there for a while"}
