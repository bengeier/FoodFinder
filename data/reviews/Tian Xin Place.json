{"text":"My family has been dining at Tian Xin Place for a better part of the decade and I have to say the quality of service and food have been declining. 

Not only quality, the quantity of food has shrunk to a point where you really start wondering how bad business has to be for them to give you so little food for the price you pay. For example, the deep fried pork chop soup noodle dish only comes with a couple small pieces of pork, or if you order the snow pea leaves, expect a really small plate of greens (usually yellow because they most likely will be wilting). 

If the restaurant is full, do not expect your food to come out in an orderly manner. The last time we dined at the restaurant, we waited almost an hour before any food came out. We also saw someone wait over an hour for take out. 

Despite the small portions or the slow service, the dumplings and certain dishes are decent. They highlight some dishes that won awards and I would recommend that you order those. Note: this \"list\" is in Chinese and they have it on each table. 

It has been getting harder for us to decide to go to Tian Xin Place. Asian Legend unfortunately is more consistent and speedy..."}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful. Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurant in Toronto. 

The food is tasteless, not traditional Chinese at all. We sat there for 2 hours and we were the only table in there. 

The waitress hard sells all the expensive food. 

I would rate this restaurant to be 0 stars if its possible with Yelp. If you are Chinese, please do NOT come."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best soup dumpling (xiao long bao) I have ever had and I've been to many places including Ding Tai Fung. This is a family owned restaurant whose chef has been perfecting Shanghainese for the better of 20 years. The soup dumpling has the thinnest skin and the best broth and I have yet to get one that's broken. My girlfriend and I have gone to this place well over a dozen times and we live more than 20 minutes away. 

The owner have also always asked us if we had any preferences and have made their dishes various different ways in order to accommodate us. If I could rate it 10 stars out of 5 I would!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! We order streamed soup filled dumpling, pan fried green onion pancake, braised minced pork balls and fried noodles. Everything tasted pretty good! The noodles was a little bit salty! We are looking forward to come back and try more stuffs!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not a fan. I'm aware that this place has won awards, but I found the food to be underwhelming and overpriced. We came here with a friend who is a regular at this place, and I left very disappointed.

We ordered a variety of dishes to share, listed below.

Choice of Four Cold Dishes ($45)
Firstly, the price point of the assorted four cold dishes is embarrassingly high. The portions that are provided are minute compared to the cost! That said, I did find the cold dishes to be among the better of what we ordered that night. The four that we chose are as follows.

Drunken Chicken
The chicken was very thinly sliced (with roughly 10 to 15 slices), and heavily marinated in wine. The texture was quite smooth and velvety, which is a requirement in Chinese cuisine.

Five Spiced Smoked Fish
The fish came almost in a deep fried state, with bones included. The pieces were so brittle and crispy that you could very easily bite through the bones! It's an interesting dish, and reminds me like the deep fried fish that you find in the snack department of Asian grocers, or like the vegetarian fried goodies in Asian markets.

Preserved Pork
This was the one cold dish that I didn't try, but apparently (according to my sister) it tasted like bacon or ham.

Jellyfish Salad
Although this was one of the more simple dishes, I quite enjoyed it nonetheless. The jellyfish is springy and al dente; however, I did find it to be slightly oily. The cucumbers were a necessary addition to brighten up an otherwise salty dish. This dish alone costs $12 (we ordered extra because of the small portions in the original plate).

Xiao Long Bao
Decently executed, but they arrived to our table lukewarm. The wrapping wasn't too thick, but the filling wasn't too large nor generous either.

Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings
This was honestly so dry and disappointing. The wrapping and fillings were dry and tasteless. You must eat this with some dressings or sauces, though I would actually suggest not ordering this at all.

Sauteed Braised Eel Fillet
At $31, this is by no means a cheap dish. However, there were literally only 10 slivers of eel. Oh, and I guess the restaurant's definition of sauteed and braised means to do so in oil. The nakaimo yam, carrots, and eels came swimming in thick yellow grease. Disgusting.

Sea Cucumber with Sizzling Rice
Again, for $27, this was an absolute rip off. There were maybe 8 pieces of very thinly sliced sea cucumbers - if you pieced them together, they'd make up a measly and pathetic single sea cucumber. The sea cucumbers came drowning in a very thick cornstarch and oyster sauce mixture. The sizzling rice was essentially a fried rice base torn into bits. Interestingly, we received it separate from the solution, so missed out on the theatrical sizzling sounds.

Chinese Cabbage Alfredo
This was... An interesting dish. It tastes like some sort of cream chowder base with cabbage and bacon bits. To be honest, I wasn't a great fan, but you can probably tell so by this point in my review.

I will never return. The food is overpriced, portions are small, and flavour is underwhelming."}
{"text":"Shanghai food | dumplings | slow service | Mandarin 

The food here is good and decently priced however, the service is quite slow ... My dinner pasted 2.5hours mostly just waiting for food.

The server speaks Mandarin and the menu is in Chinese. The recipe comes with no item names so if you ordered a few more items than you can remember you may want to keep a note of it. 

Overall it's good if you have some time to sit."}
{"text":"This place is literally empty on weekday nights. I went with my family and we were the only table that they served. It is also quite expensive.

We usually have the steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), deep fried fish, soup, and vegetables. I found that their best dish is definitely the deep fried fish. It was lightly battered and they serve it fresh too. 

I would say that you should not judge a restaurant by its amount of customers but with the quality of food they serve and this place is falling in overall quality and the price is not right."}
{"text":"This place is just ok and the price is not equal to quality of food , just one famous dishes is excellent and the rest just ok , if you have many choice , you will know which to pick .... [the price is not right - too expensive]"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times, and the quality is pretty decent. Foods to try include the dumplings, green onion pancake, drunken chicken, sesame biscuit and thick noodle beef soup. Quantity is not bad, but it's a bit pricier than competitors like Asian Legend. Seating is comfortable, not too crowded. Large parking lot too. Good for lunch for families or small groups."}
{"text":"The food is not good here. 
The restaurant smelled funky when we walked in. 
I don't know what else to say..."}
{"text":"Came here with several co-workers for lunch. Tucked away in a small plaza, along with a Korean mini-mart,  Nino's Bakery, and a KBBQ. This restaurant specializes in Shanghai dishes and offers $6.99 lunch specials on Mon-Fri. 

We ordered:

Steamed pork dumplings (6) - As with any Shanghai cuisines, this is one of their staple items to order. Though each dumpling is small in size, the flavour was savoury and bursting with soup.

Pan fried pork dumplings (4) - Standard dish. Most of the pan fried pork dumplings I've tried retained some of the soupy broth inside, but this one was dry.

Beef and Brocoli - I was quite surprised with this dish. The beef was tender, flavourful, and appetizing with accompanied with rice.

House special Yang Noodles - Crispy thick noodles with a savoury sauce, loaded with ingrediants (bok choy, BBQ pork, squid, shrimp). One of the best dishes of the afternoon.

Chicken fried rice - Small pieces of shredded chicken. It was quite bland, but it went well with the salty dishes that we ordered.

My co-workers enjoyed the different types of flavours of each dish and will probably be back for another lunch outing."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed in the food presentation, quality, pricing and overall in general. This restaurant is inside a plaza with the Korean Marketplace and some Korean restaurants..There has been a few changes here...I noticed a few different shanghainese restaurants changed for the same location but the food hasn't improved at all...

Their lunch specials had alot of choices but we did not end up choosing anything for the lunch specials lists as it wasn't very appealing..

Service wasn't attentive and it did take awhile for the food to arrive. We ended up ordering beef brisket noodles and dan dan noodles...both of which were bland and not authentic in my personal perspective....

We ordered the some appetizers..(3 different types) and it just all came in one dish...so it was just not cosmetically appealing..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Shanghai-ese restaurant in GTA, and yes, they have the best soup dumpling.  I love to order the dishes on their recommendation list (however, they only write in Chinese in the list). Their \"squirrelfish\", sweet and sour ribs are also my favourite dishes in this restaurant.  Must visit again and find more fav dish :-D"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch as it was nearby one of my relatives places. Seeing how I always seem to notice this time every time I go to Legend, I decided to try it out.

We ordered the following:

- Xiao long bao x 2: I'm a sucker for the crab meat filling, which this place has. For some reason I do prefer crab meat over the regular pork broth, and this place was no exception. However considering the price I paid ($7.25 x 2) I still prefer Ding Tai Fung's, even though theirs don't have crab meat.

- Drunken chicken: The slices were quite small compared to Ding Tai Fung...also the alcohol taste wasn't that strong. That actually was a good thing though since I was DD for that day.

My relatives also ordered other stuff which I forgot (and didn't bother having as I wasn't hungry). I did notice service was quite slow, especially since there wasn't many people when we arrived. It seems to be a family business, as some people who served us looked like the owner's daughters.

Will I come back? Meh...it's quite far from where I live."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Average food.  Not worth putting up with the attitude and wait.   Wrote this wheniwas eating there.  Waitress very unfriendly and does not take your requests or comments seriously, turns around and outright ignores you.  Food is average,  and it takes painfully long for one dish to come out.  This is my first Chinese restaurant dinner where my family can actually finish a dish, and wait for 15 mins or more,  refilling my tea multiple times, and still not get the next dish.  Kitchen seems to be extremely disorganized. Some dishes taste like canned sauce.  Hot steamed bun has enough juice and the peel is thin enough,  but the minced pork's texture feels like it had been used to make a broth.  Tables are way too close together,  so everytime a waitress tries to reach a neighboring table of ours,  she pushes our chairs. Worse off,  there are two different tables around us and she needs two separate aisles! This means that she runs her greasy hands to dabble on our down winter coats while she pushes our chairs took get through the non-fire-compliant aisles.  She passes her dishes and hot soups in the air over the heads of the kids in my family.  Brocolli in egg dish not cooked through.  Bean tips over aged, very tough.  All tables got slow service,  combo meals or a la carte, although the restaurant was only 60 full. Don't even waste your time and money."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant since before it was even this restaurant.  The old owner went on to open A La Kitchen in Markham.

We come primarily for the lunch specials, but have dinner once in a while too, and they deliver to the immediate area which is nice. 

We have tried most of the menu and keep going back.  The quality of food is definitely there.  Definitely have the soup filled pan-fried pork dumplings."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials Mon to Friday till 3 pm for $6.99 at Tian Xin Place which is a Chinese restaurant that specialized in Shanghai cuisine. 

Their lunch specials though has a lot of selections but they are really all an entree that comes with a bowl of rice and a choice of soup or soy drink. 

I should have ordered the dumplings and other shanghai dim sum... but since I could never resist lunch specials I decide to try:

Fish Filet with Sweet and Sour Sauce and their hot and sour soup ($6.99) was disappointing... As there were more batter than the fish filet itself. OK my mistakes to order this as there are 16 other choices to choose from in their lunch menu....

I might come back and try out their dim sum... and definitely would not be ordering any Fish Filet with Sweet and Sour sauce again!"}
{"text":"Went here because Legend Chinese Restaurant closed on us after calling in and this was the closest Chinese restaurant that was \"open\".  Actually when I went in there and asked if they were open it was actually near past their closing time, but the owner said it was okay and our group of 10 people went in for dinner after watching a play.

We ordered 6 dishes off the menu based on the pictures

Onion pancake
Cold cuts (tofu, drunken chicken, meat+rice noodle with peanut sauce)
2 orders of siaw long pao (since there were 10 of us)
fish topped with egg
Shang Hai style pig belly
Meat and seafood with rice patties (not really on the picture, the one on the picture didn't have meat)

Though the order of the food was a little messed up, considering that it was late and they were kind to let us have our meal, I didn't factor it in.

Overall the food quality was good, the only problem is I didn't check the price, which may be why this is 5-stars.  However, presuming we paid $25 per person, I would say this was good quality.  The only thing left over was a couple of untouched bowls of steam rice.

The onion pancake was normal, nothing special.

The cold cuts were dishes I haven't really tried before, I just chose them by pictures and all of them tasted really good hard to say which one was my favorite.

The siaw long pao was good, so nothing special considering this is a Shang Hai place.  Granted if you're a Shang Hai place and you can't do this right you might as well shut down or get yourself franchised like Asian Legend.

They had a fish topped with egg dish.  Originally I was going to order something else, because I didn't think people would like this dish, but apparently it was someone's favorite so AWESOME and I like it too.  All I can say was it was good.

The Shang Hai style pig belly was okay, but the fat was a bit \"yucky oily\" though not as much as other places.  I ate this with the meat and sea food rice patties so it was a good mix.

Most people didn't have room for dessert so we skipped it.  Though I am thinking I want to try their rice dessert next time I go there.

However, the staff waiting on us was friendly and I would definitely come here again recommend it to other people.  I may stop recommending Legend in the area if I find out the price is good as well."}
