{"text":"Ridiculously small portions for the amount you pay!! The employees are not friendly and seem miserable working here. You are better off paying a little more for better quality and more food somewhere else in the airport! Or just bring a lunch from home!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5  Located in the E terminal around gate 20.  I hate eating greesy heavy fast food when traveling, it just makes me feel bad.  So when traveling with my husband and 2 children this is where we ate.  We are huge Moe's (also fast tex mex) fans and this place was pretty close.  We got 2 small buritos (one veg and one chicken) and a cheese quesadia.  It cost $18.00 plus some change.  So a bit pricy, but the quality is much better than other fast food options.  My 5 year old ate her entire burrito and my 8 year old her quesadia.  They were both a bit hungry afterwards.  I shared with my husbad and it was enough to take off the edge, but that's all.  The woman in front of us was one of those problem customers and she slowed the line way down so I'm not sure if they are slow normally or if they were hampered by the previous customer.  They have burritos, tacos, quesadias, and bowls.  The selection of meats is standard.  The vegetarian option is just veggies  (no tofu).  The salsa selection was nice and the ingredients whiel not fresh fresh were tasty.  Salt content was pretty good.  If I'm ever in Charlott again I would eat here again, unless I was trying to make a tight connection."}
{"text":"Well, I would've loved to have visited either Salsarita's location at the CLT airport however I couldn't get either location to answer the phone. I called during normal business hours to ask a question that depending on the answer, would result in if I would go there or not but since I can't get anyone to pick up the phone, I guess that's my answer right there. Unfortunate. Why list the phone number if you're not even going to answer? I called each location 3 times each."}
{"text":"Really! They refused to put my nachos on the side! I don't want it to be soggy when I'm on the plane. The old lady was snappy, and they got a messy kitchen. This is inside terminal E."}
{"text":"What airport location does not take the main business travelers card. To not take American Express is stupid. The lady behind the counter was as friendly as a pit viper to boot. Food was not bad but not spectacular either. With all of the other airport choices I will not e back."}
{"text":"2 pm Monday afternoon. Out of sour cream (ridiculous). Waited 15 minutes for what I thought were going to be freshly cooked fajita vegetables only to be told they were out of vegetables! I will never go to any franchise of this chain again!"}
{"text":"Below average Mexican food but better than Taco Bell. We got a veggie bowl and chips/salsa."}
{"text":"Airport breakfast is a tricky thing. If you have time for a proper breakfast you either A) are on an international or red eye layover or B) you do not like sleep and really like your breakfast dining in airports.   Personally I like to maximize pillow time so my breakfast needs to be quick and efficient without sending me to the airplane bathroom and subsequent apologetic walk of shame past those poor souls forced to sit near said bathroom.  Salsarita's delivers on the food without delivering to my airplane companions. The food is quick and clean. The service is cordial and polite. The smiling faces here give me the feeling that all is well with the world - and if I have an extra ten minutes to take my Salsarita's to the rocking chairs - their analysis is certainly correct.   When passing through CLT - consider Salsarita's. BK, Quizno's and Cinnabun may be known entities - but it's time to think outside the tortilla!"}
{"text":"Not terrible for a quick stop in the airport.  Especially if you are trying to avoid the fries and burger standards.  It was quick and fresh. A bit skimpy on the meat."}
{"text":"Sorry, if you are going to sell burritos and call yourself \"Salsarita's\", and you have no salsa and no hot sauce you don't deserve even a single star. I have eaten at Salsarita's many times and enjoyed it, but this airport location should go ahead and close forever."}
{"text":"This place has no idea how to make a burrito. As soon as I started trying to eat it everything exploded everywhere and made a huge mess in the airport"}
{"text":"Bland burrito (even with salsa, cilantro, onions, everything) couldn't finish it. And the chips were way over seasoned. Queso with the chips was the most edible thing but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"One of the better options for breakfast in the airport. It's also economical too especially if you compare it with the other food places. I got the bowl with the add-ons that they provide and it was good. I chose chicken out of the three proteins (beef, chicken and bacon). Neither the beef or bacon looked appetizing."}
{"text":"This is just another one of the many burrito and taco restaurant that are similar to moes or Chipotle . Overall it is probably not that exceptional. However for being in an airport the prices are pretty good and the food is decent. I got a bowl there for about $8."}
{"text":"Bland airport Mexican food that doesn't satisfy your Mexi-cravings, but will fill you up.  It seems sort of like Chipotle's crappy little brother.  I got a large (the normal size at Chipotle) burrito with chicken that was unevenly chopped (some pieces were morsels and some could barely fit in my mouth), flavorless rice, pico de gallo, corn, onions, cilantro, lettuce, and a \"little bit of sour cream.\"  In addition to throwing things onto the tortilla as if they were filled with all the hate and scorn of someone who has just missed a flight and been re-booked into a middle seat that doesn't recline, they threw in a huge gob of sour cream.    The one thing they have over Chipotle is the option to have cilantro and chopped onions.  How come Chipotle doesn't have that?  Surly service + mediocre (but certainly edible) food + cilantro & chopped onions = 2 stars"}
{"text":"Meh, bland food and a # 2 between the two other vendors in terminal E"}
{"text":"Agree w Emily N. great stop in E concourse. Opt for the chopped steak burrito (small is plenty big) chips and hot salsa!"}
{"text":"Kept us going on a marathon multileg flight --- definitely a cut above your average terminal food.  Good beans, good cheese, and surprisingly good salsa.  Don't know if I'd patronize a center-of-town burrito place at this level --- but for an airport, it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Pretty bad attempt at quick TeX/Mex ... Ingredients overall lacked flavor everything came from a can and my tacos were served cold.  Sad."}
{"text":"Was here for a layover and tried the chips and salsa .  A fair amount of chips with very little salsa given so it was not a good deal at all.   The BBQ place next door was actually pretty decent.  Would not come here again if I have a layover in the airport again"}
{"text":"Not much taste but the best I could do around here being Gluten Free and Vegetarian.  Chips are super thin, they break when you try to dip them. Salsa, black beans, rice, Guacamole were all sides.  Portions are small except for the chips. And this is someone who is happy with a kids meal usually!   Really, how much does rice cost them?"}
{"text":"Short and simple here: the food was hot, the selection was good, and the line moved quickly. Noting about this place is authentic or gourmet, but it worked for killing time on a layover.  Solid airport food."}
{"text":"Good healthy airport food.  I get two soft chicken tacos.  Tastes same as Moe's ,etc.  Fast service, made to order."}
{"text":"Prices are high, service is comically poor.. that being said... I can't wait to layover in charlotte, bc I love the nachos that much... the corn salsa?! Delicious. I like customizable anything.. add fresh taste veggies?  Sold.. it's a worthy stop for the closest to quality airport food you're going to find in a food court."}
{"text":"Not a bad stop for airport food. I got the chicken bowl and it was very filling. Would have gave it a four star review but the lettuce was not fresh and the black beans were nothing to write home about. The flavor of the chicken and salsa made up for it though. Was okay."}
{"text":"After a night spent in the airport, my dad and I were on the hunt for something decent to eat. We decided to try Salsarita's because the line was short, the prices were fair for airport food and the food looked fresh. Overall, it was an alright experience.  I got a breakfast burrito with egg, bacon, lettuce etc. and it was good. Apparently, they don't usually warm up the burritos because when I asked one of the ladies she said they only do that for quesadillas. My dad got a quesadilla and I had to watch as his was done to perfection. Luckily, another server offered to warm mine up. She was without a doubt the friendliest person I met on that trip, and thank goodness for that because based on the experiences I had in the NC Airport, I would not want to visit the city."}
{"text":"I got the breakfast burrito with salsa and they should have just poured water straight into it. Tasteless and gross. (I'm saying the salsa is waaaaaay to watery)"}
{"text":"I was hungry. But I'm disappointed in Salsarita's. So the employees were not very keen on friendliness but it's an airport so I get it. And I guess this place thinks that steak is the same thing as pot roast? That's what my steak quesadilla tasted like. Yay for free refills on drinks, but if you're looking to satisfy your hunger, pass this place up."}
{"text":"After a LONG day of travel and an unexpected 2 hour stop in Charlotte, a fresh option like Salsarita's was a nice surprise for airport food. I'm a fan of the \"build your own burrito\" concept, so that helps... I know it's not everyone's idea of a great meal.  I had never actually heard of Salsarita's, but judging by the previous reviews, it must be a chain... and apparently this airport \"Express\" location doesn't have all of the usual options. That's okay - they had everything I needed, including various meats, beans, salsas, and veggie toppings.   It was definitely a much better choice, tase-wise, than the Papa John's and Burger King located on either side. The line was much shorter, too. Honestly, for about $6 for a huge burrito, it's a great airport food option. A small can of Pringles costs $3 on a plane, after all."}
{"text":"It was OK. Chicken was a bit dry. Salsa was tasty. Friendly service. Cheaper than other Mexican options."}
{"text":"Its not that hard to smile and pretend the customer exists.  They also burnt the breakfast food.  Don't go for breakfast.  They are more interested in talking to the other staff than working."}
{"text":"For airport food this is pretty good. Fresh, tasty ingredients and not too expensive. I don't normally review airport restaurants but this was worth the stop."}
{"text":"Above average airport food. I ordered the chicken tacos with chips & guacamole. The tacos were flavorful and fresh (cilantro is a bonus) and the guacamole was good. A very refreshing option from the rest of the other gross fast-food chains. Another bonus, the staff were quick & friendly, not grumpy at all! I also agree with other reviewers that this is also a much healthier option than other places in the airport."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, always reliable. I had a salsarita's on my college campus so maybe I am biased. Maybe it invokes a little bit of nostalgia in me.  I am a BIG mexican food fan and I enjoy this place. The menu and ordering style is similar to chipotle. But correct me if I'm wrong, I think Salsarita's was around before chipotle.  Anyway, the food is always fresh and tasty. This location was very fast and efficient at lunch rush. I saw that they were changing out some trays of food and keeping things fresh. Stop by if you're having a Mexican food craving at the airport."}
{"text":"Had the bacon breakfast burrito.  Looked horrible when they were \"assembling\" it. Should have walked away.    Tasted like it looked"}
{"text":"It is your basic airport food, but a better option than the burger king right next to it. I got the grilled steak salad. I added hot salsa, corn salsa, and guacamole. The steak was good and tender. The hot salsa is spicy so be aware that it is what it says it is. The price was a little too much, but overpriced airport food is the usual."}
{"text":"He stood in the face of a 2.5 star biz, and braved it anyway.  Salsarita's is overpriced and fairly plain, but I'll give them this: it's not bad at all. Two steak tacos, with a side of chips and guac, and a bottomless soda will run you around $14. Ridiculous on the street, where tacos are king, but reasonable in a concourse that's flooded with stupid expensive, mediocre options.  The steak is sitting is a brine-laden warming tray, so it's hot and moist. Your choice of toppings - including guac! - are mostly veg and salsas of varying heat. Nothing wilty, gritty or wonky; the 'cado dip needed salt and acid. If you go soft shell on the tacos, eat quickly - single torts will disintegrate post-haste. The chips are warm and non-greasy.  I'm not doing backflips over Salsarita's, but I'm not doubled over a Term E stall - so it's a win (enough) for me."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Salsarita's Express. I got a big portion for the price I paid and it was decent food. I ordered the steak tacos and they allow you to decide what toppings you want on the steak. I also tried the hot salsa and chip which were good."}
{"text":"Typical airport food, was not expecting anything special when eating here. The customer service was great, very attentive employees and quick. The food quality was average, but at least it was not extra for guacamole. Overall a decent place to grab a quick bite before the plane ride."}
{"text":"If you need a quick fix of mexican food on the go at CLT, this works, but don't expect  anything incredible. Cheap, quick and basic. The chicken was dry and sub par, the rice was likely from a box, but it was pretty much what you'd expect for an airport burrito bar."}
{"text":"Worst service in the planet! I wasn't really in the mood for Papa Johns, Burger King, Chinese, or Chilis, so I went with Salsarita. The burrito was good and affordable, but your staff is super mean!   I asked for a chicken burrito and made it a combo, I asked the lady if the burrito brought chips and she rolled her eyes at me and says to the other employee \"don't give her chips, she don't want em\". I'm like \"I do\" and she rolled her eyes and kept saying \"ugh\". Then I asked them if the combo brought soda and she didn't answer me. I think she's mad at the world or something, must really hate her job.   I would give the burrito and chips, a 3.5, it was pretty good! As for customer service, I have to give you guys 1 star because you guys need to replace your staff!"}
{"text":"Food rating:  3.5 stars  My bf and I were laying over at the Charlotte airport and were hungry.  Thanks to the Yelp mobile application for the Blackberry, we actually found reviews for another Salsarita's location - http://www.yelp.com/biz/salsaritas-fresh-cantina-charlotte-5  Based on that, we decided to head over to the main terminal.  As the reviews described on the link above, it is very similar to Qdoba or Chipotle for those that aren't familiar.  I'm happy to report that unlike Chipotle, Salsarita's doesn't charge extra for Guacamole.  Woot.  My bf ordered a salad bowl and I ordered a burrito.  Both were pretty fresh (considering that we were at the airport).  Another added benefit is that it passed the \"eyeball\" test.  We saw some pilots lining up... and that's got to be a good thing (considering that they are probably at the airport very often).  Overall, the ingredients were pretty fresh and not loaded with salt.  Woot!"}
{"text":"Still sick. Do not eat here unless you want to puke your brains out 7 hours later. The food looked old and I should've known better and now I am paying dearly for it."}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food, and a better choice than Burger King next door.  My chicken quesadilla was actually pretty tasty.  I like that they don't nickle and dime you to death with toppings and that you can choose whatever toppings you like.  Even sour cream and guacamole!  The rice and (refried) beans were a bit bland, however."}
{"text":"Mexican food at an airport and it's good!  I hit them up for breakfast and it made for a good time!"}
{"text":"Great, fast service...exactly what I'm looking for at an airport! The food was hot and fresh, lots of options. I'd go again!"}
{"text":"Veggie burrito was very good. Try the NoDa beer in a can $ 6.50 vs $10 beers at bar next door."}
{"text":"One star is too generous. You couldn't serve this food at a kennel. No redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Stopped to get some quick, somewhat healthy food. Both tacos started off with a bite into those hard stems on the end of avocados in the guacamole (or tomato stems, not completely sure) Terrible. Can't enjoy food if I have to worry about breaking my teeth on it."}
{"text":"Vegan option when stuck in the airport  Since I was given a bonus 8 hours in the airport I ran out of food I had packed and saw that this place had several items that could be made vegan. I agree with the other posters, kind of bland, even with the fresh cilantro and medium salsa and jalapenos. They kind of skimped on the veggies which was annoying since I ordered a veggie burrito. But the staff was friendly and pretty fast. If abandoned by my airline again here I would probably eat here again since for airport food it was not as outrageous in price as one usually experienced, but will not seek them out when I have actual options. Frankly, I really only ate here because they had something vegan and was annoyed at being at the airport for so long."}
{"text":"The correct name of this business is \"Salsarita's Express,\" (see the attached pic).  Salsarita's Express is located in the Atrium area of Charlotte Douglas International Airport - almost a food court feel to the area.  We stopped in here for a quick bite during a layover. I ordered the grilled chicken salad - with corn, red onions, black beans, and jalapeños. Probably one of the healthier dinner options available compared to all of the fast food. Overall, a fair salad - nothing about it would make you say \"Wow.\" But it was filling.  Of course you can get more traditional psuedo Mex fare here as well: Burritos, Tacos, and such."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. The better realization here folks might be that those who eat fast food think fast food is awesome.  Those that came in with 5 star expectations who ate at a fine steakhouse last night will have their hope crushed. Expectations people.   I'd personally suggest to come in with zero expectations, possibly on a Thursday because you get a free beverage with a taco salad. Just enough food to hold me and another yelper over til we arrive home later.    You could always downgrade a notch and try out burger kings mystery meat next door?   Good luck Mexican foodies!"}
{"text":"This place sucks especially the white manager guy..they charge 8 bucks for a regular size bowl and the quantity is amazingly less and gone guy was extremely rude ..he was trying to save as many salsa and other veggies as e could ....DISSAppointed"}
{"text":"The gal I dealt with glared at me. Like she dared me to waste her precious time with my stupid order. Then she literally threw the contents of my tacos together and slid them down the line.  I give low ratings to businesses that throw my food.  2013 #171 / 365"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch while waiting for our next flight.  For airport food, it was pretty decent.  I wish that I had known that some dish already includes beans / rice such that I wouldn't accidentally an extra side of it.  The service was as expected for a busy airport food stand."}
{"text":"Great customer service but lacking good food. Tortilla wasn't fully heated so the folks here don't know how to properly heat a tortilla and wanted to add black beans to my burrito. I was like ugh and was quick to tell him no. Any place that thinks black beans is best for a burrito definitely doesn't know it's stuff. Asked for the hottest salsa and they said it was the green one and I was skeptical but in a hurry. Boy it was not even hot and was the typical salsa verde with sweetness. Giving one star just because they were nice and good at customer service but bad at food service."}
{"text":"It's Mexican-American fast food in an airport's food court. With places like these, you can already know what to expect before you even order. Salsarita's was good to me, however, and it got the job of filling my stomach done pretty well. I would personally be more interested in what the other restaurants of the airport have to offer during my next trip, but I had a good quick lunch here and can't complain.  In terms of quality, this is perhaps a notch or two below Chipotle. I ordered a large burrito bowl for $7.89 and sure enough, it was all the normal contents of a burrito served in a black plastic bowl instead. Possibly because all this food was spread out rather than compacted into a tortilla, there seemed to be more food in here than what you would find in an ordinary burrito. I still can't tell whether that bowl created the illusion of more food.  The rest of my family ordered a chicken nacho for $7.79. This whole thing was apparently enough to satisfy three people somehow. Probably the inclusion of rice and black beans helped to make these nachos more filling. The prices here were low, and we got all the food we needed for lunch before we had to hurry to catch our flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This food is by no means award-winning, but it's appropriate for an airport like this one."}
{"text":"While waiting for my next flight, I decided to head to Salsarita's since I was craving Mexican food, and didn't want the typical fast food burger or Starbuck's.  I ordered steak tacos with a side of chips and salsa.  The steak tacos tasted weird - almost as if the steak was pork.  The chips and salsa were ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Salsarita's express is a must! It out beats all other airport food and it is very very fresh. The hot sauce couuuuld be a little hotter (but I'm not complaining!) And the prices was pretty good, considering it's airport pricing. Loves it! I want to find the real salsarita's to eat at."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise.  Fresh. Tasty. Well-made. Yummy.  Sure, it is still airport food, but decent airport food? Seriously? Yes indeed. I had a burrito with shredded chicken and all of the fixings. No refried beans here. Nope, real black beans. Even better.  Defininitely a winner and a healthier (I think) alternative to the fast food places located in the airport. Certainly better for your heart than Cinnabon."}
{"text":"Unless I have a stellar experience, 3 stars is about all I can give any airport eatery. So using that logic, Salsarita's Express is about as good as it can get. I had a breakfast burrito that tasted fine and did the job between flights. I don't know that I'd recommend anyone to have it but I doubt I'd recommend anyone to an airport eatery anyway.  The service was friendly and fast though, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I ordered chips with guacamole and side of fajita vegetables.  Chips were light and crispy, no complaints here.  Guac was so loaded with onion it was difficult to taste the avocado.  The side of fajita vegetables contained 2 slivers of red bell pepper and the rest was onions.  I would only return here for chips and even that would be questionable given the unpleasant counter service."}
{"text":"If you're watching your sodium intake then this is the place for you. It looks much better than it tastes."}
