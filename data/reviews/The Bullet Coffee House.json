{"text":"I work in the same area as this coffee shop and it is amazing! So many yummy options to choose from and the service is great! My personal fav' is the Charlie Brown, which tastes like a delicious peanut butter cookie straight out of the oven in liquid form.  Highly recommend trying this place out. Even on my days off I find myself sneaking over for a fix, so be careful this stuff is highly addictive!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to kill some time while my dog was at the groomers. I work remotely, so I am always looking for a new spot to get some work done. When I walked in, the coffee shop was smaller than I had expected, and it is not conducive to those who live the \"laptop lifestyle.\" Seating is limited, so this coffee shop is more geared to those \"grab & go\" customers. There is a small couch, if you did want to come here with a friend a visit a while. 

I ordered a bullet coffee with a bagel breakfast sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious! The cheese was melting off of the sandwich, and I wish I had taken a picture before I gobbled it all up. The staff is super friendly, and the space is very clean. If you're looking for a quick, caffeine pick me up and a small treat, this is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place more because it seems like a locally owned business and the girl was lovely at the counter, but really I can't say it was awesome. The espresso was terrible. I had to throw it away. Also they don't have any bathrooms."}
