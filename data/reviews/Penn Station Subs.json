{"text":"Worst service ever.  Clueless employees wrong order and terribly slow.   Trying to hide incompetence with a fake cheeriness"}
{"text":"* Super greassssy sandwiches * Salads made on shredded lettuce  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I think it's a little expensive, though. I bought a sandwich for myself and one for my beautiful mom. We shared an order of fries, and my toddler demanded a cookie.  We didn't order drinks because we took them home to eat. Totally worth the money! There were tons of fries left over. Even with my toddler hogging out on them on the ride home, we had plenty with our sandwiches. I will eat here again, for sure."}
{"text":"Super long wait. Staff is treating the guy who is cleaning the store terribly. He is the only one working! Poorly managed. Feel bad for the nice pleasant guy working hard while the other screw off on the back...they got a 3 solely for all the one guy's hard work."}
{"text":"There's something about the bread at Penn Station that makes you crave a sub from them. My favorite sub is the artichoke with mushroom. So creamy and tasty and supposedly on the lighter option menu even though it doesn't taste even close to light. Get the mushrooms on it!  The Reuben breaks the rules by having a white bread roll instead of rye but it is awesome.  I keep meaning to try the other subs but the artichoke has me mesmerized and I can't stop ordering it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I am in love.  Fresh cut fries and lemonade are great with the subs too."}
{"text":"I was really pleased. This was the best East Coast style Reuben that I have had in Kent, ever."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get a hot sub that tastes really good at a decent price.  This place is always neat and clean and quick to serve with a full compliment of friendly staff.  I have never had any problems going here and always leave happy.  My favorite sub is the Artichoke sub and this is coming from a person who LOVES the Philly Beef.  Worth the trip if you want a good sandwhich!"}
