{"text":"I came here because there are literally 0 local coffee shops in the Glendale/Peoria area, this popped up and I had to try! Staff is incredibly friendly, they offer a great selection and they use Press coffee. I definitely recommend. The shopping center its in is a little rough, but the bar itself is adorable. Get out there and support our local community!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The customer service is always super good, and the coffee is delicious! So excited to see how successful the owners will be! Vanilla iced latte with coconut milk is unbelievably delicious guys!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The best coffee in the valley thus far. They use the best syrups \"Monin\", friendly staff and just amazing taste. Had the peanut butter coco coffee. YUM! One of the very few coffee shops that use peanut butter. Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go up to in the morning. There is no sitting area, The menu is simple but delicious, and everyone is very friendly. 
I am glad there is a coffee shop on Glendale before downtown with the big parking lot!!
And there is a Mexican bakery across the road... coffee and pan dulce. I'm sold!!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot little spot to enjoy coffee. 1st time here and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been comming here for a few weeks and I love it! It's such a cute coffee stand, and the staff is so sweet. I recommend the Very Veggie panini, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Dapper & Stout Coffee. Customer service was excellent and everything was delicious. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love braistas!!! Friendliest staff around! The coffee is great! So many delicious coffee drinks to choose from. Although the coffee is incredible, I'm so in love with the paninis! The ham, white cheddar and bread and butter pickle panini is so good!!!! I can't believe this little coffee shop has such amazing and tasty food to offer! Its worth your time to check it out! You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try even though it was very out of my way as I was traveling from New Mexico to LA.  I ordered an iced Americano since the barista said they had no decaf espresso, I got a regular (I love coffee, I drink decaf as it had less of a diuretic affect on my body).  I was speaking with the owner Aaron and during or discussion on coffee places locally and far away I mentioned I drink decaf and wished he had some, he said he just got some decaf beans in today and he made me another iced coffee with the decaf that was actually a nice caramel taste, no charge since the barista didn't know about the menu change.  I would definitely stop here again, just for the coffee.  If and when they get some more healthy eats, I will try that too.  I gave four stars because anyone can make a good coffee once, so when I return and if the coffee is consistently good, Ill update my rating."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! The staff is really nice and the coffee is delicious. They also have a selection of fresh made paninis, muffins, along with cinnamon rolls and pretzels. Their menu also has what they call  \"cereal frappes\" that are made with real cereal, apple jacks, cocopuff, and cinnamon toast crunch are the flavors they come in. You should definitely stop by this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite morning coffee shops. They remodeled and it was for the better! It isn't in a grest area but for grab and go coffee and snacks it's perfect! The staff is amazing and I have yet to have a single drink be less than amazing!"}
{"text":"Officially my favorite coffee place!! Everything tastes amazing and the customer service is so great!"}
{"text":"We just ordered coffee, tea, and food from here to be delivered to our work this morning. And I am so glad we did. Not only was the food amazing but the coffee is even better. One of the best macchiatos I have ever had. Definitely will be going/ordering from here a lot more!"}
{"text":"Not very pleased with the manager. Not friendly at all. Drinks on the other hand are good but people also make the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Typically a Starbucks junkie but this place is something else! Came here for the first time & everything was wonderful! I will definitely be a returning customer! I absolutely love the simple yet unique concept (it's different than any other coffee shop I have ever encountered). Phenomenal coffee, & the staff/management are beyond words. I highly recommend that you try it yourself, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This Coffee Shop is an awesome place I am so pleased that it is close to my school. Staff was great drinks and food was amazing. The aesthetic was pleasing for instagram pics. I will honestly be back."}
{"text":"Like I have said before, I really hate leaving 1 star reviews but this is needed. 

Idk if I came on a off day or cause it was Sunday but nothing was really right. Lady with the glasses was super nice though and she mentioned it was her second week, which is fine and had no issues. But she was not able to log in the POS system and I offered to pay cash to make it easier. I asked how much and she stated $5.75 which seems high for a 24 oz iced coffee and we both looked at the menu and it was just $3.75 then I showed her my yelp check in which gave me a $1 off she saw it and said ok. 

She tried again to login and it still didn't work so I got cash from my car and gave her a 5 and 75 cents expecting $3 bucks back then I was going to tip 1 dollar. When I gave her the money she couldn't open the drawer and just said \"can I just give you back a dollar cause idk how it is with tax\" at this point I was over it and said yes. So I basically paid $4.75 for a coffee that was suppose to be $2.75. 

Now, I wouldn't have cared much cause it was close to 5 bucks if the coffee was good but it wasn't. It was weak, with only 1 shot in a 24 oz cup which is crazy. I have never seen so much milk poured in a coffee for a breve ever. 

Wanted to give this place a try cause of the reviews and I was around the area where there wasn't much coffee choices but will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! I love this place! They should open 10 more as fast as possible. I can't say enough about the place. Great atmosphere, staff, & coffee! I even met the owner he's a great guy! This place treats you like one of the family. I love this place and hope there are many more to come very soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it the chick that was working there was SUUPER cool and our drinks were off the chain! #yummy #nicestemployeeever"}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning to try a new place. Not what I expected for sure. It is a walk up window. The owner was serving up drinks this morning. He was incredibly friendly and helped my husband, my 2 yo and I find some delicious drinks. I had the Mexican white macchiato iced.(I am still thinking about it!) my husband got the chai vanilla latte icees) and a strawberry banana smoothie. 

It's was quick and such a great local place. We can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and I'm in love . It is clean, well decorated, and even the plants are well maintained! I was completely rude and didn't get the owner's name but he was a complete delight! Looking at his business you can tell he has thought of every little detail. He was kind enough to make my daughter a less than hot, hot chocolate and when she opened up the cup in the car she was so excited about the unexpected marshmallows. And the little snowmen stickers placed over the drinking spout were so sweet. It's the little things. We don't live near here but we'll be back regardless. It's worth going out of your way. Oh and most importantly, the coffee was some of the best I've ever had. Dark chocolate macchiato was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Been using Uber Eats for this place, I ordered with my boyfriend this time around and even as a picky eater he totally agrees it's great. I'm absolutely glad to update my review from what I gave before after seeing online photos that horribly represented this place. The owner responded to my previous review (which was certainly disappointed with how low class these girls looked for such great food)and as to what's being told, there's not a tacky mismatch corset theme, yay! DEFINITELY can't wait to go eat there with my bf and our son. please try this place :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place great customer service and the coffee is so good mocha timety ladies for the great coffee and service"}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Delicious coffee drinks! It's my go to coffee spot! Oh...and the paninis are incredible!"}
{"text":"Staff is so friendly and helpful, and coffee is great! I love the \"All Day\" which gives me my protein shake and espresso all in one. And it is sooooo delicious. So happy to have a great coffee shop in this area, which has definitely been lacking. Yay!"}
{"text":"The hidden gem in Glendale, always clean, quick and easy to understand the menu, if you haven't tried this place give it a try you won't regret ut"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, local is always best. The staff here was very kind and the area is very clean and modern. I'll make sure to stop more often when in the area. Can't see what this place has in store."}
{"text":"Super cute little coffee shop, the people there are so sweet and friendly! They also allowed me to use my own protein instead of theirs. They were so kind, and the coffee is great :) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So happy to see they changed from bra-istas to dapper and stout!!! I think they will attract more customers with their friendlier vibe. That is a big deal to have to change all of their signs, cups, merchandise, advertising, etc. so I am happy to see that it was worth it to them!! I still love the coffee and feel more inclined to go a little out of my way to come here again now! See you tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Tried this shop on a whim and I'm so glad I did! Great service and great coffee. Reasonably priced and great sizes! They had many other non coffee options, a good choice for anyone wanting a little pick me up. Will definitely be back! Best coffee in Glendale. 

Their food also looked delicious I'll have to try it next time!"}
{"text":"awesome place for my 2nd time!! love their drinks ice caramel macchiato & blended nutella protein.  nice customer service..  thanks"}
{"text":"A good place to drink great coffee; most of all it's local. Ive experience enjoyable customer service from all the employees. Give them a try if you haven't already, better than a corporate company over all. Support your  local communities and the small businesses."}
{"text":"This place has plenty of options to fulfill everyone's perfect drink fix! Smoothies, protein shakes, fraps & of course a load of coffee options  & the paninis/sandwiches that are made and sold here are a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Get coffee here all the time! One of the best if not the best in Phoenix. Definitely would love to see the place grow and add more locations around the valley."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Staff was friendly. My frapp was pretty good, not too sweet and whip cream was fresh whipped cream. The cold brew however was a little weak, but very bitter. It taste burnt and was nearly unpalatable. /: Would go again if I was in the area, just probably wouldn't get the cold brew again."}
{"text":"Absolutely darling. Hands down the best coffee shop. Must try the butter cake& of course it goes well with a double shot of espresso with a little steamed somethin' 
It's got the cutest outdoor seating and the attention to detail with the decorations is an interior designers work of art. Well done Dapper & Stout Coffee Company"}
{"text":"It's easy to find a coffee shop. They're practically on every corner, but to find one that is more than pouring hot cups of joe and mediocre customer service is more difficult. Ive heard quite a bit about Dapper and Stout and it's been on my list of places to check out for a while. I couldn't have been more excited to be able to plan my morning meeting up with one of my girlfriends and trying this place out finally. First impression was that this location doesn't fit for all this place is and can be in the future. The surrounding strip mall is a dive with some questionable people constantly walking in and out of a smoke shop next door and TASC right next to that. This is an outside only coffee shop so it made it a bit awkward. The shop is perfect. The windows are open wide and inviting. There's great signage on the wall with awesome blue lighting behind it to make it pop. The menu is clear and easy to read, the vibe is what you'd feel like downtown laid back, hipster , just come as yourself kinda place. The service was out of this world. The owner was very welcoming, gave us some background, helped us with all the questions we had, and made us feel so welcome. The conversation wasn't forced and I love that you could see he loved what he does. We need more these kind of places. . I ordered a Mexican White chocolate Mocha which is basically what it states, but with cinnamon added. Let me tell you what...This is usually my go to drink, but by adding cinnamon it kicked it up a notch.  A taste that soothes the soul, makes you want to savor every drop. It had me feeling right at home and wanting to stay a while. I also ordered a breakfast bagel. It came with pesto Mayo, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, bacon and scrambled egg. I'll tell you I am not a fan of mayo, but being advised they don't do substitutions I went for it for the full experience and it did not disappoint. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. My friend ordered a very veggie panini and she also said it was so great. I wish this place had more locations so I could come more often. As I said this place would be perfect at a place like West Gate or even a pop up shop downtown somewhere. Because this location just isn't doing them justice. For those of you who haven't been. Give it a chance. Don't judge on the initial appearance of the surrounding area. You'll be kicking yourself later. I will say however if the service and coffee weren't so above and beyond awesome I would've given only 4 stars for the area. Thanks for such a great experience today Aaron. You rock that shop!"}
{"text":"What a sight for sore eyes. I have a latte every morning and it is always Brewed to perfection!
This is a genuine quality product. If the lattes and the smoothies don't have you coming back the beautiful hosted will! Way to go, welcome to Glendale!"}
{"text":"Had a white mocha with cinnamon. Nicely flavored drink. Quick service and large sizes. I'll be coming back to try the rest of their drinks."}
{"text":"SUUPER CUTE! And the coffee is excellent! I visited Braistas for the first time this morning with my mom. I ordered the \"All Day\" protein/ coffee smoothie (Wow) and my mom ordered an iced caramel macchiato +the $2 green tea. Everything was phenomenal and the owner Aaron was super friendly and personable. The outside seating area has two tables and about 4 chairs per table. The menu is packed with variety and they offer a $1 off/ item when you check in on yelp. AND he gave me a punch card. I'll definitely be stopping back here soon since it's right down the street from me. I've been looking for good coffee in Glendale and we finally have it! You definitely have to check out Braistas if you're in the mood for coffee and a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this coffee shop to any coffee lover out there! My roommate and I always choose this place to make our coffee runs and splurges because it's cute, quick, and always super friendly. We've becomes such regulars here we go through their stamp cards like nothing. The menu is short and simple but their options and blends are perfect. I would highly recommend the Blended Nutella Protein Banana Milk with Espresso - it's Delish!"}
{"text":"This place is quite a fresh take on an older side of Glendale. The service was friendly and the coffee tasted great! The nitro cold brew and their take on the macchiato was quite delicious; love that they grind the beans right in front of you so you know it's fresh. Definitely coming back next time we are on this side of the Valley!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! Excellent customer and an overall good vibe. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Soy chai, Americano and Hot Chocolate for the lil' one. Yummo! Great customer service, cute location. Would definitely recommend and return thr next time we are in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great experience, finally a place where you get big time service with a small business feel . Everyone there is nice and genuine, the owner was there as well and made sure all our food was made perfect!thank you ! I will be a long time regular"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. The ownership, management, and staff are amazing. They treat you like loyalty and make your experience one of a kind. 
They use PRESS espresso beans that are roasted locally in Tempe. Starbucks coffee has nothing on this place. 
It's a unique concept. I mean where can you get a delicious mocha latte, French toast panini made fresh and served by beautiful females dressed in corsets and Chuck Taylor's? 

Come check this place out, I guarantee 110% you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great, service is good too. Came in one early Saturday morning. Worked on some homework. Unfortunately they don't have Wi-Fi but as for me I have unlimited hotspot so I myself didn't have much of a problem. It's still a nice hidden spot. Grab you coffee and go kind of place. They do have patio area. Right now it's just two tables but the place is new so they could end up adding more. I would come back. More than likely will. I got a 16oz Mocha it was delish!"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the breakfast bagel sandwich, it was amazing. The egg, cheese, bacon, pesto, with the red peppers are delish. This might be my fav breakfast sandwich ever. I saw how big it was and thought I could never eat the whole thing....and then did! Service is great, everyone is friendly and personable. I didn't get coffee but the tea is great too."}
{"text":"This place has a little drink called The Bowtie and it's absolutely amazing. A must if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The best coffee in Glendale. The pesto and mozz panini is ridiculously good. Aaron is super nice and makes one hell of a coffee."}
{"text":"Easy to find! Our drinks were made quickly and tasted good. I got the iced chai tea with coconut milk, and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Bras: The ongoing female torture device.

So my bruh had been wanting to go here forever. It just so happened that we both had a late-start day of work on a Monday. He had to bribe me with lunch and coffee to get me out of the house though because I would have just slept in if he didn't. I'm 24/7 tired, okay?

After lunch, we got our coffee. I was excited to see some boobies but was more pleasantly surprised to see them using Press roasted coffee beans. Their large drinks are humungous and at only $5-something a pop, why not?! I liked the Chai tea latte and loved the caramel macchiato! As for the boobies?, all skin and cleavage was hidden behind a corset. :'( The cups are also adorned with a corset decal and it's too cute!

The location isn't the safest as there is a drug screening place a few doors down. I worry about the ladies who work here! But it's a great unpretentious shop with some outdoor seating. There's no actual indoors so just sit on their supplied lawn furniture! I wonder if they can add misters though. It would help keep people cool. Anyways, they make a solid coffee drink. I wouldn't mind coming back. They also have dairy alternatives here!"}
