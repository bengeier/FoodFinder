{"text":"I've come to this place since I was little. It's literally part of my childhood. I feel like I grew up with the guy that works the window. He has been working there forever and is always super friendly! No matter if it's 3 am and I need Carne asada fried or its noon and I need a bean and cheese burrito for lunch. I don't know his name but he is always smiling and just happy to be there! It's such a joy to see him.

And don't even get me started on the food! 10/10! Five stars! Two thumbs up! I have never walked away disappointed or hungry. My favorites are Carne asada burrito, super breakfast burrito, California burrito, and the veggie burrito. No matter what I always get a side of chips and guacamole! 

They will always hold a special place in my heart...and my stomach"}
{"text":"they say its the best one out of them all becuase of expediency quality and the fact that they pay attention to you when you walk up to the window and everything taste like its fresh"}
{"text":"Carna Asada burrito with cheese, gacumula,  sour cream, and pico will make your tummy shut up for a good price.. It's just to bad that the meal doesn't include a drink.  That's just the down side. Everything is all separate price and they'll charge you for everything, if you under stand what I'm saying"}
{"text":"The BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had!!! I was shocked!!! My friend took me here while visiting AZ and I would have never expected such an excellent meal! I have asked multiple times to go back and am going to make sure I have atleast one more burrito from here before I go home. The meat was very flavorful and the tortilla was so soft and light. You have to go here!!!!"}
{"text":"pretty darn good food at a damn good price! sometimes a little attitude by the cashier from time to time, otherwise 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but service it is not.. I went and ask for xtra green sauce, and he gave me one of each, I don't get where the xtra green salsa is in that.  I also got a horchata, and forgot to give it to me so I went back I told him and he said OK just back up, and I get that they were a few cars in line so I appreciate the fact that he did wanted me to wait, but when I go by the entrance, he is just standing at the window waiting for me to get off my car to give me my drink.  What's the point of going through the drive-thru if I need to get off my car.. I do not mind waiting in line but at least for a good customer service he should've taking the drink to my car."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday evening and got the mega breakfast burrito (at least that's what I think it was called).  Let me just say that when a breakfast burrito has ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, AND cheese you always go for it.  It was delicious and I highly recommend stoping by.  They have a drive thru but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's \"fast food\".  High quality, I will be returning soon for another delicious burrito."}
{"text":"Holy amazing burrito, Batman! I totally forgot my breakfast and this is on my way to work. The sausage, egg and chess were, hot melty and perfect. The hot sauce was spicy with a hint of vinegar. I will be full all day! I was skeptical because the outside was sketchy...but I will be stopping again!"}
{"text":"God bless Rolberto's for being a hop, skip and a stumble from home.  Thanks goes for being open 24 hours - especially on late nights when I need some greasy carby goodness to soak up the alcohol and prevent the hangover from hell.  Everyone - you can categorize this with all the other Erto's (Filiberto's, Raliberto's, etc.) 

I must admit I have never had Rolberto's sober or during the day, so I can't vouch for food quality.  But I'm sure it's shitty.  As a matter of fact ,Sunday morning I had to deep clean my kitchen because I was about to hurl from the residual stench of the food.  But that is neither here nor there.  Major points go to Rolberto's simply for providing another alternative to barfy fast food and the Gay Denny's.  The chicken torta and carne asada burritos are good (read - digestable).  But don't blame me if you get sick!!"}
{"text":"If you're gonna be one of the ERTOS, at least be consistent.

Whether its a Robertos, Roybertos or Bertoberto- one thing I like is that they all kinda taste the same and I can go to any and expect the same thing. I didn't get that at Rolbertos.

I ordered the carne asada burrito and super nachos. The burrito tortilla was dry and had a flour-y residue on it. While it was a good sized burrito, the what seemed like day old guacamole just ruined it for me.

On to the super nachos. When I opened the box, the yellow melted cheese atop the mound of meat was just begging to be devoured. I couldn't make it wait so I dove it. Bad idea. Where are all the chips?!?!

It was buried underneath all the toppings and I couldn't grab anything. So I said... FORK IT! The chips were soggy and no crunch to any of them at all. For the first time, there were more meat and toppings on this than chips. 

Now we all know that despite which 24 hr taco shop you go to, the proof is in the hot sauce. And... a hit.. and it was just okay. I've had better and it could be spicier. 

This does not live up the ERTO legacy at all. My $11 could have been better spent at Taco Bell tonight."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Charged me and became hostile because we had the audacity to want our food. We actually never got it. I asked who the owner was and he pretended to be the owner. All we wanted was our food and that was just too hard for Juan. If that was his name. Who knows. Avoid. Do not come here. Never ever. It's horrible."}
{"text":"A $7 carne asada burrito  CRAZY TOWN¡¡¡¡¡¡¡This place has always been really good I've lived in Colter for 20 years and we coming here forever. But now the   carne asada burrito and it cost you $7 in 7:50 if you want to use your bank card I think they're crazy and it's way Outta line most expensive carne asada burrito in town even more expensive than Ajo Al's"}
{"text":"While I do appreciate the fact that they stay open pretty late, the food here wouldn't be something I'd develop any strong craving for.  Good-size portions, inexpensive, flavors fair to middling."}
{"text":"I been going to this fast food place for 12 years. Even if I am not near I'll make the drive past other \"betos.\" Always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Decent food and friendly service but these guys owe me like, 40 side cups of pico that I always pay almost a dollar extra for, yet they never give me. I can let it slide once or twice but it's been almost every visit."}
{"text":"I am on lifelong quest to find the ultimate California burrito. Rolberto's usually hits the spot in that regard, and their burritos here are always tasty. The red hot sauce is super spicy, and the employees are efficient and friendly. The tacos, quesadillas, and carne Adana fries are on point as well."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food!!!
The best ever..
Burrito with eggs,cheese, potato and shrimp..
Yummy!!!!!!!!! I am gonna fly to heaven..
Ohh yeahhhh.."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito the other night in the drive-thru, didn't know I mistakingly ordered the Lard and Cheese Burrito. Three of the worst dollars I've ever spent.

As far as drive-thru Mexican places I've given a try in my day (and I've given a few too many a try), this might be the worst.

I've yet to find a really good dirty taco shop around downtown, but the Filberto's by Glam is a lot better."}
{"text":"I just got my dinner & it is so bad I had to throw it away. It's 1030pm, I haven't eaten all day & I am starving!!! I ordered the 2 taco deal & they were the worst tacos I've ever had!!!! There was hardly any meat, the meat that was there was so burnt that it hurt my teeth. There was no cheese on either taco & just a pinch of lettuce.i don't understand... you're a taco shop, it's taco Tuesday, & y'all can't make a god damn taco??!!!! It sux! I don't work or drive cuz I'm too sick, I don't get out unless I uber or someone takes me so spending money on a meal I can't even eat is horrible. If y'all had a crazy crowd & it was madness, I might get it, but we were literally the only folks there!!! If I could drive, I'd bring the food back, but I can't. So awful you treat your community like they don't matter."}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest refried beans I've had at this style of place. I always try to swing through for a bean and cheese burrito when I am in the area. Never had a complaint about any of the other dishes either. One of the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"I think it was an off day for them last time I was here.

They almost never get my order wrong. But for some reason I was given beef taco's instead of fish. Damn language barrier! :(

My friend ordered a shrimp burrito. I tasted it. It was good. I was a little skeptical about how it was going to taste at first. If it wasn't so salty I'd consider ordering it myself.

My chicken chimi was just huge! Like always :) But it always surprises me how humongous they are here.

Their horchata wasn't as good this time either. Maybe it was a fresh batch & needed some more time to set up. Not sure. But it needed more cinnamon."}
{"text":"Short, sweet and honest. I wanted to strangle my family, they'd pissed me off and besides I was very, very hangry. So I decided to go for a walk, and because it was after 11:00 p.m  my options were pretty scarce. I came here and ordered a carne Asada. I even saved a dime because it's Friday and that's the daily special. Now I'm not a fan of Carne Asada burritos, but I said I was hangry remember, and we all know they pack that sucker full. So I took advantage of the outdoor seating, and ate...but only after I located the only clean, acceptable table to eat at. The small bag of onion, carrots and jalapeno was alright, but they win the medal for nasty, soggy carrots. The burrito was a good size, but it lacked flavor, I cannot lie, I ate almost all of it. Hey, I get desperate also. I finished eating, and not less than five minutes later my stomach was bubbling. Either the spice of the pepper was too much or they should change the name to Carne ASSada. you get what you pay for that is the lesson."}
{"text":"Can be hit or miss. The tacos are usually pretty good and fresh, as are the breakfast burritos. Salsa seems to be more of a hot sauce... I'd say pick up a tub from Trader Joe's and pile that on instead. (Haha.) Chimichangas are a big NO, especially for ye of sensitive colons. I always get a big ol' awkwardly sized styrofoam jug of horchata that I can barely hold in one hand. 

Overall, don't expect a gourmet culinary experience. Also, just park and order from the window when there's more than two cars in the drive-thru or else chance attacking your sleeve, your friend, or yourself out of sheer desperation and hunger."}
{"text":"I thought that the kitchen was very clean. The food was good and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Rolberto's, I can't tell you how much I love you and how, when all others have abandoned me, you are always there for me right after the bars close but before I pass out. And even when I want to take you to bed with me, you've always been agreeable. Sometimes the only way I know for sure that I had a great night is when I wake up on the couch with a pounding headache and one of your  half-eaten Carne Asada burrittos on my chest.

I love your nachos, your taquitos, I'm sure if I was into lengua I'd love that too. The only time you've ever let me down is the chorizo and egg buritto. Even though it was lacking in taste, I love everything else so much and you've been there for me on so many inebriated nights that, tasteless chorizo aside, I still l love you and know you'll ALWAYS be there for me."}
{"text":"Best place for quick and yummy Mexican food. Also, they have the best burritos in town. It's the only drive through style place I go to for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"BEST Taco Shop in Central Phx...hands down! I've tried them all. Rolberto's is the best, consistently fresh and delicious food. I've eaten here countless times for a decade plus...never been disappointed. As long as they're in business, I'll be a customer of Rolberto's on 7th St and Camelback."}
{"text":"I'm a South Texan by upbringing so I'm picky about my Tex Mex.  I'm so picky Cal Mex seems like a cheap imitation to me.  

But this place passes muster, and then some. Their Chili Relleno burrito is one of the best I've ever had, and their potato and egg burrito was also delicious. 

Their tortillas still aren't as good as Taco Cabana's - but then again, no one's are, so I don't knock them for this.  This place is the real deal.  Anyone telling you otherwise is probably a tourist.  Real Tex Mex places should be dive-like, and staffed by real Mexican-Americans. Trust nothing less."}
{"text":"Craving an egg and potato breakfast burrito. Had less than $4 cash in the car, didn't know if Rolberto's sold these so I stepped up to the counter and asked. Yes, and for less than $2.50. No reason to go home for more $$.

Waiting outside in the heat seems to take longer than sitting in the car, but it arrived soon enough. I sat outside on the picnic tables watching some teen boys playing some dragon card game and trading collector cards. Tried to figure out what the creatures were - aliens? monsters? dragons? but never could.

Burrito was fabulous. Been waiting four years for this. Maybe my taste buds have faded? This was very satisfying. For a few moments though, I did think about Norman Fiero, a fabulous Phoenix chef who had a few Mexican restaurants (last one near LGO or pre-LGO). Norman made great breakfast burritos. I digress. . . 

Bumping Rolberto's up a star."}
{"text":"Yo, the quesedilla is clutch for late and night and this dudes are fast."}
{"text":"I must have been desperate for Mexican food back in 2009 because there's two Mexican food joints on 35th Ave that absolutely blow Rolberto's away: Polibertos and Rolandos. The last two times I've been here, they screwed up my order (guac when I asked for no guac) and seriously undercooked the food. It was kind of gross."}
{"text":"This was a great little hole in the wall joint with good authentic Mexican food.  Flavorful as well as great portions for the money.  It's not much for atmosphere but on a nice day you can enjoy n outside table."}
