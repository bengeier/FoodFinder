{"text":"I come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options I have in the area.  Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew.   I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a \"healthy\" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able.   I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.  They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5."}
{"text":"Had the curry bowl today with saag paneer and beef madras, plus naan. The whole wheat naan was not bad for whole wheat and was lightly toasted to warm up. Saag paneer was delicious, but wish there was more cheese pieces in there. beef was tender with nice spice."}
{"text":"Wow have things changed! Looks like they are cutting corners like crazy now. Every single dish seems to have changed recipes and the food went from tasting fresh to tasting like every other fast dash Indian place. The quality decline does not warrant the current prices. At all. Don't get me wrong, if you know you're going in for meh Indian food, then this is fairly okay, as long as you are prepared. We weren't. It had been a while since we ordered from here and were excited to do so tonight. Sadly, this has definitely been our last time ordering Veda. I will also stop recommending them. I don't know how long they have had their new recipes in place but I hate to think of how many people I have sent there only to have them eat warmed up frozen, rubbery chicken in a canned sauce.  First of all, the delivery guy behaved as if we were some dirt beneath his shoe. I have never seen such a scowl and he had the body language of somebody who did not like us for whatever reason and did not want to be there at all. We couldn't understand his attitude because were were smiley and polite but no matter how polite we were he just acted as if we were scum. We tipped him anyway. Kind of regret that the more I think of how scowled he was.   We shrugged and moved on because we were excited to dig into our food. Right away it seemed different. I took a bite of the veg samosa and the mush inside of it was fairly okay but bland and the texture was a little off-putting. The pastry was good, though. The chickpeas were pretty good but you could tell that they were canned and that the sauce tasted like it was from a jar. The butter chicken was the worst. It was rubbery, the texture was very processed and the sauce was definitely from a can or a jar. This depressed me the most because the butter chicken used to be sooo good. As little as last year, their butter chicken tasted so much fresher and the sauce tasted much more home made. It also had much more spice as well as taste. That is all gone now.   The chutney was definitely from a jar. That is just a fact. It was too sweet, had hardly any spice to it and very liquidy. Their mango chutney used to be really chunky, spicy and tangy. It definitely tasted much fresher before. Now it is a jarred sauce that is slightly inferior to Pataks.   The brown rice was good and the naan was good. They have a great curried slaw that they have added and it is pretty tasty but overall they have lost everything that made them great and worth the slightly higher price. Gone are the days of fresh and healthy tasting food from this place. It used to settle in the stomach lightly but this new stuff has settled very heavy in my stomach and I am still feeling uncomfortable from it hours later. They are now just another fast food Indian place that uses processed, easy to heat up food to cut corners. They are just not worth it anymore. And that makes us sad."}
{"text":"Ordered the large curry bowl, food was extremely bland and tasteless.  Avoid this one."}
{"text":"I personally really enjoy Veda, especially for what it is. A healthy takeout option that is inexpensive and tastes good. This BLOWS anything away within a similar price point. The servers are always friendly, the food is fresh and I always have an overall good experience there. I've been dining there for years. Its not often enough that we have these types of 'fast food' restaurants that actually concentrate on healthy tasty options. If you are ever able to make it out there please try either the butter chicken or saag paneer my two consistent favourites."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this place one bit. I am a huge foodie and was interested to try their 'healthy Indian takeout' place on Yonge. Hugely disappointing in respect to the food. A letdown on every level taste and food wise.  It was not even fresh that day (asked the girl and she said the sauces could be 3 or even 4 days old and the rice not even fresh everyday!), was flavourless, tasteless and the quality of the chicken in my butter chicken curry was poor at best. My girlfriends sauce for her beef madras was one of THE blandest, weakest,  most forgettable curry sauces I've ever had. My naan bread was average at best and my girlfriend left most of her meal. Usually I would at least try to help her finish it but sadly at Veda it just sat there until we very quickly left. Bland, boring, not actually that fresh and healthy and an underwhelming meal was hugely disappointing. I gave it a score of 1 out of 5. Weak"}
{"text":"Blah. Ordered the thali. Bland, tasteless. May have been made with frozen veg.  Ordered the samosa - again, bland and tasteless. I was expecting the baked flavour, but even the filling was underwhelming.   Veda is now on my \"never mind, I'm not THAT hungry\" list."}
{"text":"I really like their beef madaras, saag paneer, and vegtable curry. Their red lentil is great too! The Currito idea is adorable, and it's huge! I can always get 2 meals of out it, but if you're a big guy, one will totally fill you up."}
{"text":"The Food doesn't taste amazing but it is is tasty for low fat food, especially since they seem to be constantly improving their recipe.    I can understand the negative reviews because sometimes the food tasted like it was left over but that's changed! I sincerely think that they have been doing their best to improve the taste and freshness without sacrificing their healthy slogan though.  The only problem is that the selection is limited and never changes. That, and the fact that their butter chicken is inedible. I mean, you can't make a dish that is meant to be buttery and greasy taste good while making it low fat. Other than that, the food is tasty, affordable and definitely a healthy choice compared to typical Indian restaurants. The Staff are also very nice and friendly.  These are the reasons why I like the place."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant has opened that caters to people who oppose flavour and freshness - it is called veda. Stay away.  In terms of context, veda is kind of like the manchu-wok of Chinese food, the frankie tomoatoes of Italian food, and the taco bell of Mexican food...I hope you see where I'm going here.  Admittedly, there are people who like all of these places, including veda. That is nice for them. I am not one of those people.    Frozen Indian dinners from the supermarket and even canned Indian foods taste like gourmet treats compared to what is passed off as food at veda's.  Simply put, there is no lower rung on the totem pole of Indian food than this place.  To take it one step further, if one was in the unfortunate position of having to choose between eating Indian food from veda or eating the crap from someone who just ate quality Indian food somewhere else-  it would probably be a toss up, and I would not fault that person if they were to choose the latter.  This place is really bad.  If you want a good laugh, you could pair up with a friend and have one of you get take out from veda and the other from Indian Palace across the street (just make sure you are the one who ends up with the food from Indian Palace). Once the laughter (and tears from the person stuck with the \"food\" from veda) subsides, it will become readily apparent that to classify both of the dishes as \"Indian food\" is the insulting equivalent of calling both coffee and crack cocaine \"drugs\" - in other words two items that are worlds apart but unfortunately get stuck under the same overly broad category due to a lack of more precise terminology.    If you were really feeling adventurous you and your friend could follow up the meal by having one of you drink a coffee from Starbucks, and the other taking a few hits off a crack pipe (at this point that person who ate the veda food will probably feel so sad and depressed they will eagerly hit the pipe in an effort to escape the memories of their awful meal).  Again, the gap between these two items will likely be readily apparent (but perhaps not even as extreme as the gap between the meals).  At the end of the day, the best advice here is to avoid veda  (and crack) at all costs."}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the restaurant, I was greeted and asked if I had been here before. After stating no, the cashier graciously explained what the most popular and best deals were. She even let me try a spoonful of one of the dishes before I committed to it. Great customer service, nice atmosphere, GREAT price, and great food!"}
{"text":"It was decent but disappointing. With the cool look of it and rave reviews posted all over the exterior, I thought I was in for much more.   The tiffin was a well-priced combo where you can have rice, one meat dish and one vegetarian dish for $6.99 plus tax. You have the choice of rice vs. spinach rice. I'm not sure why there's a choice because the spinach is pretty lacking and doesn't add much but whatever.   I got the butter chicken because I find that's a good place to start when summing up a new Indian place. The chicken itself was fine but I found the texture of the sauce to be a bit pasty and yeah, not so flavourFULL.   I also ordered a brand spankin' new dish- the spicy lentils- and there was some nice spice going on! However, I could not make out the actual lentils for it was all mush and the pasty after-texture made a second appearance.   I know Veda wants to be healthy but it does come at the expense some taste and texture. It's a nice alternative to fast food come lunch time."}
{"text":"Currito: A burrito stuffed with curry.  It's a fun idea.  It's also too bad that Veda's Butter Chicken Currito was a let down.  A whole wheat wrap stuffed mostly with rice, bland sauce, and I think there was supposed to be chicken in there.  I paid like $8 bucks for rice in a wrap. At least it came with a free dipping sauce. The tamarind dipping sauce was the tastiest part of my lunch!"}
{"text":"I tried their snack pack earlier in the week, which had 1 veggie spring roll, 1 chicken samosa, 1 beef empanada and 3 pakora. You can choose vegetarian or meat options. The best part was the dipping sauce. I really enjoyed the mango chutney. Veda told me that it's healthier Indian fare, as they use milk instead of the heavy cream and use lighter oils instead of the usual heavier ones. I can def taste the difference, and it's still packed with flavour... i just prefer the normal indian food i usually get!"}
{"text":"Their snack pack is a deal. Service is friendly though the cashier seems new and a bit slow. Love their pakora and empanada and samosa. I'll get back if I get the chance."}
{"text":"Wish I'd looked at the reviews before I went here. I had the butter chicken over basmati rice, with a side of pakoras. The texture of the chicken was really off-putting, it was a tough and rubbery. The flavor of the sauce was pretty bland as well - the lack of cream really kills it. Yes, it may be \"healthier\", but you're really compromising on taste here.   The rice and pakoras were fine, nothing special. Overall, I was surprised how pricey things were, especially the meal combos. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and tried a different dish and have to add a star. It was quite busy so I had lots of time to make my choice, and it was a good one. I ordered the small curry bowl - I chose the spinach basmati rice and the chicken curry. It was less than $6, and was plenty of food. I like it because it was tasty, filling, but still light and not over filling. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in myself for constantly walking by this place several times daily before! does a decent job at \"healthy\" Indian with good variety, portions and prices. All in, I paid $9 for a bowl with rice and 2 curries that I've given up on after getting halfway through.   Several vegetarian - and even vegan - choices; cute things like \"curritos\" and baked samosas. Does it compare to the flavorful and fresh foods you'd find in South East Asia or a nice restaurant? ....no, but I'm a seasoned desi, and this flavoring is expected for the clientele and area (Yorkville yuppies).   The chickpeas need to be cooked longer; I'm thrilled with the inclusion of butter tofu. Love the friendly, helpful service.   Definitely recommend for quick, healthy but flavorful lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 curry choices with the rice pilaf; saag paneer ( cheese & spinach) and the tofu butter curry. It was horrible. There was no flavor, it was cold and not fresh. I don't even know how they call this stuff Indian food.  People have a misconception that Indian food is greasy and unhealthy- if you go to any cheap fast food joint chances are that quality will be sacrificed!  This place should call it quits!  Thumbs down"}
{"text":"(2.5 stars) I got the thali (rice + one protein + one veggie dish) with saag paneer and mixed vegetable curry. The saag paneer was creamy and pretty good. The vegetable curry, on the other hand, was pretty bland and the vegetables looked sad. I think they came from a bag in the freezer, because the carrots were those round shaped kind that are pre-cut and unnaturally identical. The curry was not spicy at all and a bit watery. The spinach basmati rice was nice but couldn't save the curry dish. I like that the dishes seem healthier/less heavy or greasy than other Indian places. They are good about clearly specifying which dishes have meat or dairy.The baked samosas looked good and they have a walk-in special that's $3 for 3 samosas.   The place itself is small, but it never seems to be too busy so you can eat-in if you want. They have a bunch of magazines to flip through and clippings from magazine reviews. I like that they use real dishes and cutlery if you eat-in, as opposed to plastic/styrofoam. Prices are good -- my thai was ~$6.50. Maybe if I was in the area and looking for something really cheap and fast, I would give this place another chance and try some of their other dishes. But overall I found Veda to be just so-so."}
{"text":"Dont go here.  The food is the worst indian I've ever had, and it's not even healthy.  If you are broke, it might seem like a good deal, but honestly it's pretty revolting and not even worth $6.  And even though they tout themselves as \"healthy\" simply extracting the oil from indian food does NOT make it healthy!  There is sooo much filler in their sauces I had difficulty swallowing.  I got their butter chicken which had maybe 4 tiny tiny chunks of chicken in it.  It was 80% sauce, which was probably mostly flour and had a bad texture.  Their saag paneer was also a lot of filler, and spiced wrong.  I could tell they went way overboard on the tumeric, because it was much more bitter than it shouldve been.  And oil is not unhealthy if you use good oils!  Sure, Ghee is a bit fattening, but if they substituted it for a lighter unsaturated fat, and used better ingredients they would be WAY healther than they are now.  Their food reminds me of yogurt, they are the cheap no-fat yogurt full of filler and no flavour, vs the whole milk good quality stuff.  Frankly, I'd pick the latter any day."}
{"text":"One Word Summary: Bland.  A simple menu of quick, healthy, cheapish Indian served in a clean, modern space sounds like a no-brainer. Unfortunately, Veda doesn't come through in the taste department. They are the Indian equivalent of all the Southeast Asian fusion restaurants that put plenty of energy into having a cool name, modern decor, and polished image but don't worry about unimportant details like the quality of their food.  For $9 (tax included) I got the Tiffin Combo which consisted of basmati rice, chana masala, saag paneer, and a piece of naan. Both the chana masala and saag paneer were bland and what flavour they did have was all wrong. The chickpeas in the chana masala were undercooked and, as a result, not nearly tender enough. I liked the naan but it was more like a pita than naan.  Veda pitches themselves as a healthy alternative to most Indian food. To their credit I will say that the food did seem a little lighter on the oil and cream than a lot of Indian places. Also, the service was efficient and friendly. But, unless they up their game significantly, I don't see any reason to waste your time on this watered down Indian food."}
{"text":"Attention allergy sufferers: Claims to have a \"nut-free\" kitchen but most recipes contain coconut.  Health Canada does not consider coconut a nut (although it is included in the definition/family of nuts) so they follow that guideline."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the tastiest Indian food, then Veda is not what you are looking for.  They do, however, absolutely live up to their \"Healthy Indian Takeout\" slogan. The dishes are very low in oil/grease/fats etc, you can tell just by looking. Veda does a great job of making the dishes tasty/appetizing, but they do taste somewhat bland in comparison to regular Indian food.   They have a great variety with vegetarian and vegan options, plus everything is completely \"nut free\" and the curries are gluten free too.   Price point is great, I usually get the meal deal which consists of choice of rice, 1 veggie dish and 1 curry dish. Comes to $7.50 with tax.  They also recently added \"Curritos\" to their menu, which is basically a roti or Indian curry burrito.  Bottom line - if you go out of your way to eat healthy, you will likely love this place. If you don't care - you're probably better off with regular Indian foodage"}
{"text":"One word sums up this place: Meh.  I guess for a ready-made takeout place the food is good. But for Indian, this place is mediocre at best. The process of getting my order was slow but the guy helping me was nice.   You may want to try this place if you're in the area, but definitely do not make a special trip."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  I had the chicken curry and rice and it was a bit cold, but i did enjoy the flavour.  My bf had the butter chicken and it looked nasty, he didnt seem to enjoy it that much.  The naan sucked, but the samosas were pretty decent.  Probably wouldnt go back here."}
