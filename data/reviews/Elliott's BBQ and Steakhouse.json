{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food!  Staff is very good as well!!  Great steaks,  sandwiches & wings!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a really nice meal here.  Price is a little more than one would expect but it was kid friendly so I really can't complain too much.  If you are I  the neighborhood I'd give it a try."}
{"text":"This was an awesome steak house!  My steak salad was incredible.   Great portions!! Diane provided great service.   The entertainment was great, too.  What are stop and stay!!"}
{"text":"We just came back from dinner and it was awful. I gave two stars only because of the waitress. I was only give it one star but our waitress really tried but the food was poor. We received the wrong meals and the build it yourself burger that I ordered came with some kind of sauce that I did not order. I did not finish it as it was awful. They have another restaurant named the Elliotts Backstreet BBQ, located a few miles away, that has much much better food, and cheaper! Not sure if this is the problem but the cooks were just changed at both of their locations.  Good luck at your new location."}
{"text":"Went here after a school function with my wife and kids. We sat on the patio and had a good time. I was happy to see they had a kid menu. As for the adults we shared several dishes including Calamari, Brisket, and Salmon all were very good. We are happy to have a place in the neighborhood that isn't a chain, and has a wide variety of great food options. We will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Once with a larger group and once with just my wife. Both times the food and service were excellent. Portions are big and the prices are good. I ordered the lunch special, which was a Prime Rib sandwich. What arrived was a huge bun, overflowing with real prime rib pieces. I didn't think there was any way I would eat it all. After taking a few bites, I knew there was no way I was leaving any behind. It was one the best sandwiches I have ever gotten. The meat was juicy. The homemade horseradish sauce was perfect. A good kick to it, but not too spicy. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich, and she loved it. I had to steal a bite, just because the sauce smelled so good. I am pretty sure I will be ordering that next time we go. When we went with the group, we had two children with us. Both had no problem finding things to order, and enjoyed their meals also. Definitely a thumbs up for Elliot's!"}
{"text":"We decided that we wanted to go out for a nice dinner to close out 2014. We looked at a number of restaurants in the area and settled on Elliott's BBQ & Steakhouse in Pleasant Hills. I made reservations for 4 and was told that at the requested time they were seating in the upstairs room.  Now I've been going to this place since it was The Red Bull Inn (McElhinny's actually), but was never upstairs. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and drink orders were taken.   We discovered that the upstairs dining area is a great place to enjoy your meal. The staff handling the second floor was attentive, which made the entire dining experience flow nicely.  We started with appetizers of cheese wheel and stuffed mushroom.  Both fantastic.  I enjoyed a delicious prime rib with salad, baked potato, and asparagus.  Two others at the table had the same, with a fourth ordering crab cakes. Everyone enjoyed their dinner.    My wife and sister in law ordered dessert of pumpkin cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake. Both said it was very good.    All in all, it was a great experience and fun way to kick off New Year's Eve.  Will definitely be returning to Elliott's BBQ & Steakhouse and recommend it to anyone looking for a good local dining place."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Definitely recommend their Beans and Greens, and breaded Mozz Cheese wheel as appetizers.  Some of the best i've had.  For dinner, my go to is always their Brisket--it is tender, juicy and I love their BBQ sauces they make.  Also, their Au Gratin French Onion soup is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Food is good (they have much more than just BBQ or steak), service has been exceptional each time we've gone. It's by no means an upscale restaurant, but it doesn't pretend to be. Great weekday specials too."}
{"text":"The place has been around a long time and always seemed to have cars in the lot. We decided to try it without checking Yelp first. Big mistake. We both ordered half racks of ribs. We are used to fall-off-the-bone ribs. No such luck here. These ribs were so tough that you couldn't even split them with a knife. The meat was difficult to chew. They were served drowned in a sauce that was so hot it burned our mouths. The service left a lot to be desired too. We sat at out table for over 10 - 15 minutes before we saw a server."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time. We definitely should have tried it sooner! Everything was absolutely delicious. We shared steak and ribs and couldn't be happier. The appetizer sampler was great and their house ranch was amazing! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good! There are so many more things than just BBQ and Steak as the name suggests :). As for the service, it has been exceptional each time I've gone. The wings are crazy huge and at an excellent price! It's by no means an upscale restaurant, but it doesn't pretend to be. The regulars that go there are funny people and if you sit in the bar area you're sure to hear some hilarious comments from them directed towards a sports game. Awesome weekday specials too."}
{"text":"I was fully expecting a BBQ or smokey flavor in my brisket, but there was none. The portions were insane, probably a solid pound of meat, which made my sweet potato look miniature. If you're looking for a steakhouse I would suggest going here, but if looking for BBQ go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how good the service and meal I had was! Several restaurants have been there in the past and they were ok at best. This one is killing it! I had the center cut pork chops and they were AWSOME! I'll be back for sure. ... a bit pricy but a nice neighborhood family restaurant."}
{"text":"My mother and I tried this for the first time last night and we had a great experience! It wasn't too crowded, we were seated right away, and our waitress was attentive and friendly. Actually, all of the staff was very friendly. I decided to try the Boneless Center Cut Chops with Sweet BBQ sauce. I don't usually like pork chops but this meal was really great. I loved the sauce and they even gave me extra (I didn't realize how much they already put on it haha). I also ordered a baked potato and clam chowder soup which was also delicious. My mother had the veal and a sweet baked potato and ate every bit of it. We were so full I even got a take home box! We were considering and thinking about dessert, but we just were never asked if we wanted any. That's my only improvement I could recommend. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in tonight on a whim because she saw them advertising 50 Â¢ wings. I had never eaten there so was game for the adventure. We arrived at 6:02 and had our choice of seating in the very small dining room. The servers name was Patty I believe, very nice young girl, I asked if they had sweet tea (remember I just moved back from 10 years in South Carolina) and she said yes, then asked me if I wanted her to put the sugar in or if I wanted to put the sugar in at the table. ( I refrained from explaining to her that was tea with sugar not sweet tea) I ordered 10 Parmesan Garlic wings and my mother (the one that hot sauces everything) ordered 6 medium hot wings. 35 minutes later they arrived. My mother's medium wings were so strong they were clearing my sinuses just sitting next to her! She had to get a dish of bleu cheese they were so hot. Mine were covered in fresh minced garlic and butter, but not much Parmesan. Their wings also are batter dipped, like fried chicken batter dipped. I have never eaten wings like that but ok ... I found my 10 wings to be inconsistent in how they were cooked. Some were very dry, a couple were very greasy, none were to my liking, but they were all edible without much flavor. The atmosphere was pleasant for a small restaurant and clean, the service was excellent, the total for the bill was $13.50 for 16 wings and two glasses of tea so you cant beat that. I cant say that I am marking a date on my calendar to go back but if I happen to be driving past and its a Tuesday I may consider giving it another chance."}
