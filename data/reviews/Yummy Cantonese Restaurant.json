{"text":"My Asian friends recommend it to me - the place is small, a bit dirty and crowded on weekend (cuz it's cheap) but yummy rice roll and congee!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely worth trying. Most may not dare to enter because it doesn't look that appealing but the food is really good and the low low prices make it even better. If you like pork liver congee this restaurant makes the best one I've ever had. There is big pieces of it and it's cooked to perfection, not hard/tough like some places. 

Also, the rice noodle rolls are really good and freshly made. It's not the typical ones you get at dim sum. I like the fact that they have so many variety. I usually order the beef and pork liver rice noodle rolls. Yum!"}
{"text":"Enough said, 5/5 I came here at least once a month, healthy and delicious. Ask them to side the soy sauce for MSG free noodle rolls."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for great congee and true style rice rolls.  Way better than the typical Hong Kong style thicker skin rolls ...these are made fresh with every order and great offerings of fillings.  My granddaughter loves the egg-filling and I always order the congee with pork and salted duck egg.  Their deep-fried doughnut sticks are made fresh as well.  If you're looking for ambiance, you won't find it here.  It's a no-nonsense restaurant with bare furniture and there is a TV mounted on the wall that's usually on some Oriental channel.  All in all, feeding a family of four costs less than $30 with tip, and believe me, we're all full by the time we leave!"}
{"text":"Most people reviewing don't understand that the rice rolls is in Canton style not Hong Kong. It's suppose to have texture to absorb in the sauce. There aren't many restaurants in Toronto that makes them the Canton way. However, given that their soy sauce isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"If i could give it a negative star i would. Food is ok but service is HORRIBLE. We asked for no onions and cilantro in everything and it had extra. One server was nice and apologized but the other was just place rude and gave us attitude after we asked for a box to go."}
{"text":"Really good rice noodle rolls, you know that they steamed the rice flour mixture to order. They are thin and soft but still have good texture that soaks up the soy and hot sauce. 
Yes, the place is kinda grimey (- one star), but the food is is fresh, fast, tasty, and properly made. I would also recommend their squid tentacles, even better tasting than the ones for dim sum.. they put a nice coating on it that stays hot and crispy."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were in the mood for congee breakfast.  The price was right for our budget.  Service was just ok.  Slight language barrier here.  We order preserved egg & pork congee, bbq  pork rice noodle roll & calamari tentacles.  All that for around $16 bux.  Less than we would have spent at our normal congee spot, Congee Town.  Only issue with the food was the calamari was too salty for our liking, we ended up taking that home,  though I did like the fact the tentacles were larger than other places.

Oh their style of rice noodle rolls isn't the smooth type.  I've read another another reviewer calling it \"scraped\" it may not look as presentable, but for us it still tasted ok.  Also, as for portion size as compared to other spots we've had rice noodle rolls, they give more here.

They have extra condiments which other places we've visited don't have which includes; sesame seeds, sweet sauce & peanut sauce for use with rice rolls/congee etc.  The sesame seeds and sweet sauce did the trick for me. 

I deducted 1 star due to for method of payment is CASH ONLY.  Debit & Credit not accepted.  Would definitely go back for congee and rice noodle rolls, not for the fried items.  Potential foodies be aware, there are quite a few dishes that they serve that have internal delicacy organ meats."}
{"text":"Besides Sam's Congee (located in Market Village) this is my other favourite place to go to for congee (rice porridge). You get a huge bowl for what you pay for, I usually can never finish a bowl myself. My favourite congee is the pork liver with pork blood congee. The congee's flavour is phenomenal, never too salty, and the pork liver is always cooked perfectly. The dough sticks are always freshly fried and are made to order. Crunchy on the outside but super soft inside. Tastes so good to dip the fried dough into the congee!  They also have rice noodle rolls here, so I'm excited to try that next time. It's a hidden spot, but very popular. It already starts getting busy (I mean lineups from the door!!) around 10am so I suggest going at 9am ~"}
{"text":"Food was a little on the bland side or one dimensional but it is cheap. Rice roll was better than other menu items. Place reminded me a little bit of China."}
{"text":"I come here once per week for my fav beef rice roll and congee. I will come here for traditional rice roll but not the environment. The rice roll tastes very similar with those at my place. I had try few different rice roll restaurant but I like this place the most!"}
{"text":"It's our favourite rice roll place in Scarborough. Compared to other dim sum places offer rice rolls, the rice rolls here are way better - thin enough to see through with just right amount of sauce. The only down point is it closes pretty early :("}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times, and honestly haven't made a review yet, i have to say this type of Cantonese breakfast is not the typical canadian cup of tea. however for those who like a light breakfast that makes you feel warm and healthy it is awesome. The type of food it serves, is all over toronto, but in a combination of taste, price, service. i don't think i've ever found another place thats better than this place in toronto. It serves congee, rice noodle rolls(classic street style not dim sum style). and fried dough. Honestly the price is ridiculously affordable and the quantity and quality of food they deliver is great. the service is no frills chinese style. which is efficient and effective. This is not a place for those who want fancy food it is more like a family canteen for breakfast. and there is much to love at this place. Honestly i would recommend anyone who loves traditional Cantonese breakfast to go to this place. it is by far the best in the city when it comes to this type of breakfast. Your wallet will also thank you afterwards for it."}
{"text":"COME here instead of the wonton place next door which I was only forced to go to because this place was full. 

It's usually really busy here so we were finally about to get some seats on the past weekend. The congee that contains fish slices is indeed fresh fish. I highly recommend their congee and my fiance really enjoyed their \"cherng fun\". 
Their iced lai cha was so bomb, I want to go back just to drink that. 

The portions are huge for the price they sell it for *thumbs up* I couldn't finish my bowl of congee and had to even save it for dinner."}
{"text":"Great cheung fun, nice texture and flavours

Congee is alright, typical

Price to quality ratio is better than average. Definitely will be coming back

*Second visit was takeout. Still just as good!"}
{"text":"We came in at 7:55pm ish, and the restaurant closed at 8pm. They still sat us down and let us order. Huzzah!

Boiled lettuce - it came in smaller pieces this time! It was very tasty. Either they cook it in some kind of broth, or they top it with cooked oil or something. It's got a slightly oily sheen, but it's great!

Deep fried dough stick wrapped in rice noodle roll - This time, the dough stick was crispy enough! That's a huge plus in my books. The sauces are still thinned out, and we had to ask for sweet sauce, but I'm assuming it was because it was later at night and they were cleaning/refilling the bottles.

Rice noodle roll with egg and cabbage ($3.75?) - I updated my review, then totally forgot to add this dish to the review. Fail. Well, here it is. I prefer my rice noodle rolls in rolls because that's what I grew up with, but I have to say that the scraped version is beginning to grow on me. This one is the scraped kind, and it's mixed with egg and chopped cabbage. This one is so simple and so delightful! The salt from the soy sauce and the sweetness of the cabbage work together marvelously. I was going to the the BBQ pork roll, which is my go-to, but I'm glad I decided to get this one instead.  

Fish head and belly congee - They have a few fish congees. I should have mentioned that in my last review. For those of you who aren't into bones, this is not the congee for you. I actually had half a fish head in my congee, eyeball and everything. This is a good thing. It means they got my order right. There's a good amount of ginger slivers in this congee, so if you're not a ginger fan, ask them not to put it in. I forgot. Oops. This congee comes with white pepper already in it. It's not spicy. It adds flavor. 

Funny story of the night. We were the last customers seated in the restaurant. The waitress actually left before we did, but she said that if we needed anything, the kitchen staff would be able to help us.

Next time I come, I'm trying the oyster congee ($7)."}
{"text":"We visited this original Cantonese food restaurant on 28 January 2018 around 2:30 p.m.  When it comes to decor, this place is quite lackluster.   There seemed to be more wait staff, kitchen staff and cooks than customers.  Kind of a small place, the television hanging on the wall was showing Cantonese programmes, and staff buzzing around this rather small dinning room. The server was a bit hard to understand, and my husband can understand Cantonese.  One wait staff, all she did was go around to each table and refill the condiments.  The annoying thing was she approached our table twice, to replace condiments that we did even use.  The place wasn't full, she could have waited until after the meal, rather than disrupting our conversation, while eating our food and replacing the condiments.  The food came in a reasonable time and was delicious.  I had the Mixed Mushroom with Pork Congee  for $5.00 and my husband had the Beef Rice Noodle Roll for $4.00.   The prices were cheap considering the amount of food.  I have developed a taste for Congee, so maybe we'll try this one again.  Hopefully the  'Condiment Changer' will be on vacation."}
{"text":"Fantastic cheurn fun soft and freshly made sweet soy sauce just right steamed fresh congee with pork so delish will come back again
Beef cheurn fun 4/5
Egg cheurn fun 4/5
Pork preserved egg congee 4/5"}
{"text":"I mainly come here to eat congee which always reminds me of Hong Kong breakfast. At first, i was a little sketched out since this place isn't that pretty and the restaurant name is just so silly. But I'm glad i took the chances because the food isn't too bad! I usually order the pork and preserved egg congee + sweet donut and it has never failed to make me satisfied!  I also ordered a side of veggies, hk milk tea and rice noodle rolls (which were my least favorite). It's super cheap here for a meal and for 3 people, it came to $16 including tip. 

The only problem here is that the waitresses are kind of rude but with how busy they always are, I can see why they aren't in a good mood. For the price and the food, I can let this fact slide."}
{"text":"First impression on Yummy Cantonese Restaurant. Crowded, unorganised, dirty and incompetent service at the front and in the restaurant itself. 

I gave it 1 star. Purely based on the food taste, mediocrity. Other wise this place don't deserve anything better. With the choices available in markham / scarborough, I will never visit yummy again."}
{"text":"As a local Cantonese born in Guangzhou, I can say the rice noodle roll here is very authentic. Unlike the ones that you ordered from the dim sum place, its texture is way better. The congee here is very good too! The prices are reasonable and the portion is large enough for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the food they give u.  The pricing is on the lower side.  The portions are pretty good.  Good place to snack & lunch.  I would definitely go back.  This is not HK style rice roll or ?? it's Cantonese style which was a nice change for me, never tried Cantonese style till I came to this place.  Pretty good experience.  congee is decent.  If u r expecting an extensive menu like congee Wong then this is not the place for u, the menu is quite simple here.  This is more quick in out restaurant.  Environment is very simple Chinese style.  Overall was a good experience.  I liked it."}
{"text":"this place was one of the very first place to open up mainland chinese style rice rolls.  hong kong style is different, hong kong style has a thicker skin, mainland style is thinner and way better.  this place also offer the usual congee style.  the rolls pretty good.  portions are about right.  if you ask for the chinese doughnut stick rice roll be prepared to get stuffed :  the thing is freaking huge, i mean you get a lot.  there is not a lot of parking during the usual lunch time hours both during the whole week.  go after the rush.  customer service and toilets are what you expect from chinese resaurants.  it's pretty clean, they have an open kitchen.  table was a bit sticky for me not because of dirt or whatever but it was just sticky to the feel.  the sauces seem to be pretty fresh too, same for the sesame etc.....

go!"}
{"text":"I've been eating in this area since forever and have only recently discovered this gem of a place. It makes me sad for all the bad bowls of congee and crappy rice rolls that I've had to consume in my long life. The congee is made by the bowl, so it might take a moment for it to get out to you but it will be guaranteed to be hot and delicious. The usual combinations are all available, and the one bowl can easily feed two people. The rice rolls are a bit different because the folds aren't all neatly rolled up, but I figure it's just because they make it fresh there. No complaints, especially when drowned in sesame sauce, sweet sauce, hot sauce and sesame seeds. 

Let's clarify that this isn't the classiest of places. They ran out of actual chairs so I got a plastic stool to sit on. When our table ran out of sesame sauce, the table next to us offered us theirs because there was a mutual understanding of the importance of sesame sauce. It's just that kinda place. Don't bring your dates here unless they are awesome and know how to appreciate the taste of a well made Cantonese breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is great, price point is low but the service really does suck. The waitresses here are slow and they never refill your tea. But you know what, the food and the price is cheap so i can overlook it. If you don't mind slow service, this place has some decent food at great prices."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Hong Kong. It's your classic HK food joint serving you canto meals. It's not the greatest tasting food but it's still good given the price is dirt cheap. I come here once in a while when I'm craving congee and cheap food. It's the only two things that keeps me coming back! But don't order their rice rolls - it's always soggy and overcooked. Their deep fried \"donuts\" are also very greasy and soggy. 

Their service is probably one of the worse I've ever had. The waitresses are always unhappy and they're slow to serve you. Food also comes out very slowly as well. You kind of expect that when you're eating at a cheap food joint like this. The restaurant itself is pretty rundown (that's probably why it reminds me of Hong Kong street side restaurants). Two stars off for that!

If you're into authentic cantonese food, you should try this place. If you're more into nicer places like Congee Queen, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"Average place for getting congee and rice rolls. Price is low and service pretty fast. The inside is clean and open which is rare for these types of places. Food is pretty average. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Good congee, good rice noodles. I recommend trying the beef rice noodle, beef and fish congee, and dough-fritter-wrapped-in-rice-noodle dishes. Don't get your hopes up about attentive service though!"}
{"text":"I like rice rolls a lot, so this place definitely satisfied that craving. The congee on the other hand is nothing special.

Staff: It is a typical Cantonese place. You flag them down to order, but they bring what you need. The rice rolls came fast, but the congee took forever. The staff said it's because have chicken in ours, so it takes longer.

Ambience: It's got the basic chairs and tables, nothing else. It's a little cramped as our chairs were against those behind us, so it was kind of uncomfortable.

Food: I really like the rice rolls. As far as I know they make it fresh and thin, so it's different from the ones you see when you go for Dim Sum. We had the Beef Rice Roll, the BBQ Pork Rice Roll and the Dough Stick Rice Roll. The only one I didn't enjoy as much was the beef because I think it was sliced beef rather than ground/minced beef, so it gave it a different texture. In addition, we got Chicken Congee which was very basic. Nothing but parsley, green onions, and chicken.

This place is definitely one that satisfies rice roll cravings, but you can skip the congee if you want."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Cantonese food in Toronto (Scarborough area). I woke up craving for Cantonese food, and wanted congee for brunch because I had BBQ skewers the night, and wanted something comforting and warm. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the Cantonese-speaking environment in this restaurant. It's a very casual spot with decent service. It brings back a lot of childhood memories growing up. I ordered the Preserved Egg and Pork Congee, Beef Brisket Noodle and Fritter Rice Roll Chinese Doughnut. The bill came to $16 so it was a steal! 

I caution you that the congee they serve is very hot, which is perfect in my opinion but make sure you get smaller bowls to consume it or you might accidently burn yourself. Add some sesame which is provided as a condiment to your Chinese Doughnut for extra taste. The Fritter Rice Roll Chinese Doughnut was crunchy inside (Chinese Doughnut), and soft and tender on the outside (Rice Roll). Add some peanut butter sauce and you will enter a state of extreme joy."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of rice noodle rolls at dim sum, you would like this restaurant! We ordered the beef and coriander rice roll and I wish we had ordered 2! Everything looked and tasted fresh. The service was very friendly and the environment looked clean. We will definitely visit this restaurant again in the near future."}
{"text":"Was recommended to try this place out for their rice noodles, and so had pretty high expectations coming here. Unfortunately left unsatisfied. It is not for everyone's taste buds to say the least. 

First impression of the place, small, rather dirty (floors, condiment containers, tables), and the place had a heavy bleach/ chemical smell in the air (could be because we went around 5pm so it was their cleaning time as it wasn't so busy). We were greeted quickly upon entering and got to choose where we wanted to sit. Their menu consists of mainly a variety of congee, their famous rice noodle roll with different ingredients inside, lo mien, and a few options for noodles in soup - typical Cantonese breakfast food. Prices were not as cheap as I had expected for what seems to be a \"quick bite\" stop in my opinion but I guess decent for the portions. I mean, they charge the same prices as some of the better options in the area for example Congee Queen. But anyway, we ordered a plain congee ($2.75), dried shrimp rice roll ($3.75), and beef brisket noodle soup ($6). To my surprise, food came quite fast and altogether which I appreciated. However, the taste just wasn't there. The beef brisket was not tender and very hard to chew, the rice roll was so thin it would tear apart trying to pick it up. On top of that, they serve the rice roll drenched in soy sauce so you can't control the level of saltiness. The dried shrimp pieces in the rice roll were not fresh and had a rather hard texture to it. The congee I will say was decent because it had a \"homemade\" taste, I could tell there was no msg put into it so for those looking for that healthy homemade congee outside, this is it. 

On a side note, always check your bill, as they messed up ours and another table's order and bill while we were there and it wasn't even busy so there was no reason for that. 
Overall, the quality of the food was bad, prices - not justifiable, service - none, atmosphere - dirty. I had really wanted to like this place as I pass by quite often, but sadly would not return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Disappointing in my opinion. The congee wasn't bad but I ordered the pork rice roll and coming to this place is the first time I ever heard anyone put chives in pork rice roll... The wait time was long and it was definitely not worth the wait... I also didn't like the atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"Tldr: Cantonese breakfast place for congee and rice noodle rolls. Fresh, delicious, great value. Would recommend. 

Came here for the first time with my mom and sis since they were craving a Cantonese-styled  brunch. This place offers a wide variety of rice noodle rolls and congee that are made in-house. They also have soup noodles if you're feeling that. 

For congee we got 2 types: Salted egg/pork, and mixed mushroom/pork. For just $5 each, it was pretty worth. The bowls are huge, and the ingredients were fresh. The congee was quite clean and smooth, and i can tell that it wasn't MSG-filled like other places. In terms of rice noodle rolls, we got the BBQ pork, plain, and fried dough fritter. These rice noodle rolls are not like the typical ones that you see at a dim sum joint. They were uniquely wrinkled (kind of like the wrinkles you see on an old man lol), but tasted amazing. There was a pleasant elasticity when I bit into them, and it didn't tire out my jaw during the mastication process. They also have sweet soy sauce, sesame sauce, sesame seeds, sriracha, and chili oil on the side on each table. 

When we got here at around 11:30am, it was mad packed. This place is pretty small, but we got seats after a 10min wait. Service was alright, but the food came fast. Price is great for what's offered. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Scarborough is definitely where the OG HK residents are. Despite North York, Markham, and Richmond Hill having the newer hip and trendier venues, this spot does Scarborough proud in maintaining the authenticity of HK high carb meals.

My friend and I came here for a brunch and ordered the congee with beef and preserved egg, beef brisket soup mein, and fried dough fritter rice roll. These are all old school HK classics and we got hit pretty hard with nostalgia.

The food itself is good. The congee is well flavored, not too salty nor too bland. It could've had more preserved egg but otherwise was well proportioned. Dough fritter rice roll was good especially with the additional sesame you could add on. Fritter was fried well and not overly dark like how it could be if restaurants reuse oil. The noodles were not soggy and the brisket was not especially fatty.

Quality spot for cheap eats. And I think I'll close with the one selling point which is its value. The food is reasonably priced with congee around $4-5, noodles $5-7 and the rice rolls/fritters ~$5. The crowd there were OG Cantonese grandmas, grandpas, and aunties and uncles - proof that it's legit.

Service was quite good for a Chinese/HK type place. I think this is why often Chinese spots get downvoted so often; we just have to accept that the level of service at Chinese or Asian restaurants are often less than that of Western venues. Hence the 10% or less tip which \"Asians\" so often get stereotyped for; they suit the venue.

tldr Come here for quick eats of high carb HK style food. Fast and \"yummy\" food as the name of the restaurant suggest."}
{"text":"3 years after my first visit and I decided to give this place another try. It was a cold and windy day and Congee is really my kind of comfort food.

I had been bee quite a few Cantonese style rice roll joints so now I kind of know what to expect and start to enjoy this kind of rice roll. 

Plain Rice Roll is pretty good and great value. I would order that again. Even my Pork Blood congee has the punch with a lot of ginger!

I guess I will be coming back again.

BTW, the condiment bottles are a lot cleaner than my last visit!"}
{"text":"This place has a relatively limited menu (really your main options are rice noodle rolls, congee, or noodle soup), but the prices are cheap. Food is pretty tasty for what you pay. The restaurant itself is tiny and not very clean, so if that bothers you, I suggest eating somewhere else. I've only been here once, and my experience was good. 

I wouldn't recommend this place since there are better restaurants in the area, but I would come again. My review may change in the future."}
