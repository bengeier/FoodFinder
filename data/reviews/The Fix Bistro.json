{"text":"I live literally across the street from this place and have never been there.  Chef Eric Rogers,  that SLAP ME SHRIMP sir should come with a face because it literally made me want to slap someone. That shrimp was so good I ordered two... I shared. The first bite rendered me speechless. No seriously... I could not speak because it was that good!  My goodness this place is killer.  Would I go back?  Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"The service was really nice, our waitress Brittany was attentive but not overly attentive. The Street Corn was so Yummy, I had the chicken pasta really tasty a little spicy for me but good..Enjoyed it will be back."}
{"text":"Holy s#!£! Amazing sandwiches and burgers. Get the LBJ, don't question yourself, it's like a filet mignon had a 3 way with Cajun shrimp and a cheesesteak!  Service was perfect. I think my wife ordered something, too. But I was too busy making love the the LBJ to pay attention to her."}
{"text":"Wow some very good food nice atmosphere,Food came out in a timely manner,Will be back"}
{"text":"The food and service was great. The food was prepared well, delicious! We sat at the bar and the server was friendly and efficient. The owner spoke when we left which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow. I think I just had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life.  Great service too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, enjoy the meal, was trying to have a conversation but noise level off the charts.  Had a nice after dinner drink was deciding if we wanted dessert when the manager approached and ask us to pay the bill.  She made small talk so she wouldn't appear rude, then proceeds to ask us to leave because they were setting up for a big party.  She said you can move to the bar, but there was no seats.  I was really surprised by this because I heard such great things about this place.  Need better customer service.  Not the best experience, even if the food was memorable, being ask to leave left a sour note."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try a new place to eat for a change and we stumbled upon this place and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! From the BMF sampler appetizer until the Chicken Cajun Pasta. ALSO, the specialty strawberry lemonade! Our waiter made our dinner even better with his great service and personality! I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great meal, great service, reasonable rates. Couldn't have been better. We have every intention of going back."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The music was too loud.  It was a club-like atmosphere at 4:30pm.  And the service was slow, because the servers and bartenders were too busy talking to each other."}
{"text":"This food is absolutely delicious. I tried the Creole soul rolls...bursting with great flavor.  Friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent food, poor service.  In a city with so many great restaurants, service is what makes a place stand out. I called for a reservation and was told I would get a call back-I didn't and had to call again 2.5 hours later for an answer. When you enter from Lee Road, the hostess stand is in an awkward position in the back, and the staff on my visit were not particularly interested in greeting me as I waited for my party. It might have been our server's first day but it was rocky the entire dinner. We got a drink menu that only had cocktails. When asked about beer he was unsure exactly what they had (which was about 6 bottled options, no draft here). Our appetizer came out incorrect but the woman who brought it out and realized it wasn't correct gave us that one while they made the one we ordered-that was appreciated and the only endearing thing about the service that night. We had to ask to order dinner and had to repeatedly search around the floor for someone to refill water. I had the turkey reuben which was unique and pretty good, albeit very heavy/filling, and the others enjoyed their food. They just need to work on their service."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cajun-Creole food.  Both times we went our server was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I finally made it to try the OMG Philly and it was awesome! The fries were fresh and fried perfectly. The service was great and the portion was just right. I went for lunch but would like to go back during the evening and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere as soon as you step in. My wife and I came to celebrate my birthday with friends, and we're extremely happy with out visit. The food was good and the service was great. Shout-out to Deja for making our night a good experience."}
{"text":"This is the best bang for your buck on lee road.  The food is new American with a classic creole twist.  Reasonably priced with a great happy hour.  The food is AWESOME!!  We will definitely be back.   Try the slab me shrimp and anything with salmon. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"This place is 2 legit, 2 legit to quit!! Servers so nice and FOOD SO SO GREAT!!! Yum! Come with a big appetite, portions are healthy!"}
{"text":"Wow, I would come here just for the street corn. Grilled and covered in bang bang sauce and queso fresco - amazing! The vegan jambalaya fried rice was flavorful and the BMF chicken was pretty good as well. Drinks were strong but delicious. Loses a star for the price - a little pricier than what I would pay for the quality ($12 Long Island) but don't misunderstand, it's still really delicious. Service was also wonderful. Speedy, attentive, and friendly. Again, would definitely come back here for the corn!"}
{"text":"Omggg the pics on IG  does this food no justice .  Had salmon dish and it was amazing . The flavors was like rhe 4th of July in my mouth .. The staff and service was impeccable.  Compliments to the chef  will definitely  be back ."}
{"text":"They have such a unique menu! I was a little hesitant to try their Philly cheese with shrimp, but it was amazing!! And their fries was smothered in Parmesan cheese! They also have great customer service which is a major key! Love this place and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the quality of the food, never got a chance to order. Tried calling over the course of an hour to place a takeout order; either busy, or ringing with no answer. Finally got through to someone after a while, and was rudely told that there were no take out orders, which contradicts their website. Give me back the Black Box!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great... smothered street corn was the tastiest corn I have ever had... bangin shrimp were awesome ... and the buttermilk fried chicken with Gouda mashed potatoes & collard greens entree was fantastic."}
{"text":"I visited The Fix Bistro on a Friday evening with my family. I heard about them at a Yelp Event for The Sweet Fix. We were warmly greeted at the door by the staff. The music was loud, but not unbearable. I'm not a fan of rap, but I may not be the target audience of the music they were playing.  We started with the corn, cooked with a spicy mayonnaise sauce. I thought it was very good, but to me, I think the sauce would have been better as a dipping sauce and not pre-slathered all over the corn.   For my entree, I had the salmon. The salmon itself was perfectly cooked. My mother remarked that it was \"the best salmon I have ever tasted.\" I'll admit my review is not as effusive, but the salmon was indeed excellent. The sauce served with it was perfectly seasoned and matched the fish well. Unfortunately, the rice underneath was generously salted, and I didn't have too much interest in it for that reason.  At the end of our meal, one of the owners came out personally to chat and ask how the food was, which I thought was a lovely touch.  I will likely return to the Fix Bistro at some point when my family is back in town, and I look forward to seeing the staff again."}
{"text":"Wow!  I celebrated my milestone birthday at The Fix Bistro, this past weekend, with 7 family members.  We were able to make a reservation, which was definitely a plus.  We arrived at the designated time and were warmly greeted by the staff.  We waited for a few moments in the lounge area, as our table prep was finalized.  Jessica was our server.  She was professional, friendly and on-point!  She recited the menu specials, answered questions and proceeded to take our orders.  We ordered a variety of entrees.  A few in our party ordered that day's special, which included a cajun pasta topped with salmon and deep fried lobster meat.  My husband ordered the appetizer shrimp with a side of smoked gouda mashed potatoes.  My daughter ordered the shrimp topped burger and garlic parmesan fries.  My other daughter and myself ordered the OMG 2.0 Philly, topped with grilled shrimp and lobster meat, accompanied by the garlic parmesan fries.  My grandson had the kids burger and fries.  We also ordered Sangria and other alcoholic beverages.   My sandwich was truly OMG, everything was fresh, hot and tasty.  Grilled chicken with onions, mushrooms and peppers, topped with cheese, lobster and 4 huge shrimp on a perfectly toasted brioche bun.  It was delicious!  Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meal.  The portions were more than generous and reasonably priced.  The grand finale to our perfect meal was my dessert, warm poundcake (real poundcake, not package, topped with peaches and whipped cream....it was SOOOOO good.  The food was great, but our server, Jessica, was AWESOME, no request was too large or too small.  Thank you to Jessica and The Fix Bistro for making my birthday dinner special!"}
{"text":"OMG philly with a side of bang sauce is where it's at!! Best thing on the menu for sure and the reason I will keep returning. Sweet potato fries and parmesan fries are solid as well. Only thing keeping from 5 stars is: 1) slow getting the food out 2) fries had definitely been sitting for a little while. I don't mind waiting but if you have to wait, the food has to be 100% fresh and hot."}
{"text":"So after watching the 28th year of the Parade the Circle,  we wanted to try something new... fix bistro it is!  Staff warmly greet you and quickly seat you on a Saturday afternoon.   I started with a refreshing Red Sangria and The Street Grilled Corn. Just a fresh, clean meal. Yes I think $9 for two ears of corn is outrageous,  but there were tasty, at least!  The soul rolls were flavorful filled with collard greens and next time I'll pass on the Creole Fries... just...fries.  The Tilapia was excellently grilled and served over jambalaya rice with al dente mixed veggies, but make sure you ask for the creole sauce on the side...too much salt! And I usually am the one who licks the salt off the Margarita glass... this was like that...but \"ain't no Margarita \"!  I'll definitely give it another try. Brittany was a delightful , attentive server and Amanda the Manager made her rounds asking for honest feedback on service, food and drinks!  With the garage door that opens on pleasant days... nice place to relax!"}
{"text":"I would love to leave a review singing the praises of this place. However, I fear I will never get the chance to actually taste the food here as I have been waiting for 50 minutes for a take out order. At about the 40th minute, I asked the young lady at the take out counter about the status of my food, only to be told \"It should be out soon, we're  really busy tonite\"....um what?!   Mind you, I drove 30 minutes to get here. I tried calling my order in ahead several times, but this place doesn't believe in answering their phones, so I had to chance  it and just swing on by...bad idea!   At this point it doesn't matter if my burger comes out sprinkled in the dust of rare diamonds and is served to me on fine China accompanied by a complimentary cocktail served in a crystal flute as an apology for my incredibly long wait...I will never, ever be back her again!   I live in Ohio City. With all the amazing food offerings to choose from between there, Gordon Square and Tremont, there is no reason to drive a half an hour and still wait an hour for a takeout order.   By the way,  I'm still (insert explicative) waiting!!!!!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I were huge fans of Black Box Fix; and we were very excited to try the bistro as soon as it opened. We went in around 8 PM on a Thursday, excited to get some of our favorite burgers in Cleveland again. The new location is quite nice and has a great ambiance, the open garage door allows for a nice breeze and lets you look out on to Lee Road. I'm sure it will be much nicer once construction finishes on Lee. We were rapidly seated and handed menus.   We ordered the corn appetizer and asked for some waters initially. The appetizer came out in a fair amount of time, they were exceptional in flavor. However we were served the appetizer without any small plates or cutlery; we requested some plates and cutlery and were brought plates but again no cutlery. So we resorted to eating it with our hands. Flavor and seasoning were spectacular thus far, but the service left something to be desired.  Prior to the appetizer coming out we had both ordered the Hibachi burgers done medium, and requested the fries extra crispy as we've always had issues with the fries from Black Box being rather floppy. We waited what felt like an exceptionally long time for our burgers to come out, and ultimately they came out. What followed was one of the more disappointing meals I've experienced, especially for a burger I've had before and loved in the past. The burger and fries were cold, so much so that the parmesan cheese that was placed on top of the fries didn't even soften. The burger that we requested done medium was clearly done rare and quite pink in the center. The patty and shrimp on the burger as well as the bun were cold. The worst part was that fries, which we had requested extra crispy, were still rather flaccid.   For desert we ordered the Pineapple Express Cake, which was pretty much a pile of whipped creme in a pie crust with a canned pineapple ring on it. I'll take fault for this as I should have read the description on the menu where it stated it was whipped creme. To be fair though, it shouldn't be called a cake. We requested our checks, after handing us our check the waitress stood over our shoulders watching and waiting for us to tip which felt quite awkward.   Overall it took my roommate and I slightly under 2 hours to get a burger and fries, which came out cold. The flavors were there and taste was good, the high quality of the ingredients being used was evident,  and the ambience was great. The service left quite a lot to be desired.   I give any new restaurant two chances before I write it off so I will visit again in a few weeks just incase the events of my first visit were due to them being newly opened. Until then however I will hesitate before recommending it to friends or colleagues. I will update my review after my next visit."}
{"text":"Eclectic restaurant featuring southern classics like buttermilk fried chicken and street corn. Burgers were great! Dessert, simple, but homemade and delicious. We had the carrot cake and loved it. Very friendly staff. Lots of personal involvement and attention to detail from owner made us feel like we were dining at the home of good friends."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Black Box Fix. The Fix Bistro is okay.  Its fairly new. Food was the same like the Black Box Fix plus additional food. Alcoholic drinks could be better. They were too pricey."}
{"text":"The buttermilk fried chicken was so delicious as were the sides. Our server kept apologizing for the wait even though it didn't seem that long. Literally as we started eating my fiancé said \"I don't mind waiting when the food is this good.\" A few minutes later the manager came over and offered us free dessert for the wait which wasn't necessary. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG Sandwich: 5/5. Incredibly tasty sandwich with great Cajun flavor. Very filling, very good.   Cajun Fries: 4/5. Pretty good, but weren't served hot  Service: 3/5. Waiter said food would be done in 14 min and it took 45 minutes. Restaurant only had one other table at the time.   Atmosphere: 4/5. Nice music, good vibes. A little cold, but overall a nice atmosphere.   Price: 4/5. Pricey, but lots of food.   Overall: 4/5. Would come again."}
{"text":"Greasy & No Seasoning If I do go back i will just have a drink no food bar looks nice"}
{"text":"Had a great time at a birthday party here food was good and waiter Devon was very professional which I had my first turkey Ruben was very good I would recommend with the fries next they go out of there way too make sure you are pleased with the service"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time there. The food was superb, service was excellent. Food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here last night.  The service was excellent.  We ordered the corn appetizer and I had the Cajun tilapia and he had the salmon. Both pieces of fish were cooked perfectly. The corn appetizer was a bit overpriced but was really good.  The drinks were also good. I had their version of a Long Island Ice Tea...it was a bit sour for my taste but was really potent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This. Is. My. Favorite. Restaurant.   No, but really. The Fix offers a fantastic dining experience: The food is beyond flavorful. The staff are friendly and eager to serve. The drinks are consistently above average. The specials are equal parents inventive and delicious. The locale is cozy and intimate; great for both many or few. Don't pass up the opportunity to eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm dropping my review to 4 stars is because they only had 1 server on for the entire restaurant tonight.  At one point, I asked him if he needed my help. I understand it's Wednesday but, they were packed! Poor guy was alone and there were a lot of pissed off people. It wasn't his fault."}
{"text":"Wonderful drinks, food and service. Loved it. Soul rolls are as good as everyone says. Philly was awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland! The music, vibe, set up is so relaxed and the drinks are everything. No matter what you like to eat, you will find a favorite here. The perfect place for after a long day of work. And the staff is so nice and personable!"}
{"text":"Best place in Cedar Lee neighborhood. Everything is great here. We have dined here six times trying new items and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the OMG Philly with fries and it was very good! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the fries were great"}
{"text":"I had the OMG Philly. Food was good, originally came to try the LBJ Philly...but the restaurant said they were out of ingredients to make the sandwich. We were very disappointed since that was the only reason we went."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. First time was \"meh\". Wanted to give it a second try. Came in hoping for the fix street corn appetizer. When I asked for it our server explained that it was taken off of the menu in an effort to make the place more \"upscale\". I smiled & am one all for reinventing yourself. The only problem with this is the fact that this place is no where near upscale. The tablecloths are covered by a sheet of white paper. Felt like I was at one of those boiling seafood places. The drinkwear is plastic. Chairs remind me of my high school cafeteria. We asked for the lobster pasta dish...they were out of it. Our appetizer came out after our entrees. There's a lot of work to be done before I'd consider this place \"upscale\". Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Came her friday night for dinner on a whim. Walking down Lee and trying to see which places we havent tried yet and settled on this one. We were pleasantly surprised.  Decor- 4 stars- seats were comfortable and place was well lit. Tables were kind of just put where every they would fit and no uniformity but we also weren't on top of other people so thats always a plus.  Food-5 stars/. Had the chicken sandwich special with was with a cognac sauce that was amazing. the fries were well cooked and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese. The Chicken was nicely fried with a great seasoning to it. The roll was standard.  Service- 4 stars/ Service was friendly. Had a free drink as they were doing a promotion for the same cognac that was in our sauce. At the end had trouble finding our server for the bill, but all in all a good night.. WE will be back!"}
{"text":"This is an average restaurant with above average prices. 13.00 for lunch vegetarian fried rice. With prices that high you would expect table cloth and silverware. Instead no table cloth and plastic utensils."}
{"text":"I went to the Fix to sit down and eat for a birthday party a week ago, which was actually my first time doing that. It was a terrible experience and the only reason why was because of the server. The food and drinks were great, but the server was rude and pushy. My friend wanted to order an appetizer and the server told her that someone else had ordered one already. Mind you, she wasn't with the person that ordered the appetizer, so I didn't understand the relevance of his reply. Next, he tried to rush us out by telling us that we had to leave because another party needed to be seated. I've been a server before and the one thing I remember was that you could never tell your customers that they had to leave unless need be. That was not a legitimate reason. I am disappointed at this experience."}
{"text":"Went to the Fix Bistro for dinner last night for their grand opening since moving to their new location. The restaurant is much larger and much nicer, with an active stocked bar and a lot of extra seating. They seem to have increased the amount of staff as there are now servers, bartenders, and even someone to direct customers to the register for takeout orders.  == The Food ==    Overall, the food is pretty much the same as Black Box Fix was, extremely delicious southern-style food that you know is absolutely terrible for you, but you will enjoy every single bite and crave some more. It isn't so overly rich that you'll want to avoid it for a month or two after having it, like at Melt Diner or other places. Portions are extremely generous and you can probably expect to have leftovers or at the very least feeling satisfied.  The food is cooked in a very appropriate fashion. My girlfriend tried the sampler, which gave us a good impression of the variety of their menu. The chicken sandwich was cooked perfectly: I generally expect restaurant chicken to be cooked to the point that it is dry, but this chicken was still juicy, delicious, and well seasoned. The soul roll was just as delicious and perfectly cooked as their previous location. It was crispy on the outside but still moist on the inside. It comes with a deliciously sweet chili dipping sauce that is not too spicy and matched well with the soul roll. The Parmesan fries were crisp and warm, though the Parmesan was placed on the fries immediately before serving which left it unmelted atop the fries; they could be improved by melting the cheese a bit before serving.  I ordered the Railroader, a favorite of mine from their previous location. While this burger normally melts in my mouth, I felt like something was missing. Not only did it need a bit more seasoning, but I believe the Gouda or caramelized onion sauce was missing, though I still enjoyed it.  == The Location ==    It is clear they want to attract a much bigger crowd given the new, larger location and increase in staff. The building has room for potentially 50 diners at once and while I expected it to be crowded for their grand opening, there were only a dozen or so individuals eating in, though there were regularly customers coming in to order or pick up takeout. The restaurant doesn't seem very well organized; If you were to walk in wanting to place an order you wouldn't know where to go, as the takeout registers are located in the back of the building, across the dining hall, rather than near the front door. Even with direction we were confused if we were being directed to the bar to order until we noticed the two registered tucked away in the back.  I also noticed a faint smell of sewer near the back, though I attribute that to the recent underground construction coupled with the heavy rain Cleveland has received lately. Still, it was strong enough to make me want to sit on the other side of the building where the smell wasn't noticeable.  Chef Eric seems to want to attract a much larger dining crowd, especially considering the extended hours until 1:00am on the weekends and now opening on Sundays, but the kitchen hours are vastly different than the store hours. Even though the restaurant is open until 1:00am, the bar closes at 10:00pm and the kitchen offers restricted starting at 11:00pm and closes at 12:00am. It is also strange that they are opened for lunch during the week, but not during the weekend when more people would be available to visit their location.  They might want to consider reducing the available seating and making better use of the available space. Some additional forms of entertainment might be a good addition, like a pool table or some other games customers can play during the usually long waits.  == The Service ==    As it was opening night, we were immediately greeted at the door by several individuals who ushered us in the direction of the registers to place an order, even though our intention was to eat in. We eventually made our intentions clear and were given the seat of our choice, and there were many choices, and a server brought us menus.  Overall, the service was... subpar. Most if not all of the employees from the old restaurant are still on staff and handling the takeout orders. I believe our server may have been new, as many requests had to be made throughout the evening, so take these comments with a grain of salt:  * Chef Eric offers a soup of the day, but we were never told what it was. * After ordering, we were not checked on until our food arrived. * We were not given flatware, and had to request it. * There were no napkins available. * There was no salt or pepper on the table and had to request it. * Our drinks (water) were not monitored and we had to request refills. The refills were from a dollar store pitcher with room temperature water.  Even though there were many requests, everything was attended to immediately."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I loved Black Box Fix, but since opening this spot, the quality has really taken a nose dive. Came in on a Wednesday evening to place a takeout order and have a cocktail. Grabbed a seat at the bar, bartender was quite friendly. Ordered a vodka/cran and hubs ordered an old fashioned. The bar is NOT fully stocked. Bartender, while nice, did not know how to make an old fashioned. They didn't have the proper ingredients, so made it with Jack Daniels (weird!). Food took about 45 minutes to come out. One round of drinks and 3 to-go entrees around $80! Got home to eat, found out our entire order wasn't there! My railroader (fave sandwich on the menu) was underseasoned and underwhelming. Hubs had the LBJ and said it was fantastic (had better be with filet mignon on it.) Will I eat here again, probably, but not anytime soon and definitely not having a drink there. Sorry."}
{"text":"You ever been to a restaurant that just makes you want to slap the sh*t outta someone cause it's so dang good? This is one of those places for me. To begin, our server was amazing! It was our first time so we asked her for recommendations- she definitely did not fail us. We had fixed street corn as an appetizer (heaven!!) and for our entrees we had the OMG Philly and the BMF chicken (both to freakin die for!!) not to mention the drinks are both tasty and get ya feeling right! (Recommend the Carmel appletini)  I love this place, if I could give more stars I definitely would!"}
{"text":"The best corn on the cob ever. What a nice group of young people working there. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Creole Turkey Reuben and it was very tasty. The turkey meat was so tender and had a great taste.  The cabbage added a nice flavor. The prices are fair and I appreciate the service. I was greeted when I entered with smiles. I did order a glass of Lina wines which it is good to see them supporting other local businesses. The only reason they only got four stars because the only been open for about two weeks and the are working out the kinks.  Wine is not different from liquor there are different calibers of wine (some high end and some not) therefore the price should reflect that. Price mark up is required to run a business the average mark up is 200-300% and the average consumer may pay it or may not so keeping with the average mark up is expected.  The consumer is very knowledgeable and wiser about the money they spend and definitely want to get what they feel is worth their money.  Overall the food, service and atmosphere was nice. Was eating during lunch time so many people were picking up food to go, only a few people dining in."}
{"text":"Both the Food and Atmosphere are Excellent! Greeted and seating immediately upon entering. We ordered and received our food rather quickly despite the restaurant being full. They even had a live jazz band playing  with no cover charges. I truly enjoyed my entire experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Clearly one of the best new restaurants and best Chefs in town. Everything we had was delicious. Service outstanding also with focused, conversational waitstaff. Can't wait to go again. Hurry..."}
