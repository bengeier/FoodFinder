{"text":"the place is really cute and earthy.
They have a very big selection of freshly pressed juice. All fresh ingredients, there even protein powder extras. 

The reason i'm giving it 3 start is because the portions are very small for the expensive price. 
I could have went to Ju-go Juice, order a large for the same price and it would actually be a large. Their \"large\" are in fact smalls, and the smalls are extra small.  

But the juices tastes amazing. I cannot complain on that.
 Mine was 8$ with taxes for a \"large\".
Yes fruits are expensive, yes a store has to make its profit."}
{"text":"Best smoothies, best juices, best chia pudding and BEST smoothie bowls!!! 
The staff is super friendly and makes sure to let you know that you can omit or add to whatever you order."}
{"text":"I go to rejuice every morning to start my day! The service is awesome (cute too) , amazing fresh juices and such a variety! Great addition to Sherbrooke street."}
{"text":"Great service ! Good employees! They explain all of the products perfectly, definitely worth the $! Alexis and Amanda were the best ! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Not very good, the prices are too high for size and quality of products provided. I like green smoothies and they are very difficult to find anywhere in Montreal. The green smoothie at this place was so full of ginger it was inedible, it was like a tobasco smoothie. If it was called \"ginger overload\" I would have known what I was getting into, but because it was the only green one on the menu I tried it.

I can't recommend this place because of the prices, quantity, or quality. The smoothies I suspect no one has ever tried them before putting them on the menu, I suspect they came from a generic \"health smoothie\" cookbook uninspired and unoriginal"}
{"text":"I come to Rejuice almost every day, sometimes twice a day. I love everything there. Juices, smoothies, coffee, salads and soups. Everything tastes amazing..and gluten free and organic. I am so excited this place opened up. 
And the staff is super friendly, they make you feel like good old friends as soon as you walk into the door! 

I wish for more rejuices locations in Montreal:)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I went in, as the woman couldn't make the drink I ordered, and it did not taste good. I waited almost 10 minutes for her to make it, and then I had to return it. I expect more when I pay $12 for a drink. Too bad as the drinks tasted good on previous visits."}
{"text":"Terrible \"smoothie\" made with zero care by someone who didn't know the difference between romaine and kale-- or was hoping I didn't. Tasteless and watery result."}
{"text":"They just mouve to a new nice local 2 corner ouest sherbrooke 5211 . Tres bons jus pour l'été , also available warm drinks for the rest of the year.. Little terrasse under the tree."}
