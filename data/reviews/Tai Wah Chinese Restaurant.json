{"text":"I NEVER leave a negative review, but I had to, to help others make informed decisions.

First, when I entered the restaurant to pick up my food, the place seemed dirty. That should have been my clue and I should have walked out. So, my review may be biased since I was grossed out from the get go.

Egg rolls have funky spice smell not present in any other egg rolls I've ever tasted. All the food I ordered tasted like they were stir fried in very low heat. It is supposed to be seared in high heat, but it almost seems like they were steamed with oil. GROSSSSS!
I ordered  Mongolian beef, chicken fried rice, sesame chicken, chicken lo mein, shrimp with lobster sauce and egg rolls. They were all bad. If you are expecting your typical Chinese food, this is not it.
Worst experience Ever."}
{"text":"Okay yes, four stars, but I'll have to throw out some caveats.  Firstly, it's a family run Chinese restaurant so the service is always lacking.  Therefore, I'm ranking the service on a curve where the far right side only rises to 'tolerable' which is where this place sits (I had to get my own beer and track down the waitress for more rice, etc.).  Secondly, I've eaten here twice and I've never ordered off of the 'English' menu and I cannot attest to how that food tastes (but from its appearance I wouldn't go there to eat that even if I did find myself in the mood for 'fried stuff covered with red stuff').

So all that said, there is a strategy to employ when eating at this restaurant.  Like many Chinese restaurants around American universities, they have two menus: one of 'Kung Pow Whatzit' type dishes that's in English, and a second menu that has delicious fare closer to actual Chinese food which is written only in Chinese.  I definitely wanted to eat the good stuff, so I developed and implemented a long term scheme to sponsor a Chinese foreign exchange high school student for several years until they finally went to Kent State for college.  At that point it was just a matter of cleverly suggesting that we eat at this restaurant so that someone could translate the menu for me.  It's probably the best Chinese food this far north of campus without traveling to the east side of Cleveland (which is probably your only option should you lack a Chinese foreign exchange student to pal around with)."}
{"text":"If negative stars were an option, I'd give this crap shack a negative five. We had the unfortunate displeasure of \"dining\" here recently. I use dining loosely because we ended up not eating the majority of our food. Our food was not made right and when we asked for it to be corrected the horrible troll of an owner assured us that the food was good, and that it was our opinion that it was bad. Very poor customer service from a women who's business management, and cooking skills are on par with that of a small child who stumbled into mummy's kitchen. This discussing, greasy swill of a restaurant should be condemned and in its place anything, and I mean anything should replace it. If a shop opened that served deep fried dog crap rolled in stale peanuts opened in its place, I assure you that it would be better. These people do not deserve to be in the restaurant business. There citizenship (if they have it) should be revoked and they should be sent back to whatever God forsaken part of the earth they came from."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat!! The service cannot be beat. The food is delicious, and you get more than enough food to fill you up. I love coming here with my boyfriend, and my family and I often get take-out."}
{"text":"The food is horrible and the service is worse. When we told the owner that what we ordered was not pad ti and that we wanted it off the bill she flipped out on us. We then told her that we would be telling people not to come here and she said she would sue us. Don't go there unless you feel like dealing with a psychotic Chinese women. I would not feed this crap to my dogs."}
{"text":"I made a giant mistake returning to the scene of the crime.

I've seen some decent reviews about the place and overheard some generally positive comments about it in passing, so figured I'd be nice and give it a second shot.

Yep, still awful.

The good:
Anything that was fried seemed ok.  No complaints from our child about the sweet-n-sour chicken, Mom confirmed it was good too.  

Their egg rolls were great.  Large size, perfect crunch, great consistency and good taste.  

The crab Rangoon was much the same...fine because it's fried.

The bad:
Fried rice.  Their fried rice was awful.  Perhaps the worst batch I've ever had in my life.  Further, it smelled bad.  Get a wiff of the box and it smelled stale and nasty.  Compared this to the steamed rice that had no scent at all.  I remember long ago a teacher explaining to me that today's fried rice is yesterday's steamed rice.  Yet, at this place my bet is it's a scene out of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and it's last week's steamed rice.

Sesame chicken.  Not even close to what you'd be used to in a normal Chinese restaurant.  Their take on it had it more on par with a typical walnut chicken...just didn't taste right at all.  I even sung the Muppet's tune with Stadler and Waldorf to my kids, \"why do we always come here, I'll guess we'll never know...it's like a kind of torture to [have to eat their food].\"

Green beans.  We expect green beans with a slight hint of garlic, Tai Wah's are prepared in a sweet sauce.  They just get it wrong.

Damage Done: $55 for a family of four.  Ridiculous.  I could spend a similar amount down the street at Noble House and come away beyond delighted.  Quite honestly, Tai Wah robs you without a gun.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd have been better off going to a bad Chinese lunch buffet.  At least their non-fried food would have been fresh.

Our six year old put it best, \"don't eat bad Tai Wah.\""}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered their Pad Thai which consisted of only noodles and egg - no peanuts or any kind of sauce. Very bland and not at all Pad Thai. We also ordered cashew chicken which was bland. We will not go back."}
{"text":"We moved to Hudson 6 months ago and have tried this place 3 times.  I wanted it to be good.... I willed it to be good..... But it just isn't.  We ordered the hot and sour soup this time and it was not edible.  It tasted like slightly spicy dishwater.  I sent it back and the owner was so angry that she didn't speak to us for the rest of the meal.  None of the dishes were good.  I am officially giving up.  We won't be back again."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the negative reviews were about. I found this place to be okay.

As I have said in past reviews, I'm not a fan of Chinese food. Just not a big fan of throwing a whole bunch of vegetables together (before anybody messages me about Chinese food, I know I'm making a generalization). However, I felt the food here was adequate. They have a full-service bar behind the counter, but I was at an event for work. No drinking here. They also have soft drinks.

Dishes here are reasonably priced and large. I had a tub -- yes, a tub -- of ribs. I'm not talking about your typical babyback ribs. I'm talking about Chinese-style ribs, marinated in some sauce for three decades at a time (or so it seems). The food here was high in flavor but low in filler, something many Chinese restaurants around here fail at doing. Finally, the service. You cannot beat the service here."}
{"text":"Kind of jumping the gun on this one, but the dish I had was very good.  A strip mall Chinese Thai place.  Typical decor with the gold lions and fish on the wall.  Very nice service.  It was kind of late.  So not to many people around.  
I ate the green curry pork.  Finally a spicy Thai dish that's spicy!  Not face melting hot, but you know its there.  Very creamy rich coconut milk curry with just sticky enough steamed rice.
I was very happy with this dish, but its all I have had there.  But I will be back to see if the rest sucks or not."}
{"text":"So it's lunch time when I look over and see Tai Wah Chinese Restaurant, not many places in Hudson to go when your feenin for some quick fried rice, so I go in to assess the place, they pass all the test so I ask about their cuisine, my 1st question in any Asian restaurant what do you put in your (pork)fried rice, very specifically (pork)fried rice, for 1 that's the only thing I eat and for 2 I didn't want (feline)fried rice, so the guy taking my order, say's to my question \"what do we put in our fried? well, let's see, onion, and a little bit of sprouts\" so I say \"that's it, just rice, pork, onion, and sprouts?\" he says \"yes\". So I order it to go, please & thank you. Get home to find out I have EGGS in my fried rice, noooooooooo! Everybody knows DeLena does not do eggs! So I look up the phone number, lady comes on the line, and passes the phone to the same guy that took my order, which later I find out is the owner, and the cook, he's says \"yes, I told you onions & bean sprouts only\" I say \"right! You didn't say anything about EGGS!\" he says \"oh, I didn't know you didn't want eggs\", I never said \"hold the eggs\" because he never included EGGS! So he tells me to bring it back and he will replace it for no charge. SERIOUSLY, was there ever a question that there would have been a charge that I was going to pay...but I tell him that I was on a lunch break at that time, & I would not be heading that direction again until next week. He SAYS TO ME \"Well, just bring it back next week when you come, & I will replace it with no egg,no charge\" again SERIOUSLY! feeling frustrated*(, never again Tai Wah Chinese in Hudson, Ohio! Some people are highly allergic to EGG!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since our family moved to Hudson 12 years ago.  They have really downsized in recent years but the food is still reliably good.  Chinese is definitely their specialty more-so than Thai although the Thai dishes I have tried were okay.  Also their food is much better when you dine in than carry-out. 

Best thing about this place: dishes are reasonably priced and they don't skimp on seafood, veggies, or meat.  Veggies are still crisp and fresh like they should be, not overcooked and mushy, and the seafood and meat also cooked correctly rather than overdone and dried out.  I've also noticed that their food is much less salty and oily than other Chinese restaurants in this area.    

As one can tell from the atmosphere of the place, by no means is Tai Wah a fancy or gourmet restaurant, but the food is dependably hot, tasty, and plentiful."}
