{"text":"I had the pleasure of seeing their booth at the Uptown Farmers Market and bought the plant-based pepper jack cheese block for $10. It was so creamy and smooth and addictive! We were immediately convinced after our sample nibble. The entire block was devoured that night. It's soft enough to use as a spread for a cracker, or the texture seems like it can be easily melted as well. So many recipes I'm going to add this to!! I'm eyeing their brie (omg so excited!), fresh mozzarella, and jackfruit. I don't think I can wait a whole week to get my fix! Their website is super easy to navigate so you can place an order for pickup or delivery. I'm so happy this company exists in our desert!"}
{"text":"I recently bought some of Sol Kitchen's vegan cheeses and meat at Zen Nights. The cashew cheese is a good spread for crackers or tortilla chips. It's full of garlic flavor. We had the vegan pepperoni on pizza. The consistency is great, but it's very pepper-y, so beware if you don't like spice. It added lots of flavor to the pizza. The best item we got was the vegan pepper-jack cheese. I added it to a baked bean burrito. It melted well and a little goes a long way. The texture is creamy, but the flavor is spot on. It's so great to have vegan deli foods made right here in the greater Phoenix area! I don't think they are available in stores yet, but are frequently at farmers markets like the Uptown Farmers Market."}
{"text":"Awesome cheeze is all I can say! I bought the cheddar spread for crackers and the pepper jack block and they both had an amazing addictive flavor! Since I live in California I didn't have a chance to go back for more but I definitely will be getting some when I go back to Az to visit. I also bought their pepperoni and their sausage and they were both so good! We had them on pizza and it added great flavor and texture. The sausage could definitely be used for so much more though! Definitely worth buying!"}
