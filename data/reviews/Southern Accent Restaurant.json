{"text":"The food was fantastic. We tried the hush puppies, Cajun calamari, poutine with brisket, the bourbon street chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and the steak with fries. The atmosphere was very cool and had a very good feeling of \"home\". The only two things that I would complain about is sometimes we felt the food wasn't as hot as it should be, perhaps it was sitting before it came to us and in part with that, our waitress sometimes took a long time to come back to the table. However it is Winterlicious and the place was packed, so that could be to blame. But overall fantastic experience, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a friend and my birthdays. I had called for a reservation on Thursday, a little late i know, and asked for a spot for 15 people at 8PM. They said it was unlikely but they would call me back.  A few hours later they called back and told me they could get me a spot for 12 at 8:30 but that was it.  Fortunately, a few people had cancelled and this number was fine but the reservation had to be at 9. The day of the event they called back telling me that 9 was too early and we had to come at 9:30. I asked if we could still arrive at 8:30 but hang out by the bar. They were fine with this.

When we arrived at 8:30 they told us that our table was ready?? Good for us, but it kinda sucks because a few friends had cancelled since they felt 9:30 was too late to be eating dinner.

As far as the food goes, I really loved it and so did everyone else. Not many of my friends have had exposure to this style of cooking and I'm glad they got to experience it. Now I just have to convince them all to take a trip to New Orleans with me.

Another thing that's great about this place is the bourbon selection. Other than expensive steakhouses there aren't too many places in Toronto with a really good bourbon selection. I got a chance to try out some varieties i've never had before and a few of us tried out the bourbon tasting menu as well. This is a great idea if you want to experience a few different hard to find bourbons.

The waiter was really friendly and helpful and they even moved us to a larger private room because we were kinda cramped in our first one. I don't think it was meant for 12 people. 

Aside from the annoying problems making a reservation this place was amazing and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to be one of my FAVOURITE places in Toronto. The only place that could remotely compete with Southern Accent (& Express in Scarborough) is the Royal Oyster House in New Orleans. I love the Mardi Gras vibe. Nestled in Mirvish Village and surrounded by other old fashioned houses on a quiet street, Southern Accent is a hidden gem in Toronto. Last week, I had celebrated my birthday there and the food was just as amazing as it was from my last visit: the Voodoo pasta (seafood) was tender and spicy, the piquant shrimp was truly hot, the blackened chicken was served in a huge portion. My husband had the hush puppies, ribs, and a serving of corn bread (all yummy), the bread pudding was gooey good and the cantaloupe sorbet cooled down my burning tongue from all that spicy goodness. Tried my first shot of absinthe....*grin* Warning: the portions are VERY generous, so if you can't finish it all then take it home. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Southern Accent last night for a large Birthday party. A large party is a challenge for any restaurant but they were ready for us. The food was great & the atmosphere was fun. The menu had something for everyone. (You do have to be a fan of southern food to start or at least open to tasty food)

The Hurricanes are REAL and somewhat lethal as a good hurricane should be ."}
{"text":"I'm from the deep south (about an hour from New Orleans) and while the food here is not really authentic Cajun or New Orleans (two different things), it's quite good.  The blackened chicken livers are really good!

I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Thursday night after a meeting at about 9 PM. Having been to the old restaurant on markham Street way back I hoped this would be an opportunity to enjoy what I remembered at the Markham Street location years ago. The restaurant is new to the area but I've been there for  about 40 years. Had the prefix menu along with my guest and both of us started off with the shrimp bisque. It tasted very shrimpy but had the texture of glue. They serve some cornbread which never has been one of my personal favorites but having said that despite the fact that it was oversweetened in my opinion it was adequate. Next is the main course I had the jambalaya which was quite simply the worst in my life. There were a total of five shrimp no larger than my thumbnail and obviously Asian pond raised shrimp. Again the size of the shrimp a total of five with no bigger than my thumb now. This source was tasteless the rice had the texture of glue and there were a total of count this three minuscule pieces of what they referred to as sausage. Could've been Oscar Myers at best. This was just simply the most disappointing meal I've had in months at a total cost of $104 with tax and tip it represented what I consider to be The worst value of any restaurant I've been to in a long long time and for anybody that's even considering this place I would strongly suggest you take a pass. It would be my guess not my hope at my guess that if they don't improve the quality of their food substantially and quickly they too will go the way of the dodo bird like the two previous restaurants before them at that location. There's nothing more than I love to see that a successful restaurant having been in the business for many years but you know way shape or form do they stand a chance if they continue along the same path.
Oh yes and we had the chocolate cake for dessert they must've been following the same recipe as they did for the soup and the jambalaya because it also have the texture of glue. By the way I'm not joking I sent it back thinking if they replaced it with some of their homemade ice cream it had to be OK thinking if they went to the effort of making their own homemade ice cream it should be a signature dish .
Both my guest and I had one small spoon of the ice cream and decided to cut our losses and leave for the evening. Frankly speaking this restaurant could unlikely get much worse.!"}
{"text":"This is a great place - the only real complaint I'd have is that it was a little warm inside.  We had the cornbread and gumbo to start, both of which were exceptional.  I had the blackened steak, which was delicious but just slightly overcooked (which I'll forgive!).  My partner had the jambalaya, which was excellent!

Service was a little slow (it was a busy night),but the server was very personable

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night for dinner, it was our first time there and was not sure what to expect.  The food and service was above anything we could have imagined.  The waitstaff  was really attentive and assisted us with all our questions. The wait staff also really knew how to describe the dishes and how they were made which is rare at most places. They are also able to accomodate any dietary restrictions.  We had the crab cakes which were good and the gumbo which was amazing.  Mains including the lamb chops which were fantastic and the brisket which was also very good. The bread pudding for desert was the best i ever had and the drinks were excellent.  We also really enjoyed the psychic and the atmosphere.  We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"I love to order a table full of apps and a Martini when I visit Southern Accent. I also love to introduce this great spot to friends visiting Toronto. The apps are always amazing and the Martinis are to die for - and it's fun to get your palm read for dessert!"}
{"text":"70$ for two people.. this is the affordable course menu. Usually 1 entree is around $20.

The food is quite good, a bit too salty for my taste, but still very delicious.
70$ seems a bit expensive, but you get a lot of food. Portions are huge and dessert is fabulous. Service was also great! Ambiance is awesome - good for first dates.

It's cozy, cute and colorful.

I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went on a Travelzoo voucher fixed prix thing but didn't need to. Their menu is extensive and has many well priced items. No need to do the set menu option. 

I had the picante shrimp - delicious and just spicy enough. The hush puppies with it were great dipped in the sauce. The cornbread a friend had with her gumbo was a bit dry. The cajun combo jumbo was quite delish, particularly the candied yams (hint of cinnamon) and the blackened lamb dipped inn the lemon beurre. The sweet potato brownie w praline topping was incredible. I added a small scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream for $2. My friend had the bread pudding in a bourbon sauce and it was also amazing. The sauce was perfect - sweet, smooth, with a strong bourbon taste. 

Service was a bit spotty and slow and they weren't great at selling the menu. 

The restaurant's cookbook for sale had all of their recipes. Can't wait to try something from it. 

The garlic lime hot sauce they make and sell is nice and peppery spicy too."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Saturday before going to see a play. Told the waiter we had a time limit. And they had no trouble getting our food out.

We ordered the chicken livers as an appetizer (delicious!). And promptly ordered our main dishes (lamb chops, bourbon chicken, and voodoo pasta). I have never seen my friends eat their meals so quickly! They loved the flavour and the quality of their meals.

We were out of the restaurant with time to spare. I will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes! Great, friendly service! And my top shelf vodka martini was perfectly \"dirty\" with three olives."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Funky interior, always participates in the winterlicious program.  The psychic on the weekends is great.  Best whiskey sours.  Great first date place.  Love it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to winterlicious last night at Southern Accent and the food proved to be somewhat disappointing. Located on a small street with outside xmas light decorations, the victorian building looked quaint and promising from the outside.  I could picture how this place could be in the summer with an outside patio.  So with some anticipation and eagerness, I entered the building.

Once in, I was promptly brought to our table.  The room I was led into was decorated with several dozen pictures of this black and white dog.  It was very different and interesting, while beeing somewhat disconcerting as everywhere you turned, you were faced with the same dog that was staring straight at you. Made you wonder which artist had this dog as a pet and whether he mourned his long lost loved dog through his art.

So without much deliberation or hesitation, we decided to both order the Orzo with squash and scallops for the apetizer as starters.  The Orzo tasted ok, the scallops were very salty, and there were som esunflower seeds in the dish which made it crunchy.  My friend said he could taste the spice but i felt the entire dish was abit bland with the exception of the super salty scallops which is the only thing i can remember.

For the main course, we decided to order the  Creole Jambalaya and the Cajun Turducken.  The Creole Jambalaya was a disappointment for me. The rice was mushy, and there was no taste to it other than an overpowering tomatoe sauce.  I couldn't taste the chicken, ham, andouille sausage. There were two grilled small tiger shrimps. We left one third of the dish half eaten as we couldn't even stomach the rest. Compared to Big Daddy's crabshack, this jambalaya was below my expectations. My friend also commented that the spice wasn't evenly distributed so it seems that someone forgot to stir the dish!!
The Turdcken chicken  was supposed to be turkey, duck, chicken, and 3 stuffings, oyster, cornbread/andouille, and sage/onion with pecans.  I could only taste the dry turkey.  There was something hard and dry that could have been chicken or duck, but there was no taste and i could not distinguish, there was so little filling that I could not taste any of the the ingredients listed.  On the positive side, the garlic mash and the side seasonal vegetables (a mix of carrots, crunchy green peas, and baby bok choy) were very good.  I tried to focus on the sides to forget the taste of the main dish and the Jambalaya.

The dessert we ordered was the Nawlins Bread Pudding and the Pavlova.  The Bread Pudding was good with bouron sauce, but it was so sweet that we couldn't finish it.  The pavlova was a meringue with fresh fruit and cream on top.  The Fruits left much to be desired as it was sparse and not extremely fresh, the cream was good, but the meringue was sticky at the bottom and tough, we could barely break a piece apart.

So overall, although the food was dissapointing, the service was good. Our waiter was nice and courteous.  My water kept being re-filled without any reminders and our order/bill came very promptly."}
{"text":"Highly recommended- inviting from the moment you walk in- very good food with many options for both carnivores and vegetarians. Felt like a two hour vacation from the cool rainy night outside."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews for this place so I figured I'd give it a shot. Southern comfort food is always good when the mercury starts dropping and the rain is falling.

The interior of this place is kitschy southern. I don't care for it too much but the space itself is nice and intimate -- meaning your chair may back into another table of 2. There is also an entire upstairs space that you could check out.

The hospitality here was as you would expect from the south -- super friendly. It also seems like it's a local neighbourhood haunt for some as the bartender and the manager were seen several times greeting people by first name. 

I honestly couldn't decide what to order here because I wanted everything. Between the catfish, shrimp, lamb, jambalaya, and chicken, it was hard to choose short of just moving to NOLA. I decided to get the Cajun Trio (a smattering of jambalaya, two strips of spicy chicken, and a mini lamb steak). My dining partner ordered the spice-rubbed chicken and calamari. 

Calamari dish - fit for two. (Unless you haven't eaten at all that day).

The Trio was quite nice but the portions were kind of small. I guess I was expecting southern US-sized portions. In any case, it was good to get a taste of everything. The lamb was cooked medium and was nice and moist. The jambalaya had a nice kick (but not mouth-numbing), and the chicken was a little more blackened than I would like (actually I think it was a little burnt) but was moist and tasty. 

This is also one of the few places where you can get ginger beer and mix it with two types of rum (the dark & stormy). Or, if its a schoolnight, have the ginger beer on its own. 

All in all, it came as advertised and I'd definitely come back and pick one dish instead of sampling 3."}
{"text":"In Toronto for work recently and came here for a late foursome dinner. We started with hushpuppies and ordered two plates (four to a plate and they are small). Excuse me, I should have said that we actually STARTED at the bar. Mardi Gras gone wild decor.... we all have a crazy southern place somewhere in our lives, this is Torontos. Enough said. So, back to the bar: The girls got bourbon sours and they were excellent. I hate hate HATE sweet and sour mix (high-fructose corn syrup, COME on) but these were made with freshly-squeezed lemon, so already I am thinking this is a \"free\" drink and had several throughout the night. 
Post-hushpuppies (which were excellent) I had catfish with a basil sauce and though I had never before tried catfish, it was really really good! And the drinks kept flowing..... 
It is also reasonably-priced and could be romantic on a date. Really impressed!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Was in the area to see a fringe festival play and we only had limited time to eat. Wendy made sure to check on us frequently and even remembered what time we had to be finished by. Best service and food I've had in a long time. Hit this place up for Summerlicious and try the lamb, it's to die for."}
{"text":"Why, oh why, have I never been here before!

A friend introduced me to this place and it is amazing!  Everything I ate was fantastic and we made an event of the meal!  The bourbon sours were to die for, the ambiance is festive yet cozy and the staff is friendly and welcoming!

I highly recommend a reading by the resident psychics!  It was a fun addition to our evening.

If you are thinking of going here for dinner do your self a favour...GO!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me...doesn't matter if it is any of the \"licious\" menu or regular menu, the portion is always generous and the staff are friendly. Last time I was there for the Winterlicious, and I was impressed by the portion they served. 

Very cozy place, the patio is a nice dining area when the weather gets warmer. I have to say it is not cheap, so if you wanna see if you are a fan of the Southern food or not...you should try one of the :licious\" events."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was terrible.
We had to wait about 20 minutes for our main dishes to come after we finished our appetizer. 
The guests next to our table got their main dishes first because they ordered the Winterlicious menu.

One of the servers who finally brought our food, did not apologize for the super long wait."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious the other night. There were ten of us, so we got a private room, which was very nice. The room was lovely, with closets to put our coats. The server was amazing - very friendly, efficient, awesome at answering questions or finding the answers if she didn't know them.

The decor was delightfully tacky - kind of like a grown up, classier zelda's - very fun and colourful! I loved it! The restaurant is housed in a victorian house in the Annex, right down the street from Honest Ed's.

The food!!!! Oh wow was it delicious! We had the winterlicious menu, but they did also have a vegan menu for regular dining! With all the vegan items listed so you didn't have to go on a mystery hunt through the regular menu. Lots of food options for vegans, veggies, the gluten-free, and the eat-everything's. To start, I had a vegan cesar salad with creamy garlic tofu dressing and tofu crisps (it comes with the option of croutons for the non gluten-free and parm cheese for the non-vegans).

The main!!!! be still my beating heart! steamed bok choy, an amazing veggie/mushroom/tofu dish in a lovely sauce,BLACK RICE PATTIES!!! so so amazing! I almost couldn't finish it because it was so filling, but I FOUND A WAY.

dessert was an orange sorbet. I felt it was more of a granita, which in my opinion was nicer. there were pieces of actual orange in it!!!

everything was delicious, presentation was amazing, service was great, place was lovely. AND you can hire a PSYCHIC for part of your meal! that's just cool!

I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in New Orleans and so I came to Southern Accent to see if I could find food that matched what I experienced in the South.   Not even close!  The chefs seemed to have no idea how collard greens are supposed to be prepared, they did not have red beans and rice on the menu, and the bread pudding looked like it had been made a week ago and microwaved before serving.  The waitress (owner?) was rude and arrogant (seemed to think that her food was the best Southern food outside of New Orleans).  I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking, but maybe they have never been to the Southern US!!!"}
{"text":"The Jambalaya was very good. Drinks were good and so were the desserts...all in all a nice Cajun restaurant....wish they had Bananas Foster...:).."}
{"text":"I second these parts of Mackenzie's review:
Drinks are delicious (mint julep particularly noteworthy)!
Food is really good...the raw oysters and jerusalem artichoke soup rocked.  And the bourbon bread pudding was fabulous!!
The restaurant atmosphere is definitely cool:  dark and private, with little colored lights around.  Hip clientele.
On service, Mackenzie and I part ways:
Service (by Richard) was phenomenal the night we were there (2/16/2011): he kept the kitchen open for us until we arrived (late), and was a doting waiter/host and conversationalist."}
{"text":"My fella and I went here with a groupon I purchased a while back. Groupon was accepted and processed with no issue, so we were off to a good start. 

We had a fantastic meal! Our server has worked here since more or less the beginning of time, from the sound of it, and knows everything about all the food and drinks and regaled us with many stories about the restaurant and its history. I appreciate that. She even bent over backward to accomodate my gluten-free diet, without ever seeming annoyed or judgemental. Not that she needed to - the restaurant has a seperate gluten free menu listing all the things that are safe to eat! 

We had a sazerac (a bit sweeter than the ones we had in New Orleans, but still yummy) and a julep (delish), followed by a bourbon sour (freshly squeezed limes!) and a bourbon tasting series (fun). We ate gumbo (not me, but my partner said it was yummy), pickled okra, beef brisket (amazeballs!), blackened chicken livers (don't even think about it, just eat them. they're amazing), and the rack of lamb (HUGE! easily twice as much lamb as I was expecting, and served with this brilliant sauce/salsa - well worth the splurge). 

We were seated upstairs rather than down, which was ok, but much brighter and not quite as full of character as the area downstairs. Try to request a table downstairs, where you can watch the bar, sit in cute little curtained nooks, and feel the bustle that is so authentically New Orleans. 

We can't wait for an excuse to go back! I overheard someone saying they're doing another groupon in January, so I'll be eagerly watching my inbox and will pounce when I see it."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  The food is great, bourbon list is good and the ambiance is so over the top tacky you can't help but love it.

Highly recommend the livers, the catfish, collard greens and the cornbread."}
{"text":"OK, Southern Accent, I was psyched to visit you and eat Cajun food. Now, less psyched after my evening there.

Pros: the pecan pie is delicious. Like daaaaaaang delicious.

The fish I had (not catfish, a catch of the day of some kind) was tasty and perfectly cooked. Very nice, and the spice rub on it was good too. Some bones, but that happens, no worries.

Cons: the website advertised alligator, but they had no alligator! And not like \"oh sorry, we ran out tonight, but we'll have more on Saturday\" but rather \"we get alligator once a year and that period of time is over.\" Which would be fine if their website said anything about seasonality for this dish. I wanted some damn alligator! Ok, whining over (about that).

The ceviche was cooked. Like, the shrimp and scallop must have been boiled. That's not how ceviche IS, man. It's not cooked! It's lime juiced and salted but largely raw-ish. So cooked-through ceviche? That was weird and not tasty.

The vegetables and rice that came with my tasty fish - really blah and meh and other boring words. 

If I could give this place a 2 1/2 star review, that would be spot-on. The service wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just... there. Combine that with an uneven meal, and I'm definitely not rushing back to Southern Accent."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it! 

We had 50th Birthday party at Southern Accent and our guests had FANTASTIC time! 
The atmosphere: just like visiting an old friend's house party in The French Quarter. Charming clutter, tons of candles, dark walls with bright art pieces - you are transported in The Big Easy the minute you step over the threshold. 

The food: we had a hor d'ouvres style party and the food was outstanding (thank you, Frances, for helping me out with the menu selection!). My favourite item has to be the mushroom tarts - the flaky pastry with wild mushroom and brie filling. Delicious! IMO, prices are quite reasonable for the quality and amount of food. 

The drinks: try the ice tea and the Caesar (only if you like yours SPICY). 

The Service: can't praise enough the owner and the staff. The event was flawlessly organized and managed. I did not have worry about anything as they took care of all the little details that made the event so special. 

We booked the Physic Reader for the party. I did not get a reading myself, but our guests were quite impressed with her abilities. In any case, it was, yet again, a nice little touch that made this evening so memorable. 

We enjoyed this place very much and will likely become regulars..."}
{"text":"We had a great time sitting on the patio and enjoyed the delicious summerlicious menu.  The service was phenomenal from the hosts to the servers.  We came in a large group with kids and they were amazingly friendly and accommodating.   Tasty kids choices too!  The lamb is delicious, has a good kick.   Chocolate brownie is heavenly.  Homemade vanilla bean ice cream....bread pudding...all amazing choices!"}
{"text":"3 stars generally. 4 stars if I've ordered brisket that day. It is really excellent.

I've eaten and drank here a few times; the staff are generally courteous and friendly. Extra hats off to the server that we had who chimed in on our Olympic weightlifting conversation. I hope you enjoyed the Games, dude. The decor never blows me a way as I am not a huge fan of kitsch, but if that's your thing, then welcome to heaven. The patio is a great option in the summer, though if you've had the misfortune of sitting at a table on the patio that slopes towards the street, it's a little awkward.

I've been happy with the gluten-free options that are available, and the additions to the menu with the outdoor BBQ are safe bets. If you manage to arrive between 4PM-6PM, the appetizers are often 1/2 price. A great excuse to try a whole bunch of little snacks, including the spicy shrimp with the corn fritters. (Name escapes me.) Or 1/2 price oysters, which is a nice way to ease into the experience if it's new for you.

Ordering suggestions: again, the brisket. Jambalaya is also a great bet, even as a side dish. Any dish is made better with the garlic mashed potatoes, or the collard greens. I suspect that the chicken that they use is actually chicken \"cake\" (you know, that weird chicken mass that doesn't flake off like a normal chicken breast would, and seems like the stuff they put in Tim Horton's chicken salad sandwiches?) so I'm not going to order that again. Quibbles. The beef and fish are real.

This isn't a dining option that I would suggest to someone who is a vegetarian. If you are going to come to Southern Accent and you don't eat meat or fish, please don't bother eating. But what's a girl or guy to do? Come for the great bourbon instead. They have flights (four 1/2oz tasters) starting from $12, which makes it a great opportunity to try something new. I've heard great things about their cocktails, too.

A note about parking: If you park on Markham St south of Lennox before 6, you'll need a permit, and the traffic cops in the Annex are so f***ing fussy. Just be careful when you stash your ride. Not fun to come back from birthday dinner at 6:30PM to find a $30 ticket."}
{"text":"Southern Accent is a beautiful restaurant inside a beautiful old Victorian house, this was the first date my husband took me on the first time I came to Toronto to visit. The atmosphere is very eclectic and sort of fine dining. The patio is probably arguably the best patio in the city it's just gorgeous. I had the mango pork and it was delicious my husband had the beef brisket w/ seared collars greens. We still usually come back for every anniversary. Don't expect your regular pub fare, and expect it to be a bit pricey it is more of a fine dining sort of restaurant versus your standard annex pub. Very well worth it I would say :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for Valentine's day yesterday. I can definitely say this place is a must see. It has a very chill, house-party type of vibe. Very noisy and you're in close proximity to everyone. The service here was way to slow for my likings. But for my appetizer I decided to order the cornbread and my boyfriend decided to order the poutine. I was expecting my cornbread to be complimented with a side of syrup but that didn't happen because they gave me butter instead. The cornbread itself was nice. Just nice...nothing special. My boyfriend felt the same way about his poutine. I think it's safe to say they need to work on their appetizers. For dinner I decided to order the Bourbon chicken which was complimented with turnips in a honey BBQ glaze sauce and some mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the voodoo pasta. We LOVED our dishes!! The only negative I have about my dish is the sauce on the veggies had a touch of vinegar which was too strong and was starting to make me dizzy. My boyfriend also wished that his pasta dish was bigger. But I must say the food was great and I was not dissapointed! Check this place out people"}
{"text":"As a native Southerner and New Orleanian, I was disgusted and insulted by both the food and the manners of the waitstaff.

Toronto has never been good at doing \"authentic\". Mexican food here, for the most part, is a perfect example. Most diners in Toronto don't seem to know or care about authenticity, which allows places like this to exists. Another problem are the owners who attempt to do \"authentic\" seem to learn from books and not from experience.

This is the impression given by Southern Accent.

The gumbo was bland and watery. The only real spice that was evident was salt - and there was more than enough of that! I needed 3 glasses of water to clear the salty taste from my mouth. Not convinced that there gumbo is actually roux-based. I think they probably just make it as a soup (which is NOT gumbo).

Hush puppies were bland and gummy. The sauce served with them (never seen that ANYWHERE before) was overbearing. 

Cornbread was Yankee cornbread, almost like cake. Too much sugar (Southern cornbread is not sweet!!) and this was not made with buttermilk or soured milk. It didn't have the crisp outside that Southern cornbread should have (only achieved by cooking in cast iron). Dry and crumbly.

Jamabalya was a sticky mess. Rice was cooked into clumps and was almost gooey. Glutinous garbage. It was also very bland with no real flavour or spice. Menu called it \"highly-spiced\" - it was, as the gumbo, spiced with salt. The shrimp were tiny salad shrimp. The ham was some kind of cheap, formed ham and had no smoke flavour. The sausage was not andouille - it was some kind of smoked sausage but was not real andouille. I know it's hard to get (the stuff sold at St Lawrence Market as andouille is not real andouille) so don't try to fool people. Maybe they don't know any better, which judging by the menu, I'd believe. Jambalya was topped with soggy greens of some kind (which I requested be left off). Menu said collards but they were so overcooked, they could have been lawn clippings for all I know.  

Decor was like someone's stereotypical idea of New Orleans. Garish nightmare.

Service was ABYSMAL! Server didn't come to table for almost 20 mins after we were seated. Took over 30 mins between apps and main to arrive. We never did get the drinks we ordered and our waters were refilled once. When I told the server that I had requested the greens be left off the jambalaya, she said that I never made that request (even though everyone at our table heard the request) but she would take it back and have them re-make it. As we had waited so long, I decided to eat it anyway. I commented that it was weird to have jambalaya topped with greens she snappily said \"That's the way they eat it down there and nobody here ever complains.\" When someone at our table told her that I was a chef from New Orleans and knew what I was talking about, she looked at me and said \"If you hate it here so much, maybe you should just move back.\" REALLY?!? All of our food was cold. When we FINALLY got our server back to the table to let her know what was wrong, she said it was the kitchen's fault, not hers, and she walked off. Our requests to speak to a manager or owner were repeatedly refused. We even tried calling the restaurant over the next few days to speak with the owner or manager and our calls were never returned. Says all I need to know about their business.

I can say with all certainty that we will never be back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for years. Love it. Good patio, awesome food (consistent over the years as well) and a great selection of bourbons. The inside is very interesting with a decorative main floor and upstairs as well. The service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"I saw a very negative review of Southern Accent posted today so I thought I should share my own experience there which is pretty much the polar opposite of \"David B\". I am not from New Orleans or a chef as he says he is, so I cannot comment on how authentic the food is. However, I can comment on my experience at the restaurant having been twice so far (and planning to return.)

The first time I visited with three friends and we enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the upper floor. The whole place has a homely, kitschy decor which you probably either will love or hate. Personally I think it gives the place a fun character. I had the $25 prix fix menu (it now seems to be $27) with the alligator (!) appetizer, jambalaya, and pecan pie. The alligator wasn't particularly tasty but at least now I can say I've tried it. (Note that alligator is only offered at certain times of the year so check the menu on the website before you go if you're expecting to get it!) The jambalaya was excellent; again I don't know if it's \"authentic\" but I enjoyed it. The pecan pie was also excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful. He also had a \"radio voice,\" everyone at the table commented on it.

The second time I went with a large group of about a dozen people. We were seated on the lower floor, and we had a different server. He was obviously new (you could tell he was sometimes struggling to remember the specials and recall his memorized speech) but like our previous waiter he was attentive and friendly. This time I tried the beef brisket which was quite good, though I think the jambalaya was better. I got a Mill St Organic Lager which is a subtle and clean tasting beer to enjoy with the meal.

Overall I was quite pleased with my experience both times and so I bought a coupon on Dealicious to go back sometime in the spring/summer. Two thumbs up, good food, friendly service, and not too expensive (especially prix fix menu)."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times and always LOVE it. Best cornbread I've ever had...classic and exactly as it should be. Calamari has nice spices real breading (as opposed to your typical 'stock' pub calamari), and comes with a sweet n spicy (not too spicy) dipping sauce. 

Potato crusted fish in a smoked tomato sauce was perfect. Fish coating was crisp, the fish itself was light and flaky, and the sauce was packed with flavour. Have also eaten the lamb chops, which are some of the best lamb I've ever had. Blackened perfectly and the spice balanced out by a slightly sweet glaze. 

Dessert is incredible...bourbon bread pudding is best I've ever had. Sweet potato brownie has incredible texture, and topped with a caramel walnut crunch that mixes perfectly with it. 

Great drinks lineup too. Being a cajun restaurant, they have a quality bourbon selection (Bookers, Bakers, Eagle Rare, Ridgemont, etc). They also mix the bourbon nicely into cocktails, including a fantastic mint julep and tasty specialty coffees."}
{"text":"came here with some friends and was uber impressed! originally i was suppose to check this restaurant out for my birthday but my company got discouraged by the exterior and we went elsewhere. i wish i knew back then what i know now - that Southern Accent is phenomenal! First of all, the interior is kitschy but done the correct way. The whole place feels like gypsy takeover intertwined with a drunk mardi gras. There are LED Christmas lights everywhere, random things hanging from the ceiling, intimate booths that look more like fortune teller tents and a incredibly detailed bar containing a large variety of Bourbon. Needless to say, I loved it! 

The bartender that night seemed to have a lust for bartending and while he got annoying at some points, it was refreshing to see someone so passionate about their job. His sense of humor was cheeky and sarcastic which added to the larger then life atmosphere. I opted for a mojito and he whipped out one of the best I've ever had. My friends and I also decided to give the Bourbon tasting tray a shot and got an education on premium Bourbons while we waited for our food.

I had the brisket poutine which was by far the most amazing poutine I ever put into my mouth and clogged my arteries with. The brisket was tender, melt in your mouth while the fries were fresh cut. The whole meal was very filling and delicious. A girlfriend of mine had some garlic mashed potatoes, blackened steak ( i think? ) and greens. The mashed potatoes were AMAZING, i don't know what they put in there but they were so fresh and addictive i don't know how anyone could resist eating more. 

After we finished, we paid and ended up walking around the restaurant to see what the other floor offered. The second floor has separate party rooms which are all done up in true New Orleans style. It seems like each room has its own theme. There is also a giant dining hall for larger events. You'd be surprised how big the space actually is! The washrooms were fun and girly, mysteriously shrouded with layers of gauze and red lights. Talk about atmosphere! Any restaurant that goes all out not only in their food but also in their environment is one that I will be revisiting time and time again. In fact, my best friend will be hosting her large birthday party there.

LOVE IT! 
PS- I heard Mardi Gras week at southern accent is a total blown out party and experience that one must go to."}
{"text":"Funky and eclectic decor. Service was great. I had the fried green tomatoes and catfish...both very good. The fried green tomatoes is very HOT (temperature-wise)...so, don't stuff it in your mouth like I did. My boyfriend had the $25 \"pre-fixed\" menu, which is a very good deal. Avocado bruschetta was very good. However, chicken in the Baton Rouge Combo was 1/3 the size of a normal chicken breast. So, guy bewared! The Jambalaya and candied yams are delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here just for a drink, and ended up ordering a few appetizers because we just couldn't resist. I enjoyed the whiskey drink that was recommended, and the beer options were good too. We tried corn bread, pickled okra and the baked garlic. We will be back to try their prix fix menu. The jambalaya looked great. The service was friendly and the food came out promptly. Makes me want to go to New Orleans!"}
{"text":"This place is very funky I liked the decor it was nice and not overly crowded 
The server was amazing I give her 5 stars I wish I remembered her name. She was very helpful. 
The food was good. But I think I expected more. The blackened chicken was good but the mashed potatoes and green beans were kinda blah, I know they aren't meant to be exciting but they were boring. 
Calamari was yummy, wasn't a fan of the hush puppies and catfish fingers.  Chicken livers had a good smokey taste. 
I guess I would give the food between 3-4. 
I had the psychic reading cause I thought it was cool. But 40$ for not even 15mins wasn't worth it.   I don't expect her to know my life but when I have my wedding rings on hands on the table I thought she would pick up on that I was married. lol. But no. 
Anyways I would maybe go again but I think the menu needs to be more!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous meal tonight at this magical restaurant, and I only have great things to say about it.

Our starters ( oysters, cornbread, pickled okra and a salad with vinaigrette, grilled peaches and blueberries) were all crazy good. Our drinks, which were recommended to us and masterfully mixed by our waiter and mixologist Richard, were spot on. The mains we had (lamb, ribs, and fish special mahi Mahi) were all delicious, well seasoned, and perfect portion sizes. 

But that's not even the best part!  The place is located in an old house which has been remodeled and oozes with character. Private rooms, nooks and crannies, and eclectic touches abound. The service was warm, knowledgeable, professional and charming (thank you to Richard and Wendy who were both excellent).  And to top it all off--a very good Tarot card reader is in the house should you require some psychic guidance. 

Yeah, it's a little spendy. But worth it, as it goes beyond a standard meal out and provides a memorable event meal out. 

Will definitely return. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Waitress is enthusiastic, courteous and diligent. 

However, food needs improvement. Dessert for prix fix is mere icing sugar. 
Pasta for pris fix is below average; steak is too sweet. 

Come here for ambiance but not food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Friday night with my wife. Had the prix fixe menu $25 for 3 courses. My wife LOOOOOVED the avocado bruschette \"best I've ever had\" and I have to say the piqante lime sauce for the hush puppies is something else--they apparently sell it by the bottle.

Tried also the cajun calamari, kind of addictive, we finished it all off.

Dinner was blackened chicken (nice) with Bok Choy (wow amazingly done) and yams (ok).

Best part of the evening... homemade pecan pie. Make sure you order that. Make sure."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé de très nombreuses fois à ce restaurant lors de galas et événements reliés à un festival ou un autre. Le 'bourbon sour', mélange de jus de citron et de bourbon du Kentucky est excellent. 

La cuisine, moyennement relevée, est assez constante dans sa qualité. Les lieux mériteraient un petit ravalement de façade. La décoration y est kitsch et à la limite du bon goût. 

Certes ce restaurant se veut une adaptation locale d'un restaurant de la Nouvelle-Orléans, mais il sombre un peu facilement dans la caricature : est-il nécessaire d'avoir une voyante qui profite de la crédulité des clients?"}
{"text":"For many years, Southern Accent has been the place I go when my aching soul needs a good cajun & creole spanking.  

For the American expats, there is a popular annual Turducken Thanksgiving dinner event that is a must (early reservations are highly recommended, I missed it last year).  The perfect event to sample stuffed Chicken-Duck-Turkey and cajun & creole treats, talking about 2 good spankings in one visit. 

Last night, the Turducken was served with 3 unique stuffings, cornbread, andouille sausage & oyster.  Hands down, my favorite out of the three was andouille sausage.  It had a good kick and was most flavorful.

Turducken was moist and tender, and came with a rich yam gravy made with Bourbon and Grand Marnier, cranberry citrus compote.  I know, sounds fancy, right?  And don't even get me started on their famous garlic mashed potatoes.  

After devoured a generous serving of the main dish, I was doubtful that I could end the night on a sweet note.  My tummy was telling me, \"No.\"  But who am I kidding?  This fella never turns down a dessert!  A warm Maple Apple Pandowdy with homemade Vanilla Ice Cream sounded too good to pass up.  The sweetness from Vanilla Ice Cream complimented the tartness of Apple Pandowdy nicely.  Man, oh man, what a combo!

The service was flawless from start to finish.

Thanks Southern Accent for comforting my aching soul on a cold Thanksgiving night."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time because my colleague who took me said he discovered the place in 1987!  Pretty good longevity in this city and you can see why by the menu.

They have a fun cocktail menu with many Bourbon based drinks on hand, including a hand squeezed lemonade that was dangerously tasty.  The wine selection is not vast, but the wine is decent and is reasonably priced.

For starters we had the chicken livers and the Cajun shrimp with hush puppies.  I would have preferred bigger shrimp but the hush puppies were really good and made up for it! By the way.....this is not a place to come if you are dieting!  For my main I had the blackened lamb which came with vegetables and garlic mash.  The lamb was a reasonably thick cut and was also really good!"}
{"text":"Booked this restaurant for our Winterlicious dinner. The menu intrigued me, we had the meat gumbo soup, crab crostini, creole jambalaya, Fried catfish, pecan brownie and cake of the night which was something they added to the menu. The gumbo soup was not what we expected, it wasn't spicy but it was hearty. Thought it would be something like Campbell's Gumbo which I personally think is very good. The other app, Crab costing was good, cold dish. The mains were quite flavourful and size was not too bad. The pecan brownie was very moist but the cake was a tad hard and dry, desserts were that special. Lastly, we had alcohol drinks, The Cesar was not good at all, definitely made differently from other bars and restaurants. The bourbon Street drink was  also not that great, unless u really wanted to taste the liquor and lemon, it was not a good mix. Overall it was an experience and I love trying new restaurants but I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"After reading other favourable Yelp reviews, we picked Southern Accent as a new restaurant to try out for my boyfriend's birthday. Ever since we got back from our trip to New Orleans a year ago, we have held a lot of nostalgia for the city and it's delicious food. 

Let me preempt this review by saying: I have never been to or heard of another cajun/creole New Orleans-style restaurant in Toronto. I was so impressed when I heard about it, despite their unimpressive (outdated) website that I was going to try it no matter what the price was or what other Yelpers thought. You cannot hold this girl back from blackened chicken and a good cocktail.

We sat under a very \"Mardi Gras\" themed set up. There were other tables with little tents over them, like a fortune teller's shop. Oh - there are even psychics you can talk to while waiting for your meal! 

Our waiter was patient and went through the specials with us. He took extra time to answer our questions about each dish and emphasized that all of their ingredients (including cocktail ingredients) were fresh. If they can't find fresh ingredients they won't make the dish. He was very personable and friendly and made lots of recommendations when asked. 

We ordered the blackened chicken with bok choi and jambalaya, beef brisket with garlic mash and collard greens and the tiger shrimp to start. 
Everything tasted incredibly flavourful and fresh - better than most of the food we had in New Orleans, actually! I have never had juicier blackened chicken (I find that most places tend to overcook it) and both the bok choi and collard greens were so rich in flavour I thought there was no way they were real vegetables. 

For drinks, we tried a Hurricane (how can you not?!) and a Bourbon sour. The drinks tasted fresh and well-made. All in all, a great birthday dinner and an even better find! 

They even have a great hot sauce selection which I found most restaurant in New Orleans to be lacking (surprising, right?). A few things I would have liked to see on the menu: shrimp and grits and po boys!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food quite a bit, but wasn't crazy about the environment (a little crowded, actually kind of run down - the kind of place where they hang a wall hanging over a crack or water damage rather than just fixing it) and the service was so-so, friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, patio is enjoyable in the summer.  Will come back every time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Southern Accents will not be my last! We dropped in without a reservation at around 5pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. The server was knowledgable and gave us some excellent recommendations. 

Our visit was during the maple festival, so we selected the prix-fixe menu, which came with an appetizer, a main, and a dessert. I started with the gumbo, which was excellent, and my friend had the crostini, also very nice. The crostini weren't too hard, and had gruyere cheese, cranberries, walnuts and prosciutto. I selected the ribs as my main, which came with grits and collard greens. The ribs were in a maple sauce, which was sweet but had a bit of bite, and the meat just fell right off the bone. I'd never had grits before, but I liked them, and the same went for the collard greens. They were almost like a palate cleanser! My friend had the trio, which allowed him to try the lamb, the blackened chicken, and the jambalaya. All three were delicious, but the blackened chicken could have had a bit more spice and was a little bit dry. For dessert, we got the gluten free praline sweet potato brownie, which was superb, and the pecan pie, which was delicious.  All the desserts are made in-house and it shows. They even sell a cookbook with the recipe for the brownies! 

The restaurant wasn't too loud, which was great for conversation. 

All in all, an excellent experience, and I look forward to going back in the summer and trying the bourbon sour, a house specialty for 31 years, which I passed on as I was driving today."}
{"text":"Was so glad my friends and I decided to come here. The night before we had been to Gusto which in my opinion was both too cool for school and pricey-er than I felt was necessary. I paid the same here, ($42 including tip) and got much better food and enjoyment for the effort. 
Waiter was lovely and very informed about the menu, we all ordered off the pre fix  (Monday to Thursday available) and everything was good and the food felt well cared for. My friends and I are all 'immigrants' in Toronto coming from different backgrounds where the foods have strong flavours - Jamaica, Trinidad, Egypt, the Philippines - and so the food was spicy but that went down well with all of us. Hush puppies were delicious and reminded me of my Caribbean home, and I really enjoyed my vegetarian entree. Added bonus, there are quite a few veggie options! Woop woop, (especially in this new food landscape land of bacon popcorn and prosciutto-tinged everything). For dessert the bread pudding was delicious though the sweet potato brownie was actually much more sugary than the waiter had suggested. 
Drank the local beers (the hoppy one is REALLY hoppy) and I heard that the cocktails were good too. Decor was kitsch and warm and the experience was just what I would have hoped for. Sweet!"}
{"text":"We went there during Summerlicious 15, and had 3-course $25 prix-fixe menus. For appetizers, we had the gumbo and the pasta salad. For mains, we had the jambalaya and the fish (which I guess is beer-battered white fish with home fries), and for dessert we had the peach cobbler and the bread pudding. We also had a stormy and a elderflower spritz for cocktails. It was all very delicious, very tasty and the quantities were very good. Since it was a 3-course menu, we ended up being quite full actually.

The service was very pleasant and useful, all the people we interacted with were smiling and seemed happy to be working there. Finally, the atmosphere of the restaurant was really amazing. It is actually huge, occupies an entire victorian house. As a consequence, it is a collection little rooms, all decorated in a different way, but all reminiscent of the Big Easy (the one you see in the movies at least). We went during the dummer and sat outside (which was great too), but did a little tour of the entire place on our way out, and can't wait to come back in the winter to enjoy the cozy inside!"}
{"text":"I had THE WORST meal I've had in ages on Friday night. I typed in romantic restaurant ideas and landed on a place called Southern Accents - a Cajun- inspired bistro. It sounded charming. It ended up being anything but. We started with an appetizer - they're picante shrimp. $9 for two shrimp cut in half! In half! Unreal. Then came the main. Jambalya. It's a Cajun restaurant, should be good, right? Wrong. Ketchup with Uncle Ben's rice is being generous. Absolutely terrible. Desert? Surprise, surprise. Awful. I tried to send my food back, but the waitress - clearly knowing how bad the food was - took off before I had the chance. $120 later we left. And have nothing but a bad taste and a wasted night to show for it. Do not go here under any circumstances. Unless, of course, you're interested in a horrible meal, penny pinching entrees and staff that runs away before you can say your piece."}
{"text":"Sad attempts at the genuine article. Jambalaya was good as heat and serve microwave food. I got a rule; if you are gonna charge me good money for a meal, it has to be at least as good as what I can make myself. Blackened snapper was tasty, but portioned as if it was an appetizer.
The places food costs must be minimal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner Saturday night. Great atmosphere. We ordered hush puppies for app it was delicious. We ordered bayou chicken and New York blackened steak. Both mediocre. 
Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the vibe of this restaurant! It reminds me of a New Orleans French Opera House! They even have an in-house psychic. There is seating on the patio which is always packed and there are also party rooms and seats inside. I really like how the inside seating looks like a psychic's tent - it's very cozy (not to mention perfect for date night). 

On weekdays they have  1/2 price apps from 4 - 6:30PM. I would highly recommend the calamari! It's a very generous portion for an app which is great for sharing (or you can order 2 and not share ;D). They also bottle their own hot sauces which had some good heat (but not burning heat) which went very well with the calamari.

We ordered the gumbo, steak (rare), jambalaya, calamari and picked okra from the tapas menu. The calamari and jambalaya were definitely the highlight of the meal though there was a piece of hair in our calamari. It took a while for us to flag down a waiter to tell them because it was so busy but when we were able to get their attention, they were very apologetic and quick to replace our dish. 

As for the steak, well, I'm from Alberta so nothing can ever be as delicious as our good ole AAA Alberta steaks fresh off the bbq! But this one was alright. One thing I did like about it is the fact that when we ordered it rare, it actually came rare and not medium rare.

Overall it was a very pleasant experience (besides the hair) and I would really recommend the calamari. So delicious!"}
{"text":"just addict food
I have been only few time and I am telling you the flavour is very addictive 
very delcious
amazing owner and always great staff"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 restaurants in the city. I discovered it while living in the annex a few years ago. I was walking by their front patio and they were selling their delicious Jambalaya for $5. I was blown away away when I went inside and loved the intimate booths they had. I hosted my Birthday dinner there last year with 12 of my close friends and they all loved it. They have Jalapeno infused vodka which is great in a Caesar or on it's own as a shot, if you like spice like me. They have a New Orleans atmosphere which is very colourful and creates a nice ambiance. Highly recommend you go!"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for a long weekend and stopped by this place! We loved our meals the first night and stopped by the next night for the beignets. We were told that they were sold out of beignets but Chef Dave and server Hailey hooked us up! They scraped the bowls for us and gave us a nice spread on the house. Great food and great conversation with Hailey. Our server the night before (can't remember his name) was awesome too. Would definitely come back! Thanks to the staff for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few restaurants in different cities during my travels and this has to be one of the best in terms of food and service. I found the hospitality was definitely cordial and friendly, the service to be impeccable and reliable, and the food to absolutely incredible. 

My friends and I shared those delicious must-have hush puppies as an appetizer, they are sensational and the sauce they come with simply adds to their allure. I ordered the bourbon chicken and it did not disappoint, it was not overly spicy and the accompanying mashed potatoes tasted delicious too. 

For dessert, I ordered the creme brûlée, it was the first one I've had in years since my trip down under and it was sensational, the size was perfect and I left the restaurant not feeling stuffed or sick but rather, incredibly satisfied and wanting the opportunity to go back again. 

I will make an effort to go to this restaurant next time I'm in Toronto. Simply incredible."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on about 3 occasions, which the experience has been consistent. The service staff are very nice and they try hard. I had no problems dealing with them, and although they weren't very knowledgeable, did their best to serve us and that counts for something in my book.

Food here is average on a good night. The menu tries to use Louisiana-style cuisine and drinks, but unfortunately comes up far short on effort. There isn't anything special to the dishes and there is nothing particularly special about them. 

The drinks menu gets worse. This place has not only Toronto's worst sangria, but probably the world's worst. It was really, really bad. No fruit in it. Just red wine and something else that resembled either gasoline, or water from Lake Ontario. It was like it was created by a 14 year old who was only concerned with getting sloshed. I supposed after a jug that swill, you probably would stop caring what it tasted like. Either way, we sent it back and they allowed us to, with it not showing on the bill. 

They do make an effort with vegan and gluten free options. I will commend them there. Unfortunately they aren't just any good. 

What I do like about this place is the vibe and the bohemian atmosphere. Mirvish Village (and many of the neighbourhoods on Bloor moving westward) is one of those places in Toronto that still has an old vibe that can make you nostalgic. SA sometimes has live music and fortune tellers, which is kind cool entertainment. 

In the end, 2 of the 3 stars are pure environment and ambiance. It's a cool place to be on the weekend and my wife still enjoy going there. It's too bad they don't take the time to fashion good food or drink to match the feeling of the area."}
{"text":"This place is more about the atmosphere than the food. It was a Friday night and no waiting, I can understand why. I had the French Quarter Lamb, having been to New Orleans, I was very disappointed.  The food needs a lot of work.  It's the type of place you go once,  enjoy for the décor and you don't go back.  If you never make it here, you haven't missed anything.  My lamb didn't look anything like in the picture below. I guess that makes this place inconsistent!"}
{"text":"I have recently become a regular at Southern Accent. It all started with me coordinating a post- screening party for a film that my company produced. I searched for a few locations and I settled on Southern Accent. The manager there was fabulous. she worked with me and closed the entire restaurant so we could fully utilize the floor space. The servers walked around with bottles of wine so guests could get a top up and not have to go to the bar. 

The food was amazing and everything felt very well treated.

Afterwards they sent me a fabulous Gift Certificate and so I took some of my coworkers and we filled up on delicious Calamari and Sangria.

I went there again on Friday and had the Prix Fixe dinner menu. Everything was spectacular and the server was again, remarkable. I will continue to go to this venue because of the decor, the servers and the food."}
{"text":"Great spot! I went on the weekend and there was a violin and this other instrument I don't know what it's called... made of metal. It was so good! The atmosphere and the drinks were great too."}
{"text":"Love the layout of the restaurant - really cool separate rooms for private parties ! They also have little tucked away corner table some with curtains which is great for a date! Service is always wonderful but the food could be better. I am spoiled though because I have had real Cajun and Creole food in Nawlins. I'll still go back there though!"}
{"text":"So this is the story: My friends and I always eat at Chiptole or Osmows or just very random restaurants by the University of Toronto. I really wanted to get them out of their three block radius and go somewhere different and exciting. I really enjoy Creole food, or any kind of cuisine that screams Louisiana. I tried out Nawlins during Winterlicious 2016 and this Summerlicious, I really wanted MORE Cajun.  I scoured through the menus and found, in my opinion, the best one: Southern Accent. Their Summerlicious menu looked really promising and as a super eater of blackened fish, I wanted their blackened fish. They also had gumbo and jambalaya and I thought my friends would enjoy this kind of food.  

Little did I know that Southern Accent is extremely intimate. When we walked in, I think we all paused a little bit because of how romantic Southern Accent was. There was live music playing and the whole restaurant was dim with fairy lights snaking all around the restaurant. This restaurant is quite small and cozy and we were all bumping into each other with our backpacks. When we were sitting down, our belongings were just clanking and crashing into each other. It was all kind of embarrassing but very funny at the same time. 

Note: This place would be great for a date.

Anyways, with that aside, we all had a really good time. The restaurant was PACKED and I like my restaurants packed. Our food, though, was just not the best.  

For appetizers, the three of us got the gumbo and one of us got the Chilled Summer Tomato Beet soup, which is apparently vegan although it doesn't say so on the Summerlicious menu. Gumbo was good, but very salty in my opinion. I don't know what everyone else thought, but my friend liked his soup. Overall, appetizers was more or less successful. 

For entrees, we all got different things: blackened fish, ribs, jambalaya, dirty rice with tofu (vegetarian). My fish was alright, it wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be. The skin wasn't really crispy as what blackened would suggest. The rice was good though. My friend said his jambalaya was tasty, though his stomach is a black hole and didn't get full. My BF's dirty rice with tofu was super bland. It really lacked any flavor at all and this was a major disappointment to me and him. Maybe they could have seasoned his dish with the same fervor they seasoned my gumbo. But my other friend loved his ribs. So overall? Meh. I can't believe the vegetarian rice was so bland. Creole food is all about big and bold flavors and spices everywhere. 

The dessert was alright. Three of us got the brownie and one of the got the root beer float. I think I was just disappointed with the dirty rice to really enjoy the ice cream. 

Overall, I was super disappointed with the incredibly bland dirty rice. But, if you're looking to just go for a cozy and intimate dinner, then Southern Accent is probably for you. 

TLDR: Bring your date here. Just for the ambiance though, not the food."}
{"text":"I visited Southern Accent back when it was on Markham st. for a work dinner. It was the first time I had been there but the others at the office are big fans of this restaurant and I can certainly see why. All in all the food is amazing and it has a very homey feel to it.

For the table we ordered hush puppies and calamari and they were great. I ordered the catfish which was fried to a perfect crispy outside without being dry inside. It came with collard greens (which I had never had before) and mashed potatoes, both well executed. For dessert I had the bourbon bread pudding and it certainly was not lacking any of the bourbon flavour, very delicious! 

Of our entire party of about 12, I didn't hear a single complaint, everyone was very pleased. This place is definitely better than other southern style restaurants I've been to in the city, 100% would recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"I've only been once (as part of Summerlicious) and I'm a serious fan! Given how other Summerlious experiences have sometimes left me wanting more, this was a pleasant surprise. 

First off, our server (Wendy) was delightful, helpful and funny. She took the time to explain a few food items and lovingly described the soup of the day (a watermelon gazpacho) and the southern inspired signature cocktails.

Each course was delicious! My date and I both had the watermelon gazpacho as our starter but I heard the table next to us going nuts about their alligator, so that sounds good. For the main course the blackened tofu was tasty (but I think next step I'll go with the French Market Vegetarian) and my date's BBQ trio was tasty (or so she says). I usually HATE bread pudding but my date's bread pudding was AMAZING and my pecan pie was super tasty. 

In response to a previous comment about the BBQ Trio being not very spiced - it was explained to us by our phenomenal server, that the Summerlicious menu focuses on the less spicy items to be a little more palatable to the not-very-adventurous diner. It sounds like that piece of information would have been welcome for everyone. 

A couple other tidbits:
- Several stellar vegetarian options and at least one vegan item that I spotted. No boring pasta primavera at this place! 
- Apparently they are going to be doing prix fix every night AND they plan to always have a vegetarian option and I've been told the chef likes to get especially creative with vegetarian options, always having at least one or two that contain proteins like tofu or tempeh (in addition to other options).
- Cocktails were amazing. I highly recommend the Gator Bait for sweet treat! 

Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I recently went there with a friend and to start with the ambience takes you into a different space, the hanging glitter fringes, low light, painting and special private booths. The staff is great and very cheerful. We tried crispy calamari('best in town' says on the menu and honestly it is great), garlic and peta (dont remember the name), Jambalaya. The overall food is on point although they can work on their portions. Their cocktails are awsome I tired Gator bait and it was great. This place is perfect for families and date spots. Definately calls for a second 3rd round."}
{"text":"First time going there, and it was surprisingly good. The resto is dark (hard to take pic) with New Orléans deco as a reference. Food was really good. Our waiter kept forgetting to bring the items we ordered even if he wrote them on his paper pad; we had to remind him a few times. 
Aside from that, the food was ok. The calamari, hush puppies, gumbo and salad were good. The fish was too pasty. Didn't like it."}
{"text":"Passed by this gem randomly and was drawn in by the comfy / eclectic lighting they have set up. Upon entering you get a real cozy vibe going, and can even get a psychic reading (?) which adds to their awesome mystique. This place really piqued our interest.

Came here for drinks and the bartender was a gentleman and great conversationalist. Entertaining, charming, knowledgeable. He recommended us the bourbon sour and caesars which were appropriately robust in flavour and really kicked off the night for our group. As a certified alcoholic, the accurate recommendations he gave us and made us gets the hairs on my neck dancing.

Followed up with their calamari which was amazing, and had a go at their catfish which was also really good. 

The conversation with the staff was a huge highlight here. 

We came for drinks and a social time, which was perfect to keep it casual - it's a smaller place that oozes charm, history and an appropriate touch of mardi gras glam. Would definitely come again with friends to hang out and talk.

Definitely recommended for a casual night for drinks. Will come back to try their food more earnestly. Solid place."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Probably not.

If you can nab a groupon, you get incredible value here. We paid $49 (+tax and tip) for four people for a three-course meal. 

Cost aside, the food is somewhere between \"okay\" and \"good\". The desserts were definitely their strongest suits, but they were also very ordinary desserts, so it doesn't say much about the quality of the restaurant's specialty cuisine.

YUM:
- Bread pudding: great! Can anyone really mess up bread pudding?
- Butter tart: delicious, but again, butter tarts are always delicious and this could have been store-bought for all I know. 

MEH / OK:
- Catfish filet: decent
- Blackened chicken: decent
- Jambalaya: a mountain of simple, singular, unexciting flavour
- Polenta stacks: probably the most flavourful dish we ordered, primarily due to the cheese, but still only marginally better than the other dishes

SKIP IT:
- Salad: soggy and salty
- Hushpuppies: reaaaaally dough-y, floury, and dry. I'd skip this no matter how much the servers try to hype it up

There wasn't a single dish that was bad, but there wasn't a single non-dessert dish that was delicious either. So if you're trying to decide whether or not to come here, it's a question of whether you want to be full or whether you want to be wowed. If you want to be full, this place is perfectly fine."}
{"text":"The best Cajun food in Toronto. Everything is tasty and good. And above that the service is always good and friendly. Definitely recommed it."}
{"text":"A nice place for some authentic Creole/cajun style cuisine. The resturant is decorated in cute Mardi Gras type decorations. Having gone for Winterlicious, I also ordered the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari were individually quite small and not as crispy as I had hoped, However, they were seasoned well and came with a nice and flavorful sauce. The oysters came with a nice spinach and cheese topping, however, the oyster itself was quite small and was buried under the toppings. The gumbo, while a small portion, was very flavourful with its abundance of spices, ham, and okra. For the entrees, I would have to note that the lamb was very well seasoned with different cajun flavours, accompanied with a wonderful mint glaze. The desserts are homemade and are wonderful, from the vanilla bean ice cream to the sweet potato brownies, to the pecan pie! Good choice for excellent cajun food :)"}
{"text":"This place was good, but it didn't particularly blow me away. My expectations may have been a tad high, though, after reading the reviews.

The atmosphere and the service were both absolutely fantastic. We got a private room for our party, and the food and drinks came out pretty quickly.

The hurricanes were sweet and delicious, but I don't think they were 2 oz. We're all drinkers in this party, and everyone admitted to feeling a little tipsier than anticipated. They would be good to share, as they were HUGE.

The food itself was pretty good, but again, didn't blow me away. The menu was small, which is always a good sign, and everyone seemed pretty happy with what they had. The jambalaya was a little spicier than anticipated and the catfish was pretty good.

I would recommend this place for a fun night out with friends, but probably won't be back myself again."}
{"text":"Came during Winterlicious 2017 for dinner. Reservations were made, and the person at the door promptly seated me with the rest of the group.

They have an open kitchen facing the street, so if you're passing by you can see great food being prepared. They offer vegan and vegetarian options for those that have dietary concerns, so that's a plus. 

The lighting is dim, there are christmas lights hung everywhere, candles and lamps on the tables. Lots of interesting decor and ornaments placed all over the room.

In terms of service, everything is very procedural. Our waiter started by taking orders for drinks. 
10 minutes later, he came to take orders for apps and entrees. Another 10 minutes later, the apps were served up for everyone at the same time. The dishes are taken away only when everyone is finished.

After 20 minutes, the entrees came out. However, one of the guests at our table had to wait another 15 minutes before their dish came out (it was from a vegan dish from a separate menu, so that may have been a factor). As a result, we ended up waiting a much longer time before we were able to put in orders for desserts because every person had to finish their dishes before they would proceed to the next course.

Because dessert orders are taken at the end, we had to wait another 10 minutes before the desserts arrived. And when the desserts arrived, some people got spoons and some people got forks for the same dish, which is a bit weird. Did they just run out of utensils?

In terms of food, it was great. I ordered the Gumbo, the Bayou Chicken, and the Bread Pudding. Everything had a lot of flavour, and the portions weren't too bad. The chicken entree came with two large pieces of boneless thighs, and the meat was quite tender. The skin was moist because there was a lot of sauce poured on top; wonder how it would've tasted if it was crispier instead.

In total, we spent close to 3 hours at the restaurant, which is a bit too much. The restaurant was not that busy, and they had 3 waiters going around. There's definitely a lot of downtime, and if anything happens that causes delays (people showing up fashionably late, ordering items that end up taking twice as long to make, etc), you're going to be waiting much longer. However, if everything is completed in a timely manner, then it would probably be a much better experience. It may better to come in smaller groups."}
{"text":"The is an interesting fact in Toronto when it comes to dinning out. Almost no restaurant in this city is truly and fully authentic. Yes, of course, they are exceptions, like Guu and some of the awesome Chinese restaurants up north of the city run by Hong Kong chefs. Almost everything else is either an outright insult or a very close simile, generally \"Canadianised\" for the local's taste buds. Mexican food is a perfect example of this. 

The reason why this is the case is simple. Our geographical location, the limitation of the ingredients required, the already mentioned catering to locals and sometimes just keeping the ingredients in stock is a problem. Hence it is hard as heck to get a decent Mojito in Toronto as almost no one carries the fresh mint needed. 

So, that bring me to Southern Accent, a place a once used to recommend for it's retro 20's decor and patio. Or, I would say to you: 

- \"You have a hot date you want to impress?\"
- 'Aha.'
- \"Then take her to Southern Accent. Get there ahead of time, give them a rose to have delivered to your table with the wine/dessert. They are cool that way and just make sure you book \"The Snug.\" That's the table near the entrance which you can close with a velvet curtain for extra privacy. She will love it!\" 
- 'Cool! How is the food.'
- 'Alright.'

Now here is the thing, I thought the food was alright. Nothing especial, Jambalaya was decent if a bit pricey but a truly nice decor. As a side note there used to be an authentic place called Jambalaya just north of College on Yonge that did an awesome Jambalaya. Sadly it went out of business. 

Then a while ago I talked to some who actually have been up and down in Cajun country and also to Southern Accent. 

They called it a shameless travesty, a place that had no right to have the word 'Cajun' written anywhere on its premises. And that if you want real Cajun food then to try anywhere else but avoid Southern Accent and that the only reason they were in business and could get away with it was because most Canadians did not know any better. They are bland and on the tasteless. 
I was like, 'Oh?'

Then I asked where there was an authentic Cajun place in Toronto. 
Her answer was \"Good Cajun? No such thing.\"
However they did recommend \"Lucy's Seafood\" but they are in the suburbs.

I still recommend Southern Accent for the decor and the feel of the place, just not the food. Oh, one last thing, they use to have a Fortune Reader next to them as part of the optional entertainment."}
{"text":"OHHHH LAWWWWD, this place was excellent.  The food was just amazing and so were the drinks.  Our server was extremely knowledgable about both food and drink.  

We had:

Cajun Poutine with blackened chicken and briskett
Cornbread
Voodoo Pasta
Jambalaya
Bread Puddin'
Pecan Pie

It was soooo good I cannot wait to go back.  The food was hot, but not burn your face off hot.  The interior is very unique and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I got put in this little mini-room type structure with a curtain.  Bourbon tasting was extremely cool and the mint juleps were yum but all drinks are strong so beware if you don't like beverages where you can really taste the booze.

Delish creole and cajun.  If any of you go, take me with you!"}
{"text":"I went with a voucher because otherwise there ain't no way I could afford this place. 

The atmosphere is amazing!! The place is huge, too. 
I honestly was excited just to be in such a cool place, and that was on a Wednesday night. 
The decor is just amazing, colourful, in your face...all over the place. The music selection is wonderful, bringing you into the dirty south...

The food was delicious but I gotta say this place is NOT CHEAP. 
We didn't get any drinks, shared the cheapest dessert and appetizer, had a soup and 2 of the cheapest Mains and it came to $64 before tip. 

I'm really glad I got to go and if you have the money to splurge it's certainly worth going to check it out. 
I imagine on the weekend it must be much more lively and chaotic."}
{"text":"My culinary friend recommended this place to me. We tried to make reservations for dinner around 6, taking the advice of many fellow yelpers, but couldn't get through on the phone. I called a few times, straight to voice mail, with a short welcome message & I couldn't leave a message either. I even tried to make online reservations but the earliest time slot was 8:30pm - a little too late for us. We decided to take take the risk of long lineups & go anyway. There were no lineups & the hostess asked if we had reservations & she seemed a little frustrated when we said no. We explained the issue we had trying to book & she quizzically looked at the phone. Nonetheless, she was still nice, found a table for us but said we had a 1.5 to dine (I don't like being given a time stamp when dining out & we never take long to dine anyway). It was busy, so I understand the need to book a table. 

The entrance to this place is unique & decor makes you feel like you are in the south. The lighting is low but elegant & romantic. The walls are colourful, decorated with a few paintings. Our table was for 2 & draped on 1 side with a heavy curtain, similar to the entrance. The tables are set with small lamps & candles.

We order the shrimp & grits to start with a Bourbon sour. For the mains, we order blackened chicken & the small jambalaya. It was my 1st time trying Cajun/creole/southern food. It was delicious, definition of 'stick to you gut'. The blackened chicken was super tender, probably the most tender chicken I've had in restaurants & flavoured with spices perfectly. The shrimp & grits was super creamy & on the cold winter day we went, it was a great pairing - the shrimp tasted like bagged frozen shrimp.

Our waiter was alright, he seemed a little impatient & could have been more approachable. The hostess was better.
I can't wait to try the menu in the spring/summer! If you like southern food & can't go south anytime soon, it's worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a fun night out. The service has always been attentive, as well.

The food is great, though it has changed over the years, but still good.

I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a fun date night with some good drinks and great sharing platters."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite restaurants, anywhere. We had our first date here, 18 years ago. Very little has changed, which is a good thing. We had the $25 prix fixe menu. Started with some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. The entree was voodoo pasta with chicken and sausage. The sauce was outstanding - spicy/creamy/yum! Finished with awesome pecan pie.

Our problem is that we should be trying more different restaurants, but we want to keep coming back. Highly recommended if you enjoy cajun/creole, or flavourful food generally."}
{"text":"Scrumptious food and a fun atmosphere made for a great Saturday afternoon/evening dining experience. 
Came here on Cinco de mayo for a Kentucky derby themed event. I was with my boyfriend and we decided to sit at the bar and share a few apps - the oysters, hush puppies, blackened chicken liver, shrimp piquant and cornbread. All were so delicious but the blackened chicken liver was a nice surprise, bursting with spicy flavour and so moist. I would definitely recommend trying it out! You may develop a new love for liver! The shrimp were a good size and everything else was so delicious. Having had a lot of southern creole cuisine, I would say this place does it justice! Highly recommend. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a bday party with a big party of 25 ppl.  This place is pretty massive.  It is set in an old style house with a TON of decorations and artwork.  Im not an artsy person myself but I could tell that a lot of effort was put into placement of the decorations to help with the entire New Orleans theme which I appreciated.  We sat upstairs in our own private room where we were served by Luke and Lance who were experienced and wonderful servers.  They were attentive, quick, and had great personalities that catered to our every need.

I ordered the Belvedere Martini and it was so delicious I had to order two of them...well maybe 3 or 4 I think... I lost count after I kept drinking them but they were delicious!  Haha!  My food complimented my drink nicely...I ordered the New York Steak with Shrimp, Veggies, and Mashed Potatoes and it came out to perfection.  Everything had a touch of spice and a kick of flavor to it which made it taste super good!  Overall I enjoyed my time here and appreciated the fact that this place was not just another chain restaurant....you can tell the owners want their customers to be truly satisfied when you come here."}
{"text":"Great food I have been here quite a bit and have tried almost everything on their menu. I do wish they had a wider selection of menu choices...maybe some etouffe and more seafood? Other than that amazing food and great ambiance. Servers very attentive and friendly. New location is way smaller so harder to get seats if you do not make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"We came here for summerlicious and had an amazing time. The space is warm and cozy, and the servers really reinforce that NOLA vibe. Great service and experience.

We got a few items from the prix fixe menu, as well as some from the regular menu. I remember everything was delicious, but the blackened chicken stands out in particular. Be sure to get that, you won't regret it. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars

My Summerlicious binge comes to a full stop at Southern Accent.  Came here with Hedgehog as we both wanted to experience the novelty otherwise known as alligator.  We booked a table on the patio and arrived promptly for our reservation.  The décor is quite interesting and colourful with reminders of Mardi Gras looming not too far overhead.  

The type of cuisine served is Cajun Créole.  Cajun is the cuisine of the French Acadians who were deported by the British from Canada to Louisiana. The 3 staple ingredients, otherwise known as the holy trinity in Cajun cooking are: bell pepper, onion, and celery.  Cajun and Créole cuisine are quite similar and the two terms are generally used interchangeably.  The major difference is that Créole Cuisine gathers its influence from continental Europe adapted for the local ingredients of Louisiana.  Cajun cuisine is also seen as the \"poor man's cuisine\" as it was born of many French provincial cuisines from the peasants while Créole cuisine was born from aristocrats.

I must say that their cocktails here are pretty boring.  We ordered the French which was made with: Chambord, Vanilla Vodka and Pineapple Juice.  A Lychee Love Boat consisting of: Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Lychee Juice and Lime was also ordered.  These were basically martinis, but I felt they weren't very good.  Amateur bartender?  We were brought a bread basket with hummus while waiting for our appies to arrive.  It was a nice departure from eating empty calories and fat from the usual vat of butter that shows up at most restaurant tables.

For starters, we ordered the Kick ass ALIGATOR which is served in a piquante sauce with hush puppies.  Hush puppies are a corn bread fritter.  The alligator was tender, which totally blew away my misconception that this rough-looking reptile would be a tough monster to bite into.  I absolutely adored the piquante sauce, as I could use the excess to dip my hush puppies into.  The hush puppies themselves were quite savoury, not overly oily though I did find it to be a bit on the dry side.  The Cucumber Gazpacho was rather disappointing.  Although it was refreshing, as a gazpacho is intended to be, there was no real flavour to the soup.  It tasted like sour cream and cucumber whipped up in a blender.  I found it to be rather bland and lacking in flavour.

For mains I ordered the Lafayette Shrimp Étouffée which was served on a bed of cumin-scented rice and a spiced seafood reduction sauce and a side of grilled asparagus.  I didn't like the way the rice was cooked as there were hard chunks that clustered together.  It was interesting how they molded the rice like a Hershey's Kiss though.  The shrimp were of a good size - at least they're not skimping me on the protein!  I couldn't really taste the cumin in the rice, and I felt the seafood reduction lacked in any real seafood flavour.  All I could taste was the texture of a plain roux.It seems William T. is gaining points for menu selection tonight as his Canal Street Creole Jambalaya was utterly amazing!  It was rich in flavour and came with a plethora of proteins including chicken, smoked ham and andouille sausage.  It was served with rice that was infused with a flavourful tomato sauce, topped with collard greens and garlic grilled tiger shrimp.  The collard greens tasted amazing.  Almost like eating really tasty collard chips, though they were not quite as crispy as a chip but had a nice chip-like texture to them.  F or those of you who have never experienced this dish and want a point of reference a Jambalaya is similar to the Spanish Paella.

My meal doesn't ever end without a dessert finale!  I finally regained my foodie instincts and compensated for my erroneous appetizer and entrée selections with Pecan Pie.  The rumours are true, Southern Accent serves up a mean pecan pie.  It is served with a side of whipped cream.  The crust is heavenly, and not at all oily like most pecan pies you find in the stores.  There was a generous amount of pecans (which is great, as you are not left with mouthfuls of corn syrup and no pecans).  I like my pecan pie with less corn syrup as the corn syrup really is just there as a binder.  Yummy!

The N'awlins Bread Pudding was nothing to sneeze at either.  It was made of apples, pecans and raisins and topped with a flavourful bourbon sauce.  It was not as sweet as the pecan pie, which I liked and was a very moist bread pudding.  I am not usually a fan of bread pudding, but this one is a keeper.

Verdict:
The portion sizes at Southern Accent are quite filling.  I think of a typical Southern mother feeding her children, while keeping in mind that she doesn't want to fatten them up like Hansel & Gretel - the portion sizes were just right - enough to satisfy you, but not leave you feeling 10 lbs. heavier.  The service was not good - the servers were amateur at best. Would come back if I were in the area just for the Jambalaya and Pecan Pie!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that the food here is fantastic.  The Bayou Chicken is perfect, but I also really recommend the jambalaya and po'boys.  The diversity on the menu really sets them apart from the other restaurants banking on the Louisiana cajun/creole food trend.  

Some staff can be a bit disorganized, both dine in and with take out.  It has been hit or miss with service.  You get that everywhere, though.  I'm not wild about the dining room, because it has a bit of a church hall vibe, but the recent mardi gras decorations seem to have helped the ambiance a bit."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this restuarant for a while, maybe it was all the hype, but I wasn't as pleased as I thought I would be. 

I really like the character of place. When we went, it was decorated for Mardi Gras, but I'm sure it has a festive feel no matter what day. It's in a small house in Mirvish Village, and small little nooks of places and room where you can sit and have an intimate meal. 

The food itself is Southern obviously, but I was looking for something more. It was okay, nothing spectactcular, and it didn't end up in my list of 'must go again'. 

I also pre-booked the psychic. I'm always skeptical of these things, and when I have a chance, I'll try my luck.  Of course it's a show and she says what you want to here. It's a nice entertainment addition to place, but it's $20 for a reading. They don't advertise this, just be careful knowing that's how much you're willing to pay.

I'm only rating this a 3 because I did like the atmosphere. I would have rated the food only a 2. I've had better."}
{"text":"This is the second birthday dinner I've had here and this year was even better than the last. While all of the food wasn't strictly authentic, it was damned tasty. It could have been hotter, but most people I know that have grown up around here can't stomach spice, so you can't fault a Restaurant for catering to the tastes of the masses instead of being completely on par and scaring away the locals. I was dipping hummus smeared bread in duck gumbo. Authentic? Not really. Delicious? yeeeees :D

Me and my SO were tucked away in a tented table which made everything a little more romantic. The layout and decoration of the joint is cozy with a slant to the enigmatic. And the music? I friggin loved the music! 

I was very impressed by how on the mark our server was. I feel rude that I never caught his name, but he was a tall young man with a long ponytail. I couldn't imagine serving in a place where every table is hidden around a corner or tucked in another room. I'd either forget about people completely or be nosing in on them every 10 minutes to make sure they're alright. He was never overbearing nor was he absent. We ordered from the prix fix menu and the poor guy had to bring us out dish after bloody dish for five courses on spot one by one with a smile. 

The changing Prix Fix menu is great. Sooooo much food. You can get a $25 steak at Moxies or you can pay $30 at Southern Accent for a pick and choose feast and make a cullinary experience out of it. Maybe some dishes are better than others, but the trying is the fun part.

I'd recommend this place to anyone. In fact, I do recommend this place to everyone. It's absolutely charming and I hope that it's around until I'm crippled and grey."}
{"text":"And it's Southern Accent for the win! I took my girlfriend here for dinner Saturday night for a Kentucky Derby themed party. The atmosphere was incredible. Most of the bar patrons were wearing funky straw hats provided by a tequila company. We couldn't decide on mains, so we ordered rounds of apps. Oysters, chicken liver, hush puppies, shrimp, cornbread were consumed. All were fantastic, but the chicken liver, shrimp and hush puppies were personal favs. The bartender made great mint juleps and an on off-menu raspberry cocktail at my GF's request. 

Also a special thanks to Justify for winning the Derby and getting us a $50 dollar gift certificate. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh my god!  This place was da bomb!  Highly recommend!

Tucked away in the romantic street of Markham (I've never seen this street before!), this cozy and friendly restaurant welcomed us with open arms.

Now let's get to the food already!   There was quite a bit of diversity on the menu.  3 solid flaps of Appies, Entrees and Desserts.  We went for the $25 prix-fixe menu (from my understanding changes on a daily basis).

Starters: I had the AVOCADO BRUSCHETTA and my boyfriend had the MEAT GUMBO.  Both were very rich in flavor and hits you like home-style food should hit you, warm and to the bone.

Eating soul food, we had to get the CORNBREAD, which I highly recommend!!!  Imagine perfectly warm cornbread, that's light and fluffy and just melting in your mouth... Cornbread is hard to master (for me, at least!)  And this place did it 100% right!

Mains: I ordered the SOUTHERN FRIED BAYOU CHICKEN, which was what the server recommended (btw - the service was exquisite).  She said that it's a southern staple (so true) and that it's not always available on the menu and that some people need to be e-mail notified when it is on the menu.  So I had to try it and it came with a side of CUMIN BASMATI RICE and GREEN BEANS which was hearty and divine.  There was a sauce over the chicken that was thick and delicious!  

Cool Note, ask for some hot sauce (also a southern staple) and they bring out a variety of hot sauces which they sell as well and boy, they are good!

My bf ordered the BLACKENED CAJUN CHICKEN, it was a smaller piece of chicken but was not a loser to what the sides had to offer.  He had SWEET POTATO MASH, JAMBAYLAYA, HUSH PUPPIES and COLLARD GREENS.  OH ME OH MY.  Each bite of food was like a little food explosion in your mouth, filled with hearty flavors injected into every bite.  I have never seen him so vocal about his food, it was definately a winner in our books and easily claimed \"one of the best meals of our lives\".

Dessert: Since I had scarfed down everything so quickly, I went for the ORANGE FRUIT SORBET, which was lighter on the palette.  It was so fresh and definately tasted homemade, I highly recommend it.  We also tried OUR FAMOUS PECAN PIE and that was really good.  It all tasted so fresh, you can taste the flavours of the pecan just ooze out with every bite.

Overall, this was one of the best experiences of our lives. It's a must go.  The service was helpful and attentive.  The atmosphere was a little random and busy but very entertaining.  The food was superb (one of the best in the city, in my books).  We felt so comfortable, we had great flowing conversation, much like a new couple going on a first date again.

Cool Note - They have a fortune teller in the front of the restaurant.  I didn't do it, but from the other reviews, it seemed to be about $20 per reading. 

Sorry this review is so long, I usually like to keep my reviews short and to the point but that would not do this place the justice it deserves.  If you are reading this, please hop into your car and go immediately."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this restaurant for years...highlights are the Jambalaya, Gumbo and Voodoo Pasta.

Service can occasionally be spotty (my 1 star deduction) but by and large I always enjoy going here.

If you haven't been, it's basically in an old house (been there for 30 years) with a decent sized patio in the summer. Food is relatively inexpensive and done right."}
{"text":"As we entered the playful confines of Southern Accent I couldn't help but feel as if some magical teleportation device had somehow taken me to the salty shores of Lake Pontchartrain.  The space was cozy yet intimate and was N'awlins through and through.  The kaleidoscopic interior offers the eyes a visual smorgasbord, where each room allows for a unique individual feel without taking away from overall ambiance.  Drapes and muted lighting create a feeling of separation from other diners and the centrally located 1940's style bar is a sight to behold for any northern Mardi Gras revellers.

Now If I said the best thing at Southern Accent was the food I would decidedly be lying.  And although the food was undeniably ethereal in its absolute perfection, a harmonious balance of piquancy, which I felt more than privileged to experience despite a relative lack of proximity to Bourbon St., I will go on record and state with certainty that it pales in comparison to the gentile southern hospitality and charm we experienced in the capable hands of our incredible hostess/server/tour guide/historian Wendy.

Wendy was simply put, the best server I have ever had.  She was gracious, charming, informative, and above all genuine.  She gave us a tour of the restaurant and a brief history lesson, and I must say that without her guidance I may still be stuck in some forgotten recess of Southern Accent  unable to write this review, as the old converted Victorian seemed to have an endless abundance of twists and turns much like a Casino specifically designed to discourage gamblers from departing, not that I would have had minded staying in SA, but happy to Yelp about it all the same.

Last but not least I have to at least mention the food.  I had the $27.00 prix fix menu.  I started with a phenomenal crab orzo, followed by the Jambalaya which has to be among the best dishes I have ever tasted.  Generous chunks of andouille sausage, chicken and smoked ham on a bed of seasoned Cajun rice topped off with a plentiful array of shrimp and perfectly bitter collard greens kept visions of SA dancing in my head.  An honorable mention goes to the Pavlova topped with house made whipped cream and a healthy scattering of assorted berries.  The Pavlova was chewy, but strangely crunchy, and above all highly satisfying.

Thank You Wendy and Southern Accent and of course Wendy."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party with a group of 20 people. This restaurant is located in the heart of Mirvish Village in an old fashioned style house. The restaurant was beautifully decorated making you feel like you were actually in New Orleans. The fact that this establishment has been in existence since 1987 you know that the business is doing pretty well. The service was excellent, food was delicious (minus the fact that it was too spicy for me to handle) and the ambience was comfortable and relaxing. I ordered the lamb with the mash and veggies and my bf ordered the steak with shrimp, mash and veggies. Both were cooked well to our specifications except that it was a little too salty. I also minused a star because it took an hour by the time we got our food.

Overall, great place to dine if you want that Creole experience."}
{"text":"I went for Summerlicious and had dinner. I did enjoy my meal. I'm not complicated and if anything give me hot sauce! I would recommend this place.

My friend on the other hand is from the Caribbean island and for her it was lacking the essence, the flavour, the soul of the dishes. 

To each is own taste. Nevertheless we did enjoy the ambiance and decor. Perfect for group night or an intimate date. The staff is amazing. 

Yes! I gave it a 5 stars because I'm the one writing the review and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! First visit and the food was absolutely delicious; from appetizer, main and dessert. Their bread pudding with bourbon sauce - OMG it is to die for !!!! def will come back and try other food in their menu."}
{"text":"This place has a very unique look to it however a small group of us got together and decided to try it. 

I was all over the place with the menu and didn't know what to try but really appreciated our server who was 1) patient as hell and 2) offered great suggestions. 

I had the gumbo to start which had a nice flavour and the fried catfish as the entree - OMG that thing was unreal but talk about an insane portion and something to regret after....(a little over the allotted daily caloric intake..haha)"}
{"text":"If a restaurant can make a food I normally do not like and make it awesome to the point where I may have developed a food crush, then they are certainly doing something right. Hello Southern Accent, hello blackened chicken livers! I hate liver; the smell, the taste, the texture! That was until I tried the blackened chicken livers...I am in love.  Well seasoned, smokey, blackened yet tender...yum! Piquant shrimp is tasty...if anything just for the garlic, lime hot sauce. 

I have tried the jambalya however the beef brisket is fantastic. The fact that I did not need a knife to cut it as it was so tender just about sent me to meat heaven. I had never tried cheese grits...interesting and tasty.

3 course set menu for $27 is a bargain, although I did not eat from this menu on this occasion. 

Atmosphere/Decor: I love the layout of this place as there are so many smaller rooms and they seem to be popular with parties and can provide an intimate space. Warm, welcoming, casual and homely...with pretty fairy lights everywhere! They also have a small patio. 

Staff: On the ball and fast. We did not have a long wait for food, despite being warned we may as they had a number of parties in the restaurant that night."}
{"text":"Fave restaurant in Toronto! Everything here is sooo yummy!! Authentic southern food and amazing beignets. Me and my boyfriend came twice this week and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"This little gem of a place has delicious food and good service. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious lunch but only 1/4 people ended up ordering the prix fixe. The rest of us ordered off the weekend brunch menu.

I know that the decor and food might not appeal to some people. The restaurant is definitely a little kitschy and the food kind of mainstream in the spice/flavor departments. That said, I really enjoyed my meal here.

I got to try:

-crab royale (crab cake was AMAZING, one of the best I've had)
-some bourbon barbecue ribs (cooked well, smoky, falling off the bone, ribs could have been warmer and sauce could have been a smidge hotter but was very flavorful)
-the eggs/cornbread/brisket Benedict (5/5 entree, loved the slightly fatty brisket and sweet cornbread)
-calamari (pretty standard but good sauce)
-savory chive biscuit (honestly so good, didn't need the butter and a good-sized biscuit)
-praline brownie (very moist and great topping - gluten-free, by the way)

I really liked it and I would definitely return. I think it's just shy of a 5 because it's a little toned down in the flavor department."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time at this place. Great food and cocktails (Whiskey sours were great as mentioned in previous reviews), and a decent selection of beer. I had the catfish and can't wait to go back and get more. Our server was great- very attentive and friendly, quick with refills. The ambience of this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Intense decor, the vibe is very lively. Our server joked around with us and made us feel welcome. Their appetizers were to die for: Blackened Chicken Livers and Piquant Shrimp. The mains were not good: Cajun Jambalaya was very bland and dry; Dauphine Street Cracker Catfish was nothing special. We were disappointed with the mains. As for drinks their Sour Bourbon is a must-try."}
{"text":"This place was originally on Markham St, but moved due to Honest Ed's closure. At first glance, the environment felt somewhat exciting with the Cajun decor. Looked at the winterlicious menu as I wait for my friends to come. 

3 courses for $28:
- Beginnings: Spinach Lentil Soup, N'awlins Gumbo, Special Salad and Cajun Samosas.
- Principals: Lafayette Etouffee, Bayou Chicken (local), Canal Street Jambalaya and French Market Cauliflower Bake.
- Sweet Endings: Pavlova, N'awlins Bread Pudding, Sweet Potato Pecan Praline Brownie, Homemade Ice cream or Sorbet and Fresh Fruit Cup.

They have some $8 Special Drinks for Winterlicious, which I took Southern Jim. The drink on it's own felt a bit too strong. As I eat my Canal Street Jambalaya, the taste of the drink actually complements the spiciness of my dish.

The Spinach Lentil Soup was good, but my ignorance of the N'awlins Bread Pudding led to an unexpected disappointment. My ideal thought of \"pudding\" was more of a soft creamy texture. Yet the reality of this \"pudding\" was nowhere soft nor creamy. To make things worst, there was a taste of bitter orange inside this block of pudding. Should have chose the Sorbet instead.

Overall the meal was good. As for the service, our waiter took a bit longer to come by as the restaurant was somewhat crowed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Big fan of the blackened chicken livers and the Dark and Stormy cocktail"}
{"text":"Came here with a travelzoo. I haven't been to the restaurant for about 20 years and not sure why! Food is excellent and serving sizes huge which I wasn't expecting due to the coupon. Everything we tried was delicious including the peach sangria.  Especially tasty  were shrimp apps, hush puppies, jambalya, calamari and cold dill yogourt soup. Dessert was incredible - we had chocolate  cake and pecan brownie. We will be back. Highly recommended unless you are on a diet! It will be a sad day when the doors shut for the honest ed's redevelopment so hurry and go."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was decent, but the service was atrocious. We came in on a Saturday night at around 9pm. Although we were seated quickly upon entering, 17 minutes passed between the time we sat and the time a server acknowledged our presence and asked if we wanted something to drink. We were actually a few seconds away from just getting up and leaving before the server finally came. Server was super-brusque -- no hi, no hello, or anything else other than the bare minimum/perfunctory words that needed to be exchanged. I seemed to get total 'tude that would be a little more befitting some snooty place in Yorkville rather than a place  basking in the blinking lights of Honest Ed's and built to look like a Louisiana crab shack. Servers also had to be flagged down for things like ordering martini rounds, drink refills, and the bill. My dinner there took two full hours for what should have only taken one at most because of the slow service. 

Egregious service aside, the food was okay, but not great. Being an American expat and having lived in the southern part of the U.S. for several (mostly forgettable) years, I've had my share of great Cajun cooking; Southern Accent doesn't quite match up. I ordered the prix fixe. The green salad appetizer was nice and lightly dressed but... y'know.... just lettuce on a plate. The Bayou Chicken main consisted of very skinny/non-meaty fried chicken thighs and a drumstick, then smothered in a spicy sauce. There was a lot of batter and sauce, but not a lot of meat. The bread pudding dessert was warm but didn't taste very fresh (had a slight rubbery consistency like it had been microwaved too long), and the sauce little too bourbon-y for my taste.

During this same visit, I witnessed a server spill drinks onto two other diners, and plates being dropped elsewhere in the restaurant. Sheesh. I would come back to try other things on the menu, but the service was just so bad that I'd be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"I loved the original location & was excited to buy a Groupon for the new location, try it out. Although the atmosphere remains vibrant & fun, I was extremely disappointed. I'm fine with taking my time, slower service but this was painfully slow! I ordered a Cesar & it was bland. The salad was completely non descript (just lettuce). My main was catfish. The fish itself & the home maid tartar sauce was quite good. However the rice looked old & the greens were tasteless. The bread pudding was excellent. 
Overall, I was so excited for the new location but the poor service & mediocre food was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"On residential Markham Street, just out of the Bloor/Bathurst neon glow a mini restaurant row of Butler's Pantry, Southern Accent, Victory Cafe and The Central, all housed in well... converted houses.  This format lends itself well to the New Orleans, kitsch, glowing lights, and nooks and crannies that give your dining party a touch of privacy in several instances.  

I've ordered the BBQ Beef Brisket and was most satisfied.  The sides were less suited to my liking but I was good with the beef and the drinks (Sazerac/Julep).

Our servers each visit were often a combination of bar tender and others, they actually were quite friendly but inconsistent on timing, speedy initially and then not responsive later.  Overall, considering that awkward combo decent."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious. Everything was okay, but it didn't live up to the hype. 

Food 3/5:  For my app I had the oyster rockefeller, which was a bit too salty. My main was the Peter Street Fish which was luke warm by the time it hit the table and the fish had clearly been frozen, however the sauce it was covered with was quite good. For dessert I had the pecan pie which was cold, it would have been a lot better if they'd heated it up. Although I was pretty disappointed by the food, I'm hoping its just the winterlicious curse and I will come back because they had some pretty good deals (ie. half price apps at happy hour and shuck-for-a-buck Mondays). I ordered the piquant shrimp while waiting for my friend and this was better than any of the winterlicious food. The shrimp sauce was tangy and spicy (although the shrimp did have that frozen texture) and the hushpuppies it came with were fried to perfection. The portion was super small and it wasn't worth $12, but at half price it was great! 

Atmosphere 4/5: The only way I can describe this place is so tacky its cute."}
{"text":"I went to Southern Accent for a tasting event along with a friend and we got to try a variety of items on their menu which included APPS - Blackened Chicken Livers w/ Hush Puppies and Piquant Shrimp, Calamari,  MAIN - Chicken, Jambalaya, Lamp Chops w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Catfish with Collard Greens, Seafood Pasta, DESSERT - Bread Pudding not to forget the drinks - Jack Sours i.e. Jack Daniels with fresh lemon juice and Woodford Reserve Mint Julep.

The Calamari served with 2 kinds of sauces was my favorite followed by Piquant Shrimp, Blackened Chicken and Catfish with Collard Greens. I would certainly recommend Jack Sours for people who want to drink something refreshing compared to the Mint Julep which had a very strong taste to it. For desserts, at my next visit I would certainly like to try their pecan pie as it is one of their specialties.

The ambiance was cozy as we got to sit in the curtained booths they refer to as \"Snugs\" and Wendy, our waitress, made it a great experience."}
{"text":"I was back here last night with some girlfriends from work for our 'dinner and a psychic' night. The atmosphere of this restaurant is great, the food is fantastic. I ordered the French Quarter Lamb which came with garlic mash and green beans. The lamb chops were cooked to absolute perfection and were accompanied with the most incredible apricot, ginger and mint glaze. The green beans were fresh and cooked al dante and the garlic mash was smooth and delicious! I would definitely order this dish again.

The psychic? A tad expensive for 15 minutes and I felt that I needed to provide too much information prior to her deciphering what her 'guides' were telling her. Pretty generic responses... apparently I have ties with England, Ireland and Scotland.  Huh, who would have thought (considering I'm a fair-skined red head!)?!!

Believe me, I'm not a sceptic by any stretch of the imagination but this experience certainly didn't 'wow' me the way the lamb chops did!!"}
{"text":"What a Gem!

We stumbled upon this little hideaway last night and were extremely impressed. The decor and music are upbeat and fun and the service was excellent. Southern Accent offers an excellent Prix-Fixe nightly and a super-value Prix-Fixe on Sundays. $22 or $25 per person will get you a three-course meal, with coffee included! Plus, the margaritas are delicious. 

Highlights from the menu include:

-Hush Puppies - Appetizer of corn fritters with a creole spicy sauce.

-The Lamb Chops - Some of the best we've ever tasted and only $22 on the Sunday Night Prix-Fixe! Actually, less than that because you get the lamb + appetizer + dessert for only $22.

-Homemade Pecan Pie-- yummmmmm. Nuff said.

Great value, flavour country all the way, excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit Southern Accent since I was 17 years old, so a whopping eight years have gone by and I finally got to go last night. It was WORTH THE WAIT. (And yes all caps were necessary because it was just that good!)
Let's start with drinks: we had a peach rose sangria which was delicious, and I had a bourbon sour, which has now become my drink of choice. It was just strong enough and the size was very generous.
Appetizers: we ordered the baked garlic, the hush puppies, and the Cajun calamari. I think baked garlic should be a mandatory menu item for every restaurant always. It came with a basket of bread, some hummus, and some olives and feta. Smearing the garlic on a piece of bread with hummus spread on top was absolutely perfect. The hush puppies were a great size, two to three bites each, and had great texture. They were dense but not too heavy and for a fried item, they weren't too oily. The dipping sauce has a nice kick, but if you're not a fan of spice I'd skip it and just eat them plain. The calamari was cooked to perfection and the Cajun sauces were incredible.
Mains: My dinner companions had the steak and the jambalaya, and I had the seafood Voodoo pasta. We each sampled each other's entrées and all of them were excellent. They really know how to balance their spices here. Everything was very well seasoned and the spices did not overwhelm the flavour of each dish. Be warned, though: if it's your first time here and you want to have appetizers as well as dessert (like I did), pasta might be a bad choice for your entrée. It's delicious but it is a heavier option than the meats would be.
Desserts: one of my dinner companions felt compelled to order two desserts, and I can't honestly say I blame him. Between the three of us we had the pecan pie, the bread pudding, the crème brulee, and the sweet potato praline brownie. The pecan pie was very good, it was perfectly sweet without being cloying. The bread pudding was unreal. It's probably one of the best bread puddings I've ever had. The crème brulee as well was perfect. The custard wasn't overdone, which is one of my pet peeves, and the sugar was perfectly caramelized. And the brownie. Oh the brownie. First of all, it's small. But the size is perfect because it is incredibly rich. But oooooh so delicious.
I feel like I can't say enough about this place. The food was outstanding, the place itself is so much fun with every room decorated differently, and the service was beyond compare. Our waiter's name was Gordon and he was so friendly and wonderful, I hope when I go back I get him as my waiter again.
If you made it to the end of this review, I applaud you. I know it's long. But this was such an amazing restaurant experience, I had to mention absolutely everything. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've sauntered past this funky joint many times on my way to Suspect video but have never actually gone in.

Went in on a rainy Friday evening with the wife and another couple, and had a great time.

I ordered the Decosta Street Pork (sp?) which came with Rice Pilaf and sweet&sour Bok Choy. It was awesome... the pork was tender and spiced perfectly, the portions were big and bold, and I was very happy with what I got.

Had a couple of yummy Bourbon Sours afterwards, and called it a night.

Not much to complain about here. The whole thing was a tad pricier than I expected, and the service (although super friendly) was slow/lacking at the end of our night (it got a bit busier but still...).

The decor and atmosphere was great, as was the music and food. I'd recommend it, and will be going back to sample other dishes."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've been here a few times for drinks, and couldn't help twisting my head around every time a plate passed by my seat. The aroma that wafted past my nose was incredible! Needless to say... I finally made by for dinner. My lord! Was it not the best meal I've had in a very long time. My boyfriend and I both ordered off the \"prix fixe\" menu, which is 27$ for an appetizer, an entree and dessert, and we shared an order of calamari. 
First up was the calamari, which was by far, the best calamari I've ever had.. And I've eaten a lot of calamari! They were cooked to perfection, it wasn't rubbery, it was perfectly seasoned and came with two delicious sauces to dip. 
Next up we both had the soup of the day, which happened to be potato leak soup, it was garnished with green onions, bacon and a fried oyster! Delicious!
For the entrées, I chose the blackened chicken that was served with garlic mash, sauteed spinach and a fresh lemon beurre. Everything was spot on, so flavorful, everything was great on it's or mixed together, the flavors complimented each other. My boyfriend got the jambalaya, I only tried a bit, but it was perfectly cooked,a nice blend of spices and flavors. 
For dessert we went with the banana bread pudding, and my gosh was it delicious! I feel like I am abusing the word \"delicious\" but I can not explain to you enough how much I enjoyed everything about every dish we had there.
On another note, the staff are all delightful, polite, friendly.
The prices are very reasonable, especially for how good the food is.
In case you don't get the point I'm making... Put on your shoes, grab your jacket, and head down to Southern Accent... .. . asap"}
{"text":"I booked a table on the patio, outdoor décor ever reminding me of  Mardi Gras. 

My appetizer consisted of alligator served in piquante sauce with hush puppies. The flesh was tender which surprised me as I never thought such a tough looking creature would be quite as succulent. The piquante sauce was great for dipping hush puppies in & the hush puppies themselves were crisp on the outside & soft within.

My main was the Canal Street Creole Jambalaya I was most pleased with this dish as It was rich hearty & full of proteins including chicken, smoked ham & andouille sausage.  The rice was saturated with spicy tomato sauce, topped with greens & garlic grilled tiger shrimp.  

For dessert I had pecan pie & N'awlins Bread Pudding . The  Pecan pie is served with a side of whipped cream.  The crust was crisp & non oily.  Pecans made up most of the pie with just a bit of corn syrup as a binder.  The pecan pie was extremely good & was the best dessert there. The N'awlins Bread Pudding was made of apples, pecans & raisins & drizzled in bourbon sauce.  It was not too sweet & was very moist.  

Portion sizes were enough to satisfy me, the service was decent & the food was good. The Jambalaya & Pecan Pie would be enough to lure me back."}
{"text":"One of the most romantic spots around- we sat in the completely private and curtained room across from the bar called a \"snug\".  And the bartender was not only the most memorably friendly server, but he had his own bourbon drink recipe that was out of this world!  He also knocked before entering our snug, hilarious!  The cajun and creole food was great- I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just visited for brunch at the new location at College & Ossington. Awesome service and food at a really great price! It's cool how they've adjusted to the new space and have brought so much of the history of the old location with it. Snugs are still there for people who want a little privacy. We had the crabcake with hollandaise sauce, the BLB sandwich (chicken livers), and the jambalaya omelette (spicy). All delicious and looking great on the plate. Highly recommend people check out this new location!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but always dined on the patio.  Last week was the first time I was actually seated inside the restaurant.  

Wow - what a sight!  It's eclectic and fun and whimsical all in one beat.  Nothing really makes sense and that's ok.  It's long and narrow and to get to the 2nd level there is a tight staircase. It has a definite old school funky vibe in here.   A few tables upstairs makes it feel cozy in a fun relaxed way. Around the corner from the flashy Honest Ed's this place is definitely flashy in it's own sense (you'll know what I mean when you see the decor).  There is also a psychic that there is there on the weekend nights and charges $40 for 15 minutes. I've never had it done here before but someone I know has and said it was a very accurate reading (take that  with a grain of salt). 

Of course by the name of the place this is a Southern joint.  Never having been to the south I can't vouch for the authentic nature of the food but it's pretty delicious.  I had the fried catfish with rice and collard greens.  The fish was nicely fried and moist on the inside.  The rice - I wish there as more of it since the piece of fish is pretty big.  I'm a rice girl through and through so I would have enjoyed more of it.  The collard greens were dressed very lightly with think lemon juice (not sure) but were refreshing contrast against the fried fish.

Overall a great place to get your South on - even greater in the summer where you can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"I give Southern Accents a 3.5.. Yelp needs to add half pts!

This place reminds me of NOLA's in New Orleans.. The hurricane's are pretty yum, better than Pat O'Briens in NO! The ambiance is fun, definitely a mardi gras feel. Service good! Food.. i liked! 

We started with the avocado bruschetta - ok this I would skip.. there's hardly any avocado.. The roasted garlic, A liked it!

Catfish - highly recommend.. Crispy, along side tartar sauce... (I loves tartar sauce)
The trio - I can't find the exact name on the online menu - sausage, chicken and grits.. Addictive! Rich! lovesssss 

Dessert - Creme Brulee - pretty good, small
Strawberry Rhubarb pie - meh.. not so much.. 

Would I come back, yep.. It's a fun place, in a super cute neighborhood."}
{"text":"All it takes is a 15 minute wait for a drink to pull you out of the moment and put you in a bad mood."}
{"text":"I came into this restaurant as a result of turning away from a crowded one.  Initially, I thought the choices were a bit limited but once inside I had a change of mind.

When you initially enter, to your immediate right is the psychic which is always a hoot!  If you want to eat, you must turn left. You are greeted by a jolly hostess. Despite not having reservations for a Saturday dinner, we found a table. You pass through festive & cheerful Mardi Gras decorations.

Drinks - drinks are a plenty! I had a Blue Martini which was delicious and to prevent any accidents I switched drinks to a sparkling maple drink.  

I decided to get the prix-fix. I ordered the crostini. My dinner companion ordered the soup of the day - a rich russet potatoe soup. I chose the St Peter Street fish dinner (rainbow trout, mildly seasoned, along bak choy (green collards?) and seasonal veggies). The trout was cooked to perfection.  He chose the bourbon street chicken which was moist! So juicy and tender! Oh, the spices! Next time, I am ordering that dish.

For dessert, we shared the gluten free sweet potatoe praline brownie. It was super rich and sweet, so I only had 2 tastes. It was too much for me. But it was tasty.

Our server was an Aussie whom I had difficulty understanding because of his accent! But he was efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner last night w my daughter.  Emmy was our server - so attentive and knowledgable - and she even brought the bartender to our table when we had a question about the bourbon!   The food was very good.  My daughter had the bouillabase and I had the blackened chicken. Best part of dinner was the shrimp app with hush puppies.  I wouldn't recommend the oysters rockefeller though...not enough parm cheese broiled on top, so was a bit mushy.   But other than that - a great dinner.   Loved the music they played too.

We even had a tarot card reading - lots of fun!"}
{"text":"The food is great, inexpensive and in great portions but above that the staff is just incredible. 
Always there but not in the way, friendly but not over the top. A1.
Thank you for a great evening."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant as highly recommended by an acquaintance at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. Was recommended by her to try the best calamari in the city. I also ordered the catfish. The rubbery, stretchy and chewy cajun fried calamari was an absolute MISS. The only thing that somewhat allowed me to eat what I could of it was the hot sauce. Must have been frozen. The Dauphine Street cracker catfish however was absolutely 5 star amazing and the best I've ever had along with the delicious garlic mash to top it all off. What an amazing and wonderful treat. Absolutely outstanding. I'll be back again for the catfish and certainly try a different app next time."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for dinner. We had the liver app and shrimp app and they are very spicy but taste great. I had the ribs with potato salad and it was well seasoned and the potato salad omgeeeeeeeee it was soooooooo good. The device was excellent l; server attentive; intimate environment great for a date night. Cocktails were also very good especially the bubbly champagne drink. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"First I me I ever tried creole food and I have to say it was a good experience! The restaurant was different, it  had a psychic table/ booth which was a concept I've never seen in a restaurant but it was very interesting. 

Although I've got nothing to compare it to, the food seemed pretty good so I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"The charm of their old converted house on Markham St. can never be achieved on College St., which is to SA's detriment (hence a 3-star instead of 4). Sadly, I miss the old location too much, it was a rare gem in the city.  The new digs, look funky-ish but otherwise just a typical College St. restaurant with tables lined up like a cafeteria.

Otherwise, the food (as always) was great, and the service pretty good too.  If you've never been, please DO GO and pretend I never mentioned Markham St."}
{"text":"Two friends and I stopped by this place before heading to watch a movie for TIFF. It is a very quaint place. The day we went for dinner, there was a wedding reception taking place. It was very beautiful to watch. 
Having being to New Orleans, I always appreciated southern food. I can say one thing: this place did not disappoint! 
We had the Cajun fish and shrimp, lamb chops and jambalaya. Everything felt very authentic."}
{"text":"Every single thing on the menu is delicious, every item. I went with my family and we one of everything on the menu. I am surprised I didn't puke from eating about 3x my stomach capacity (Really) but wow, there is not a single thing at this restaurant that didn't blow me out of the water.

My favorite was the gator appetizer with hush puppies, it tastes kind of like chicken/octopus and the sauce they use is AMAZING. Awesome cocktails here too, and coffee. The Catfish is probably the best fish I have ever had, collared greens were perfectly buttered and cooked.

Great ambiance, it's in an old Victorian house but its gigantic. It has 3 levels, nice washrooms and a good bar. I sat on the patio but the various seating arrangements looked like they would be very fun, but possibly claustrophobic. That would be the only con about the restaurant, it feels very cramped but almost in a good way, like when the hot tub is full of beautiful women except for me.

I don't know dick about Cajun food other than it is delicious, I know a few people who have friends in new Orleans or have visited there often, they say that Southern Accent is better than a significant number of restaurants in new Orleans.

But wow, that was probably the best meal of my life."}
{"text":"It doesn't happen often, but sometimes I find myself in the mid-afternoon, thinking of the evenings dinner, scratching my belly and thinking \"By gum, I could use some catfish tonight.\"  Southern Accent here I come.

Tucked away on Markham Street behind Honest Ed's, Southern Accent stands out with a yellow awning and large sign that commands attention nicely.  Go inside and you're hit with all things Louisiana, Cajun, and Zydeco in a 1940s bar.  You're also hit with a grand smell of Creole and Cajun smells and aromas that just make you hungry.

I mentioned catfish, and it is good.  But if you're not too keen, there's tons of other dishes that are spicy and flavourful that taste pretty genuine.  One of the best things is that jambalaya comes as a side dish allowing you to have it along with anything else that you fancy.  Oh, and you definitely need to treat yourself to a starter of cornbread.  You'll be flashing people and getting beaded necklaces in no time."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious 2012 and had an okay time. Waiter was amusing.

The atmosphere is nice (we sat on the patio), but I wasn't so happy with what I ate. I should say up-front that I usually eat a high raw food diet so my tastes could be a little whacked. But my boyfriend said his meal was just okay too and he's not high-raw.

I had the coconut cauliflower soup which was AWESOME. Lots of flavor.
Boyfriend had the grilled portobello mushroom with quinoa. He said it lacked spice for being a cajun place. It was VERY mellow. I think we're spoiled by the Chim churry (sp?) mushrooms at the Lonestar Texas Grill (best mushrooms everrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!)

For my main I had the vegetarian meal which was a bad decision. It was veggie jambalaya stuffed eggplant with butter soaked collards. I don't think it mentioned on the menu that the jambalaya was filled with tofu or seitan. I don't like to eat soy products but I ate it anyway. The eggplant was kind of tough to chew in places, so I left some of it on the plate. I didn't eat the collards. The pooling butter underneath it was a big turn off. The veggie jambalaya lacked flavor, but I get what I deserve picking the vegetarian option that would have no animal fat in it. (Other than seafood, I don't eat meat. But I'm not super strict when it comes to eating things like animal fat, dairy, eggs, cheese, etc. I avoid it as much as possible, but I don't make it a hassle.)

Boyfriend had the regular jambalaya and he said it was just okay. I think we were expecting to be blown away by the spice, but we weren't. The only cajun food I've had before is the cajun catfish at the Metro grocery store and this: http://www.zatarains.com/Products/Rice-Mixes-and-Side-Dishes/Dirty-Rice-Mix-Original.aspx 

Dessert was coconut cream pie. I shouldn't review this because I've eaten a few raw food desserts and there's no contest. Raw food desserts are eons ahead in taste. This tasted like nothing to me. Okay, there was a hint of coconut. Boyfriend thought it was just okay too.

At the end, it was $73.00 I kinda regretted spending. (2x Summerlicious price fixe dinners + 1 Stella + tax and tip)."}
{"text":"A friend and I from out of town were excited to visit the 'new' southern accent. We weren't so excited once we got there. 

We were seated in a corner where we seemed to disappear!  It took 20 mins after getting our water to even place our drink order. At that time we placed an order for 6 oysters. We waited another 15 mins for drinks. By that time we knew we wanted to share a bunch of apps so we ordered them. 15 mins later our oysters and two apps appeared. Dirty dishes say on the table for another 15 mins. At this point I asked for some bread. They don't have bread.

Finally we got the last 3 apps a total of two hours after we sat down. Frustrated we asked for the bill. We received and paid for the meal and then 2 hush puppies showed up. They were part of our original order!!

Will think thrice about going there again. Service was truly non existent and the kitchen seems to have no sense of timing whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend it and I live in the hood!!  Spent a total of 3 hrs there. Kinda a waste of my time!!"}
{"text":"Had them 3 days ago and enjoyed their voodoo pasta and the delicious lime / hot sauce they serve their shrimp appetizer with. Also tried their ribs; dry as sand, not my thing. Overall decent experience but would rather try something else in the area than go back."}
{"text":"Not good for vegetarians! They were out of both the vegetable mains so came up with a tofu & rice dish. Now, the blacken tofu with cajun spices was nice but the white rice with cumin was plain boring. Also 4 long beans isn't very vegetarian. Not at all worth $15 (especially when I was told $12 when I ordered the dish).

The service was below average. No checking back with the party at all.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I visited here this past Saturday with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. It was a spur-of-the-moment choice as the restaurant we had planned on going to down the street was closed, but it turned out to be a very happy accident. Everyone was very pleased with the food and the service and we kept commenting what a fortunate thing it was that the other place had been closed! I also particularly appreciated the fun, whimsical decor. Very happy about the way things turned out and I would be happy to visit again."}
{"text":"Spectacular music, great service, lovely atmosphere and rich, tasty, spicy food that will draw you back for more! Oh ya, the Caesars are deadly as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was shocked as I walked in the new location (due to relocation from Mirvish Village). I have been to that spot a few times before as a different establishment and Southern Accent did an amazing job using the space available. I know the funky decoration is old news but to me was the first time and I couldn't help feeling cheerful with so many colours and the jazzy songs playing. Do I even have to talk about the food? lol...and yes, that was good too! I used a Groupon for two and the best choices for us was the tomato parnot for app, catfish for main and brownie for dessert. The waitress was also super cool. I can see this place been packed on a week night for some happy hour!"}
{"text":"So, this place was kind of a mix bag. Although the restaurant seems to shoot for a trendy vibe, it feels more dated than anything, and the crowd is not hoping (it's quite empty actually). That being said, service is friendly, and if you like them on social media, you can get free cornbread! Drinks are tasty and sweet, thought not very strong. 

The appetizers were the best part, with crispy calamari, beautifully paid corn bruschetta, and light and fluffy cornbread, and the catsifh fried fingers were good too (albeit a little small). The gumbo was disappointing and looked and tasted grey, and and so was the jambalaya. The deserts were a nice pick me up again with a nutty brownie and a delicious root beer float. Overall, with the prix fixe menu (which i INSIST you get if you eat here) is a good deal with 2/3 of the offerings being good! It's definitely a lot of food, so it could easily be split between two people with maybe an extra appetizer or dessert to supplement!"}
{"text":"i hadn't been to SC in about 3 years or so, and knowing how restaurants are in Toronto, I'd imagined in the years since it had either: gotten too pretentious/expensive for it's own good, or were bought by someone that just didn't care as much.
 I'm happy to report: Neither of the above is true. Had an incredible meal, great service and no hipster-douche baginess. It really was a great experience. It has toned down over the years...it used to be like a microcosm of Mardi Gras - no longer. To be honest, I always found that a bit disparaging, and well, trying a bit too hard on their part in the part to be a bit of a theme-park of a dinner experience. The whole experience has matured quite a bit, no Drag-Queen hostess anymore (sadly !), and it doesn't feel like the circus it used to be...it's grown-up a bit...but it's not dull. Nice balance after 20 years."}
{"text":"The Sazerac is the grand ole drink of New Orleans.

This is one of the few places north of the Columns hotel on St. Charles where you can find a decent Sazerac.

A great bar to have a long conversation.

A gem in the Annex."}
{"text":"First time trying Creole food-impressed. Got the $28 prix-fix with meat gumbo,jambalaya and Pavlova for dessert. The soup was delicious but very tiny. The jambalaya was a rainbow of tastes spiced just right but the Pavlova was a bit disappointing. In retrospect I would have gone just for the jambalaya and maybe the soup separately which is cheaper since the dessert is not that authentic anyway. The place has a very kitsch décor, which gives it a character-some might like it while others might think it's over the top."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this one short and sweet:

Drinks are Delicious!

Food is really good.. the Jambalaya and the Calamari are my favorites.

Service is just OK..

The restaurant itself has a very cool feel and look to it..

Overall thoroughly enjoyed the Souther Accent!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends visiting the city. The place was kind of crazy looking and the service was a little awkward - though very prompt and polite. 

I had the prix fixe- duck gumbo was amazing. Still remembering days later. My fish was very nice and everyone else enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant for the summerlicious event. I got really exited since they had some alligator dishes and I really wanted to try some. When I got there I was told they had no alligator left, no big deal.
I had the jambalaya and I was so disappointed. It took about five minutes to serve our food, which is surprising since it takes a lot more time to cook food. The gravy around the dish had already form a paste on top, the rest was obviously microwaved and so bland. I was really hoping for something else."}
{"text":"Amazing knowledge of Bourbons. Staff led us through a tutored tastings, treating like we were the only customers in the place.  Corn bread melted in the mouth, and bread pudding is a must! Not 100% authentic south but amazing flavours regardless. Place is small so suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"I dined her for Winterlicious and I'd come back again! Everything I ordered surpassed my expectations and the prices are fairly reasonable. I had the chipotle coup, blackened chicken, and dessert wine on the Winterlicious menu.  You can expect a bit of heat here - after all, this is Cajun-inspired. Maybe next time I should try the fortune-telling! The service here was very good, expect one of the waitstaff seemed very confused as to who ordered what and kept mixing up orders."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This review is based on attending a tasting menu.  I just thought it would be fair to mention, but everything that was served is on the usual menu, so I don't think a dining experience would be all that different.

Atmosphere:  The first thing that you'll notice is the whimsy, eclectic décor, but homey.  Every square inch of the Victorian house-turn-restaurant has something on it.  It's a mix of Mardi Gras / indie café art / found objects.  And with the Holidays coming, they've added garlands 'n tinsel.

On the menu was a Mint Julep (a strong, bourbon-y, mint based cocktail), APPS - Blackened Chicken Livers w/ Hush Puppies and Piquant Shrimp, Calamari,  MAIN - Chicken, Jambalaya, Lamp Chops w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Catfish with Collard Greens, Seafood Pasta, DESSERT - Bread Pudding.  Everything was pictured, except the dessert.  :(

What stood out for me were the blackened items which have this grilled flavour, the fried items (calamari, hush puppies, catfish), Voodoo Pasta, all the accompanying sauces, especially the ones that came with the shrimp.  I usually don't eat much fried food, but these items weren't greasy or even oily, but fairly light tasting.  The pasta was nice 'n chewy with a nice cream sauce.  Again, I'm usually not a cream sauce person, but this was good!

Upon my next visit, I'd re-order the Calamari, Shrimp, Catfish, & Pasta.  Too bad I didn't get the try their Pecan Pie 'cause I looove pecan pie!

Our waitress, Wendy, has been with the restaurant for close to 20yrs.  She was very enthusiastic about the food and restaurant and explained the menu items in great detail.  I briefly met and spoke to one of the owners, Frances and she just seems lovely!"}
{"text":"About 8 months ago I was sitting on a patio in Toronto with a few friends, and I asked \"Where is New Orleans?\", to which one of my friends responded \"I think it's in Louisiana\". \"I want to go there\", I said in reply.

8 months later I did. And before I did, I checked out Southern Accent - twice. It instantly became my favourite restuarant in the city, and after returning from New Orleans, I can honestly say that this is (so far) the closest thing I've found to authentic Nawlins cookin.

This little place hiding behind Honest Eds has a ton of character. I love that there are private dining rooms (cozy with \"privacy curtains\" if you're feeling amourous after a few Bourbon Sours), and each section of the floor has a different theme (love the green tea room on the second floor). The girls bathroom has a little bourdoir outside of it that is super cute, and meshes well with the Victorian house the restuarant is situated in. The website makes the place look a lot bigger than it is, so I recommend calling ahead for reservations.

The pre-fix menu is superb, for $25 you get an app, entree and dessert, that will more than satisfy your soul food craving and your belly. A must pick is the cajun combo (if it's on the menu - things seem to come and go on the prefix as the weeks change) for a taste of everything. For a starter, I highly recommend the hushpuppies (jalpeno cornbread with a yogourt dipping sauce) and the bread pudding or pecan pie for dessert. When we complimented the chef on the best desserts we'd ever had, our waiter responded with \"I'd tell him, but he's already heard it at least 10 times today\". Cocky, but I believed him.

What they get you on here is the drinks - $10 a pop, but you must must must get a Bourbon Sour or two. The Hurricane packs a punch, but tastes nothing like the ones you get in New Orleans, and in my opinion is wayyy too sweet. 

A cozy spot with a ton of character and a menu that's a foodie's dream, for a great price. I'm sure this place will stay in the top spot on my Toronto's favourites list for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Sorry but I really don't see what all the fuss is about! The company was great but the food portions small and not particularly southern. The grits were lumpy; was there potatoes in there??"}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve. The drinks were great, the food was fabulous, and the service was .. alright!

The exterior and interior of this restaurant are both very eclectic and get you excited to eat here right away. We were seated in \"the booth\" which is literally a former entrance to the home, turned into a closet with a curtain over it. The reservationist warned us about this, but we were perfectly happy with it. Very cute, intimate. Of course, there's ample open seating as the restaurant has two floors.

The waiter came to greet us. He was awkwardly hilarious and gave us a good \"WTF?\" initial impression. Throughout the night, he seemed rushed would do quick rush-job checks on our table, but I'll give him a second chance because he was also doing the bar by himself, on New Years Eve (and it was busy!). I'll give him credit though, he makes a good drink, especially his Bourbon Sour -- Recommend trying it, and go for the upgraded one for $2 more.

The food came to us and it was an explosion of flavours. It was a special NYE menu, with my choice being a Bourbon Chicken plate and my date being a Lamb plate. The Bourbon chicken was both of our favourites with a huge mix of flavours and a perfect smoky flavour. The Lamb was great too, but slightly disappointing given the price, as the roasted lamb felt a bit dry in some spots. The sauces in both the dishes were amazing, and definitely made me a fan of Creole cuisine. Will be trying more.

Overall, quite pleased with the experience and plan to go back some time to try the Catfish and other dishes. Their regular menu looks much more appealing than the NYE menu they had going."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting and remember about this place.

Everytime i've been i've loved it even more.

In the old Annex hood by honest eds, this is an amazing lousiana restaurant. The food is bloody good, real cajun style, and very unique atmosphere. The place tends to close early, and is a little pricey (around $60/ head usually) but is well worth it. The food isn't like anything i've eaten in toronto and I think they make the best shrimp period. It's lousiana food, with artisitic flair. They are also famous for the classic Hurricane drink (from  a famous bar that got destroyed in katarina) that is basically a huge glass of alot of booze. I don't like it personally because it's very sweet, but it's very very popular. But the highlight really is the amazing food. 

I recently went their during winterlicious to find out the head chef came in everyday at 5am to prepare turducken.
I had it and it was amazing because of the unique added touches ' layers of oysters and sausage sauces in between the rolled layers.

I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"I like it! Went here with a group of 10 for winterlicious last night and it was a pleasant experience. The witnerlicious has good veg options but we had a look at their regular menu too and it has some great veg options also.

The good thing about this place is that it wonderfully accommodates meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans...and...even those gluten free people. The veg dishes are actually well thought out and not just lame pasta dish or bland tofu crap that is an insult to vegetarians.

The service - very good. Our server automatically did separate bills because she overheard some of our group (me) saying that they had to leave early. No hassle. Love love love it.

The Decor: Super trashy, super tacky and kinda stuck in a time warp. It was an assault on my eyes and really the only thing I didn't like about this place! \"boo\" - why yes there ARE pictures of ghosts on the walls scaring dishes of food and platters on the ceiling...why! This place just looks old and instead of renovating they simply keep adding more and more and more crap everywhere."}
{"text":"Experienced this restaurant as part of Toronto's \"Summerlicious\" festival... so perhaps had a lesser experience.

I tried the Jumbalaya, which was just the right amount of spice, ahd bib chuncks of shrimp in it, and good portions of ham... very enjoyable.

My girlfriend got the BBQ / Grill sampler platter which was very disappointing.  It features a sausage, which had a very tough skin, a piece of lamb which was okay (I'm not much a fan of lamb), and a grilled chicken breast which seemed like it went right from the M&M frozen isle to my plate... very little spice was used on any of these and they were not served with any sort of sauce.

The restaurant was neat considering it's a renovated old house, and the New Orleans inspired decor was neat... but overall I woult not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to come to this place as I only read good reviews from the other location. Unfortunately I was disappointed to say the experience did not meet. We came here for the winterlicious and with that the prefix menu didn't stand up. The service was the real disappointment as it felt like forever for each course to come. When the food came the flavours were bland and the portion sizes weren't filling. The atmosphere was nice but did not make up for the food disappointment.  One point that stood up to was I couldn't say the creole flavour was not creole. Sorry I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Specifically recommend the brunch. No lines. Incredible pancakes and really unique New Orleans offerings you won't see anywhere else. Same great staff with perfect drink specials to give you that \" can't believe I get to experience this\" weekend feeling."}
{"text":"Must try: Jerk Wings

Came here when they were doing a $5/lb jerk wings and $10 bourbon sour and really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.

The jerk wings were so flavorful and tender! They weren't very big so at first we thought we wouldn't be full, but there were quite a bit of wings and was actually very filling. We also ordered the calamari which was amazing as well, not too fried and came with a generous portion of sauce. 

I liked the sangria a lot as it was not watered down like a lot of restaurants here in Toronto. Bourbon sour was too sweet for my bf but it was just right for me. There's a very nice bourbon list as well as beer selection - will try next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Halloween. I have always wanted to try this place. I have never been to New Orleans so I won't comment on the authenticity. I loved the decor of lights and knick knacks. The in house psychics just added to the allure of this place. I ordered the jambalaya and it was good. Now again, I haven't had jambalaya in Lousiana but everytime I see it on a menu here in Toronto, I always ordered. Maybe it is the South Asian in me...always drawn to a rice dish mixed with veggies and meat and/or seafood. Comfort food ;). 
 
They have a really small bar and have live music every once in a while.  The place looks so cozy & cool. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Meh. You can tell this place was the sh!t back in the day, but it's definitely stuck in a time warp. Walked the strip, looking for a place to eat, and it was the only patio that actually had vacancy (and lots of it) so that should tell you something about the food... the interior was pretty kitchshy, bathrooms included, with weird saucers pasted onto the wall - I just didn't really get how this was Southern... ? The decor is very mardi gras, and again, dated. I think this place could use a bit of an overhaul... 

The food, for late night eats, wasn't terrible by any means, but nothing stellar. They were on the appetizer menu by the time we arrived, so we opted for the piquant shrimp and the cajun poutine, topped with brisket. The shrimp, meh. Tasted like they were cooked in frank's red hot (don't get me wrong, I like frank's red hot, but would expect something a bit.. fancier.. (?) at a cajun resto that touts itself for authenticity).  The poutine was definitely the better part of my meal, and good for sopping up liquor, but nothing out of this world by any means. I can't say I'm a hugely jazzed fan of this place, and after hearing so many good things from others (albeit, they used to frequent this joint circa 10 years ago), I would've expected more from it... Definitely not authentic cajun food by any means, but hits the spot if you're looking for a sit down, late at night, just to grab something a little something for your belly. It served its purpose that night but have no inkling to go back."}
{"text":"I don't usually review places outside my neighbourhood but my wife and I went here for supper on a Friday and it was so outstanding I had to post.  The server was kind, helpful with choices, and accommodating to special requests.  The sea bass with cajun corn was excellent, and my duck/chicken stuffed with hazelnuts over mash was fantastic.  Oysters, both cooked and fresh, were excellent.  Try the Collingwood Stormy Rye.  Wow."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and went with the Winterlicious special. First impressions: Limited lighting to take nice photos. Washroom has interesting design elements...

The food was very well prepared beside the fact that the Blacked Lamb was overly seasoned with black peppers, a personal preference as I much rather taste Chef Thess' master skills in preparing a lamb. Besides that, out waitress Hayley was very polite and took the time to explain each and every dish to us along with the history of this renowned restaurant. 

P.S. The photo of the calamari was taken with flash which caused unwanted attention from other guests. Would not recommend taking photos with flash! ...but the calamari was good despite lacking in crunchiness."}
{"text":"Been meaning to get back here for too many years.  The food for both of us was excellent, generous portions, really nice menue. 

Now, I'm one of these people who hates having wait staff giving me the \"hi, I'm [insert name here] and I'll be your server\" approach and often hovering for one reason or another. But the opposite was true here.  

It was the start of the dinner hour but it seemed to take a long time for orders to be taken, food to be delivered and payment process completed.

It may have cost them a star ... Annoying ... but the meal itself was worth it!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to check out this restaurant when it was in Markham st. I was thrilled to find out that they are now open for lunch since moving locations.

The location is easy to get to. The food was delicious, the most authentic gumbo I've tasted outside of New Orleans! Our server Wendy was super friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be returning and would suggest it to any other Cajun lovers!"}
{"text":"I got invited here by a few cousins who love New Orleans. As the only person in the fam who keeps Kosher, I was the only one for whom this could be a problem menu.

I checked out their website and there was nothing on the mains I could eat; there was a chance their \"fish of the day\" would be one I could eat (some, like catfish, aren't Kosher, and wouldn't you know that was the one fish listed on their daily menu...), so I tried calling. It was a Thursday during the dinner seating, and I called four times, but kept getting voicemail that announced it was Monday and that they were closed. This didn't thrill me.

I finally got them at 9:30pm, and they told me that it would be Mackerel, which I could eat, so I accepted the invite. When I got there, I discovered that there were a number of veg and regular fish options that just aren't listed on the website, including the French Market veg tofu & shitake mushrooms, which was quite delightful. 

The food was lovely, the service fairly good. Not outstanding, but decent. They seated us without reservations at 6:30 on a Friday evening, during Winterlicious, which was mega sweet. We were asked to be out by 8:30, but they made little to no effort to ensure it - even not bringing the bill until 8:30, when we finally asked for it (after the table had been cleared and the desserts finished).

A few minuses, though:

- Keep your staff apprised of what you're out of. No customer likes to order something - in this case the cheese plate - and be told five minutes later that you're out of it.

- Careful when doing charges. We asked for separate bills, except for one couple at the table. My meter ran out and we didn't get out of there until almost 9 because first he charged us entirely in couples (to save time I just paid for my other cousin instead of asking for a new bill), and then he charged the couple's tab to MY credit card.  Since their pre-tax bill was more than my post-tip one, it was a huge difference.

On, and one giggle. Proofread your menu. The menu advertised an Artesian Cheese Plate. What, do you keep it in the well in the back?"}
{"text":"I have been a little MIA in the Annex recently; with regret. Thus, I was happy to be beckoned to these stomping grounds of youth to attend a birthday gathering last weekend.

Although the name initially rang no bells, stepping along Markham street just south of Bloor, I recognized it immediately. On this little strip, there is a vibrant energy that decorates it in the day, and glows it at night. I felt a little disoriented through the winding, cozy interior as I tried to find my group, who had their own ~room~(gasp!) decorated with dozens of framed pictures of \"blue dogs\". It was The Blue Dog Room, and with this novelty, I was instantly in love. I was also surprised by the place's considerable ambiance and southern hospitality. 

Our party was large, and the service was very accommodating and attentive to each of us. I was very satisfied with my choice (blackened chicken), but bemoaned the lack of \"cheesy grits\" that I could get on the side of this particular entree. (Lucky for me, someone couldn't finish theirs and just ~begged~ me to).The menu had a good variety, though as a seafood un-enthusiast, many eliminations were immediate-- including dishes with a lot of cool names, like \"Marie Leveau's Voodoo Pasta\" (the voodoo stands for sea-creatures, apparently). 

I even had a decent Hurricane, which lived up to its rummy reputation more than I expected, which inspired some really good (and loud) conversation, which caused some giggling and bona fide stumbling on the way to the-- I am inclined, in this context, to call it a \"powder room\". The staff smiled as we picked one of our party up out from the broom closet (with a curtain for a door): \"it happens all the time\"."}
{"text":"The jambalaya was really good although nothing beats our homemade version :). The gumbo was amazing. I also enjoyed the poutine! I was surprised to see it on the menu and it was really good! The bread pudding was lovely too. 

The rooms are all different and eclectic. I really enjoyed the place. The waiter was wonderful. I will be back. One tip:  plan ahead and check their hours.  I believe they are only open for dinner now."}
{"text":"Good service. At times slow but we're a grand party of 18. Slammin southern foods. The duck gumbo is to die for. Anything with shrimp Lafayette is wonderful. Stay away from the catfish. Atmosphere is quirky and rich. You are in for treat."}
{"text":"Went here once for a staff Christmas party and was surprisingly impressed. This could also be due to the amount of Caesers that I consumed -- hey, unlimited drinks and a spicy salt concoction on the rim of the drinks will do that to you.

I remember having blackened chicken and lamb, and deliciously seasoned vegetables, not to mention the tasty appetizers of jambalaya and cornbread. Finish it off with some pecan pie and I was an instant fan.

The interior of the place is cute and cozy, definitely giving that Southern hospitality that I've never actually experienced in real life, but have seen enough movies to assume it would be similar to this. The night we went, there was a fortune teller on the main floor, and the kitschy decor went well with her crystal ball.

I haven't been back after this night, since I forgot about the place until just now, and it's a little pricey for an average night out, but it's one of the few places I've encountered in the city to offer Southern fare and spicy cocktails. Yum."}
{"text":"Southern Accent is the heaving 2-carat diamond engagement ring that confirmed the place Cajun food will monopolize in my heart for the rest of my life.  I've always loved southern food, and SA's outstanding offerings compelled me to finally settle down.

New Orleans decor greeted me on entry, the restaurant's fortune tellers were roaming around; the overall ambience is dark and confetti'd with Mardi Gras paraphernalia.  The bartender mixed for me their spin on a Manhattan, with a splash of cherry juice.  Really great.  My pals' cocktails were tasty too--a very sour but satisfying margarita being the standout.

Appetizer and entree: I split the baked garlic with a pal and ordered the jambalaya, but I had a chance to try out everyone else's offerings to boot.  The cassoulet, the seafood pasta, piquante shrimp, the chicken livers (surprisingly tasty)--everything was delicious.  My jambalaya had a sneaking heat that doesn't quite get at you until halfway through the meal.  Cornbread comes in all flavours and textures, and SA's version is extremely moist with corn niblets peppering the loaf.  

Dessert: I don't have a soft spot for sweets, but the bites I had of the pecan pie were unholy and the brownie could turn someone savage.  I don't know how they could have been any better.

The service was courteous, attentive and we had no problems.  Cajun food may not win your heart, but I strongly recommend at least a date with Southern Accent."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and patio at this place, but went here for Summerlicious and feel like the portions were a bit small and the good didn't look as amazing as some of the other regular menu items we saw come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We walked in to find the quirkiest restaurant we've ever been in. The servers are all so nice and attentive. Food is ah-may-zing. Drinks are great too. The bananas foster pudding is a must try! Oh and they have little corner tables with curtains that I thought was adorable."}
{"text":"Decided to go back to Southern Accent on a Sunday evening (this time with a Groupon) a few weeks ago. My friend and I got two appetizers and some cocktails. We got the piquant shrimp and the bruschetta plus a Bourbon Sour and a Pink Martini. The shrimp and hush puppies were delicious (and spicy!) but  we found the portion to be way too small for an appetizer. My friend thought the piquant shrimp were too spicy, so beware! The bruschetta was good, but not very memorable. Drinks were okay, although my friend complained her Martini tasted like Robitussin.

Service was painfully slow and impersonal. The waitress seemed to be occupied tending the bar and talking to other patrons. Getting drinks, ordering food, and getting the bill took forever. The atmosphere was quite different this time around. The crowd in the restaurant seemed to be mostly people in their 50s and 60s. I found the whole dining experience to be quite sedating. Southern Accent wasn't as lively as I remembered. I don't think I'll be going back in a while."}
{"text":"Finally strolled into this joint and had a seat. The mint julep was something to write home about; boozy with an authentic herbal hit followed by the brandy sweetening the bevvy. Now to food... The sauce for the shrimp ap was amazing and I'm still burping garlic, which is actually delicious (despite being potentially disgusting). The blackened tofu was also flavourful fun. The calimari was good, but I'm not sure why people were raving about it. The service was okay (our server was new). Super clean restrooms."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend and I must say I wasn't disappointed.

The service at the very get go was friendly and informative.

We were recommended the Bourbon Sours which were really nice, but warning, very strong. Another one of our party ordered the Spicy Ceaser which he claimed was awesome.

When we went, there was a prix fixe menu which I chose to order from because it looked like a pretty damn good deal.

I ordered the Blackened Livers which were very good. It had a nice amount of heat without being overpowering.

This was my first time eating Jambalaya so I have nothing to compare it to. For me, it was perfectly seasoned and the shrimps were so good.

My friend ordered the Calamari and the Cajun Poutine and of course I had to try some too. The calamari good, but nothing special. They are very generous with the sauces. The Cajun Poutine was... interesting? But it is not something I would get again.

I was so stuffed from the apps and entrees that I couldn't even begin to touch my dessert (Carrot Cake). I did however eat it at home later. I'm pretty sure it is a store bought carrot cake so nothing fancy.

Overall the ambiance is nice and casual. It's a great place to take a group of friends. The food was very yummy and the service was very friendly and upbeat. I will definitely be coming back here again to try other things on the menu. Definitely recommending this place to friends as well."}
{"text":"1.  Not ideal for vegetarians.  They had one entree (polenta-based) but it didn't sound that appealing so I put together a bunch of sides on my own.

2.  Delicious garlic mashed potatoes.  The fiddleheads were okay but too sweet (?) & the sweet potato soup had A LOT of bourbon in it.

3.  I was there with a large group of people - so understandably a little more difficult to wrangle but it took a long time.  Our server was doing his best but they really should have given him a wing person to pick up the slack."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming here, and if your looking for a New Orleans experience without the air travel then this is the spot for you. The decor inside is so eclectic and colourful you'll want to get your phone camera out. It's much calmer subdued version of Mardi Gras. 

The first time I came here I had the brisket which was so deliciously moist and flavourful, each bite was its own experience! First off I sampled my friends Hush Puppies\" deep fried jalapeño cornbread balls served with a spicy sauce. That was the dish I wish I ordered but I actually had a great starter: Brie crostini, baked brie over creamy artichoke sauce on a crusty bread which was still a very good selection. . Then the Voodoo pasta, with spicy sausage as my main which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this spot the food was fantastic and our bartender was so charming. He kept suggesting these amazing drinks that would cost an arm and a leg at any other place. Will definitely go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Set in a home on one of my favourite streets in the city, this two story restaurant pays homage to one of the greatest cities on the planet.  I love New Orleans and thus it would be hard to meet expectations.  

I like the interior, it is intimate but not loud.  We were a group of 8 and fit comfortable upstairs and were all able to hear each other well.  I prefer the art and decor upstairs; the Mardis Gras theme downstairs is a bit over played to me.

I had the Creole Jambalaya and started with the Gumbo, both were good but not exceptional.  That was the general consensus of our table.  

Overall, I like the idea and the execution was solid but not what it could be.  Disappointingly, it just isn't on par with what you'd find in New Orleans."}
{"text":"This used to truly be my go-to restaurant when family and friends are in town, but last time the service was just so terrible. Brought steak at an extremely wrong temperature, a full pint when asked for a half (and then charged for it) and oysters were brought at the same time as the mains.

I looked around and I couldn't see any familiar servers, so maybe they're just training up a new crop? 

I hope they get their footing back quickly, because I LOVE LOVE LOVE their creole cooking. I stand by my below ordering recommendations."}
{"text":"Nice spot but just didn't live up to New Orleans food experience given how recently I was actullay there and just how amazing our all round food experience was. 
I feel if you associate yourself with a famously amazing food destination you are setting yourself up to a higher standard. 
We got a hurricane and beignets of course! Beignets were over cooked and so a little chewy. 
My bf got the pancakes and I got cornbread, brisket and eggs. Both solid but just no where near NOLA standard.
Service was good and the place is cute."}
{"text":"The restaurant has moved to College and Osdington but the menu is still the same with some new additions and a takeout counter at the front.  Open everyday.  Now beignets.  Brunch and lunch menus."}
{"text":"I came in here Sunday night with my family to check out the Winterlicious menu. We came in around 5:30pm and by 6:00 the place was starting to get pretty packed. Love the decor in the restaurant very kitschy Mardi Gras / New Orleans style plus the jumping southern tunes totally complete the whole Cajun feel. 

The kind hostess takes us over to a cozy table in the front window. We are seated on a cozy cushioned love seat. Our waitress later returns and is as friendly as ever and goes over the menu and specials with us.

A basket of fresh sliced fluffy bread and a garlicy yummy hummus spread is placed on the table in front of us to nibble on.

We are all here for the Winterlicious menu however we decide to order some additional appetizers from the regular menu.

Hush Puppies - served with garlic lime piquant sauce
Gold brown crunchy exterior piping hot fluffy interior combined with the chilled tangy Tabasco-esque dipping sauce was delish

Cornbread - served with a drizzle of warm honey
I can see why they say it's mighty addictive! Not overly sweet speckled with real bits of corn and the toasty exterior is perfect for mopping up that warm gooey honey.

From the Winterlicious menu this what I ordered:

Spaghetti Squash - Tossed with Grilled red pepper, Bok choy ribbons and jerk spiced polenta cubes, topped with crispy lotus chips
Not something I would normally order but it seemed too good to pass up and boy did it deliver! Not only was it beautifully presented but the combination of flavours and textures was brilliant. Loved the soft polenta cubes! The seasoning and sauce on them was delectable plus the addition of crispy chips and crunchy grilled bok choy and sweet spaghetti squash was phenomenal

Bourbon Street Chicken - Blackened, boneless chicken breast napped with Fresh lemon beurre, served with garlic mash potatoes and Grilled Bok choy 
The smells from the plate infront of me made my mouth water. The blackening spice on the chicken was not overly intense but gave the chicken a subtle kick of heat. The mash potatoes were creamy and homemade style again nice subtle garlic flavour. I was happy they put the lemon beurre in a separate dish as I found it too sweet and didn't care for it. Instead I used there signature Lime Garlic Piquant hot sauce. The bok choy however was extremely delicious, it was glazed in a tangy bbq sauce. I also mopped my chicken in that sauce it was that good.

Sweet Potato Praline Brownie - Served with fresh cream
The praline topping took some force to break into but once you put it on your tongue it just melted in your mouth. The brownie was really moist with pieces of actual sweet potato baked right into it! I could of easily devoured two of them!

Overall a very flavourful and delicious meal from start to end. The service here is really attentive with servers going around refilling water glasses and checking on you to make sure everything is to your liking. Definitely a winner for the winterlicious pick.

FYI There is parking lot located directly behind the restaurant shared with Honest Ed's and you purchase a ticket to put on your dash at the metre when you enter. Just run through the tiny alley to get to the front of restaurant."}
