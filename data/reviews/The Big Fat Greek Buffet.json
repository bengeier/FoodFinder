{"text":"This buffet did not have any variety!!! I went to grab some pizza and even that was burned severely from the bottom. I told the Chef and showed him and even he realized that it was not edible. He told me he'd make me a new one but that obviously did not happen. All their dishes were tasteless and everything seemed to be out. While i was eating, a waitress came and handed me the bill even though i was not even finished. I thought that was very rude considering the fact that i did not even ask for it. She basically was telling me to get out. Don't call it a buffet if you have an issue with people eating. Will never be going there again!"}
{"text":"First of all I need to know why is gratuity included on my bill by Default? Pair that with the attitude of the manager at the reception and you can't help the feeling of being cheated.  
Then comes the cold stale buffet and that warm salad bar, you know it's warm when the color of the \"green\" vegetables starts turning yellow. 
Finally the looks we get for having brought our kids along. 
In short, the owners need to take some action soon or they will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was very good, with a pitcher of draft beer!  Yum. yum :-)"}
{"text":"The place is nice, the food is delicious, the price is adequate, and it's all you can eat. The selection is small for an all-you-can-eat place, and that's the main issue here. But you get a good Greek lunch - Greek salad, pita, tzatziki, cheeses, chicken souvlaki, beef, rice, potato, baklava, cakes, icecreams, etc. Small buffet, but you won't miss too much.

Friendly servers and owners. Overall a good lunch choice."}
{"text":"Wow I really wanted to like this place. The items on the buffet were exactly what I love.. Spanakopita, tarmosalata, souvlaki, pastitsio etc. But I feel they couldn't get it right. The souvlaki was dry and chewy, dips were bland etc. 

The desserts were good and the staff was friendly. But really if they want to do better.. Focus on the food. Maybe cut down on a few items to make the other items better.."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that chinese buffets work cause there is lots of different chinese foods. This place has all Greek food. That's great if you like all you can eat souvlaki, potatoes and rice. But after that they have slim to nothing. Peas, carrots, meatballs, rice stuffed tomatoes, salad, french fries, mousaka and calamari. 

I was full after a plate or chicken potatoes and rice ..carbs carbs carbs and full. The food was decent and the atmosphere was ok. A little surprised a couple light fixtures were broken and the lights bulbs were just hanging from the ceiling. Also some areas of paint and the seats were either scraped off or cut. 

The cost was kinda shocking. 2 kids aged 5 + 2 adults cost me $82 + tip. I should have gone to mandarin instead. Either way I had to try it. But I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, nice ambience and quick service.  The selection is limited but quite good for the price. Food tastes very fresh so good ingredients are used."}
{"text":"The plaza where it is located is a bit run down looking with a \"gentlemen's club\" one door down, so is a bit scarey.  We went on a Saturday for lunch and there were very few people there and at first wondered if they were even open, but they were.  We were there for about an hour and not once did they put out any fresh food.  There wasn't even any one back at the grill to cook!  

The food was OK but not great.  The souvlaki was dry and not hot so had probably been under the warming lamp for quite a while.  There was a decent selection of salads but only 2 fruits (pineapple, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe).  The hot foot selection was pretty limited with a small grill area and a bar with moussaka, pasta, rice, and stuffed peppers.  They also had pizza and spanakopeta.  The desserts were good but there were very few choices and the ice cream (3 flavors only) was awful.  

I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it.  I would rather go to Mr. Greek and order fresh food."}
{"text":"i must have been there on a bad night.  i heard so many good things about this place, but i found nothing good about it the night i went.  there was very little to choose from (maybe because the dining area was near empty they stopped making food).  there was only one server, and everytime i went back to see if they had put out something, anything fresh, all i say was one man just standing behind the buffet waiting for a tray to empty.  when it emptied, i saw him open a drawer behind the buffet and pull out three or four kabobs and put them out.  there was no telling how long they had been in storage and when they were cooked.

i know on crowded days the food must be hot, fresh, and much more choices.  but on this night, i was convinced not to come back.

fool me once shame on  you, fool me twice, shame on me.  

so i wont go back."}
{"text":"Stepped off the plane at Pearson Intl., and was STARVING. After driving around for a few minutes and cussing out the GPS, we saw this place's giant sign. The selection isn't as big as you might find in some buffets, but this is a case of where quality definitely trumps quantity. The food was delicious (maybe I'm biased because hunger was impairing my judgment), and I love how they had veggie alternatives to a lot of their meat options. The hummus was great, not too sour or bitter. The cold grilled vegetables? Om, nom nom! The servers were polite, even when some big rude old man river kept interrupting mine while she was trying to take down my order for tea.

If you're famished after the 3.5 hour flight to the East Coast, I would definitely recommend this place :D"}
{"text":"customer service?  Here?  If its a slow night dont count on fresh food.  Look in the window, see if the place is full, if not, then leave and go across the street."}
{"text":"Buffet that is really not so big, and not SO fat, but it's a great spot for lunch!

Cost: about $15 after taxes/tip for lunch. I've never been for dinner.

It's Greek food, so it's relatively not so fat, but that's a good thing. At any rate, you'll eat enough that you'll become fat I suppose, because the food is pretty good. 

The food is generally all really good, the skewers (not marinated, but you can always add taziki and/or hotsauce), fries (sweet potato fries as well, which are goooooood), calamari, and grilled veggies (I love grilled veggies) are all pretty good, made fresh in the open kitchen. 

Regarding the skewers and beef, honestly, some days are better than others. They cook them all in the open kitchen, some batches might be drier than others, but they're all freshly made.

Stuffed tomatoes, eggplant and a variety of stewed beefs round out the entrées, but I generally stick to the stuff I mentioned above.

For dessert, you have bhaklava, almond shortbread cookies, chocolate chip cookies, a variety of cakes (apple, coffee, chocolate, etc. etc.) and other carb heavy desserts, plus ice cream, all of which WILL make you fat. 

Here's a listing of their food if you're interested. While not Mandarin big, it's a decent size:

Dishes:  I'd say they have about... oh... 20 dishes.. chicken and pork skewers, some beef patty type things, spinach and cheese spanakopitas, french fries, sweet potato fries, calmari, roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, roasted mushrooms, stuffed tomatoes, some saucy eggplant dishes, stewed beef, stewed chicken, some kind of lasagna looking eggplant dish, rice, steamed veggies, 2 soups, I'm sure I'm missing a few, but that's the majority of it.

Salad bar: fruits, salads (potato, seafood, garden, Greek (obviously), and spreads

Desserts: mentioned above"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Greek Buffet. There was Greek food, a vegetable and fruit bar, and desserts. The servers were good at refilling our drinks."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much in terms of quality of food and service as this is a buffet restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised! I came here because I had a craving for affordable moussaka below two digits pricing and a place that has a dine-in option.  When my search turned out to be largely unfruitful, I decided to give this buffet a try, despite the horrible reviews I've read.  However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!  Although the food selection is limited, the quality of the food was mostly great.  The moussaka itself lacked meat and eggplant, but the béchamel sauce was home-made and delicious.  The greek burger was juicy and spiced just right, along with the meatballs.  The hummus, tatziki and taramosalata was superb, and again, I believe they are home-made.  However, the souvlaki was dry and wasn't tasty, but overall, I did enjoy the majority food as it tasted home-made.  The taramosalata is a must try.  The price of $19.95 for dinner is an easy price to swallow, given that most buffets now charge around $25.00 per head."}
{"text":"We like going here every few weeks. The food is good and home cooked and there is a good variety and it TASTES GREAT! The price is reasonable for a buffet. Never had a bad visit here! It is a great place to have a family event too. We have now done 3 of them and they are so nice and put us all (tables full) in our own area."}
{"text":"First time here, staff very friendly, the salad bar has goat cheese really good!
Not sure about the hummus and the grape leaves also, they were so spicy.
The hot stuff, man! You can tell when it's home made! The beef stew awesome!!!"}
{"text":"It's clear from the reviews and our experience that BFGB is schizophrenic and unfortunately we happened to first (and last) try it tonight when its evil, cold, stale, and unpalatable personality was showing.

Walking in, we first had misgivings due the weathered and aged decor: beer-hall type seating, cavernous interior, banquettes with split padding, old and beaten paint... you get the point... but.. we'd read the reviews and a friend of ours recommended the place so we went boldly forward.  

Note to self: largely empty buffet restaurant probably never implies a good experience or fresh food... we both had this warning bell going off, but again, silence it and tried to give the place a fair shake.

The salad bar was ok... acceptable but not stellar and gave us hope.

The into the entres.. uh oh... the \"steam tables\" were keeping the food \"warm\", certainly not \"hot\".  The food on the \"grill section\" was just _barely_ above room temperature.  After the 1st tasting we nearly pulled the chain and left, but neither of us was crazy hungry and we were there, so we bravely went on.

There were serving plates on the \"hot\" tables that were empty and looked like they'd been that way for a while.  The single person from the kitchen was out in the dining room having a beer, so this probably wasn't getting fixed any time soon.  We gave up on entrees and decided to go for dessert.

The baclava was the type you buy in a grocery store (read: cheap and  unappealing), most of the \"cakes\" were in need of replacement (picked over, smushed and unappealing), there were huge parts of the dessert bar that weren't stocked (perhaps a total of 6 desserts excluding icecream).  The best part of the entire meal was the crap barely-frozen Chapman's ice cream (4 flavours) that was available.

I've been to quite a few buffets and can pretty honestly say this was the ABSOLUTE WORST buffet experience of my life.  We went there for my birthday, so my \"meal\" was free but the $25 we paid for Kim's meal (including tax and tip) really seemed like far too much for the quality of the food served.  

Will NOT buy again. OMG. Total EPIC FAIL."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Remembrance day with a group.  Not my choice and I just can't associate Greek with buffet.

Pros- ummmmm.....

Cons-
Service- although our server was fairly attentive, I would have to say she would have to be as there was only 3 groups in the entire restaurant during the lunch \"rush\".  We were in the middle of lunch when she started counting the number of guests.  She was counting, I can only assume are jackets on the chairs.  Anyway, she counted 17.  My father-in-law recounted and found 16 including a baby.  She came back and he told her our recount.  she then recounts again walking around us.  She asks me if anyone was sitting on the chairs at the end which there wasn't as it was my baby's jacket hung on that chair.  He was sitting on a high chair.  She says \"oh ok.\"  Well, two minutes later another lady, who I can only assume is the manager, arrives and once again starts counting, again asks if anyone is sitting at the chair my baby's jacket in hanging on.  Alright, unless she simply doesn't trust that her server can count or hear for that matter, it would be justified when I say I was offended for all of us.  There was probably about 40 people in a 250 capacity restaurant and 16 of that are us, at any point would we be able to rip you off?  It was just done in poor taste.
Food- I mean it was filled with carbs.  Beans (2types), 2 types of rice, 2 types of pasta about 3 different types of vegetables.  funny, 1 said stuffed tomatoes except it was stuffed by  tomatoes.  so basically, it was just tomatoes.  the Souvlaki are grilled a little at a time so you have to wait.  The calamari, I think he would fry about 20 tiny pieces at a time so either stand there and wait or be prepared not to get any at all.  he even only grills 1 pita at a time.  essentially, you're pretty much stuffed within your first plate because it's generally mostly carbs.  and since you're so hungry from waiting, you end up stuffing yourself with side dishes. I guess that's the trick.

I would recommend to just avoid it altogether and go to a regular Greek restaurant order Ala carte. it'll probably be cheaper in the long run and the quality would be much better and you'll be just as stuffed."}
{"text":"As with most buffets (Mandarin being a possible exception) My Big Fat Greek Buffet is about quantity over quality. Not to say that anything is bad. It's not. But almost any item ordered elsewhere on its own would almost certainly be better.

That said, there are a number of Greek favorites including moussaka (probably their best item), stuffed peppers, and souvlaki (though small, often dry, and sometimes unavailable without a little bit of a wait).

Accepting things for what they are though, if you're in the mood for a variety of Greek food, My Big Fat Greek Buffet will hit the mark."}
{"text":"Other than the odd times at Mr Greek type places, I am not too familiar with Greek Food, but have always been curious about this place.  Went for a Saturday lunch with family.  It was not busy when we got there at first.  With a stroller, we were seated in the room right by the door.  I found it a bit odd because you have to go up a few steps and the lower area was empty. 

The cost is pretty good, but at the same time, selection was minimal. I had looked at the menu items in the past and felt there was not that many options, and I was right. Pretty sure there is less selection here than Mandarin. Service was good, 2 waitresses and maybe the manager/owner, were all friendly.  Had to ask for refills, which is always a item on my list. Especially at a buffet, I would expect them to offer more frequently.  Food was ok I guess, but found the chicken a bit dry.  

If I was looking for something different ever once in a while, I would be open to coming back to try again, but not my first choice.  At the same time, I think I would also be satisfied eating at a Mr Greek or something similar."}
{"text":"I would give zero star if there is an option.
1. The attitude from the manager (owner) is horrible.  She clearly doesn't understand what the customer service is about and she doesn't know how to treat customer with respect. 

If that's the attitude i am getting, there is no way I am going to pay regardless the food quality, selection, or price for the buffet. 

I would Not recommend this restaurant to you. 

If you like, you can go to other places and get free buffet on your birthday with great service and respect. 

Mandarin: excellent customer service.
Imperial buffet: crab legs with good service."}
{"text":"Not caring enough of elderly clients.

We ate at the restaurant with a group of people, for my grandmother's 98th birthday. She is almost blind and almost deaf and sat in a wheelchair. We all ordered the buffet. My grandma only ate one plate, and she had to ask to have it blended in a blender because she is too old to eat regular food. When it came time to pay the bill I inquired about getting the birthday meal free for my grandma because they offer a birthday promotion: free meal on your birthday. The waitress asked for ID to my almost blind and deaf 98 year old grandma in a wheelchair and who just ate her one dish meal that was blended up into a soup. This might have been her final birthday meal EVER in her life. How rude! Her actual birthday was the day before, so the waitress needed to ask permission from her boss. And her boss refused to give us her meal for free. Under the circumstances I feel we could offer the old lady a free meal.
We will never return to this insensitive restaurant. I am not pleased with the manager on duty that day. 

The food was very greasy."}
{"text":"Oh dear, where to start? Went on a Saturday afternoon for a relative's birthday, so he ate free while myself and another person paid. For starters, the dinner menu is basically no different than the lunch one, but they charge you $4-$6 more depending on the day. 

Decor is plain, and selection is not all that great for a buffet. Salad bar with a rubbery seafood salad, dry grilled items, and most of the items are bland/not cooked well. Dessert is again limited (1 nut-free item if you're wondering), and the only worthwhile menu item is the spinach/cheese pie. 

2 stars because of a friendly waitress, but I've had better food at Jimmy the Greek."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. Its affordable, yummy and cozy. Yes, they may not have as many options as mandarin but in my opinion is passable. My favorite is the moussaka and the chicken souvlaki (which is soft and good). Ice cream is the best too."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meet gathering. Seeing this place from driving along Eglinton, I was always curious how this restaurant food tasted like. So today was a good day to test it out. A buffet style Greek food why not, my expectations were high.

My first impression was this place was busy, with lots of  businesses surrounding this area it was at a prime location. The restaurant was clean and had a nice rustic feel. They were quick with our drinks and clearing the plates.

In terms of food, it didn't meet my standards of yum factor. It's unfortunate, since the place looked so good. The food choice was minimal and the basic ( rice, potato, stuffed pepper, chicken stew, eggplant, beef, chicken and calamari) not mandarin choices so I was hoping the taste will exceed the mandarin flavour. The food has potential of being great but missing a flavour ingredient that will retain customers.

Unfortunately, for myself I won't be coming here until the next business meet. Hopefully by then, the food would be perfected and served with extra love."}
{"text":"I love this place and make sure to go there for any occasion I can. They are very reasonably priced for a buffet of that quality ($20). The variety isn't anything crazy but I love the assortment of veggies and meats and the desserts are great too! 

If you haven't tried Mytho's beer, I highly recommend it! It's a lighter beer and it is so yummy!"}
{"text":"My work took us here for our Christmas dinner on a friday night and i have to say i liked it, i love greek food. Theres not much variety of food i will admit but what they do have is fresh and tasty. The prices are a little lesser priced compared to mandarin but still around the same. They vary from chicken/pork souvlaki, stuffed tomatoes, different types of rice & roasted potatoes, fried calamari and so on. For dessert they have a small variety of ice cream, different types of cakes, and some limited fruit. What i was dissapointed was the salad/fresh food bar was very small and limited, iv always known greek food to be big in salads and more fresh/raw food. 

The customer service was limited as well, it was hard to get the waitress' attention at times, go figure since it wasnt really busy. This is a good place to come with your family/large groups of ppl because the food is tasty, and it just gives off that family vibe. Its not bad and its not too great either but its a good try."}
{"text":"A small buffet selection. But if its authenticity you're looking for this is the place! Just like the Greek grand mother you never had used to make! From a robust salad bar to the the freshest grilled Souvlaki and don't forget the calamari...yum! If your a Greek food lover then you won't mind getting fat at My Big Fat Greek Buffet!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times.  Nothing hasn't really change they sre pretty over price for the low selection of food.  If you have a hankering for all you can eat tzaziki sauce and souvlaki hit this place asap to get your fill.

Worth hitting this place up one time"}
