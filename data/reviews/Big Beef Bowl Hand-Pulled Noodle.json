{"text":"Found myself another soup spot. The small size is more than enough for anyone unless you're stature is similar to Shaq's.  The meat, noodle, and soup ratio is just right. It seems consistent as i creeped at other ppls bowls. Don't judge.  I suggest to get the regular size flat noodle.  I keeps it's al dentenest all the way through your meal. My hot date had the thin flat noodles.  it was good at first but then got sticky and soft.  Not the way to go if you want to get laid, however, the overall flavour and experience was enough to get me to homebase. Hand pulled noodles is the only way to go. Price is just right to afford a second date. ; )"}
{"text":"\"OK\" food, passable, very simple.

Was Expecting freshly hand made noodles, but it was not.

Everything was extra, prices were reasonable. 

Taste... same as If I cooked at home, buying the same simple ingredients from the supermarket. 

That means there's no Chef flavour, it's not special, not memorable, very plain.

Not enough meat. It does not live up to the name of the restaurant.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Amazing hand pulled noodles! Got braised beef with flat thin noodles and the small size was enough to satisfy! Good portions and good amount of meat for the price point of $7.99. I only wished the soup base was more spicy, but they give a bottle of hot chilli oil on each table. Next time I would get flat regular noodles because the thin ones got soft sitting in the soup. Service was good, place seemed clean. Highly recommend this noodle joint and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here cause I love the North York location. The owner is very friendly and welcoming even though we came in at closing time. He never rushed us. The noodles we're just as good as the other location and there's more seating here. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I've gone to this spot a few times and I really like their chewy noodles. However the last visit gave me major food poisoning that I almost had to go to the ER. 100% certain it was from the meat sauce noodles I had for dinner as it was my last meal before almost dying. There were also a ton of fruit flies in the restaurant, and this was in December, which should've been a sign. Don't think I'll go back ever again. Beware."}
{"text":"Went to other location in North York but this location has the lamb noodles that the one in Yonge street doesn't have, which is now my new personal favourite.

The best part of this restaurant is their tofu dessert pudding that I don't know why is not on the menu. Best tofu fa dessert I've tried in Toronto, most similar authentic flavour and texture as the ones in China."}
{"text":"Just tried Big Beef Bowl for the first time and was really impressed! The food and service was excellent. I especially enjoyed the variety of skewers and the Classic Beef Noodles with the thin round noodles. The bench chairs were a bit unstable so be careful sitting down. Overall it was a great meal and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Big Beef Bowl since it opened at Yonge & Finch. Now that it has opened up in Markham, i no longer have to trek all the way out to get some delicious noodles. This place has some of the best hand pulled noodles I have ever had. 

One of my friends knows the chef and went to China with him to learn the art of hand pulled noodles. 

Compared to the North York location, this location is spacious. 

The food is the exact same - delicious. I always get the classic and my boyfriend gets the beef with pickled mustard and shiitake mushrooms. For sides, I always get the pork belly and my boyfriend gets the cumin lamb. 

The broth is almost similar to the broth of pho but it's a lot lighter. You also get a choice of six different noodles:
- round thin
- round regular
- round thick
- flat thin
- flat regular (personal favourite)
- flat thick

The chili oil on the table compliments the noodles perfectly.

The food is delicious and service is great. I would highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! I normally go the first location at Byng. However when I found out about this location, I wanted to check it out.
1. Love that this place is bigger and with more seating. Still kept the same type of decor... reminiscent of old Chinese restaurant. I found the chairs very different...the owners shared that they built each chair and table top by hand.
2. Quality of the hand-pulled noodles and soup is the same as the Byng location...still pipping hot and yummy...you get A LOT of noodles. I always order the pickled mustard and braised beef with triangle noodles.
3. Love that they have added some additional new appetizers (spicy pig's ears and spicy tripe with beef). I always order the grilled eggplant (need my veggies!). I was there last  week and they had freshly made tofu pudding! One of my favorites! It was a nice cool dessert after a hot bowl of soup!

I will definitely be coming here again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Just came back from Lanzhou china and was craving some noodles.  Tried a few noodle shops around Toronto but it just wasn't right.  Then I came to Big Beef Bowl. The taste was spot on.  It's like I am back in Lanzhou again.  

I ordered the large classic regular round noodle ( a order of big beef bowl if you were from Lanzhou and the namesake of the restaurant).  Again, the only word I can say is amazing.  Soup was spot on and the noodles were cooked to perfection

If you want authentic Lanzhou style noodle, Big Beef Bowl is the one, there is no other.  

I will be coming here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Delicious! I tried the medium thick noodles with meat sauce. It was like an Asian style pappardelle Bolognese! Really satisfying. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Overall Impression: 4.0 stars for a consistent quality service and meal on several occasions. 

Food:
I've tried beef brisket as well as the lamb noodles now. I've tried the thick flat noodles and thick round noodles. Beef brisket is flavourful and very tender. There's different kinds of beef brisket in the bowl so the consistency of the meat varies between pieces. Overall quite good. The broth is delicious and with more chilli oil, it really gives a good taste.

It's a bit of a goldilocks approach to find a noodle thickness and type that is just right. The thick flat noodles are handmade and have different consistency, texture and thickness (width is about the same). This means some parts of the noodle are chewier whereas other parts are thinner. I personally wasn't a fan of having to chew so much. I know this is part of the experience, so I don't think of this as a negative. Just pick a better noodle suited to your taste :) So I came back and ordered the thick round noodles. It was a bit better in terms of chewiness. I'm going to come back and try the medium to thin noodles.

Parking:
I come to this plaza all the time. It's a hectic parking lot when it's busy, so just be patient. I usually park farther at the other lots and walk over cause it's easier that way. 

Service:
Friendly guy out front who I saw multiple times. Never had an issue with service. They fill your glass of water without you asking. The atmosphere is reasonable. It's got a decent amount of seating and I think it's cause it's a new place, I never had to wait for a seat and got served right away. Food comes out reasonably speedy as well."}
{"text":"The soup base is very good here and the noodle has a very nice bit to it. The menu is simple but you have different type of noodle to pick from. I like the very fine one and the wide one. They both taste good. The services is alway friendly. I enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"Large Classic Beef Noodle(with round thick noodles):

The soup was flavourful, almost like they added msg in it. The round thick noodles however, feels undercooked. The outside of the noodle was soft, and then the middle was just very hard to chew on. They don't actually give that much beef to you for a large noodle, they just gave me like 5 small pieces. Overall, the soup is 8/10, the round thick noodles were 1/10, and the beef was 5/10 (too little and small). 

Meat Sauce Noodle(with round regular noodles): 

The meat sauce itself was actually pretty good, it wasn't heavily seasoned and just seasono well enough for you to enjoy with your noodles. But the noodles (round regular) just tasted blend, there were no taste of the noodle if you don't eat it with the meat in the meat sauce. But still, the round regular is better than the round thick noodles. Overall, 7/10.

Lamb Skewers:

This is where I was surprised by the portion size of the lamp skewer. For 3.99, you get 2 small sticks of lamb on a stick. And comparing to other chinese resturants that serves lamb skewer, this place is just a total rip off. The lamb was dry, but the smell of cumin really smells good. And then the lamb itself didn't really have much flavour to it, I needed to all more salt on it by myself. 3/10

Service: 

Well, just a regular chinese resturant. It is what you expected. Not bad, but not excellent.

Overall: 
I rate this place a 5/10. 
Will I come again? No. 

Was the noodle good? Sure, just dont get the round thick since they don't seem to know how long you need to cook it. 

Compared to other chinese noodle restaurant, this one isn't bad, but it is definitely not a good one.

Edit: 
Firstly, to the reply I've gotten from the store owner, it seems like they don't understand the difference between chewy and HARD to chew on. I understand the thick noodles are suppose to be chewy. But the noodle I've gotten on that day was HARD to chew on. It was so \"chewy\" to a point where my jaw started to hurt. It was literally chewing on rubber. 

Secondly, I understand the noodles aren't suppose to taste flavourful and that's not what I meant. As the meat sauce noodle photo I've posted shows the noodle was covered with sauce. The liquid of the \"meat sauce\" tastes like water, only the meat of the \"meat sauce\" was seasoned. The sauce of the \"meat sauce\" was just simply coloured water. Which if you eat it without meat, it just tastes like nothing.

And lastly, for a matter of fact, I don't even think you guys freshly pull your noodles. You guys just stored pulled noodles in the refrigerator and that's probably why the thick noodle's texture is just like refrigerated rubber. Like man, really, I know a store located on the second floor of pacific mall and 2 stores at FMP and more on highway 7 that actually pulls their noodle freshly since you can always hear the sound of noodles being bang on the tabletop. 

The food quality and portion size here doesn't even deserved a 2 star. And I even made an account on Yelp just to write this review to help you guys to improve your noodles better. The lamb on the lamb skewer's is even smaller then the size of a 10 year olds fingernail. But I do apperciate that the owner took his/her time and respond to this review.

In the end, I just want to say why would you question a customer's review and you basically assumed the customer has never eaten lanzhou style hand pull noodles before? Hope your store shuts down soon with this kind of food service and quality. 

Tl;dr: It is fairly cheap here with $8.99 for a large bowl of noodle. Worth a try, but just don't order round thick noodle since (i think) the dont freshly hand pull their noodles. They just store pre-pulled noodles in the refrigerator. Oh, more importantly, after eating here don't write a review that has less than 3 star or else the owner will question your ability of tasting food and test you on the history of the noodles that they are making."}
{"text":"This place is quite small so it does become busy during peak times and you may need to wait a bit for a seat. The portions of the size of the bowl and the noodles are quite large for their small and large sizes. The only downside is that the portion of meat and other contents that come with the noodles are quite small. 

I ordered the beef with preserved vegetables with shiitake mushrooms. I love the flavour and taste however there was only a few pieces of beef and I had one sliver of a mushroom. Overall, I was still full in the end because there was a lot of noodles. 

I would still come back here because the flavour and the noodles are great."}
{"text":"Braised brisket with round thick noodles: 
- brisket was dry. The pieces were cut too small before the braising so I suspect the meat was already dried out prior
- ordered the large size but there wasn't a proportionate amount of meat
- the noodles were very irregular shaped causing some to be nicely cooked and some to be under cooked
- the soup lacked depth. They need to simmer the soup with a lot more bones because it was lacking that good gelatinous mouth feel and beefy taste

Meat sauce with round thick noodles:
- the mince was under seasoned. 

Lamb skewers:
- good. Nicely cooked. Tender
- well seasoned 

Pork belly:
- tender and nicely seasoned 

Egg plant:
- the flesh was very delicious but the skin was not good. Very hard and tough."}
{"text":"Completely overrated. Ordered flat noodle with meat sauce and lamb skewers. 

Noodles were not consistently cooked - parts of it was al dente and parts were soggy. Sauce was salty without much other flavour.

Lamb was from off cuts that were mostly tough and chewy. Seasoning was mostly salty again.

Service was very good though.

Better options out there in Markham."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated on Yelp. The noodles are bland. The meat quality is low (mostly fat) and they gave very little meat...Overall it's not worth the money. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl specializes in one of my favourite types of food, hand-pulled soup noodles! 

I loved everything about the braised beef brisket (paired with daikon radish), with regular flat noodles. The beef was tender, broth was rich in flavour with a slight kick of heat (looks spicier than it tastes), and noodles were fresh and al dante. Very generous portions of both beef and noodles. 

My bf ordered meat sauce, with thick flat noodles. Nothing too special about it. What stood out was that it was very saucy, just the way we like it. 

To share, we ordered a side of corn with cheese. Unfortunately, it wasn't hot enough, so the cheese did not melt on the corn. 

On our second visit, I ordered beef with pickled mustard and Shitake mushrooms, and flat thick noodles. I left disappointed - topped with a mountain of parsley (which I hate), stingy on the mushroom (found only one tiny slice), beef was too lean and bland, texture of noodles were good but too thick, therefore too hard to pick up. I do have to say, the broth was delicious!

Few things to note:
- Service is good and food came fast. Staff are able to communicate in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. 

- Plenty of parking spots available in the plaza, but it quickly fills up during dinner rush. 

- Closed Wednesdays. Cash/debit only 

Because of my mixed experience, I'd rate Big Beef Bowl 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 2.5/5

Food: As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the menu is small but similar to other noodle place. The thin noodles are pretty good and the soup base is flavourful. The soup is a bit runny which i would expect to be a bit thicker. Considering how runny it is, i would expect that it would be authentic but the MSG made it very thirsty after the meal. The skewers is rather small compare to similar places. Although 1 lamb skewer gives you 2 sticks, but the meat is so small and 4$ didnt seem seem like its worth it. The overall flavour is good.

Service: The service is quite proactive and the servers are on top of things such as providing napkins before even asking. Kudos.

Atmosphere: Its not the environment that caused the poor rating but the furniture that im dinning on. The chair is simply uncomfortable to sit on, its a narrow 3\"x10\" wood give or take and lying about being a medium size male, the sitting surface is not all there, lets just leave it there. Another thing is that the chair is rather high which i have to constantly bend my back to eat the noodles. Of course you do not have to bend your back, but as a avg. 5'7\" male, i would need to drag the noodle off the bowl at least 1 ft to my mouth. That is something i do not want to do with the chance of noodles slipping slamming into the hot broth. Another thing is the table edges, its rather sharp and resting your arms on it will leave a deep mark just 3 min in. if the tactic is to make the diners feel uncomfortable and create quicker turnover, it is definitely doing its job. I'd rather be given a stool, at least it will provide more surface area and the proper height. 

If store owner is reading, please take this suggesting and consider redoing the chairs. 

The important questions: Will i come back??????
I would probably say, if im in the area and craving for noodles, i may drop by but i will not purposely drive to this restaurant for it. there are a few other similar noodle places that are probably a bit better and offer more variety  of food and most importantly, i can enjoy the meal on a comfortable chair."}
{"text":"The place is quite busy with capacity fits 40-50 people. A little bit crowded but overall bright and comfortable. Their stools seem to be custom made from wood planks. Hubby sat on the outside of the table and made a remark on it. I personally  preferred my cushioned seat from the bench on the side against the wall. 
Food wise, I got their classic beef with flat noodles and hubby got the meat sauce with thin noodles. Soup base is not too salty yet flavorful. The noodles have a nice hand pulled texture and beef/ reddish thinly slice to my liking. Good quantity on noodles but shy on meat and reddish. Now when itcomes to their Sang Ji Bao, make sure you get there before 7pm for dinner as it is a limited time dish. Having said that, we arrive a bit past the time. Luckily they were okay to let us order anyway. The right way to eat, don't dive in when they are first served. Caution!! They are really juicy and hot and will burn your mouth if you take a big bite right away. Poke a hole first and taste the soup as it flows out then let it cool a bit for your enjoyment. The deep fried crispy texture of the bottom is delightful!"}
{"text":"Went in on a late Saturday afternoon, the place was packed! 

Service: 
Efficient, friendly staff with good recommendations. 

Food: 
I loved that they had 6 types of noodles to choose from, varying in size, thickness and chewiness!  We ordered the classic beef noodle with round thick noodles and the braised beef with flat thin regular noodles. Both broths were flavorful, good balance of spices and unique in their own way. Personally, I liked the spices in the braised beef noodles more! 

We also ordered the leek dumplings and San Ji bao. Both were very authentic and rich in flavor. 

I definitely recommend the San Ji bao! Perfectly pan fried with a deliciously juicy filling inside! My family loved these so much, we ordered seconds! Unfortunately, we were informed that the San Ji bao chef will be leaving the restaurant next week. The staff said to stay tuned with social media, the chef may move to somewhere on Bayview! 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for some hand pull noodle and bowl customization, this is a decent place to come to. You can choose the size of your bowl, small $7.99 or large $8.99 (they are generous with the noodles) and the type of noodles you want; thin or thick. For me the thick noodles tasted better because it has more texture. You can also add side dishes, more meat, or an egg for extra charge.  

There was about 7 soup bowls options on the menu, personally I would like to see more, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Also the spicy beef side dish was not too spicy as well as the soup that was suppose to be spicy."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. Did not get a chance to visit the OG location in North York, but when it came to Peachtree Centre, I knew they were doing something good.

The place is clean, with cool light fixtures, and modern vibe. I am not a fan of the slim wooden bench chairs, and prefer to sit in the booth.

I came twice in a week, and ordered the same bowl: Brisket with medium round noodles.

The broth is flavourful and complex, the noodles are perfectly bouncy and al dente, and the brisket melts in your mouth. The fatty parts are just OK, but order extra meat! Its worth it:)

Portions are big. I am 200lbs and a small does the job.

CASH ONLY, SOFT OPENING OFFERS 15% DISCOUNT."}
{"text":"I've had hand-pulled noodles at various  restaurants but either the noodles or the soup doesn't taste right. Big Beef has the perfect combination of both.

The thin noodles are AMAZING. They're so thin yet so chewy and not too soft. I prefer the thin noodles over the thick as they are easier to eat and also have more taste (more surface area to soak up the soup). The soup has a strong beef flavour, not much MSG. 

Chicken hearts were super duper good. Not a lot of places serve this dish.

I've never had dumplings with such tasty filling at a restaurant. I often find the meat too fatty. The dumpling wrapping is also not too thick and very chewy.

I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I love their hand pulled noodles! The first time I tried then was in North York. Their restaurant was so tiny there that we sat at a small table on the side walk lol. Obviously when I heard they opened a location in Markham I had to eat there. I ordered the Braised Beef Brisket Flat Noodle small bowl for $7.99 and added a small order of chicken wings for $2.99. The noodles are super tasty and full of flavours. The beef was meaty and savoury, not too much tendon. They have 6 different types of noodle styles. If you come here you have to like beef as the title suggests lol.

I prefer this location much better! There's free parking and 3 times the amount of space for seating. I would definitely recommend everyone to come try this place. It's located next to Moji facing Kennedy. I know sometimes the plaza can get confusing since there's so many different restaurants here!

The only down fall is the chairs here are like small benches. they are a big too high for the table...."}
{"text":"Was a bit underwhelmed as I was expecting more based on the high Yelp reviews.

Came on a weeknight - the restaurant was busy but not packed. I like the minimalist decoration and the Bruce Lee  signs. The menu is simple - there are a few select noodle broths and toppings, and you choose the noodle type and thickness.

Ordered:
Braised Beef noodle - small with flat thin noodles
Original beef noodle - small with regular round noodles
Cold spiced chicken
Lamb skewers.

Noodles: regular round had a nice bite to it, the flat thin is a bit overcooked so it wasn't chewy. A little disappointed.

Portion: Good amount of noodles for the size, plenty of broth

Broth: clear beef broth, not too bad, served hot

Meat: original beef had only a few slices. Braised beef has a few more chunks. Can be more generous with meat

Cold spiced chicken: disappointed. The sauce looked spicy, but the chicken is bony, lacks texture, not flavoured throughout, and the sauce had pieces of szechuan peppercorn that I had to spit out. Not worth the  price

Lamb skewer: comes in 2 skewers, 4 nuggets each. Kind of small for the price, but it is seasoned well, but not too spicy or salty.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. I've had better beef noodle elsewhere."}
{"text":"I stumbled at this beef noodle bowl restaurant when I was looking for some delicious food to satisfy my tummy. When the waiter took my order, I originally ordered the thick flat noodles. The waiter asked if it was my first time there and if it was, he suggested that I order the regular flat noodles or the regular round noodles and adjust my tasting on a future visit. I ordered the Braised Beef Brisket with regular flat noodles.

The noodles are freshly made with a good consistency and not too doughy. Broth was tasty, not too salty and I didn't leave feeling like I wanted to drink a tub of water. The beef brisket was not as tender as I had hoped. There were about 8 half slices of Japanese daikon but I thought it could have had some vegetables just to change up the taste a bit by adding some extra flavour and texture.

Overall, the service was pretty prompt and efficient. Price point was decent ($7.99 for a small, $8.99 for a large bowl). My tummy left feeling satisfied and it didn't break the bank for a decent meal. I would return for a future visit and try the thick flat noodles."}
{"text":"Amazing beef noodle soup! This place is has good seating and their service is excellent. The menu isn't huge and that's a good thing. You are here for the soup noodles. The hand made noodles taste great. Give this place a try. I'm sure you will love it."}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket (???) with thick noodles. The noodles were great but the beef was either fat or too tough. The beef portions were small but then again their small bowl is only $8. I would say that the service was quick. It was quite busy for a Thursday night. Not sure if I would come back again given the food choices in the plaza as the overall impression was just meh."}
{"text":"This is my favourite beef noodle house - the service is quick, the noodles are chewy and cooked well. The broth is delicious. I think my only qualm is more meat but it seems as if everywhere I go they give the same amount of meat. ? Still delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here once before but wasn't sure why I never came back... I tried Big Beef noodles again and regretted not coming back more to satisfy my noodle cravings.

Food 3/5
. We came on Saturday for lunch and ordered the pan-fried dumplings, braised beef noodles, classic beef noodles and spicy beef and tripe appetizer. To start, the dumplings were a nice two to three bite size. They were nice and crispy on the bottom and soft and juicy on the inside. It could've had a little bit more seasoning but if you use a lot of vinegar/soy sauce it won't be a problem for you. I've lately been on a search for the best spicy beef and tripe appetizer and this place sadly disappoints. There was more tripe than beef slices which is fine but the dish lacked flavor though it was in a plate of spicy oil. The flavor wasn't infused into the ingredients and basically just bathed in it. The beef noodles however were definitely a standout. I appreciate when a restaurant allows noodle customization as everyone has different preferences. This time I chose the flat thick but preferred the regular round after trying my friend's. Although the flat thick noodles were firmer in texture, it seemed like more quantity and by the end of the meal they became a bit soggy. The broth was nice and hearty without being too greasy. I particularly loved the thinly sliced radishes that soaked in all the flavors of the soup. 

Service 4/5
The restaurant wasn't too busy at lunch time on Saturday. The server was nice and courteous, always attentive on when we needed waters refilled. I ordered a regular but was given a large and he was nice enough to change the price to honour what I ordered. 

Overall Big Beef is a good place to satisfy noodle cravings. It has various noodle sizes and firmness to suit everyone's taste"}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly rated on blogTO that my sister convinced us to check it out. Unfortunately it was just ok. I really liked the idea of hand pulled noodles, there are 6 styles of noodles you can pick from, ranging from super thin to flat and thick. We ordered the veggie noodle bowl with thin noodles and the spicy beef brisket bowl with thick regular noodles. 

Here are some of my take backs:

1. The thin noodles not so good for a noodle soup because it absorbs all the soup so it becomes really mushy.

2. The veggie broth wasn't terrible but tasted a lot like sesame oil. The spicy beef brisket broth wasn't spicy at all, and honestly tasted like the satay spice you get from Chinese grocery markets. Which reminded me a lot like what my dad used to make as a child. So not very impressed. 

I think for people who didn't grow up eating Chinese noodles made by their parents will find this place good, but for me it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl Is located at Peachtree Plaza on the strip facing Kennedy - an often missed area of the plaza.  Clean, 'vintage' style decor in a place that's always busy.  Seating is borderline uncomfortable - seats are slightly slanted forwards (?) and the tables are very close together.  Edit: I find their seating has improved since my last visit.

Servers are very friendly and recommended some items when they overheard my conversation with my friend.  Menu is somewhat limited - there are a total of 6-7 noodles only, though you can 'customize' with 6 types of noodles.  A few skewers/appetizers which are a much needed addition to your meal because there simply isn't enough meat in your bowl of noodles.  A mere 4 slices of meat with nothing else but soup is a bit disappointing (but you can add extra meat for $3.99).   

However, their San Ji Bao ($6.50 for 4) is quite a surprise.  Usually at dim sum they feel undercooked, but here it's pan fried quite nicely with a satisfying crunch.  Definitely recommend these San Ji Bao's!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here when they started to open. I always ordered their beef brisket round thick noodles soup and just couldnt get enough of it. Its served really boiling hot and thats what i really want and odered their picked cucumbers with black fungus to cool down my tongue. 

I want to give this place 4 stars but cant, i find that everytime i come here i noticed that the meat and noodles are getting less and less, you dont get anymore the value of what you paid for. Ok so labor cost went up as well prices, no problem i understand. But to serve you meat which is either all fats or too touch to chew on is another story. 

Overall, the consistency and quality have not been getting better i hope they soon realize this problem before its too late. Its close to home dont have to drive all the way to First Markham place ot Richmomd Hill to get a decent beef noodle soup. 

Oh btw just to let you kmow, i just came back from my trip from Taiwan and tried their famous beef noodle soup. I even searched high and low and ate at this 3 Micheline star noodle soup house and was dissapointed. We have the best tasting beef noodle soup here in our own backyard unfortunately we don not have the consistency that Taiwan have."}
{"text":"Actually a big bowl!

Food: 5/5 Big bowl of deliciousness.
Service: 4/5 A bit too eager.
Environment: 4/5 nice. 
Washrooms: ?/5 Didn't try. Lol.
Worth it?: 5/5 really good and satisfying.

10% during soft opening. Cash only during soft opening. 

Came here during the soft opening for an early dinner. The dining room was pretty empty at this time with only 2 other tables. The server was overly eager. He must be very excited to be opened. Every time I looked up to ask our group a question he would run over and ask what we were having. Lol.

He brought us tea over and I instantly noticed that the tea cups and spoons were a little dirty still. I guess with there soft opening going on, they are still ironing out some of the kinks. As a seasoned professional dishwasher ( It was my first ever job. Lol) I knew instantly that dishes were racked for too long before going into the washer. I hope they figure it out soon as it's my only complaint with this place.

The food was very delicious. I had the beef brisket noodles and also tried the meat sauce on noodles. Both were labeled as spicy but neither came out as such. This was easily forgiven because the beef brisket was really good. The meat sauce was also pretty good but I would save it for a hotter day. It was allot more fresh and refreshing tasting. 

I will definitely come back after their proper opening. I just hoping they figure out their dishwasher."}
{"text":"I've now tried both Big Beef Bowl locations and the food is pretty consistent. 

I've tried the classic and the braised beef and they are spot on! The hand pulled noodles are freshly made to order and goes well with the broth.

I like the charred smokiness of the eggplant and the corn. My kids love the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for lunch and the place was pretty empty. The server was very very nice and patient and the food came very quickly. 

We ordered a large classic beef with flat thick noodles ($8.99), large beef brisket with flat regular noodles ($8.99), grilled eggplant ($2.99) and spicy beef tripe ($5.99). 

The noodles were delicious, if you like hand pulled noodles, you'll love them here- very chewy and thick. The classic beef came with sliced beef and cooked thinly sliced radish, the soup was lighter with an herby taste to it. The beef brisket was my favourite with well marinated brisket that falls apart when you pick it up. It flavoured the soup really well. I feel like the classic beef would've tasted better with thinner noodles, but the brisket went well with the flat noodles. 

I loved the taste of both the side dishes we ordered (spicy tripe and grilled eggplant). The tripe was very salty but the flavour was great. The eggplant had a smokey flavour with garlic, but the skin was a little too burnt. 

Overall loved this place and would definitely come here when I'm craving hand-pulled noodles!

Note: the large noodles were huge and 3 of us ordered the 2 noodles and 2 side dishes and we were crazy full and still had half a bowl of noodles as leftovers!"}
{"text":"First off, I was very pleased with the small and specialized menu, so my hunger could take charge and make the order it desires. Straight to the point! 

The noodles are very VERY GOOD!!! Nice chew feel, smooth, clean tasting. I loved the round thin noodles,  very slurp-friendly. 

The soup base for the classic beef bowl is nicely flavoured, and not overly salty. I'm so satisfied I'm writing this review while still sitting at the table, so we'll have to wait and see if I get thirsty from MSG intake later on. 

There isn't very much meat or other toppings. Just enough to accompany the noodles but doesn't steal the show, letting the noodles shine. Meat lovers may need to order some side dishes, but noodle lovers like me would be more than happy!

The chilli oil is fragrant and delicious! A must addition to the soup. I think it may be home made.

Very good meal, will be back."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing it on yelp, though I was slightly disappointed. We had the lamb noodles with round thin noodles and the braised beef noodles with round thick noodles. Small ($7.99) was definitely more than enough food for us. Because the thin noodles are so thin, we found it overly soggy/soft, but that's just personal preference. I did like my thick noodles though. I think it goes perfectly with the soup and beef, but it's not the best hand pulled noodles i've had around here. The meat they use is great quality and tasted great, though they weren't as generous with the lamb. The soup here is super light. The braised beef soup does of course have more flavour than the clear soup, but overall both soups didn't have much flavour. This is also personal preference though, I'm sure some people appreciate a lighter base. Service is friendly, but the food came a tad slow. Overall, not a bad bowl of noodles, though I don't think I'd be here too often."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles and sides from just a simple manu. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It's a rare occurrence when my husband would compliment a Chinese noodle bar! This place somehow got us coming back for more! Ordered their chewy flat noodles with beef, spicy tripe and beef, potato strips... All of which were devoured in minutes! Their spicy oil is surprisingly not as spicy as most Chinese spicy oil but extremely tasty. Would totally buy a full jar next time I go!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for dinner and it was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening. We were seated immediately, but found that the restaurant was quite small, with little room to breathe. Service was quick. Food came quick as well. I ordered the spicy round thick noodles with braised beef. I loved the noodles and enjoyed it thoroughly as it had the perfect texture to it. The beef was delicious as well, but came with small portions. The broth was not spicy at all - adding some hot sauce to it didn't make much of a difference either. We also ordered a side of pan fried dumplings and they were okay, nothing special. Would recommend to others to come and try the noodles - but nothing too special or out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"We always drive by this place but never got to try it until this past weekend.
We were craving for some hot soup noodle so we thought we could try this place out.

They have a super simple menu - with about 8 choices of soup noodles, a few options for cold dishes and a few options of skewers.

Once you choose the noodles, you can choose one of the 6 noodle sizes.
For a table of two we ordered:
- 1 Large braised beef brisket with round thick noodles
- 1 pickled cucumber with black fungus dish
- 2 skewers of pork belly

The bowl is HUGE!! The braised beef brisket is very soft (normally it's a hit or miss with it potentially be super chewy), and the broth is very flavorful. The pickled cucumber dish is average just like a regular cold dish. The skewers though !!! Some spices that they put on the skewers made it very tasty, and the pork was not dry at all!!! Make sure you order some pork belly skewers when you are here :).

The place is clean and bright, service is good, price is very good (around $20 something for everything we ordered)
I would say this place is one of my favorite hand pulled noodle spots, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very bad service if you Don't speak mandarin with the servers. They will tell you that the stuff is sold out, yet people coming after you will get what you wanted. Not recommended."}
{"text":"All I can recall from my experience here was spicy, spicy aaaaannnndddd more spicy! I was here with a friend awhile back but boy was I not prepared to be hit with that much spicy in soooo long! I mean I can handle spice but still! The intensity was REAL!

We came here for dinner and at the time we came it was already fairly busy (about 5:30pm/6pm), a good 3/4s of the place was filled. Mind you, their restaurant isn't actually that big so don't expect to be seated quick if it's busy. Luckily we got here just before the dinner rush hour so we were seated and then the crowd started coming.

Service wasn't bad and the waiters were nice. I ended up getting the Beef with Pickled Mustard and Shitake Mushrooms with flat regular noodles while my friend got the Braised Beef Brisket with thin round noodles. I also was craving some spicy cucumbers so got that as well. Now...as you can see from the menu pictures both orders of noodle soups were spicy BUT I KID YOU NOT, mine was WAAAAY spicier than my friend's! Even he said so as well and we BOTH tasted each other's orders! What happened?!?!??! On top of that, I barely got any \"shitake mushrooms\" as indicated in the order...that was a bit disappointing...did they mix up orders? We will never know. In any case, everything else tasted fine and I was craving some spicy food so I managed to finish it WITH my mouth feeling like it was on fire. I'm surprised it didn't swell up like those shows/movies where you get a sausage mouth LOL! 

Aside from that sad part, my overall experience of the place was good. I will probably come back to try their other bowls but I sure hope next time I won't be hit with another CRAZY SPICY noodle soup with missing ingredients..."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite for lunch on Tuesday. We ordered three noodle dishes and one cold appetizer dish. To our surprise, the appetizer took 15 minutes til it got served - we were the only table seated at that time and it's a cold dish, how long does it take ?! Each of our noodle dishes came separately probably 5 minutes after another. Taste and flavour were mediocre. I would come back if I wanted cheap handpulled noodles (and if I wasn't in a rush!)."}
{"text":"I tried its famous beef noodle with beef brisket.

Meat were well done! Soft and not dry!
Noodle, I ordered flat thick. The thickest noodle they offer. It's good but some part it's too thick and some are thin. So not very even.

Overall enjoyed the noodle.

It has a seasonal menu changes every 3 month. Previous shengjianbao were very good, but they just changed menu. No luck for me."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????6????????????????????
??????????????????"}
{"text":"I had high hopes and from all the reviews here i was sure this was it.  We came here for a friday evening and started with tripe n beef, lamb kebobs, and chicken hearts.  Almost everyone ordered braised beef with various noodles. 

Noodles are meant to be freshly made, but they were atleast a day old - still better than packaged noodles.  Broth was where my issue was, it had no depth of usual beef soup flavour, it tasted like they used possibly a proper broth filled it halfway and then filled it up with salted water.  Broth also was exceptionally laced with msg. 
 
Meat was not in abundance i got 2 pieces of meat, they were large but fatty and not what the photos show.  I also had one leaf of bok choi.  

The tripe was pretty decent and the chilli oil had a good balance of szechuan peppercorn. 

Lamb skewers were decent, i asked for extra spicy but they were blandish.  

Overall i give it a 5.5-6 out of 10.  

Taiwanese beef noodle place around the corner is a lot better - we need a good beef noodle spot here that can do actual spicy flavourful broth."}
{"text":"Rating - 4.0/5.0

Recently opened their second location right beside Moji at Peachtree Centre Plaza, this noodle soup joint serves up Lanzhou style hand pulled beef noodles as well as skewers and appetizers. 

They have various noodle types to choose from and I went with the regular flat noodles. The soup base was on the peppery side rather than savoury. Personally prefer a more savoury soup base but perhaps this is how it is traditionally. 

The noodles were perfectly al dente and the beef brisket was super tender. In terms of spice level, I would say it is fairly mild. 

Overall it was a decent bowl of noodles - simple ingredients done right. Service was also friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Noodle was good but it was so hot today I couldn't enjoy it since they don't turn on the a/c.  Imagine a stuffy and hot noodle shop. 

Update:
They got A/C now after visiting a second time. Braised beef is so good. Lamb skewer is comparable to other places, except they give u 2 skewers. And I found they had less of the fat and more meat. Some places, that I won't name, serve too much of the fat and u end up not eating a lot of because it's just chewy fat. 

Kudos to owner for addressing my concerns before. Probably the best braised beef noodles in town."}
{"text":"New noodle joint that recent opened. Portion size are really big. Basically you pick your soup base and pick what types of noodles you want from thin to thick. I believe there is 6 different noodle types. I got a small beef noodle which was fairly big in my opinion. Came with only 4 piece of beef which is kind sad but beef was really tender. Not much toppings in the noodles basically some green onions and few paper thin white radish slice. They also server some grill item, got the grilled pork belly which was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon with my sister, it got pretty busy shortly after we were seated .  I love food so I ordered all the BBQ items, a spicy tripe with beef side dish and two noodles.  The spicy tripe with beef was flavourful with just enough spice and not too overpowering. I ordered the beef with pickled mustard and shiitake mushroom with the flat thick noodle. The small bowl was ginormous! I couldn't eat all the noodles , it had a fair amount of meat and the broth was so good I drank all the broth and I didnt feel thirsty after.  The flat thick noodle had a pretty chewy texture and I loved it but I think it's not for everyones liking. My sister had the braised beef brisket with the round regular noodle, next time I'll have to try it myself. And the last but not least BBQ items my favorite was the grilled pork belly! It had a slight sweet taste to it maybe a light teriyaki sauce? 
5 stars for my overall experience I would definitely come back again and try everything else."}
{"text":"Popped into this place since it just opened in the neighborhood! They are currently offering 10% off for their soft opening but it's cash only. BRING CASH! 

Overall the staff was friendly and the food was good. The atmosphere was quite quiet but I imagine it would be busier around dinner time than 5:00 PM. Service was fast -- we ordered and the food came out 10 minutes later. 

With 7 choices of noodles, it was definitely hard to choose we but went for round regular noodles for the braised beef and thick round noodles for the meet sauce noodles. 

I definitely preferred the braised beef noodle and wish the broth was a littler hotter as it came out lukewarm but flavour-wise, it was super yummy. It could have been spicier but nothing a little chili oil couldn't change. The meat sauce noodle was good but I think a thinner noodle would have been better. The noodle was cooked al dente and was nice and chewy. 

Next time, I would either get he Beef braise noodles or try the lamb noodles. Staff and food deserve thumbs up here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place amazing food and friendly staff. Couldn't decided on what to order so will be trying everything one day at a time"}
{"text":"If you are craving a big bowl of beef soup noodles this is the place to go.  They have a somewhat limited menu but they allow you to choose what kind of noodles (round or flat) and the level of firmness you want which I think is a nice touch.  I got the braised beef noodle soup and it was really good.  I'm a pretty big eater and the small size was more than enough.  The large is fairly big and has a ton of noodles in it.  It would probably be enough to share b/w two people if you're not super hungry.  Service was quick and friendly.  Parking however was a bit of a nightmare on a Saturday afternoon.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this is a 4 stars restaurant.  I went there for dinner.  My husband and I ordered two bowls of noodles and somehow they managed to get the thickness of noodles on both bowls WRONG!  When we asked them about the error, they didn't really want to change it for us and want us to take the wrong order.  So my husband ended up have his corrected and I am stucked with super thick noodles that I hate.  =(   Very disappointed.  
Other than the fact with the order errors, I found their noodles and tastes are just average, decor is average, I don't know what's the hype! 
Will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered a small and couldnt finish it. I love the ability to choose the type of noodle you want. Ordered the braised beef brisket.. wasnt as spicy as I expected it to be. Noodles were plentiful and soup was tasty!"}
{"text":"Finally tried out this location after having been to the north york location several times. And there's definitely a few differences.

This place is much larger, which means more a lot more seats available. There's at least seating for 60 (compared to maybe a dozen), but it still gets packed. The menu is also a bit larger, offering some additional bowls and apps that aren't available at the other location. Tables are packed together tightly however, and moving around proves to be difficult. I guess no matter how large the space is, things will still be tight as they try to optimize the number of customers they can seat. There's only two people taking orders and serving food, so expected limited service.

They also have a portrait of bruce lee holding three skewers of meat.

I ordered a large lamb noodle soup, since it is only offered at this location. They also have the option for a whole bowl of pork intestine. Can't beat markham when it comes to innards.

The bowl came within 10 minutes, but I still got mine before the table beside me, and they had ordered before I did.

Size of the bowl is alright. Comes with a good portion of noodles. Not as much meat though, but fortunately it's not mostly bones or anything. There is a strong sesame flavor in the noodles, which they likely mix in when they're making the noodles themselves.

The soup also had a lot of sesame flavor. You can see oil floating around the top. I don't have a particular preference towards sesame oil, but it tasted a bit too strong to me.

The lamb had that subtle gamey flavor, but personally I would have liked stronger lamb.

I've never had much luck with lamb noodle soup for the most part. Maybe the braised beef would be better.

They also take debit."}
{"text":"Cane here today for lunch with some of my friends and had a pleasant experience! The service is friendly and quite efficient. I ordered the Beef with Pickled Mustard and Shittake Mushroom, and there wasn't much mushroom. I also asked for less spicy but they seemed to have given me no spicy. I won't hold it against them since I spoke English and I could tell it wasn't the waiters most comfortable language. The flat noodles were delicious, but sometimes a little chunky. My friend got the round noodles and they seemed to be better. Overall, I had a good meal and the food was great for the price. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Really average, there's a lot of better noodle places than this place. And the skewers are pretty bad"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Markham to get beef bowl soup (not Vietnamese style of course). The alternative for this restaurant used to be Magic Noodle for me and I got sick of the high amounts of MSG they were putting in their broth.

To be honest this place is not that much better in terms of sodium levels. I still feel super thirsty after eating a bowl of soup here but the taste is SO much better. The broth is usually clear and it tastes very beefy and light. They give you a decent portion of meat. And holy, they give you a lot of noodles. I recommend getting a size small and getting some of their appetizers along with your meal. My boyfriend got the large and they give you so much more noodles with it so it was super filling for him. He's got a big appetite and even he gets a size small now!

I recommend steering clear of the beef brisket, it's a hit or miss. Some days the meat is full of fatty pieces or some really good pieces of beef! Their other types of beef bowls are great though and are usually consistent.

If you haven't been here, check it out! You are in and out relatively quick and it does keep you full for a long time. This isn't the place to hang out and dine for long periods though, it gets too crowded and their seating isn't comfortable."}
{"text":"Friend suggested this spot for a quick lunch, and we visited around 1:00 on a Monday. The plaza was packed given it was the Canada Day weekend, but we were lucky enough to snatch both a parking spot and table inside the restaurant without waiting. Ordered the classic beef noodles with round regular noodles - the noodles for the most part were quite consistent in size and the right amount of chewiness. I'm usually wary of soups and broths as I'm sensitive to MSG but the one here was tasty and not too salty. Mixed with chili oil it added even more flavor to it! Wish there was more meat (BIG beef) and vegetables, but the broth was more than enough to overcome that. Prices are quite fair, as the total came out to ~20 and tip for two.  Service is also friendly and quick, such as when the server offered to bag my friend's noodles. Will return to try the other dishes as well as noodle styles."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Ordered the non-spicy beef noodles with the flat regular noodles and the shan jin bao. 

Loads of noodles in the regular size that I couldn't even finish! Cooked to al dente with the perfect 'bouncy' texture. The broth was good, more on the subtle side so I added chili oil to give it a nice kick. I wasn't a fan of the beef brisket because it was a bit dry. 

Shan jin bao - only available during certain times in the day. 4 baos, similar to xiao long bao but bigger and with a thicker skin. Filled with juices, these were so yummy! Definitely must get. 

Good price for the portion you receive. Service is average. The restaurant is on the smaller size and can get busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"I cannot even express how happy I am to have discovered this delicious little spot. I will be back again and again.
I had the hand-pulled noodles with meat sauce, cucumber and green onion (I chose the flat-regular noodles which were so chewy and perfect...but a little too big and slippery for my amateur chop stick skills so I will choose thinner noodles next time), and grilled eggplant. The meat sauce on the noodles was flavourful, not too salty, and had just the right amount of chilli. There was lots of julienned cucumber for freshness and crunch. I ordered a small bowl which was a very generous serving size. The waiter was kind and explained that the eggplant was charred on the outside then butterflied, butter basted, and seasoned, and that the flesh was meant to be scraped out (and skin discarded). I've never had anything like it before and it was spectacular.
The menu was small but with good variety and I can't wait to try their spicy beef soup and grilled corn. The space is not super large but there're was lots of seating without feeling cramped. Everything was clean and organized as well. I have zero negative criticism and highly recommend Big Beef Bowl! SO SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Took the meat sauce flat thick noodle, i sincerely liked it very much. Was not too salty as i like them not heavily salted. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Early dinner at this place with a girlfriend and liked it a lot. Our favourite was the pan fried dumplings, very crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The handmade noodles were very good too and portion was generous. The two of us ordered a large size to share but it was still too much. Overall, good food and attentive service."}
{"text":"The menu at this Markham location was aesthetically the same as the North York one (as in design).  However, they did offer some new appetizer items.

I really liked the service here at Big Beef Noodles.  They had a lot of tables and seating available (unlike the one at the North York location).  I liked how the server refilled our water glasses and gave us fresh hot soup to add into our slowly cooled-down bowl of noodles once he realized that we were going to be catching up and eating slowly.  I really appreciated that!

The large bowl of Braised Beef Brisket was filled with lots of soup, flat noodles, and beef brisket.  The beef brisket was actually so tender and soft (with only an odd piece or two that were more chewy), but the overall quality was great.  The noodles were a little soggier than my previous visit (but that could have been because we left it out for a while before eating, which is not the kitchen's fault).  The broth was extremely delicious!

The Chicken Shiitake Dumplings came with a side of soy sauce but there was certainly hot spicy oil on the table for you to complement the dumplings with.  The dumplings were a good size and shapely.  They were decent and the spicy oil (which wasn't too spicy to my surprise) were a good addition to the chicken dumplings.  (The edge of the wrapping of the dumpling was a bit chewy.)

The Spicy Tripe and Beef was quite good!  I've had this dish before in other restaurants and the tripe in this dish was very tender and not chewy at all.  Viv really liked the sauce too.  I was actually surprised that the sauce wasn't spicy at all but it did taste good.  The beef was thin and a tad rough but not difficult to chew through at all.

We stayed there for a good hours eating and catching up and like I said, the server was so considerate to help us enjoy our visit better by refilling our cold noodle bowl with hot soup and refilling our water glasses."}
{"text":"Got the large braised beef.  Overall, a high quality meal.  There was a fair amount of beef ($8.99 for a large with noodles) given the price.  The noodles were high quality and definitely the highlight.  I could tell they were fresh (had the thin round noodles).  Base was also tasty but not too spicy.  Would recommend if craving a good bowl of noodles.

Believe they still needed to finish the inside of the restaurant.  They only took cash."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night, the parking lot was packed, but there was no wait inside the restaurant. The noodle soup with braised beef was flavourful and hearty. I tried sang ji bao for the first time! The bun is filled with broth and meat. Just be careful not to pop the bun and lose the broth inside. It was a yummy meal and I would go again!"}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles were decent, but not great. The bowl comes with a huge portion of noodles. Broth was bland. Meat wasn't very tasty. The night we came, there were a lot of families with young kids so expect it to be loud."}
{"text":"I came for lunch, with my daughter, to finally try their bowls of handmade noodles.  We ordered the spicy tripe and beef cold appetizer to share and it wasn't very good. The flavour wasn't there and the tripe was much too soft, almost jelly like with no bite to it. I wouldn't recommend ordering it. It seems a lot of places are selling sub par appetizers these days.
I ordered the regular flat noodles in the beef with pickled mustard & shitake broth. The menu shows one chilli but I didn't find it spicy at all. The noodles were lovely and the broth was delicious, I added chilli oil myself. My daughter ordered the thick flat noodles in classic beef broth. Her broth was a lot more peppery than mine. It was good and she loved the thick noodles but they would've been too thick for me. We both got the small sized bowls and they were a decent size.
I would definitely return for the noodles here but I'd be reluctant to try any more appetizers."}
{"text":"I was craving a hot bowl of Chinese noodle soup and stumbled across this place on yelp. Never knew it existed and it's only 4min from my house.  Came to try it out and though the menu is very small and limited, it was just enough to not make you indecisive. When I mean the menu is small they literally have like maybe a 6-7 choice of soup base and ingredients. But I do like the fact that they give you 6 choices of types of noodles from flat to round and thickness. 

Note: since this place is only a soft opening, they do not accept any other forms of payment except Cash. So please bring cash. A small bowl (which really looks like a medium bowl) is $7.99 and a Large is $8.99 

I had the classic bowl and my partner had the beef brisket."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the beef brisket with the larger sized flat noodle & dumplings. Service was fast, and staff was friendly. Noodles are bouncy and the perfect thickness, broth is good (definitely fill up on the chilli oil). Dumplings were served with a soy sauce/vinegar sauce and were piping hot. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We're from NYC and love hand lulled noodles from Xian Famous Foods so we were skeptical to try this place. But the thick hand pulled noodles here are delicious! The soup for the braised beef was superb and packed with so much flavor. The meat sauce lacked something and I can't decide what it was, maybe the sauce tasted too much like bolognese for it to be an Asian dish. The pork belly was small but very tasty. The dumplings were very good as well!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars..

Home made noodles were good texture. The large bowl is massive and good for the price. Beef was tender.  I think I'd skip the noodle/pork dish without the soup...

Service was average.

Debit or cash only no credit card.

I was full after the meal for a long time but I found that there's a lot of msg (or at least I felt like) so if you are msg sensitive then be warned."}
{"text":"Hilarious logo. Serious noodles. 

I ordered the braised beef bowl. Too bad they were out of dumplings though so I didn't have a chance to try it."}
{"text":"During dinner time, there's hardly any parking since there are so many restaurants that it's shared among. The restaurant also gets packed quick, but the wait isn't too long. 

The chairs aren't very comfortable - the backs are straight. On top of that, the seating arrangement is tight.

Everything I ordered that was supposed to be spicy wasn't spicy, and the chilli oil was realllllly weak -tasted more sweet than spicy. With that being said, I'd skip the Spicy Potato Slices, but the Spicy Tripe and Beef was the best dish we had despite it not being spicy. The tripe was nice and soft. 

The Sang-Ji Bao was okay - I've never had it before so I don't know what to compare it to, but it was unusually sweet! 

The Spicy Braised Pork Intestines with the flat thick noodles was okay. Again, not spicy, at all. The pork intestines were good, but the noodles were definitely too thick - it didn't really absorb the soup well. 

The Classic Beef with the Flat Regular was a classic rip off. Not much beef. I definitely prefer this noodle over the flat thick - it's the perfect size. 

Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Decent sized restaurant with many small tables (can easily fit small groups of 4 with). Very casual vibe and \"cash only or Debit\" only type of restaurant. It is a very family style restaurant with minimum decoration. I went on a Friday evening with a group of 3 of us and was able to get a seat right away. No one was waiting in line or taking too long to get seated. Plenty of tables were available. Tables were also nicely spaced out and didn't feel at all tight to the next. 

Service: Can communicate with servers in Mandarin, English, Cantonese. Service is pretty quick since there is less to order in these type of style restaurants. 

Food: 
I ordered a small braised beef thin noodle soup. I really enjoyed the soup. I didn't feel thirsty after but I also couldn't finish my whole bowl of noodles. 
To me, the size was very good. 
I got adequate amounts of meat but I think I was still served more noodles than I would be able to eat. 
The noodles were not as chewy as I would have liked (like in ramen). I tried my friend's flat noodle and it was OK and maybe had more chewiness to it. I shall try the flatter noodles next time.

My other friend ordered the pickled veggies soup noodle. It had good flavour of the soup broth. The meat was a little too lean for my liking. I usually like more fatty and tender meat. 

Overall: I would go back to have soup noodle if craving. Especially since the price per bowl is not bad and the place is not overcrowded."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night. It's a small quaint shop which is something that I appreciate (maybe it's the hipster in me). There is limited seating but we were fortunate to not wait. I ordered the beef with pickled mustard and shittake mushroom with flat noodles. The noodles were quite tender and the broth was clean and flavourful. The chilli oil was really good here added a new dimension to the dish. I'd really recommend trying it out.  
My friend ordered the braised beef brisket and that didn't disappoint either. I much preferred my dish as the pickled mustard really complimented the dish well. The skewers were pretty solid as well. Overall, I expected to return as it gets colder. It's just so refreshing!"}
{"text":"This place's rating is grossly over-inflated. Seriously, go try out Mei Nung at FMP and thank me later.

Came here on a Saturday night with some friends and it was packed. I had been to Mei Nung before and was expecting similar quality, considering the Yelp reviews, but I was wrong. Both the portion size and the quality of their beef noodle soup were inferior to Mei Nung. I was especially disappointed with the beef - all I got was a few cheap, thin slices.

In addition, the service was poor. The male adolescent working the cash register had a terribly poor attitude - visibly seething after asking if they accepted VISA (which they don't btw, only cash or debit I recall).

Will not be back to this place. There are so many better restaurants in this plaza - Chef Papa and Moji come to mind. And if you're craving beef noodle soup, just drive 5 minutes west and go to Mei Nung."}
{"text":"Authentic fresh noodles and rich broth that didn't taste msg laden at a decent price - will come again when the soup noodle craving hits :) ..."}
{"text":"When you call yourself BIG beef bowl, you set up an expectation for me...
And in this case, the expectation was not met.

Small portion sizes, fresh noodles (lots of variety), some customization (but within a limited menu), but SMALL PORTION SIZES DARN IT.

Restaurant gives off the 'classic' look and vibe of a Chinese noodle shop. Quality-wise, I think it's better than the make-your-own-noodle places, but not enough to pull me here consistently."}
{"text":"This is a typical Chinese restaurant. Large bowls of noodles, watered-down tea, and use of simple ingredients.

There's only like 4 types of noodle bowls to choose from, along with a variety of noodle thickness. Then they also offer a bunch of little appetizers like corn with cheese, \"complicated cow\", and Jian Bao (which seems to be a popular order here).

I got the classic noodle.  For a small bowl, that is a LOT of noodle. The big and small bowl is only difference of a dollar. I chose the flat thick noodles, and they are so long! It's basically eating half lasagna sheets. The beef was okay, tender slices with some tendon/fat. I forgot to tell them to omit the coriander. Nice surprise of white radish though (I think it's radish!). The soup is flavourful though I think if you drink the whole bowl, you would need to wash down the salt with another glass of water or tea. 

The meat sauce noodle was okay. Nice texture for round thick noodles but they were very oily."}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl ?!?!? More like big disappointment! If you want to pay 10 dollars for some noodles, 4 slices of really thin beef and a load of salt water in a giant bowl... come here. Disappointing flavors and for all the hype. 

We got a table, didn't get the menus until 10 minutes after and had to ask for water. Which took them like 10 minutes to get us. They forgot to put our order in and we watched multiple tables come in after us and leave before us. How cute ...

They did give us a 10% discount and apologized ...but I still won't come back. Meh"}
{"text":"I would've given it a 4 star rating, but service was a bit subpar. 

Came here on a Saturday for lunch. It was starting to get pretty busy. Staff seemed a little all over the place in terms of clearing tables, taking orders, and serving food. We were seated fairly quickly but it is pretty cramped. If two people are sitting back to back, it's impossible to walk through one of the aisles - this doesn't stop people from trying to though, so they'll push you because people these days don't know how to say excuse me. The chairs are wide but the front to back space is half of a normal chair. Feels kind of weird and is very upright. Makes you feel like you're sitting at a street vendor. 

The Shan Ji Bao we ordered was really good! Nice and soupy, hot, and the wrapping was tasty. I ordered the flat firm noodles in the classic, and they were pretty tasty. The texture is closer to a heavy pasta but gives you a more satisfying feeling if you're looking for a \"heavier meal\" without eating more. 

Note: I did not drink my broth really and was pretty thirsty later. But my girlfriend did, and later on she mentioned she felt dehydrated/was really thirsty at the mall and later at the gym. I see some people's review about MSG, so this might be real. 

As for the service, trying to get my order in was a struggle. It was one of those \"did they see you?\" moments, where someone will look at me, take their notepad out for orders, but another servers yells at them to clear tables first. Same goes for the bill. Shouldn't be this hard. We were never offered or given a glass of water even. I got my bill for $26, paid $30, guy picked it up, yelled at a girl in the back to come get it (the place isn't that big that he couldn't just do it himself) and she just assumed no change. It's not that I do not tip, but please don't just assume. 

Good food, meh service."}
{"text":"SANG JI BAO. That's the only reason I came. I've been trying to find good ones here in Toronto. Most of them are thick and doughy and don't have much soup in them, if any at all. I've been stalking Sang Ji Bao on Instagram since basically they started up their account. I've been hoping they'll open up a standalone restaurant. Not yet, unfortunately. When I heard they were collaborating with Big Beef Bowl, I knew I had to go. So we went. The sang ji bao are the best I've had in Toronto by far. The exterior is rather thin. The interior has almost an entire spoonful of soup in it. My only gripe other than the price ($5.99? $6.99? for 4) is that they're on the large side. I'm used the them being one-biters so that I can have them burst in my mouth. This is at least two bites, which means I'll probably either have to drink the soup first or risk it spilling everywhere. And I'm only complaining about the price because they're very cheap in Shanghai. Cheap and delicious.

That being said, I also had skewers. The lamb skewers were not worth it. Small and dry. The pork belly skewers were a little more worth it, but still nothing spectacular. 

And I had noodles. The meat sauce was nothing to write home about. Their lamb noodles, however, were rather good. I like their flat noodles. They hold sauce better. Wish I had the flat noodles with my meat sauce. Oh. One other thing about the noodles. We ordered a large noodle with meat sauce. The bowl was large, but it was like half to two thirds filled. The portion was incredibly underwhelming.

I might be back because their noodles are rather good, but there are so many other places to try!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago during one of the cold snowy evenings we had over the holidays. Hubby and I were looking for something warm and comforting and from the name alone, this place seemed to fit that bill. 

Big Beef Bowl specializes in hand pulled noodles. You can get them flat or round in shape, in your choice of thick or thin noodles. I'm the type of person who likes my hand pulled noodles more rustic in shape and chewier in texture so I opted for thick, flat noodles. I enjoyed that the noodles were al dente in texture, although the wide flat noodles did make it a bit messier to eat. Hubby and I both ordered the braised beef soup which had a slight kick to it, but was certainly comforting and warming as we had hoped. There was a decent amount of braised beef in the soup as well as tendon (which hubby was happy to hand over to me). We had each ordered a small bowl of the braised beef noodle soup ($8.99 each) but honestly could have shared a large serving ($9.99) which would have been more economical. 

We also ordered or, chive and egg dumplings ($5.99) which were pan fried and nicely crispy and flavourful. They also sell skewers of various types of meat, cold marinated dishes, and cold sweet bean curd for dessert. I'm sure we will be back when looking to fulfill cravings for hand pulled noodle soup."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night.  Two tables left before 6:30; after that, short line starts forming at door.

We ordered:  classic beef noodle with thin noodle, braised beef with regular thick flat noodle, preserved veg beef with regular small noodle.  And jai jian (minced meat dry sauce noodle).

Classic beef soup was very tasty and \"sweet\".  Not sure if there is msg but my throat is not too dry.  In terms of noodle, all noodles were good, chewy and al dente.  We liked regular small noodle the best - more like thickness of spaghetti and very chewy.

Overall, they give you a lot of noodle/carbs.  Three people can share 2 large.  Not a lot of meat though.

We also ordered some appetizers.  The spicy beef/tripe was very good.  Lots of tripe and shank.
Pickled cucumber was small portion for $3.  Will not order again.

Overall, would visit again.  But still prefer Sun Noodle at PMall and Potato noodle at Kennedy T&T plaza for our noodle cravings."}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese noodle. Not too many option for their manu. But noodle is all you need. You can pick 6 different noodle which vary by width. I always go for thick one."}
{"text":"This might not be a cheat meal to a lot of you, but noodles are definitely a cheat meal to me - this place is so raved about, I had to give it a try myself. Dragged the boyfriend here on a saturday afternoon and it was pretty packed, but we sat down quickly. They need more workers as the two people (one on cash, one running around) looked swamped and not okay.. I felt bad for him but he did his job great as I don't think he messed up any orders or stumbled, etc. He was definitely rushed though because it took awhile to flag him down.

The tables are very close together, because it's such a small spot, which makes for an uncomfortable meal with a few people you don't know, especially if they're slurping away beside you.. the food came very fast and it was pretty reasonably priced. Shan Ji Bao - which are basically soup dumplings (xiao long bao) but huge and doughy. Worth every bite! For noodles, I got braised beef with thick flat noodles. Texture of the noodles were the best.. so doughy, chewy and looooved how wide they were. #Thiccccaf. The beef was savoury and soft.. melty in your mouth. Some super fatty parts though, which i avoided. The soup was good, though pretty salty and full of msg, because later in the day, I was severely dehydrated during my workout. It was rough.

At the end, our bill came to $26. Gave them $30 and they cashed it away, without asking if we wanted change. We would've tipped it to you.. but it's kind of crap that you'd just assume it's your tip.. oh, and we never got water throughout the whole meal."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night dinner.  There has been quite a few noodle soup style places opening up in Markham so this place (to me at least) seems like no other.  There wasn't really anything that stood out to me.  

The beef noodle soup I ordered was very typical of what I get at other places. It was good to try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place serving up hand pulled noodles, then this is the place. 

While the noodles were perfectly cooked, the overall bowl wasn't to my liking. Though that's just my personal preferences speaking here and it seems to be an unpopular opinion. As opposed to the Lanzhou style noodles, I'm just used to, and prefer the Taiwanese/red braised beef noodles which I consider the broth much more complex and rich. The broth here was clear, and while that could be a good thing, it lacked dimension. And even though the menu here considered the brisket noodles spicy, it was anything but.

But I do appreciate this place for bringing such a traditional and simple bowl of noodle soup here and delivering in that regard.

The portion sizes here are quite generous in terms of noodles but are somewhat lacking in the meat department. I think I could have used more brisket. But that being said, the value is still incredibly fair here and is a good deal! Service was really pleasant for a place like this which is surprising to see!

So overall, this place isn't bad by any means. It still a great place for traditional Lanzhou style noodles."}
{"text":"The restaurant was unassuming and small but then again, many great restaurants tend to exemplify the \"don't judge a book by its cover\" philosophy. Big Beef is no exception. The noodles were authentic and delicious and filling. I was expecting service to be subpar but I was very surprised to have friendly, informative servers (especially for a Chinese restaurant!) 5/5 for excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Can't remember how many times I come to Big Beef Bowl and ordered my favorite Braised beef brisket. The dish is prepared very well, one bowl with especially juicy beefs and slices radish. Honestly, I love the soup of braised beef! Also the pork belly BBQ have good taste with 3.99 for 2 skewers. I ordered their new desert tofu pudding tonight. It's cold and sweet, seems like a perfect summer desert after meals."}
{"text":"Good noodles. In my opinion the noodles are better than magic noodles. They are chewy and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The braised beef soup was delicious however the beef that came with it was 80% fat. The noodles (got the flat regular) tasted very fresh and had a great texture to them. The \"large\" ($8.99) was quite a generous portion size. 

Pass on the \"meat sauce\" dish as is was lacking in flavour and had nothing special about it. 

Service was great! 

Overall, I would come back if I want a decent and affordable meal. If they improve their meat quality, I would give them a 4/5."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with the boyfriend for dinner. Was kind of disappointed that we didn't get to try the Pan Fried Buns (Shan Xin Bao) since they don't offer them on Tuesdays. 

Boyfriend had their Classic Beef with round regular noodles. He found the noodles a little more al dente than he would've liked but the flavour was good. 

I had the Meat Sauce with thick flat noodles. The noodles were cooked through and had a nice chewy-ness, meat sauce had good flavour and wasn't too salty. 

We'll be back sometime to try their Pan Fried Buns!"}
{"text":"Tip: call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait because it can get busy. Great service here and the noodles have been consistent all 4 times we've gone. Any noodle will be really awesome - savory, chewy and soup is nice and hot which I love. This is one of our regular spots now. Yum!"}
{"text":"For a fast bowl of noodles, Big Beef Bowl is a great option.  With hand pulled noodles, you can select from a variety of different noodles for your dish.  I had the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup, slightly spicy, with thin egg noodles.  The soup broth was a bit weaker than I am used to, and the brisket was good, but a little on the chewier side.  Still, I would not hesitate to try some of the other options on the menu--it's fun to explore! Altogether, it is certainly A-OK."}
{"text":"The positives: Wonderful polite service and great tasting food. The noodles can look almost like Italian pasta but there literally is no comparison in terms of the texture and taste. Their noodles are far more superior!

The negatives: Mother always taught me never to serve guests with chipped bowls or plates. We had at least two (a plate and a bowl that had chips in them) which were served to us with our food. A note to the owner who may read this review. Please invest in new bowls and plates. Dishes are most satisfactory when served within or on flawless kitchenware. - Next is the fact that they do not accept credit cards. I did not see any signage with any warning about not accepting credit cards. Cash or debit only. No credit cards accepted in this time and age??? Bah...Not good in my books.

But your service and food makes up for everything else! A warning about this restaurant's location...GOOD LUCK finding parking on the weekend. A nice quiet weeknight would be an ideal time to slurp some their wonderful hand-pulled noodles!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, the prices are fair, the noodles are good, and I love the soup base."}
{"text":"I like this place the noodles are good and the staff are friendly. Haven't had many noodle places but this one is pretty great however, bbq is my fav part. BBQ portions could be bigger but overall was well seasoned and tasted pretty good"}
{"text":"Went there because saw review here but got really disappointed. Lamb skewer was super small, had no flavor but expensive. What was worse is lamb was not properly cooked. Still see red.. Harbin BBQ makes much better and cheaper lamb skewer. Soup based noodle tastes salty and only had 2 pieces of meat. Magic Noodle makes way better. Dry noodle is the worst. It had no flavor, not even meat flavor. Not sure how chef cooked the meat sauce.. We had to add a lot of vinegar and spice in order to eat the meal.."}
{"text":"I love noodles and what better place to get authentic house made Chinese noodles then a beef noodle place!?!
This place was not our first choice in this super busy plaza but I am glad our first pick did not work out! My husband loves noodles too and our friends were also down to try this highly rated noodle house. When we arrived it was already pretty full but we got one of the last 4-person tables. The restaurant is not big and it is fairly cozy. To some people the chairs may not be the most comfortable but the tables and chairs add to the interior design of this place- very Chinese but with a modern touch.
We all ordered our own bowl of noodles with different broth and types of meat. I love how you get to choose the thickness of noodles. Most of us opted for the flat thick noodles and one of my friends got the thinner one. My friend and I chose the  clear broth which was light and flavourful. It had just the right amount of saltiness, so delicious! My husband chose the clear broth with the pickled veges which had a kick to it and quite addictive. Lastly, my other friend got the braised beef with the darker soup base, she enjoyed it however her thin noodles were slightly overcooked. We all enjoyed our noodles but I have to say another notable  item was the pan fried dumplings. They were sizable, tasty and soupy. They come in 4s or 8s but we had the smaller portion. We also tried the pork belly skewers which were also yummy but not a \"must get.\"

If you enjoy Chinese soupy noodles and beef noodles in general, you will definitely want to give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for hand pulled noodles and beef soup.  This place is located in the busy Peach Tree Plaza at Kennedy and hwy 7, so parking can be challenging if you're coming here during peak dinner hours.  Big Beef Bowl has been opened for approximately 11 months and there's not slowing this place down, its usually packed even though this place isn't fancy at all.
The food is great, they've got a selection, portions are sufficient and prices are reasonable. 
From my experience, I'd recommend their 
**Braised beef brisket - which comes in two sizes and you get to pick the type of noodles you like.
**Spicy beef and tripe - served cold, this was delicious.
**Pork belly - an acquired taste. 
**Soup dumplings - comes in 4's, they're huge and packed with a flavorful broth."}
{"text":"The noodles themselves was good but what lacked was the amount of beef inside. Felt the ratio was a bit lacking.

The fried dumpling is only available on Wed to Sunday. Luckily we any there on Thursday. They come in fours and you really gotta follow instructions they gave on how to eat it. Be careful, they are soup filled and will squirt out. Delicious though."}
{"text":"I came here for soup one evening. My first bites of soup were fantastic. As I made my way through the bowl though I realized that it was really heavy on the noodles, with not much in the way of meat or veggies, at least relative to the noodles in there. The broth was still very good, but by the end I felt like I'd OD'd a bit on starch. I enjoyed the soup, but I don't think I'd go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time because I love Lanzhou noodles. I have visited other restaurants in Toronto for Lanzhou noodles and I knew I had to try it here. 

Service: service was friendly. The server was exposing to us what the \"complicated meat\" special was. It was a dish with all sorts of beef pieces according to him. Service was friendly throughout our meal. Water was replenished often without being asked to. Servers were attentive. 

Food: 
1) complicates meat special: this had assorted meat pieces including tripe and tendon. This was very tasty and it was a great side dish to our noodles. 

2) pickled peppers: great side dish to add some variety to the noodles.

3) lamb noodles: this was warm and hearty. The broth had flavor and it's a heart bowl of noodles. It's enjoyable to have some plain noodles in a clear broth without too much oil. 

4) meat noodles: I was most excited for this since I love noodles in sauce. However I was about disappointed to find that it was so bland even though it was thoroughly mixed. I've had other Lanzhou mixed meat noodles before and I loved how flavorful it was. But this dish here was a bit disappointing. It wasn't horrible but I wished it used more flavor. 

Overall I liked the lamb noodles. But I don't think I'll come back when I crave for Lanzhou noodles in sauce."}
{"text":"Was in the area, and wanted to eat something quick. Quickly looked it up on Yelp and had quite good reviews. Quite a small joint and very simple decor. Wooden chairs, booths and wooden decor as well. They also have Bruce Lee Artwork ;D

They make their own pulled noodles. And had a selection of different thicknesses. 

Our order:

Potstickers
They were really crispy, moist inside and flavorful. But potion is small but there was at least 8 of them on a plate. The only thing is the plate was extremely chipped..not only 1 spot of several...
 
Lamb Skewers
Very tasty and cooked to the right tenderness! But they were quite small in size. Total of two skewers.

Chicken Heart Skewers
Again it was cooked to the right tenderness and was very tasty. Total of two skewers. 

Fried Bean Sauce Noodles (L)
The selected noodles was reg. flat ones. Noodles were very chewy and nice bounce. Texture was great! The sauce wasn't enough for the large thick noodles. The sauce was tasty but the noodles didn't have enough flavour. 

Braised Pork Intestine Noodle Soup (S)
The broth was very rich and flavourful. The intestines were not gamy and was very tender and delish! The noodles selected was the reg. round, the noodles were very chewy and nice bounce. Small seemed like a medium to me, but can't complain :)

Also the service was great. The wait staff was very attentive and polite. There was 2 that came to our table. One spoke perfect english, the other spoke in mandarin, but I just nodded and said Thank You :D"}
{"text":"Great value - $7.99 for a small (but it's actually sizeable) bowl of noodles. I mean c'mon.

The classic beef noodle soup is not bad, and the meat sauce dry noodle looks really good - glistening broad noodles with morsels of beef and cucumber slices in each bite. But truth is the taste is average, mostly salty. The grilled king oyster mushroom was over-seasoned. 

I would return if I happen to pass by and need to grab a quick bite. It's alright."}
{"text":"We had the classic beef and the braised beef brisket. Classic beef was lighter and supposedly the most popular item. Both soups were delicious and the noodles (thin and thick) were fresh with good consistency. Only reason I didn't give full stars was because the lamb skewers were mediocre especially once it got cold the consistency was strange as if the meat was congealed together."}
{"text":"On a cold spring evening, a bowl of noodles was exactly what I needed. Big Beef Bowl did not disappoint. My party ordered three things:

1. Braised beef noodle soup. The broth was slightly different than soup base I've had elsewhere. It was balanced and not overly spicy. We ordered the large size and shared.

2. Pork and chives dumplings. Very good, you can tell it was made in house. The soy sauce dispensers lie, it's vinegar. 

3. The grilled eggplant was amazing. There is alot of garlic. I ordered non spicy 

Service was friendly and helpful. 10% off, cash only for the next 2 weeks for the soft opening."}
{"text":"Been back a few times since my first review and I must say I'm a fan! I prefer firmer noodle so I always get the round instead of the flat. The collab with sangji bao was also a major draw to this place.. too bad it's gone now!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the above average review at the yonge and finch location. 

Came here on a Thursday rainy night around 7pm. No one was in there. But still decided to walk in.

We both ordered large bowl of braised beef brisket noodles. You get to choose the noodles sizes. We got one with round large and one with round regular noodles. 
The menu says it's spicy but it's not spicy at all.
Each bowl comes with 3-4 pieces of braised brisket, few slices of daikon, topped with some green onion. 
The broth is very clear and flavorful. But I'm not sure if it's beef soup or what.
I quite enjoyed my round regular noodles al denote but the larger one is a bit under cooked.
The beef I don't really care but it tastes ok.
The large bowl really has a lot of noodles.
And for now it's new opening so they offer 10% off; cash only. So your looking at $20 all in for two bowls of large noodles. 

Overall fairly priced, quality noodles. 
Will consider coming back when I'm craving for beef noodles; only that I seldom have such craving lol."}
{"text":"Great service, my server was very quick and very nice! The portions are very generous, a large can easily be enough for 2 people. I would've liked a bit more beef. I definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cozy seating arrangements which were not the most comfortable. Lots of stools and small tables that can be moved around to accommodate larger groups. Parking is kind of limited since it's shared with other restaurants in the plaza.

I ordered an original beef noodle with small flat noodles. The noodles are chewy and cooked well but I would advise against ordering the thick cut noodles as it's way too much dough in each bite. The broth was clear and unremarkable, with an aftertaste reminiscent of MSG. There were only a couple small slices of beef which was disappointing. When you're eating bite after bite of doughy noodle, it would be nice to balance it out with more protein/meat. 

For the price point and what is offered, I would give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"I met a friend for dinner at Big Beef Bowl, first time being there for me. The space is small, with very minimal decor, but clean.

We ordered a couple of appetizers and then soup with hand made noodles. He opted for the Brasied Beef Brisket with flat noodles and I had the Classic Beef with regular round ones.

The pan-fried soup dumplings were really good, a little crispy on the outside and very tasty on the inside. Be careful when eathing this though. We both got squirted with hot soup!

The pork belly skewers were also quite good. Nice char on it without being burnt.

My soup was good, with a nicely flavoured broth and perfectly cooked noodles. My friend's choice, with the bigger noodles and spicy broth looked a lot more interesting though. I'll have to order that next time!

There is nothing fancy about this place, just good tasting comfort food. And cheap! Try it."}
{"text":"I was attracted by the black and white signage; Big Beef Noodle in both English and Chinese;  when driving passed New Kennedy Plaza a week ago, and stopped by today to try this new noodle joint. This place serves Lanzhou style noodle. Rustic décor with wooden tables and benches. The uniforms of the waiters are unique; with Bruce Lee holding  noodles instead of nunchucks; at the back of their tees. The menu is small and simple. There are seven types of noodles for you to choose from; super slim, slim, slightly slim, wide, wider, extra wide and triangle. We had large classic beef wide noodles, large meat sauce super slim noodles, pork dumplings and wood ear fungus with cucumbers to share among three. I like the meat sauce and the super slim noodles over the classic beef noodles. The meat sauce noodles came in a large bowl without broth. The noodles cooked al-dente, they were bouncy and chewy, and the meat sauce is bold and rich. The broth of the beef noodles had peppercorns and gave off that tingly feeling on the tongue.  If you like that tongue tingling feeling, you will like the broth.  Good service! Enjoy a 10% now : )"}
{"text":"you know those highly rated places you see yelp where you go & feel 'meh'. THIS IS NOT THAT. My non-ramen family has been converted by Big Beef Bowl & we've been back twice. The portions are huge & you get to select your type of noodle. The staff is friendly and brings your non-ramen family some forks and scissors with zero judgment. All the food we got was heavenly: I had the meat sauce noodles (divine), thing one got classic beef, thing two got braised beef & husband got 'vegetarian noodle soup' (who goes to a ramen place & orders this). To share we got grilled eggplant, chicken hearts, chicken wings, lamb skewers, tripe & corn. The food was fresh, easy on the wallet and delicious. We devoured it all. And had no regrets. Well, maybe just the vegetable ramen ;)"}
{"text":"Hey guys! 

A friend and I stopped by around 9:30pm for a late dinner. It was freezing out and we both wanted something warm and soupy. Walked in and it was fairly busy. We sat down and was immediately greeted by someone. As we were pondering on what to order, we looked around and saw that a lot of people were eating a large compared to the small. It was a dollar difference and we were pretty hungry so we said to ourselves, why not? 

BIG MISTAKE!
O
We got the braised beef bowl with round thick noodles in LARGE. Guys, these people at Big Beef Bowl are super generous. I had enough noodles in that Large bowl for three meals. We also ordered pig ears and tripe with beef appetizers. Loved how the server actually explained what the appetizers were. S9ince we didn't know Chinese, we kinda just pointed to what we wanted. We wanted the beef and a tripe appetizer but had pointed to the complicated cow dish (LOL). It's exactly as what you think it is, the most complicated things to explain...from a cow..in an appetizer! Glad he explained that to us and we got the correct appetizer (Phew) ! 

The noodles were delicious.But i found their dishes VERY oily. When the braised beef bowls of noodles arrived, I had immediately thought they were spicy. But they weren't! It's just very oily. 

Their appetizers are very oily too. Other than that, loved the food. 

Their noodles are probably one of my favourites now next to ramen."}
{"text":"Big Bowl is a choose-your-hand pulled-noodle joint.  The way it works is simple: 
1) choose the protein+broth, then 
2) choose the type of hand pulled noodle.  The noodle choices are: thin round, regular round, thick round, thin flat, regular flat and thick flat.  

We ordered three small bowls ($7.99).  They all looked nice aesthetically.  The amount of noodle was more than a normal small, leaning towards a medium.  I chose the regular round noodle.  The noodle was quite good and fresh.  The broth was clear.  I couldn't taste any MSG.  Either they used very little MSG, or they didn't use any.  It wasn't spicy, so you are safe here if you can't take much spiciness.  A jar of chili oil was on every table for those who craved spiciness.  The amount of protein and vegetable was quite generous.  It seemed to be more than Magic Noodle but less than Potato Noodle Soup of Bai.

The services was good.  The venue was clean.  The seating was comfortable.  The deal (price vs quality vs portion) was outstanding. 

We missed the reverse side of the menu where the small plates and cold and hot appetizers are.  I would remedy the omission at the next visit."}
{"text":"The noodle was really good and chewy. Just an overall great place to go for noodles. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This soup hits the heart! It is so yummy. I would recommend this to my friends and family and the yelp family!

They like to keep it simple and stay in their lane and they do it well.

I ordered the braised beef with thick flat noodles, and you can order any type of noodle preference you want!

I started with the bbq lamb and it was perfect to start your food journey to the meal.

I finished with the cold tofu but I recommend skipping this. Especially since there's tastier nearby desserts to finish off the date."}
{"text":"Good, cheap noodles. 

They have a relatively small menu which I personally like since I'm indecisive and it makes choosing a lot easier. I ordered their Braised Beef Noodle ($7.99) with regular round noodles. Their noodles were nice and chewy. Some of the braised beef were too fatty for my liking but other than that, it was a good dish. 

Tip: they accept cash and debit only, no credit."}
{"text":"Legit hand-pulled noodles, authentic even when compared to the noodles from the same region in China. Serving sizes are pretty massive (but manageable, not ridiculous). Great value for money although at the end of the day you're mostly just getting noodles. Pair your noodles with some pickled radish, potato strips, and skewers. All pretty good. Generous dinner for $15/pp all in? Aww yeah.

Tip: if you're trying to decide on what type of noodles to have (i.e. thickness), do it the way you would do pasta. Guideline - for heartier, more flavourful soups, try a thicker noodle. Of course, it boils down to your personal preference.

The neg's:
-Service feels rushed (you can't expect great service from a place like this, but even then)
-They seem to run out of stuff pretty often
-Parking is a complete disaster during busy evenings
-Place is cash/debit only
-Place is a bit small, arrive before 6 for your best chance at a table; otherwise prepare to have to wait"}
{"text":"Such a great bowl of hand pulled noodles. I love getting the flat thin noodles and even though I order the small, there is a lot of noodles that sometimes I cannot even finish! The broth is tasty and noodles are delicious. I've only tried a few sides, the skewer which I thought was a bit dry. I only come here for the noodles. The little stools are hard without any cushioning and becomes very uncomfortable sitting on after a while. They really need to change the chairs. However, I am giving review for the food and it is 4 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Was in the area Sunday lunch time, read the good reviews and would like to give it try. The door was quite shabby and hard to find. But inside was quite clean including the washroom.  Everything ordered was very yummy, good size and reasonable price. Beef with pickled mustard and shitake mushrooms (sm) $7.99, no shitake found, but tasty group, i ordered thinnest noodle.  We also ordered pork belly skewers and shanghai fried bao. All were tasty and we had a very satisfied meal. Will come back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner and although it was packed, we were seated very quickly. 

The menu is short, which I appreciate, because that usually means fresh ingredients. I got the classic beef bowl with thick flat noodles and my bf got the beef brisket bowl with thin flat noodles. LOVED the noodles, they were the best part. \"thin\" is not really thin btw. The soup was meh. I liked that the classic came with tons of cilantro but the brisket broth felt a little too oily. The soup just had way too much msg in it. I brushed my teeth when I got home, drank tons of water and I'm still dying of thirst here. 

The restaurant feels pretty clean, and I notice they spray and wipe the tables down right away. The meal was priced reasonably in my opinion but the drinks seem a little pricey (unless $3.25 for a Wong Lo Kat herbal tea is normal?). 

Though the noodles were good, I probably won't be back. The dehydration is just not worth it and there's definitely better soups out there."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this authentic Chinese noodle joint. Simple menu with a solid selection of sides, and their famous beef baos to go with your noodles! Will visit regularly.

Restaurant
- fairly new renovations. Seating can get quite tight in the middle rows but the sides and booths are great.

Food
- def a winner here. Simple selection of soups and meats with noodles of your choice.
- great menu of sides. The baos are a must!

Service
-  found it generally understaffed so wait times are elongated.

Value
- overall good value for money"}
{"text":"Service - friendly and polite staffs. 

Foods - food comes out HOT, which is very important to me. This way you know it is freshly made !! Braised beef brisket noodles soup is highly recommended. Very yummy. The braised beef brisket is so tender and yummy. The noodles are very good also. Portion is generous. It would be better if they add some green leafs veggies to their noodles soup. 

Price - very decent and affordable. $7.99 for Small and $8.99 for Large.

I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was craving for a bowl of noodles on a chilly night, so I decided to give Big Beef Bowl Hand-Pulled Noodle a try (especially due to all the high reviews). We ordered a large braised beef noodle - flat regular ($9.99) and a small classic beef - round regular ($7.99). The portions were fair for the price, and I liked how I could adjust the spice level on my own with the classic beef. However, I was expecting a bowl of hot steaming noodles, but what came out was just lukewarm. This was very disappointing. Also, we noticed we were very thirsty throughout the night - perhaps there was a bit too much MSG in the soup. These made it a 3 stars review, instead of a 4 stars review. 

What I did like: (1) this place is bright, spacious and clean, (2) prices were fair and wallet friendly, and (3) friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"The place is small and spacious so if you want to come in big groups, you won't have a problem. The food was good and flavourful. The spice level was tolerable. I would definitely come back and try the other flavours. 

We ordered the beef brisket noodles for $8.99 and meat sauce noodles for $7.99. 

PS. Don't forget to bring cash! It's a cash only place"}
{"text":"Love the soup based noodle selection! Absolutely tasty. The only negative thing I have to say is the bench chairs are terrible..."}
{"text":"I like their handmade noodle! You can choose from 6 different size noodle and I personally prefer the second thin noodle. It taste really good. They are now in soft opening and have 10% off discount even you paid by debit."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. I ordered the large flat noodles with meat sauce. The noodles were indeed tender and al dente as other reviews have described. I dared to try the large flat noodles because I like to go big or go home. Let's just say that it weighed my chopsticks down and I was making a lot of slurpy noises. It was both impressive and amusing. The meat sauce itself was better than I expected. It was flavourful but not overly salty like many other restaurants. Menu said it was spicy but I disagree. I had to add chilli oil, actually. The thinly sliced cucumber added colour and a sense of having a balanced meal. Lastly, the server was nice and polite. 

CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time, went during lunch time. Small place, waited about 20 minutes. Service was not incredible. They seemed understaffed at the the time. 

I got the braised beef with flat thick noodles. I got the small size and it was a lot of noodles and soup but barely any beef. There was probably only 3 medium size pieces - not impressed. The noodles were much more wider than I had expected, a tad bit chewy. The soup itself was not oily or overly salty, which I can appreciate. 

I will say the Shan Ji Bao tasted amazing. Soup dumplings which had a nice exterior crunchy texture, filled with an explosion of flavour. Definitely would order again! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Big! Big beef bowl hand-pulled noodle is really no joke. Their noodle portions are massive! We came here one night after wandering about the plaza, trying to decide on dinner. The restaurant was actually quite empty as we came by during an off-peak time, but we decided to give it a try anyways. 

I enjoyed being able to pick the type of noodles and the staff working that night were not at all frosty. We had some questions since it was our first time there and they were friendly to us. We both ordered a variation of the beef noodles and were pleasantly surprised! The beef broth was lovely- light but flavorful. The noodles themselves were alright, too much doughy taste (not sure if this was because we ordered thick cut flat noodles.. but this still should not be doughy tasting). The amount of beef was stingy and the meat itself was overcooked.

I should note that the entire time (from when we were seated to when we left) there were fruit flies everywhere. We constantly had to swat them away from our food. Not fun...

I might come back to give this place another try, we'll see!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating. Parking however, was a bit of a challenge.
Servers are polite and pleasant, served water and took orders promptly.
I would enjoy a menu with more variety in sides, since all of the main options are noodles with red meat/veggies. I am impressed by the 6 different noodle shapes, it's typically not that extensive in a Chinese noodle house.
Noodles came, soup was really fragrant. I wasn't a fan of how all 3 of our noodle bowls were extremely chipped up. Not that you'd get hurt, but just not very inviting to eat.
I find the toppings very scarce. I got the classic beef and they were 4 slices paper thin and around the size of a credit card. There were also coriander and radishes, but not a lot. Think Japanese ramen toppings -30%. 
I got the thick round noodle, it was very chewy, almost tasted al dente. I love the soup, everything else...was okay.
For the price, I expected slightly more toppings if you compare them with competitors like Magic noodles or small handmade noodle houses in the area. 
I don't find them horrible, just not the best when you are comparing apples to apples for what you get. There are so many places in Markham that offer something of the similar quality...why go to one with chipped bowls and no parking?"}
{"text":"Ordered a large size classic beef noodle (round regular), wood ear fungus & cucumbers and chicken dumplings to share with my husband. The large is huuuuge! Plenty of noodles to go around.

The noodles are perfectly al dente and the clear broth is very flavourful, yet refreshing. I really loved the pickled cucumbers in the cold dish as I love anything pickled/sour.

The dumplings were alright, nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Friday night as we were looking for a new place to try so came here as the wife felt for noodles.

Hand pulled noodles are a big deal these days as there has been quite an uptick of restaurants serving them and Big Beef Bowl Hand Pulled Noodles is one of them.  Located in the plaza near Hwy 7 and Kennedy, this small restaurant has a very small menu of noodles and appetizers.

The hand pulled noodles itself were excellent!  The regular flat and the thick flat hand pulled had a great chewy texture to it.  It really reminded me of the noodles my grandparents made as a kid.  In terms of the broth the braised beef one had really great depth and flavour.  The classic beef was not as rich so next time would definitely get the braised beef one.

Service was very polite and attentive which is always plus in Chinese restaurants.  Price wise noodles were under $10 so the value is definitely there.

Overall a great place for hand pulled noodles! 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"Out of the two (Byng and Kennedy location) this is hands down the better location. I have gone to both and the noodles and soup just somehow tasted better. The location is also bigger and seats more people instead of being cramped. That being said, I always go for the soupy noodles though my friends liked the meat sauce noodle. I recommend the thickest round noodle and the medium flat noodles. The thickest flat noodle just is too wide and ends up clumping and sticking together. Their side dishes are good too but a little small. I would recommend if you want to share as an app with friends :)"}
{"text":"Big Beef Bowl is located on the side of Kennedy Square facing Hwy 7. There is parking on that side so you don't necessarily have to park in the main area. 

There can be a line at times, but you can always call ahead to confrim, which is what I did. We arrived and waited for about 10 minutes. You can take a look at the menu while waiting. There's a tiny waiting area between the restaurant and the door, although most people choose to wait inside the actual eating area. 

We ordered #2 and #3 noodle on the menu, lamb skewers, and pan fried dumplings. Big Beef Bowl probably has my favourite hand pulled noodles in terms of texture. It's not too chewy but chewy, and it's not overcooked at all. The beef broth is better than average with a decent amount of meat compared to similar places in the area. The portion is meh - small feeds hungry Alice, Large feeds very hungry Alice. A large bowl of noodles will not be enough if you're a big boy and eats a ton. Lamb skewers were average. Expected them to be better and taste more authentic. The pan fried dumplings on the hand were decent. If you're not feeling noodles, the pan fried dumplings will be a good option.

What I really dislike about the place is the service. They don't ever refill your water unless you ask them to, which, fine - it's a Chinese restaurant. But it's nearly impossible to get a server's attention despite how small the place is. I finally got a server's attention, and he gave me the \"wait a second\" finger gesture. We waited for almost 10 minutes when he dropped by with the bill. We got his attention with intention to order more food and get our water refilled.

If you want some good hand pulled noodles, this is the place to be. But rude service."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience.  I had the flat regular noodles (the noodle dish I had was named \"complicated cow - no joke!).  

First, the noodles.  They were very good but very long.  It literally took me a minute to eat one noodle before it broke off.  It was kinda funny, and it made my kid laugh, so that's a plus.

The complicated cow version consisted of tripe and lung.  Absolutely delicious.  Both \"complications\" were tender and well cooked.

I would definitely come back here and have another go at the complicated cow noodles."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Service was prompt and food was good. Ordered the Braised beef large sized. Bowl was a good portion, beef was nicely soft. I will have to come back to try again."}
{"text":"Came here multiple times for their beef noodles. Perfect spot to visit on cold, winter days and it always reminds me of my northern Chinese grandma's homemade dishes. Similar to other hand-pulled beef noodles places in town, the menu is simple and you get to pick the soup base and the thickness of the noodles. I am not a big fan of spicy food therefore I always go for the classic beef noodles. The hand pulled thin noodles were chewy and flavourful. The portion was generous; even the small/regular size was very filling in my opinion.

The service was a bit slow but was reasonable knowing that the noodles were hand-pulled. Will come back when I crave for a warm bowl of beef noodles."}
{"text":"This place is ok for Lanzhou hand pulled noodles however not the best. The broth is very flavored which is great but the beef was too soft and literally melts in your mouth w/o chewing. Thick round noodles were ok but too hard. And the serving size isn't very large."}
{"text":"YUMMY! One of my go-to places for hand pulled noodles and beef soup."}
{"text":"Some of the  beef brisket is not tender, hard to chew. The flavour in general is not bad. Good thing about this restaurant is there are several types of noodle to choose from and there's explanation of each."}
{"text":"I'm actually really surprised that many of the people here found the soup great since the base is dumped in msg and flavoured broth powder. 
I know this because i sat in the front, where I saw one of the workers pouring a mix of powders in containers for soup broth. 
It was clear that there was a bunch of msg due to my  mouth being dry af. 
However, the noodles were okay, they had a pretty good amount of chew and good portion. 
I'm no msg expert, but after SEEING someone pour that stuff in, I just can't give this place four stars..
so be aware."}
{"text":"The line-up was a little bit long than expected. The space is a little bit small and it can get crowded at times. The food was good and vert tasty. Although we could taste the msg but nothing out of ordinary."}
{"text":"It's great! The food is really fresh and is delicious, but the space is limited - try going early if you can to snag a table. Other than that, I don't have any big complaints at all. I don't know how likely I'd be to return, and the price is really great, but honestly it wasn't special or memorable to me."}
{"text":"We stopped by this casual Chinese noodle restaurant for an easy weeknight dinner. The restaurant isn't anything fancy, but it's nice enough (though the chairs take a bit getting used to - they're almost uncomfortably rigid). The server was friendly and gave us a good explanation of different menu items.

We each ended up getting a noodle soup, then we got a few appetizers to share. For my main meal, I picked the beef brisket noodle soup (with medium-sized round noodles, extra meat, and an egg). The portion sizes are huge, so I'd recommend a small-sized soup. Despite claiming it was spicy, it hardly had any spice (idk whether this is normal, or a fluke, or they just gave us \"white person spice level\"). Regardless, there's extra chili oil on the table for you to add yourself. Also, all of the noodle dishes let you pick your noodle type - larger noodles are chewier (with the large flat noodles being almost lasagna-sized), and smaller noodles are softer. For appetizers, we shared the potstickers (tasty, though a little overdone) and the roasted eggplant (a bit strange, and extremely smoky).

Overall, we enjoyed the cheap and tasty eats. Stop by for a delicious meal, either by yourself or with a few friends."}
{"text":"Pretty good bowl of noodle soup only $7.99 for a small! And it's hand pulled! I tried the round regular which was like a ramen consistency. My friend tried the flat regular and it was delicious. 

Beef brisket was pretty good except it wasn't spicy at all. Glad we tried it though.

Chicken wings with taro chips $6.99 were decent but not flavourful enough. Grab some ketchup! 

Amazing service. Def worth it on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Husband and I both got the spicy beef brisket noodles - his was the flat thin and mine the flat regular with a side order of the pork and chive dumplings to share. We were both extremely satisfied with the flavour, portion, price and service. Deliciously satisfying - and seemed perfect for the rainy gloomy Sunday we visited on. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
One of the restaurants at New Kennedy Square, located beside Grand Lakes Chinese Cuisine & Banquet. There are lots of parking spots in the vicinity. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Staff were efficient and food arrives pretty quickly. Our server was also friendly and checked on us a couple times. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
Simple and clean. Almost looks like they revamped and added a modern twist to a noodle stand from the streets of China! 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
Authentic. Fresh hand-pulled noodles tasted so much better than the packaged ones. Broth also tastes rich & boiled to perfection. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
Non-Spicy Classic Beef Hand-Pulled Noodles (Small) - $7.99: you can select your preference of thickness & firmness for the hand-pulled noodles. For thickness, I chose \"Round Thick,\" and for firmness, I chose \"Very Firm.\" I loved the noodles because they were perfectly al dente and absorbed flavours of the full-bodied broth. The beef was also quite tender.

[OVERALL] - 5/5
Hand-pulled noodles are definitely better than machine formed ones because of its ability to absorb the broth. This bowl of noodles looks simple, but is actually well-crafted and rich in flavour."}
{"text":"This was a happy nostalgic lunch for me, it brought me back to the early days of my northern Chinese grandmother's cooking. She would always have a pot on the stove braising meat and soup all day and jars of pickled veggies to make this flavorful lunch like today. 

Think of this as the northern China version of the viet pho, so think noodles, meat in a broth and simple veg. The Braised beef Bowl however has a more rich & complex flavor, steeped in the meaty clean broth with savory spices such as 5 spice, star anise, peppercorns, chili peppers to warm your bones after a cold wet day. 
It's a warm spice, like a smoked chipotle instead of a Thai bird chili, so when the menu shows the chili, yes it's spicy but not in a way to melt your mouth. If you like the heat ask for more spice, or use the table condiment, which you can buy in a small mason jar. Go for the thick noodle, it's got a nice chew like a bigger version of ramen but thinner than udon. 

It's a simple menu for a simple meal, add more meat if you are use to eating larger portions, the pickled daikon compliments the spice and cleans the palate. 
The lamb skewers are very close to the street meat in Beijing, dusted in spice and crunchy bits of fat.

The atmosphere is simple with some raw wood furniture which is neat, but sitting on the stool to eat was harder than it looked! I'd go for the booth next time so I can hunch over my bowl without using any muscle effort. 

This place is like my chicken noodle soup for a wintery day. Gonna be back for more."}
{"text":"LOVE their soup. Meat is meh.

Perfect place to visit on a cold, winter's day. Upon entering the restaurant, you'll notice that it's not huge so chances are you'll have to wait for a bit but not too long; people generally finish their noodles pretty fast. 

When they first opened, they had the most uncomfortable seating. EVER. I'm so glad they changed that. Staff is also very efficient in taking and delivering your orders.

Now, the menu is pretty self-explanatory. You pick your soup base, your noodle thickness, then any extras you want to put on there. There's also snacks available, like skewers. It takes a bit of time for the noodles to arrive... at least that happens every time I go... but it comes piping hot, just how noodles are supposed to be (kind of like pho!) Noodles are nice and chewy, but not a lot of meat in there. Although, the meat itself can get kind of chewy and dry. Portion size of the noodles is quite generous, though.

An ideal alternative to pho and vice versa imo."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.
They opened another Big Beef Bowl location!
I used to go to the Yonge and Finch location quite often so I'm glad they opened one in markham as well.

Standard pricing on their bowl of noodles: Small ($7.99) and Large ($8.99)
The small size is quite big already, a lot of noodles.
Tried the Braised Beef Brisket with flat regular noodles, and the Beef with pickled mustard and shitake mushrooms with round thin noodles. The round thin noodles were interesting - it was so thin it looked like vermicelli, but when you eat it you can clearly taste it is hand pulled noodles, interesting texture. I personally like flat noodles more as they are thicker and more chewy. Both soup flavors were good. Although the braised beef brisket one does have a chili sign on the menu, I didn't find it spicy at all. I personally liked the beef with pickled mustard soup base more flavorful (even more tasty if you add the chili oil). I do think they could add a few more pieces of meat though.

The meal was really enjoyable.Only thing is after the meal I was really thirsty - makes me wonder if they put a lot of MSG in the soup..."}
{"text":"The place has a neat traditional feeling noodle house where there are wooden seats and tables in the restaurant. I had a late lunch here on a Fri which still have 5-6 people inside. The service was fast and friendly. I ordered a small traditional beef bowl with thick noodles. The wait was very long as it came quickly. The portions are pretty good size - the large is big. 

Food wise - noodles were perfectly cooked with a chewy texture and beef was sliced thin and tender. However, I found the soup to be a bit too salty or garlicky. Otherwise the food was pretty good. They have some other small dishes so I will give it another try.

In the mushrooming area of noodle houses, I think it is going to have some tough competition."}
{"text":"Split decision on this. My wife got the Beef Noodle with wide, thick noodles and I got the Beef Brisket Noodle with the thin wide noodles while my son also got the Beef Brisket with regular round noodles. Although the menu shows the Beef Brisket as being spicy (one pepper) it wasn;t really spicy at all, but my son and I still liked it. My wife found the broth in her soup to be a bit bland and used a lot of hot chili oil to bring the taste up. Meat in both dishes was good, not too much and not too little.We all are fans of the noodles, very fresh and well cooked. My son and I ordered the large bowl and my wife had the regular size. In all cases the portions were generous and filling. We also split pork belly skewers and that was very good. Service was very friendly.Total bill including 1 pop was $35 not including tip, I good deal in our eyes. Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, cash only.
In summary, broth could use some work but well worth visiting and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Give me a big bowl of classic beef noodles please  ! Finally decided to try this new place with my favourite other noodle lover and boy was this an nostalgic experience ! The first sip of this broth brought me straight to the memories of China where this exact flavour was the one I had shared with my childhood friends and those good moments spent with them  . Definitely will be heading back there for this again soon ! Oh yes, skip the braised beef noodle there and stick to the classic. 

Maybe skip out on the braised beef noodle soup, in my opinion not a shop for that. It's pretty much like watered down original broth with a couple of pieces of beef and some drizzle of non flavourful chili oil. Definitely go with the original and only original noodle soup. 

Oh, and get the grilled pork belly"}
{"text":"Good:
Sides - Pork belly skewers are amazing.  Blast of flavour like a drop to a Martin Garrix song.  Eggplant was garlicky and great.  Pass on the lamb skewers though because they were tiny and do not have that nice grilled flavour.

Neutral:
Noodles - True to its name, bowls were big in size but the noodles and meat were pretty standard fare.  Nothing that really impressed.  Beef brisket labelled as spicy but it wasn't at all.

Bad:
Space - Tables are really close together, chair backs are very stiff and upright.  Not a very comfortable place to eat. 

Worth it?
Yes but barely.  The pork belly skewers saved them and are by far the best part of this place."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!! 
The noodles here are handmade and you get to choose from really thin noodles to long thick noodles. You won't be disappointed when you try the noodles here. We ordered three bowls and all of them were amazing, the soup and the texture really makes you satisfied. The staff here are also kind and super nice. 
Honestly,  I don't have words, this place is really amazing !"}
{"text":"The noodle soup here is very good here. Make sure to throw some chili oil in. You have several noodle styles to pick from (7 now I believe) and a few different choices for soup configurations. Otherwise the menu is pretty straightforward. The minced meat noodle sauce was decent, but not the best I've ever had. They're pretty popular as they're offering hand pulled noodles."}
{"text":"The services is very good,  waiter nicely explain the menu. 
6 different choice of the noodles size.  The Flat thick is very interesting, but its too thick to me, so hard to eat it.  So not recommend that flat thick for ladies.  Get the flat noodles, easier to eat =P

Cash only for 10% off during soft opening."}
{"text":"FYI they don't have those soup dumplings any more!

Ordered the beef brisket and grilled eggplant. The noodles itself were good - bouncy and chewy! The eggplant I would pass on, didn't particularly enjoy the weird smokey flavour it had. 

Our server was good."}
{"text":"3 + 0.5 star for value

I do love noodles. Freshly hand made noodle cooked al dente with the perfect chewiness definitely my favourite. 

Big Beef Bowl Hand-Pulled Noodle may not be the best noodle in town but at this price point, I am not complaining! A bowl of large ($8.99) and regular ($7.99) noodle a flat rate for whatever soup base and protein. Just a note, their soup base is more a really light broth with a clean taste. 

We also ordered Chicken Wings ($2.99) and Spicy Tripes ($5.99) which were both tasty.

If you are in the neighbourhood and love some noodles, I highly recommended giving them a try."}
{"text":"Happened to be waaay out here working for the day. It's in an Asian Mall and was busy which is a good sign. Friend had brisket bowl with thin noodle, I had beef with thick flat noodles. Generous portions and good value. We shared an order of chicken wings which were superb. Fast turnaround so don't plan a meeting over Raman."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles with lots of options on the type of noodles you'd like. The broth was very flavorful! The small bowl is already pretty big. We also got some lamb and pork belly skewers that were great as well but I would say for the price, the noodles are a better value."}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese New Year dinner with my family.  The food here is pretty good and the price is reasonable plus the portions are huge.

I love how you can choose from 6 kinds of noodles from thin to thick.  Plus the little side dishes you can order are great too! 

This is definitely a winner!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and after a failed attempt on a wed (they're closed wed) I finally made it. We went with the thin round noodles in regular broth and the fat thick noodles with a spicy broth. There was plenty of noodles in the bowl and the thick noodles were super long! Initially on first taste it was quite good. But after a while you realize the broth lacks depth, the spicy broth wasn't spicy. The thin noodle got soggy quickly and the thick noodle was a tad chewy. It was ok but didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"Simple beef noodle soup that helped with my cold! It was a bit plain and the serving was an okay size. I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"This is a small noodle place located in the Peechtree plaza. Their sign indicates that they are still \"soft opening\"; cash only. This is a good ace to grab a quick bite to eat. Tables and chairs are not comfortable for large groups or sitting for too long.
There are 6 hand-pulled noodles to choose from: round (thin, regular, thick) and flat (thin, regular and thick). Menu is very simple; you pick you broth and noodle type. I had braised beef noodle. I was impressed with the noodles; al dente, chewy and perfect texture. Broth was quite flavorful without being overly salty. Small is $8 and large is $9. Portion sizes are good

Overall; I enjoyed the noodles and will return. It can be quite crowded during dinner rush on weekend"}
{"text":"Maybe I was deprived of Asian food for a week but came here and ordered #2, beef brisket with extra chewy flat noodles small sized ($9). It took awhile for the noodles to come out but it was fantastic goodness.  The broth was rich, the flat noodles were the perfect chewy consistency (you can choose your desired thickness and chewiness of noodles) and the beef brisket was soft and flavourful and did not stick to my teeth.  I just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Handy traditional Chinese noodles. Good quality, great service and convenient location. One of my favorite Chinese noodles restaurant!"}
{"text":"The original store on Yonge has better pulled noodle and broth. Although the newly added apps are great but it's a far drive to make it a regular treat. The new braised intestine noodle soup was bland and not much meat. The sang ji bao was great crispy on one side and well steamed on the other. Definitely must ordered and must visit if in the area."}
{"text":"We checked out this little resto cos I had serious noodle craving. Not bad!!! Noodles are tasty and the meat was good. Soup base was a little too salty for us, but I think k others would appreciate it. 

We got the large... Lots of soup but not enough noodles or meat"}
