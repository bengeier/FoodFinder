{"text":"I hope everyone in Medina knows what a great place Santo Suossos is! Just passing through but wanted a good meal at a sit-down restaurant. What we found at Santo Suossos was SO MUCH MORE! The food was wonderful, the atmosphere is very comfortable, and the staff couldn't be friendlier! Eggplant parm is my go to meal at an Italian restaurant. Santo Suossos serves a great eggplant parm. Next time I'm near Medina I know exactly where we are going to eat."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, food and drinks.  You wouldn't expect this level of Italian food in Medina, but it is worth a visit!  Highly recommended for all occasions!"}
{"text":"Always a go-to place for Great Italian food.  Family owned with a friendly staff and super menu."}
{"text":"We've come here many years and always have a solid meal. They have an excellent wine list. We enjoy the vodka rigatoni and pizza."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back do to a lack of service and blandness of food. Teenage waiter lacked hustle and basic costumer service skills. Didn't even offer or bring any bread or parmesano for the meals. Thankfully I wasn't paying the bill because he wouldn't have gotten a cent for his lazy, unorganized, and unapologetic performance. Not one person in our four person party was wowed by their meal. We asked for a manager at one point and he /she never showed. At $18 a meal and so many good reviews I expected much more."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I don't go out to restaurants of this style very often. \"red sauce Italian\" is something I usually cook at home, but my wife was in the mood for eggplant parmesan, and we were in the area so... Apparently, Santosuosso's is an offshoot of Santo's in Middleburg Hieghts, which is closer to Cleveland, and the menu is very similar from what I hear. We spent quite a while deliberating over what to get, as the menu is organized into so many categories, it makes it hard to figure things out. Pastas abound, and come with most everything on the menu, whether it's Veal, Chicken or seafood, although I did see that they had grilled steak, salmon and pan fried walleye on the menu, which was nice to see. My wife ordered The eggplant Parm, which came with a choice of soup or salad; she opted for the Caesar Salad. As I usually do when I can't decide what to get, I order way too much food. In addition to a white pizza with fresh tomatoes and herbs, I also ordered what was called their \"signature salad\", with field greens, balsamic, garbanzo beans and bacon. I also ordered a veal florentine sandwich for good measure. Our salads arrived very promptly after we ordered, along with some nice simple italian bread I used to mop up some extra dressing in the bottom of the salad bowl. When our entrees arrived, I was stunned. My wifes eggplant parmesan was beautifully presented, with four nice sized slices of eggplant and a side of perfectly cooked spaghetti. My pizza was flavorful, with a nice hint of garlic and a kick of basil. The veal florentine was very tasty, with spinach and garlic, but the butter that the spinach was cooked in kind of made the sandwich a bit too heavy. tasted great, but it was like lead. All in all, It was refreshing to see that this style of restaurant can still be very good, and in addition to the great food, the atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was comfortable and relaxed. I also noticed they had a nice bar area, where I wouldn't mind sitting to have some wine and something to snack on should i find myself in the area again."}
{"text":"We have tried this place over the years and the quality of the food has really slipped and the prices keep climbing. Just left for the last time.  My Lunch consisted of a plate of wilted lettuce,1 cucumber slice, two slices of tomato swimming in dressing ;the only saving grace was the blue cheese that I paid extra for! My main course consisted of a cup of mushy over cooked spaghetti and I kid you not a chicken breast that was cooked whole and served cut in half...not sure who'll get the other half. All at a bargain of $9.00 plus the cost of a a drink, blue cheese and tip. By the way the glass of wine cost more than the meal I have been disappointed for the last time. It really is a shame because the are the only Italian restaurant left in Medina and we really wanted to love them!"}
{"text":"Two pizza's to go.  They did not have pineapple as a topping.  Interesting omission considering Pineapple and Ham seem to be quite standard in NE Ohio area.  I thought the sauce decent with crust a bit on the \"bread loaf\" side of things.  I realize some folks like this.  Both pies were quite crispy on the bottom.  Taste...decent, but not \"wow, this is our new place for pizza\".  I guess I write this review for folks to consider if they are ordering pizza.  I cannot speak to the other items on the menu.   Just a thought or two when ordering pie in the East Medina area.  Price was on the higher range for quality."}
{"text":"What's that, you say?  A non-chain restaurant in Medina that's vegetarian-friendly?  Hooray!  Is this the greatest Italian food I've ever had?  Of course not.  But I've been to Santosuosso's (Santo  Suosso's?) many times, and always been satisfied with my meal.  The sauce and pasta are always good, as is the service, and there's something to be said for being reliable.  There are a few quibbles, of course.  It's overpriced, and it's ridiculous that you have to pay $8 if you want a salad that has real greens instead of just iceberg lettuce.  And the bread is only a step above wonder bread -- no flavor or crustiness at all.  But normalized for Medina, Santosuosso's definitely gets four stars."}
{"text":"Highly frustrated with the service. The management needs to train the staff on how to take care of basic table service and delight customers vs frustrate. Food is okay. 2nd time visit, 4 family members, no 3rd visit necessary. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, had special tonight butternut ravioli very good, glass of wine, place was busy on a Thursday night, sign of a good restaurant, service was great, would recommend to anybody"}
{"text":"We had company coming and no time to cook. We ordered a tray of Chicken Mediterranean. It was really tasty and seemed to be a good value for the money. Also, it was ready quickly on short notice on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the service is AWFUL. we barely saw our server. Food was cold. One person in my party got the wrong thing, but never got the chance to tell because the server did not come back 30 minutes. When we asked to see the manager, we were given the run around! And then when we DID get a manger, they refused to remove the automatic 20% gratuity.   Absolute insanity and no way to run a business. Hopefully they will be gone soon"}
{"text":"so my girlfriend tells me she believes this place to be related to Santo's in Middleburg Hts and Italian Village in Strongsville because Santo's is the shortened version of Santosuousso's. if true this begs the question why are all these places so different? actually, i don't care. variety is nice.  we arrived and were seated immediately, which was nice because it was dinner rush and we had no wait. Danielle and i got the same things we always get - eggplant parm for her and rigatoni w/ vodka sauce for me. i won't speak for the eggplant because i hate eggplant and she's crazy for eating it, but the vodka sauce on my pasta was unlike any i'd had elsewhere. it seemed more tomato-ey. i liked it fine but it was different. i also ordered a meatball on the side. it's what i do. i like to try meatballs and this one was really good and tender. the tomato sauce was yummy and i sopped it up with my bread. with my meal i got the wedding soup. it was good and hot but very sloppy. the saucer under the cup was filled with soup that had either spilled in transit or was just poured in when being ladeled into the cup. no one bothered to get a clean saucer.  one a whole, the service wasn't the best. the server was very pleasant but we waited, what i felt, were long times between ordering soup/salad and getting it delivered, or waiting for drink refills, etc. i'm willing to overlook it because it was dinner rush and he had his hands full with the table next to us. the loud, annoying blowhard who didn't seem to shut up the whole time we were there just kept talking about football and some accident he'd been in and how much he was prepared to milk someone out of money for damages, etc. he seemed perfectly fine to me and should be ashamed of himself but that's another story. as we exited the smell of the pizzas baking in the kitchen made me want to go back and order again. i liked it fine. i'd give it 3.5 stars if i could. I think it's worth a stop if you'd like a decent Italian meal in Medina. There are few Italian restaurants in the area. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Very sub-par food. Stuff your grandpa might like and pasta sauce tastes canned. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I lived in Medina for nine years and we would eat here 2 or 3 times a week.  My family still drives 45mins for special occasions.  Delicious italian food and awesome catering too."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight and ordered Stuffed Banana Peppers as an appetizer and the Veal Florentine Sandwich. The Stuffed Banana Peppers (I mention Peppers, but I only received 2 small peppers for 9 dollars. So, if you plan on sharing this...be warned) were average in flavor and only came with 2 small peppers in marinara sauce. I feel for 9 dollars was not nearly worth the money. The veal Florentine sandwich was again average in flavor and came with plain ruffles as a side. If you wanted another side it would cost an additional fee. There was too much bread for the small amount of veal served in the sandwich. The veal was very dry and flavorless. As for the \"Florentine\" part of the sandwich, there was not much as far as vegetables. This sandwich was $8.50. Overall, for the $17.50 total plus additional tax and tip was not nearly worth it. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and the food is always good - locals often opt to take out a pizza from the handy counter out front. Servers are polite but often too few as we had to wait rather long to be noticed at the podium in an empty dining room. Lunch prices are only a dollar or two less than dinner so opted for the chicken parm. Don't skip the table bread or do yourself a favor and order cheesey garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Enjoyed the nice atmosphere and the ambience . Bar is my favourite.  Good wine and food selections. Ben made sure we were all having a good time. Would definitely come back. A special thanks to Ben for making sure we were having a great time . Highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Somewhat tight quarters, but service very attentive, and food good.  Especially liked their meatballs.  While they have half orders, they don't discount enough to mske them worth while.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is a dive in our opinion. Bad food, bad waitress help, nobody was there to greet you at the door, very cold blooded in waiting on you, & then they didn't care if they even came to your table or not. The food was terrible. Too much sauce on the food to taste it, salad was not even worth eating, bread was cold & the butter was hard as a brick. They are way overpriced for the amount ot food they give you. The lasagna tasted like ti came from a box, along with their rigiatoni, which the noodles were hard & not cooked properly. I would not recommed anyone that I really liked to go to this place at all. I got spaghetti sauce on my blouse & they did not apologize to me for that happening at all & did not offer anything for me to try to get it out of my blouse & bra that it soaked through. I thought that was very rude of them to do that. There was no manager on site to even talk to them about this at all. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had dinner and drinks here for years and the food quality is great and always consistent. It's one of the best restaurants in Medina and that's a small group to choose from.   But I'd say this is one of Cleveland's best as well. Just good food at a slightly premium price compared to the tasteless chains nearby. Santos is high quality.  One bit of constructive advice is the bar and bar booths are much better than the dining room. The dining room feels disconnected and needs to be blended into the ambiance of the bar."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. We had a wait for a table which was ok. We got a drink at bar. A couple was leaving & said we could take their seats by bar. We went to sit down & the older dark haired bartender said oh no these seats are reserved. I said oh I don't understand. She said these guys have been waiting awhile. Well we came in before the older white gentlemen so I knew this wasn't true. I said ok & let the white gentlemen sit down. I then asked the bartender can you call in and reserve bar seats & she said yes. I knew this was a lie but I said ok. As we waited patiently another couple left & gave us our seats. We sat down and older white gentleman started throwing f bombs stating the seat should be for his other guest. It was a very hostile environment but I refused to leave based on the fact that these older white gentlemen thought they had the right to the whole bar. It was ridiculous that the bartender catered to them. Luckily she did not serve us & a younger bartender did. She was great & the food was excellent. My husband & I are super laid back & were surprised by the favoritism to these select individuals by the bartender. I'm an individual part of the professional part of medina county & I was blacklisted from this bar & restaurant by an older white male community. It's too bad because the food is great here but the bartender only seems to serve to locals. Not a good impression for a local that has lived in medina county for 15 years."}
{"text":"Vodka rigatoni. Simple sauce mixed with sausage and rigatoni.  Full flavor sauce abd prefect boots of sausage.   In case you missed it in other review get the wedding soup. It's a lot of pasta, meatballs abd enough broth to cover it up.   Salads cone with homemade dressings.   Definitely worth the stop"}
{"text":"One is the simple yet elegant  dining pleasures in Life !  Really enjoy the food, and the ambiance.   One of my favorites for very good Italian food.  Great places to relax and enjoy a glass of vino and pasta!    Whether it's off the menu or a personal twist made-to-order, they opt to satisfy your craving.  HIGH FIVE!"}
{"text":"I love picking up santosuossos but do not like eating in the restaurant. The food is always good especially the pizza. I don't like eating in because it is a dark place and the service is just average."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely Luke warm.  And terrible service. We were even served by the manager who only checked on our table once.  This was ultimately a terrible decision to eat here."}
{"text":"Was in the area and checked yelp for a local Italian and this place showed up. Decided to order the eggplant Parmesan lunch along with wedding soup to go. Food came out super fast and was pretty good. I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm out that way to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I had a bloody mary for lunch, because it seemed to be the best option. 1 star because i can't give zero."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great staff and extensive menu. Kids loved the children's menu. House Italian dressing is delicious. And our favorite is the rigatoni with vodka sauce. Caution - it is a little spicy. Definitely a go-to in the area for homemade Italian food!"}
{"text":"Restaurant decor is nice. Relaxed atmosphere.  Service was good.  My wife and I both had rigatoni with meatballs and I also ordered a side of sausage.  I had a side salad with parm. peppercorn dressing which was very good. My wife had the Wedding soup which was somewhat tart.  The meatballs and sausage were homemade but somewhat bland and the sauce was mild.  Overall, a kind of middle-of-the-road experience."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Have been to Santosuossos' many times over the last 10 years.  Vodka Rigatoni is their best and our family favorite.  The Pasta Carbonara is nice too.  This is my son's favorite pizza for take out.  While it may be a bit pricey, the food and service is consistent and high quality."}
{"text":"The food here is okay but not worth the price point. The service is very slow and the staff doesn't show any sense of urgency. Will not go again."}
{"text":"This place brings me back to a good time in life. The portions are large, the drinks are strong, and the environment beats it all. It is fantastic to see and owner that cares this much about the environment he has created. George is always walking around, saying hello, and making sure everything is above satisfactory, but don't let this fool you because although he may have a calm demeanor, he might be in the back cooking up food and running the kitchen. Santosuosso's also does a great job catering and hosting parties in the back room!"}
{"text":"Had veal Marsala and hubby had Veal Parm.   We were VERY disappointed.  Veal was tough and  Marsala sauce was almost non existent. Hubbys veal also tough and the sauce tasted like it was from a can.   Waitstaff cheerful and friendly.   WE have eaten here before and found. The food this time subpar!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but the wait staff is what makes or breaks a meal. Tonight the waitstaff was not good. My drink was empty way to long. He would disappear into the back room. Bread should have come with the drink and it did not. Had the spicy shrimp, chicken Marsala with angel hair pasta and an extra piece of chicken, rigatoni with vodka spice all was wonderful as always. I always like this place because of the great food quality and the nice size portion.  Always call for reservations."}
{"text":"I feel like over a year ago this place was amazing and I would have given a 5 star review. However the last couple times we've eaten here the food quality has not been as amazing. Maybe there's a new chef? I want the old one back, I used to lovvvveeee it!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, we have always gone to this restaurant for our office Christmas party for years! Today was the worst! Our food was cold, or order was not completed properly. Server disappeared after food was brought to table, he had a guaranteed 20% tip added to our bills due to party size, so he didn't have to worry about our needs I guess. He finally came back much later with checks. Spoke to the manager and he could not have cared less!  I guess this decided for us to go somewhere else next and next Christmas!"}
{"text":"Took the wife and son out to our usual Friday night dinner. We are trying every restaurant in our neighborhood hoping to find some highlights. This was not one of them.   I ordered chicken Marsala and a Stella Artois beer. Our server was friendly and efficient, but the atmosphere in the back room where they sat us was uninviting. My son's \"kids pizza\" was tiny. Luckily, I ordered him fries too, which were pretty good.  The food was average, nothing special. We're hunting for really good food. We'll probably try it again just to see if other menu items are above average. There's gotta be something here that knocks our socks off. But, maybe not."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Took 45 minutes and 3 requests to get a glass of water.  Food tasted like soap.  Chicken was slimy."}
{"text":"We were in the are and randomly chose this restaurant. We were quickly seated and.service was prompt. The smells of great italian food had greeted us at the door, so we all chose pasta. All were really good, hot and came with a salad and crusty bread.  Portions were good and we all took leftovers home for today...which were so good. I NEVER write reviews but enjoyed our dinner so much that I had to comment. Prices were in line with any other nice restaurant. We will be back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Two for dinner on our first visit and four of us on the 2nd.  So, this review is based on two visits.  Overall, we found the food to be good, but not extraordinary.  Lots of items to choose from.  In general, the food seems to be priced fairly -- with a couple of notes.  We don't understand the up-charge of $2 for whole wheat pasta and we wonder why two dinners ordered at the same time were priced differently.  Beer and wine prices are a bit too high for this sort of place, I think:  $6.00 for a craft brew and $7 for a glass of house wine.  The options vis-a-vis beer were rather limited.  Overall, the service averaged to \"good.\"  Better the 2nd time than the first -- by far.  Would we return?  Sure.  But we'll visit some other places first."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here tonight because I kept suggesting we come back. I love quiet atmospheres where we can talk without having to yell and I can feel myself beginning to relax. This place gives me that in spades.   The food is another reason I love this place. From the fresh bread, garlic cheese bread appetizer, house salad with thousand island, and Shrimp Scampi over Angel hair Pasta in a butter/garlic sauce, everything was better than homemade.   The wait staff was very attentive without being annoying.    I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Totally agree with the other reviews - service is absolutely horrendous. Hostess girls are so rude and disorganized. Food is ehhhh at best. I've tried this place twice hoping it was just a fluke but it's definitely the norm. They don't need your business or care about it - and that seems to drive their attitude you being there is an inconvenience to them. Don't waste your time and money to have a bad meal and bad service."}
