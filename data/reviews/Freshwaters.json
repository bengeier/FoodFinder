{"text":"The food was very good, and I had a lot for what I paid. The cajun chicken was extremely good! The sides (rice and gravy, mac n cheese) were good, but not the best I've ever had. The service was good as well, topped by the owner coming by to ask how my meal was. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It is an assuming place that is tucked in a little shopping center in4thward.  Upon entering the owner happily greeted me.  She was very welcoming and generally seemed to appreciate my business.  The wait staff was very friendly and tried hard to please.  Now to the food.  It was delicious and the servings are large.  I had the fried catfish New Orleans style, which had a brown gravy and shrimp on to top/  When I tell you it was sooooo good!  I also had the saut√©ed cabbage and mac and cheese for side which were also tasty.  The four stars is because they don't currently serve any alcohol, I was anticipating getting a hurricane, but they are working on developing the bar.  In the meantime, it is BYOB.  Again, the owner is really sweet.  She promised my 2 yr old some ice cream if he ate his food.  He did and she fulfilled her promise.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the restaurant on Father's Day.  This was our first visit. There was a special menu for us to order from instead of the regular one. My husband and I ordered a NY Strip. We asked the waitress the size of the steak and she said she said she thought 10 ozs. He ordered his to be cooked medium and I asked for mine to be cooked  medium rare to medium. His was to be blackened and when he got it, it was cooked well done and did not appear to be blackened the way we are used to getting at restaurants. My steak was also cooked well done.  We both told our waitress and she apologized and said she would have more steaks cooked for us. One of the owners told my husband she would have another one cooked for him and wanted to make sure how my husband wanted it cooked. She told him that it was due to the cut of meat they had. She never checked in with me. The other owner or chef came out with the steaks and said rudely that if he knew we wanted them medium rare he would have cooked them that way.   Our steaks were actually cooked rare, but we could tolerate that better. The steaks had a lot of fat on them also - almost 4 ozs on my husband's. The owner checked back with my husband and when he showed her all the fat on the steak, she offered to get him something else. She asked him if he wanted to try the short ribs. She told him they were actually better than the steak. She told him that it was due to the cut of steak they had.I had also asked the owner if the lemonade was freshly squeezed and she told me it was. When I got it, it tasted like a mix. I switched it for an Arnold Palmer which tasted much better. The tea had juices mixed in it and there was pulp, but interestingly enough the lemonade did not have any pulp. I discussed the steaks with the owner and she told me that her husband is the chef and he said that medium cooked steaks do not have any pink in them. I told her that my husband is a chef and that there is pink in a medium cooked steak. She then told me that they normally do not have steak on the menu and it was  offered due to Father's day. She offered to provide me with a dessert which I accepted. My husband had already gone out before I spoke to the owner and he said he would have definitely discussed how steaks should appear when cooked to different temperatures. We originally went there because we wanted to try the New Orleans Louisiana cuisine but stayed even though they were not offering the items off their standard menu. We were not pleased with the food and the response of the owners. The waitress we had did take care of us to the best of her ability."}
{"text":"Went in early March for a celebratory birthday dinner.  I used to visit the restaurant when they were in Plainfield, NJ.  It was nice to see they had moved to Charlotte.  I am not big on seafood, so I had the pork chops, cabbage, ( which is great) and the macaroni & cheese and rice & gravy ( little salty).   Parking is terrible, but I do like to support black owned restaurants.  Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Today We all ate at the Freshwater restaurant in the Forth Ward since we are  visiting Charlotte NC. for the CIAA  ... First I must say the restaurant was absolutely stunning. Second thing ,was that the that the staff absolutely polite courteous and attentive. The owner met us at the door and her introduced  herself and began to explain the restaurant the menu and their experience in cooking New Orleans style cuisine for over 20 years.The first thing that they brought out to us  was the cornbread muffins. They were not what we have become accustomed to when it comes to a soulful cornbread muffin. It was northern style but we're down south so if you love Martha Stewart cornbread then you'll love these !!! Now if you love Patti Labelle cornbread skip them there not worth the Calories .The second thing Was my seafood platter.... i am from the Washington DC area So when it comes to Crab Cakes  these we're terrible!!! Because I am a Marylander and we have the best Crab Cakes in all of the World !!! I just shouldn't of order them !!!! its probably just a Chesapeake bay thing with us . If you never had a real Jumbo Lump Crab cake from Maryland then you'll love them Hahahahahah !!! Third thing was the the Ribs they were fair .. A simple oven baked Rib with Barbecue Sauce nothing fantastic... The Pecan Crusted Catfish was Fair the rice & gravy was OK the Greens we're cut up very small and reminds us of glory Greens in the Can .. The Mac&Cheese was a Truly disappointing you can not have a restaurant in North  Carolina Be Successful without having Fantastic Mac&Cheese... Now after saying all of That I must Say Freshwater has the BEST CATFISH NUGGET & Catfish I have every had !!!! Period .....Light ,Crispy ,Golden, Flakey & Fantastic... Sharon & her Husband (the Chef) should Change the name of this Restaurant to \"Carolina Catfish\" I will eat here again in One Years Time when I come back for CIAA to see if anything has changed but until then the only thing I would eat here would be The Catfish & please Tip the Staff well they are doing the best that they can with the Cards they were dealt  ..."}
{"text":"This has become one of my husband and I favorite restaurants!! The thing we love the most is how friendly the owners and staff are, the owner always makes sure she comes to speak and tell us about the menu. It is such a family atmosphere and they make you feel so welcome. The food is great as well! Love the salmon, shrimp and crab cakes. I haven't had a bad experience to date."}
{"text":"I attended a Jazzy Friday event and it was nice.  The singer sounded great and was engaging.  There were cocktail specials to accompany the usual menu. It was a good time."}
{"text":"I have not had such great Cajun in longer than I can remember. The jambalaya and gumbo are absolutely incredible! Just as good for dessert is the chefs bread pudding he recommend to have mixed with peach cobbler. Wow! If I wasn't training for a marathon I'd eat that everyday.  The location is not in a super busy area but it is a quaint and cozy place. The staff is very hospitable as well. I wish they would open up shop in Winston-Salem but if not I'll just have to keep making the trip down for that flavorful southern food.   Thank you Freshwater for the experience and making my road trip home from ATL end with a full belly and smiles!"}
{"text":"The food and service here was excellent! We went for lunch and had the catfish, greens, and red beans and rice, all excellent! Great atmosphere as well. The price was a little high for lunch, as we paid 9.50 for 1 catfish fillet and 2 sides, but again service and atmosphere made it worth it. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This was my first time for me and my coworker going to this restaurant the decor was beautiful the staff was very nice and the food was amazing I can't wait to go back and try something different. I had the shrimp etouffee and cabbage. The only downside is I would like to have had some more of the etouffee and my bowl."}
{"text":"Five star food and service! I've been here two nights in a row! I first came with the ladies and was so impressed I came back again for date night! Live jazz night! The food is amazingly flavored and seasoned. Grilled crab cakes and catfish were both two thumbs up for me! Crab cakes are all crab meat and flavor! For sides I tried collards, cabbage, and yams. Everything delicious! Try the uptown drink! I got sweet potato cheesecake to go because I had to try a dessert too and let me tell you if you like cheesecake you need to try this one!!!! Ahhhhmazing!!!! As a dessert specialist, I could tell by eying the layer cakes at the bar that they would be most excellent. I will try those next time. Small top shelf bar. Service was great! Everyone here is really sweet. This just became a regular spot for us! I will bring family here when they come to town. Only need a reservation for large parties. Free parking a breeze for uptown right in front of the building."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about patronizing this place after reading the reviews but I thought I'd give it a try for myself.  I'm so glad I did. Everything was fabulous - the owner, the servers, the food, the ambiance. A diehard fan of crab cakes, I had to try those. Delicious! My party and I also tried the cabbage (a must try); the collards; the mac and cheese; the potato salad (awesome); the ribs (fall-off-the-bone good) and the candied yams (the best I've ever tasted and I'm a true Southern girl).  My only regret is that I can't go back there for dinner again tonight!"}
{"text":"This restaurant really does have potential and the food is AMAZING however, the service is SOOOOOOOOOO SLOW! I feel really bad for the waiter Steven because he is doing the best that he can but I feel like they are working him too hard.  He is the only waiter for lunch and dinner! The first time I went to the restaurant, I had the crab cake, mac and cheese, and yams.  The second time I went, I had a pork chop, mac and cheese, and yams.  The crab cake is absolutely delicious but you can do without the pork chop.  I will definitely visit again however, they need to hire more help because bad service will definitely outweigh the good food. If you are visiting on your lunch break plan to be gone 1 1/2. Freshwaters, please get your act together!"}
{"text":"Cute & cozy place! Great seafood! Great service! Have tried and loved the crab cakes, gumbo,  catfish etouffee, and salmon!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise find.  We're not exactly sure how it got on our radar during a quick net search leaving IKEA on a Sunday afternoon.  Crab cakes & gumbo are a must (assuming gumbo is your soup of the day when you go). Fall off the bone St Louis ribs.  Jambalaya was generous in portion and quite tasty.  Coconut cake!  Needless to say we were quite stuffed & quite happy with plenty of leftovers to take back to our AirBnb.  And the staff?  Wow, they really treated us like family.  A welcoming, inclusive environment.  We look forward to coming back on a return trip to the Queen City."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise. I loved that they didn't use pork in the collards and saut√©ed cabbage. Both were great. Had the crab cakes fried, they were pretty good. Nice flavor. The catfish bites were nicely done. The music was a good addition. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really hate to leave bad reviews but this deserves the one star. My boyfriend and I went for dinner one night and received awful service and our food was cold by the time we got it. We heard about the restaurant from the owners son while out in the city. We thought it would be a good idea to check it out after the son insisted he owned the restaurant. Actually turns out the son doesn't own the restaurant and the parents do. In my opinion just a bad marketing look. He was out drunk prompting a business for his parents, just not a good look."}
{"text":"Smh... what a terrible experience! We arrived for a birthday dinner, however, we had no place setting, no silver ware, no inquiry into drink orders, and not a care from the staff or owner for over an HOUR! While listening to the excuses from the waitresses and the chatter amongst other diners, Freshwaters was short staffed. Communication of that circumstance from the owner would have made a world of difference.  The FOOD:  Mac n cheese- from a box. Gross.  Crab cakes- Meh. Underwhelming.  Fried shrimp - was tough for such a juicy looking, lightly battered appetizer. This leads me to believe that the shrimp is purchased pre-COOKED and they simply batter it and throw it in the fryer for a couple minutes. Very tough consistency.  Fried catfish appetizer - had the same batter as the shrimp which is always disappointing. Switch it up. If I pieced the small pieces of fish together, I'd say they chopped up a half of filet of catfish and labeled it as an appetizer. The portion size was unacceptable.  Shrimp creole - was swimming in water from the tomatoes used in the sauce. The sauce was obviously tomatoes, accompanied by some other vegetables, which was then thrown into the food processor, saut√©ed for a couple of minutes, then accompanied by those tough pre-cooked shrimp. That sauce deserved to be cooked low and slow for hours to reduce and develop the deeper flavors. Then, we wouldn't have to deal with that pesky raw veggie flavor enhanced only with salt and swimming in tomato water. Deplorable.  Catfish etouffee - was brown sauce seasoned with salt. Disappointing.  Everything tasted as though it was seasoned with salt alone. It was a no pepper, no garlic powder, no onion powder, no paprika, no creole seasoning zone.  Who are the Owners trying to fool? Charlotte is full of well traveled foodies who also love to cook at home. Why should I spend my hard earned cheddar in your restaurant when I could cook your chefs under the table from my own kitchen at home?  You have got to do better."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, awesome food and great service! The owner greeted us as we entered and really enjoyed our conversation. The gumbo, catfish, crab cakes and greens were amazing. Most food is cooked in a turkey based opposed to pork and it tasted wonderful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a jewel in the Queen City! The service here is awesome...as well as the food. There are so many meal choices and I love that the sides are all cooked in smoked turkey and the meats are cooked in olive oil. I ordered the veggie plate, my husband had the porkchops and my mom had the fried catfish. I don't think you can go wrong. The owner's wife and our server  were both very welcoming to our family....even to my one year old who dropped cornbread all over the place! We live an hour away but will definitely return. I would certainly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent cajun food. Most memorable were the blackened shrimp and the crabcake. The cornbread muffins and the macaroni and cheese were also good though not outstanding.   Ample portions are served so you will not leave hungry.  The service is very good and the staff is friendly. We will likely return the next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Was really good. I had the garlic shrimp, mac and cheese and cabbage...yum....I wasn't a fan of the peach cobbler...it was a bit loose and runny....."}
{"text":"My husband was recommended this restaurant by a family member.  We decided to check it out, it's more of a casual down home places. We were greeted upon arrival by the hostess who made her rounds to all of the patrons in the restaurant. There was a Soul/Jazz musician who performed. On to the good stuff the food. Food was made to order. We selected the wing meal with 2 homemade sides (tried the mac and Cheese, yams, and rice and gravy). The wings were delicious with a nice blend of seasonings, they were also very plump and the food was hot. The favorite of the sides were the yams. They also offered cornbread, it was okay not my favorite but non the less hot and warm. Overall great for a casual night out for soul food. Range $15-30 per entree."}
{"text":"We give it  3.5*s. Owner was very personable. Price point may seem a little steep, but when you receive your entrees you will notice that they don't skimp. The shrimp were nice and large and plentiful.  The crabcakes were just as described with no filler and were pretty good. Could have used a dash more of spices. We loved that all vegetables are turkey based. Complimentary corn muffins were just the right balance of sweet and corn. Decor is dark and elegantly masculine. Service was courteous,  yet could have been a little more attentive.  Have some kinks to work out and would suggest a small and simple side salad to accompany the dinner entrees/no side or 1 side items. Will back and try their lunch variety."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. The place was nearly empty and service was ok. I ordered the New Orleans cat fish. Apparently, the server only heard me say catfish so I ended up with catfish without the shrimp or brown sauce. They brought the brown sauce on the side, but didn't bring me the shrimp. Instead, they just charged me for the regular catfish. I really wanted my shrimp, but as slow as the service was, I figured I wouldn't get my shrimp in good time. Their special drink (basically an Arnold Palmer) was good.   Food seemed to be lacking salt. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We visited on Sunday 6/24, and arrived shortly after they opened at 1:00pm. We were greeted and seated promptly. I ordered the Uptown which is a take on a ArnoldPalmer...really good. The server asked if this was our first visit and if so, Mrs. Fresh would come over and walk us through the menu. We received some corn muffins while we waited. Mrs. Fresh came over, nice lady! She explained(complained) she was short staffed and then walked us through the menu. Decent prices but not really a Cajun/creole restaurant despite the selection. I ordered the blackened salmon, mac &cheese and greens. My husband ordered the ribs, yams and green beans. Took awhile but when our food came it was pretty good! The mac & cheese was baked and creamy!! Greens were bland, but fresh. My salmon was a bit over cooked. My hubs ribs were tender and he liked the sauce, you can tell the were crockpot ribs not smoked on a grill. He liked the yams too, but the greens beans were over cooked, bland and seemed like they were frozen French cut. Generous portions, we both had a to go box. Due to the short staff, refills on the drinks were not offered and we didn't get to see the desserts either. My hubs said we'd eat here again. I agree. Hopefully they will hire reliable people. I don't understand why the are open for lunch during the week. Location is not ideal for Uptown workers with an hour lunch. I'd open for lunch on Friday- Sunday."}
{"text":"I love Cajun/Creole style food, I was expecting the food to be great but it was better. No need to add any salt or hot sauce here. I had the Catfish etouffee and it was delicious!!!!!!! The service was awesome.  I'm definitely coming back to Freshwaters.  Great location, great atmosphere   Looking forward to trying the jambalaya   If I could give them 6 stars I would"}
{"text":"The old Simmon's is now Freshwaters and they have completely renovated the location with lots of lovely art and music and it's absolutely beautiful.  I stopped by for lunch but they were only serving dinner...weird...but ok.  I tried the catfish fish fritters and crab cake and both were well seasoned and very tasty.  The crab cake was all crab....awesome:-)  I didn't eat in, but looking forward to going back.   (This review is from when they first opened)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and atmosphere . The owners wife is the hostess and welcomed us . The owner is the chef ..Service was great . Definitely recommend this place. We will return"}
{"text":"You MUST GO HERE NOW!!!! My husband and I were debating if I should write this review- I'm selfish and want to keep this place all to myself, and my husband said I must share. Well, I don't remember how I came across this restaurant but we are so glad that we came here.  As soon as you walk in, the staff is greeting you. Shawna was our server. She is super sweet and super helpful. She gave us recommendations and was patient with us Our order:  Appetizer: fried crab cake  Theeeee best crab cake my husband and I have ever had. There is no breading in it, all crab, very tasty.  Entrees: shrimp √©touffee, salmon and shrimp Sides: cabbage, candied yams, red beans and rice   The food was so good, we switched plates half way through the meal. The shrimp √©touff√©e was so good. The gravy was delicious, and the cabbage was perfectly cooked.  The salmon and shrimp was nothing short of amazing! The piece of salmon was huge, but extremely moist and very flavorful, as were the shrimp. The yams were perfect!!! The red beans and rice were good.  I wanted to take food for lunch, but we couldn't stop eating. My husband even asked about dessert, which he never does. He ordered the carrot cake. The carrot cake capped off our perfect meal. It was moist and flavorful and we could not eat the very last bite. Seriously, my belt couldn't hold on any longer!!!   I even ordered from the Wednesday wine selection. Shawna suggested a red, which I didn't care for initially but it was ok. She ended up bringing what I initially ordered.  I kept waiting for something bad to happen but it never did.  The owner came over and we spoke for a few minutes. She too, is absolutely lovely.  Freshwaters gets 5 stars across the board: for food, service, and ambiance. I am already planning our next visit.  Do yourself a favor and go there. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Pre-booked a special occasion reservation for a large party. We waited an hour for bread and 30 minutes for water. Our food was cold and many of our guest waited 2 hours or more before food came out. Our guest began leaving due to frustration and hunger. No one including the owners ever once came out to apologize. They were out of short ribs and dark chicken which is what some of our guest wanted to order. The owner Mrs Freshwater argued with our guests which caused them to leave. We were never offered anything for our inconvenience, not even a complimentary appetizer for the unacceptable 2 hour wait. Our server wasn't informed about the menu nor what they offered.  Poor management and customer relation skills all around. Our group was overall disappointed and many left dissastified with the poor treatment and lack of concern by the owner. At best, it's a mom and pop shop and should not offer large party service until they are prepared to professionally accommodate the guests. Will not return nor will we recommend."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely wonderful! The food was really good and so was the service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A couple years ago Sharon and Cliff Freshwater moved from NJ to Charlotte to offer their spin on Cajun/Southern cuisine.  They went into the location where Simmon's used to be (a divey soul food joint in 4th Ward that closed around 2010).  They have done a great job remodeling and bringing it up to standards.  I liked the ambience (great jazz spinning on the CD), which may be better suited for evening dining than my lunch grab on a busy day.    Sharon waited on me at the bar and filled me in on their vision, Cliff's training with Paul Prudhomme, and being raised in East Carolina.  'Nuff said.  Chef Cliff cooked up a great grilled catfish with his special brown sauce (think etfouffee with its deep tones and rich flavors).  Mmmm.  I should have ordered a double!  The collards, however, let me down which I thought needed an extra day simmering with smoked pigs feet and hot sauce getting all happy with the greens.  Mac-n-cheese was a good riff on a Southern classic.  I think Freshwater's is a needed restaurant in this sector.  They are trying to put a more upscale spin on what is typically diving joints near industrial centers.  I say, \"Give 'em a Whirl!\""}
{"text":"Wow, it's not often that restaurant surprises me but this one certainly did. The food really exceeded our expectations. The ribs were amazing. The owners make a point to make you feel welcome and really care about the customer's experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I left without ordering dinner!  I attended a financial seminar at this restaurant last evening. Had I not attended this seminar, I would have never patronized this restaurant.  After I sat myself at my table, I was approached by two young waitresses. I thought it was a bit much, or maybe one of them was in training or something. I asked for a drink menu or if there were any drink specials, and the owner, Sharon, charges my table, interrupts the waitress as she was answering my question and proceeds with telling me the wine options! Now, I have three waitresses at my table!  I thought that was so very rude, unprofessional and so not necessary! So, I divert my attention back to the waitress and ask for a glass of wine.  The owner, Sharon, barks at the waitress to \"write it down!\" Just nasty! So midway through the hour long financial seminar, the owner informs the keyboardist to start playing. He begins playing music, very loud, while the presenter was speaking!! So rude! I decided right then, I was leaving after the presentation and would never patronize this restaurant! I had called my husband to bring our daughter and meet me at the restaurant for dinner, but I quickly cancelled those plans and left!!"}
{"text":"Seafood platter was legit. Real soul food, cooked with heart. Owner came out to speak with us and her husband is the chef. Will be coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I NEED this place to stay open forever! I am so picky with my food esp new Orleans style, having been there and eaten until I was a out to burst! This place is amazing! You need to go here. Everything was amazing! Perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Our waitress was so lovely. The owner came to the table. I was so impressed with the food that my boyfriend and I ordered three entres and dessert! I seriously considered asking for a cot in the back so I would never have to leave. Everything and I mean everything was delicious. I will be back. Again and again and again....."}
{"text":"We came in party of 13 after a event for CiAA , we were seated very quickly even tho it was jam packed . Atmosphere was great very welcoming and The Food was TOP NOTCH .  I'm still thinking about the cabbage and potatoe salad. Thank You fresh waters you truly are a 5star restaurant"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had arrived a little bit early before they opened. The owner welcomed us in and opened early. The dining room has very pleasant lighting and smooth jazz. I had the fried crab cakes on the chef's recommendation with collard greens and red beans. I thought the red beans could have been soupier and spicier but the crab cake was to die for. There was no breading whatsoever, just a generous portion of lump crab and seasoning. They have live music on Friday nights, a weekend brunch and are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I tried Freshwaters for the first time Wednesday. The staff was friendly. The restaurant is beautiful. The corn muffin was delish! I had shrimp etouffee over grits. It was well seasoned. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the shrimp had tails on. I'm looking forward to going back, maybe for Friday night jazz."}
{"text":"Went in Tuesday for the crab cake special. All the food was amazing! I had the mac and cheese, cabbage, and green beans! They had a limited spirit menu, I couldn't get a dirty martini, but everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"Read other reviews, thinking they just had a bad day so decided to try the restaurant.    Told server it was our first visit, celebrating wedding anniversary. After delivering water and explaining menu, server left. Why did we have to wait  20+ minutes to try to place our order. Someone else was trying to get the servers attention to no avail.  We decided life was too short, so we left.  Would love to support minority owned business but in the service industry it's all about keeping the customer happy. We were not happy, left to go to a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"My dad and I happened upon this great, friendly restaurant while walking around the 4th Ward area. The service was warm and welcoming. Our sever recommended a few house favorites; the crab cakes & pecan crusted catfish. We had both with some collard greens and okra and tomatoes. Everything was fresh and came out piping hot.  Don't skip dessert. We had the peach cobbler - fantastic'"}
{"text":"Being a New Orleans boy I just had to try it. There interesting thing is they don't cook with pork which for me is usually a deal killer. But I was in a generous mood so I decided to take them up on that and Was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the jambalaya and it was excellent. All the vegetables are fresh and they have pretty good corn muffins. I put a bug in the ear of the chef and maybe next time they will have French bread. This is a nice, cozy and comfy restaurant tucked away in the 4th Ward."}
{"text":"A group of twelve of us visited here after church today.  We'd all heard about it and some have visited here before.  Wow!  What a difference from Simmons.  The d√©cor is absolutely beautiful, even the bathroom is very nice and clean.  I had blackened salmon, sweet potatoes and string beans.  Everything was delicious.  The salmon was so tender.  Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food.  We loved talking to our waitress who was from France.  I'd heard varying reviews of the restaurant.  All restaurants have to work out their kinks.  This was my first time visiting and I was very impressed.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place so I decided to visit this Friday with my man and 5 year old. We arrived at 7:20 and proceeded to wait to be seated like the sign at the empty host stand read. After about 2 minutes a server walks past and says how they will be right with us, we waited another 3 minutes or so and a different server walks past and says the same thing. So we decided to sit and wait on the comfortable couch at the front door. We saw many open tables right in front of us. It seemed like the lady manager was more focused on the jazz show starting than she was greeting paying guests. Needless to say no one ever came, we decided it was no longer worth the wait at about 7:40. Terrible experience. My son was very hungry and we had to leave and find another restaurant in uptown Charlotte on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Delicious Food, Great service it is now my go to place for meetings and out of town guest. I have been to New Orleans for business and fell in love with the culture and food and now Charlotte has a taste of New Orleans here."}
{"text":"My colleague and I are in town for a conference and decided we wanted some good Southern food for dinner.  Based on the Yelp ratings and the menu, we tried Freshwaters.  They did not disappoint.  The staff was very friendly, explaining the menu and noting that everything is made to order.  My colleague ordered the grilled trout and said it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I had wonderful catfish fingers and a side of red beans and rice.  If I'd saved room for dessert, I would loved to have tried the pineapple cake.  Would totally go there again.  Thanks for a fantastic dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful southern food. Hit the spot. Mom (the owner) is the epitome of southern hospitality. You must come try her coconut pineapple cake. Everything is made from scratch. You can taste the love."}
{"text":"Had grilled catfish & shrimp in brown sauce w/collard greens and green beans. Fish was excellent, beans were good, greens were just OK but went good w/the cornbread muffins. My wife had her \"Phylliss\" platter blackened, crab cake was maybe the best I've ever had, virtually all crab. $37 for both orders (and I had a $40 for $24 LivingSocial, which made everything even better;)  One drawback was heat. AC must've been out or not working well, they had many ceiling fans going which made it tolerable. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of those times when I wish that Yelp allowed for half stars.  This restaurant ranks between a 3 and 4 but I will round up and call this place a solid 4.   This place considers themselves a fine dining restaurant. I will say that it is hard to find a soul food restaurant in Charlotte that doesn't serve their food in styrofoam so if you are looking for a place like that, this isn't it.  When you first enter the restaurant you the tables are set using chargers and all. There is some african american art on the walls for decor and a fountain with water.  I think this place has potential.  As for the food, I order the seafood sampler which came with a crab cake,  4 shrimp and fried catfish.  They also serve cornbread before the meal but in my opinion it didn't taste very fresh at all but the people I was dining with loved it.  I will say that crab cake was amazing and I wish I would have just order those.  You can actually taste and see the crab in the cake.  I don't recall there being any flour in the crab cake. The catfish was decent but I think I personally could have used a little more seasoning in the batter on the catfish. The two sides I ordered were collard greens and macaroni and cheese.   I could have done without the macaroni and cheese because it wasn't very cheesy to me.  As for the collard greens I wish their was a little kick to them but again that is personal preference because the people I was dining with really enjoyed them.  Overall, this is a decent restaurant.  It isn't your typical soul food place you will find in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Expertly seasoned food with ample portions makes Freshwaters a great 4th Ward find. This is Southern comfort food without the usual guilt. The giant bowl of Jambalaya I ordered made two meals. My husband had the grilled blackened Salmon with a side of greens. Conveniently located in a pleasant walking distract means that ordering desert can be justified -  fresh made warm peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that my grandmother would have been jealous of. The atmosphere was relaxing, influences of the New Orleans Jazz and Blues vibe makes this a great spot for entertaining friends or for special occasions. The welcoming staff did not mind my stopping in dressed in casual attire on a whim, strolling by with my spouse. This place has the charm of a neighborhood favorite but so good you have to tell all your friends about it. I can't wait to try the crab cakes next time - friends of mine said they are delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place through Living Social and decided to give it a try and man are we happy we did; the food was spectacular... Fresh, delicious, beautiful presentation and generous portions. I had the pecan crusted catfish and my husband had the pork chops neither of us were even slightly disappointed. To add to the charm the service and people were some of nicest we've come across in the city. Super friendly staff... We'll definitely be heading back to this place really soon. The only reason I'm not leaving 5 stars is because the cocktail bar isn't open yet. Soon I hope ..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since the majority of the reviews were good. However, I am very disappointed that I did. We arrived at 146 for a 2:00 reservation we made two weeks prior. We were seated right away but it took twenty minutes before someone came over and took our drink order. They placed lukewarm corn muffins on the table and left. After another twenty minutes we had to pull a server aside and ask who was our waitress because we hadn't received our drinks. Finally she took our order again and brought us our drinks, apologizing that they hadn't arrived yet.   We ordered our food at 2:30. That time frame is unacceptable. It shouldn't take 45 minutes for someone to come over and take our order. But the real problem arose as we were waiting for our food. It took almost two hours for our food to come out. Our server kept apologizing for the wait but the owner/manager didn't bother to come and tell us what the problem was. Once our food arrived it was bland and needed seasoning. But by this time we were so hungry we didn't care.   When the manager finally came over to our table, she gave us excuses rather than trying to appease our group. She stated that the kitchen was trying to do the takeout orders as well as the dining room. Her comment was \"We had to shut down the takeout menu. Notice the phone stopped ringing.\" Not understanding what that had to do with anything because other restaurants are able to operate fully producing food for the dining room and to-go orders. Then she stated \"We make everything from scratch, made to order.\" So do most other restaurants.   The final clincher was that the manager came back over and gave us some 10% off coupons for our next visit. Some people in our party had ordered some to-go items and still hadn't received them after we had been waiting for more than 2 1/2 hours. When the manager was asked about this her response was \"You already got your food.\" She then stated that we would not be discounted for that current meal, even though the service was lousy and extremely horrendous. Not our server. She was great and we could tell she was getting extremely frustrated with the kitchen as well. But the owner was horrible. She offered more excuses than solutions. And she never apologized for the service just an excuse. After her display of attitude towards our frustrations we placed the 10% coupons back on the table and stated we weren't coming back. We also wouldn't suggest the place to any of our friends for them to be subjected to the same attitude.  I can understand that our food might have taken a little longer because we were a party of 6. But there was a table where there we only 2 people and they were waiting as long as we were. A lady came in and sat down while we were still waiting and then she waited for 30 minutes before anyone came for her. She finally cancelled her order and went to the bar to speak with the manager and the woman ignored her.   I will never come back here. If she had been apologetic then maybe I would have kept the 10% off coupon. But her attitude and service skills are ridiculous. That's not how you do business. I don't respect people who treat their patrons like crap.   Edited: The owner had the audacity to call us and tell us that some of our party hadn't paid for their food. But she was the one who rang everyone up and closed out the checks. She said we were damaging her bottom line. No her crappy attitude and customer service is damaging her bottom line. Positive, I am never returning."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! Me and my fianc√© came here on a Thursday night. I love that they have a parking lot! Restaurant is nice and cozy. Decor is nice. This is honestly a perfect date night spot. They had someone playing the keyboard. I think his name was \"Groove\". We were immediately greeted when we walked in and got sat right away. I loved hearing the specials and the popular dishes to help us with our order from the owner. Staff was friendly and personable. We each got the seafood gumbo. It was delicious and flavorful! I got crab cake, catfish and grilled shrimp all blackened style. My side items were potato salad and red beans and rice. Potato salad was good and smooth. It's yellow based which I like! Red beans and rice had a good flavor. I added hot sauce to it to spice it up. My fianc√© got the salmon. It was the biggest piece we've ever seen from a restaurant! Slightly crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth in the inside. He said it was cooked perfectly. He also got okra and tomatoes and collard greens. Music wasn't too loud and the ambiance was just right. Staff was caring and knowledgable. I would definitely go back, especially on Thursdays when they have music! You can tell all their food was fresh and home made and that they genuinely care. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was my second choice due to other southern place I wanted to eat at was closed for lunch. I am so happy it worked out this way. This place not only had amazing food but also had the friendliest, nicest, accommodating staff ever. I had Crab cake which was delish. I got it fried but thinking grilled would have let me taste all that fresh crab even more. My daughters both got the catfish. One pecan encrusted and one etouffee. Both amazing. Green beans were overlooked bit so if you like them but crunchier just ask. Collard greens just like I like them. Red beans and rice fab. Cornbread was good but they need honey. Chef Cliff Freshwater came out to table and met us. He recommended trying the bread pudding side by side with peach cobbler and man was hat combo and party in my mouth. They were so kind they wrapped our leftovers and gave us extra fish and dessert for our flight back home to Cali. Thanks Shonna, Crystal and Tanya!! Made our one meal in Charlotte amazing. My kids loved it. And the cocktail helped my flight"}
{"text":"The New Orleans Fried Catfish with candied yams and macaroni and cheese with an \"uptown\" for my drink."}
{"text":"I usually go to Freshwaters when I want fresh veggies unencumbered by a lot of grease, and they never disappoint me.  I love the cabbage, collard greens, and green beans!  And when I want to veer off course with my healthy eating, I endulge in their great mac & cheese and candied yams.  I love the fact that everything is so fresh, and not greasy at all. I only gave four stars due to the ambiance."}
{"text":"I was here with a party of six and we all loved this place!! The food was AWESOME, especially the crab cakes!! The owner was friendly and explained the menu items to us. Our server was good too.  We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Pleasant environment, polite staff but very bland food. Everything lacked basic seasoning. When I commented on it the owners explained that they intentionally do not season the food to allow the customer to order how they want it. Too bad they didn't tell us when we ordered."}
{"text":"How did I just find this place?  I drove past it for months and just ate lunch there for the first time. We were greeted by the owner Mrs Freshwater, she told us about the desserts first, and welcomed us. I ordered the New Orleans seafood, Mac and  cheese and collards. I was not disappointed! The fish was extremely fresh, well seasoned and a nice portion for lunch. The Mac and cheese has the perfect combo of cheeses. The collards were very well seasoned and cooked with turkey. I will definitely visit again and tell all of my friends about it!!"}
{"text":"Best soul food in Charlotte!! Atmosphere and people are fantastic! Ate here for a week start!"}
{"text":"Lived in New Orleans for 4 years, moved back to Charlotte. I was feeling a little homesick for the food, so I stopped into Freshwaters as there aren't many options for this type of food around. This did not disappoint. Friendly waitstaff, cornbread on the table (you know it's real when they put that out there). Got the crab cakes which were completely filled with crab, Mac & cheese, and string beans. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Where do I start 1st..We got such a good deal off of Living Social that I figured even if the food is mediocre..my husband & I would still have gotten our money's worth. Well low & behold what a nice almost tucked away gem..since it's in a small plaza..This restaurant belongs in the heart of the city! I ordered fried catfish w/geens & sauteed cabbage. .Omg..can you say simply delicious..so light crispy & fresh tasting..every bite! Could've had the catfish grilled blackened cajun or pecan crusted..My husbands' St.Louis Ribs fell off the bone..I had to beg him to let me taste 1 itty bitty piece. To top everything off the owner met & explained the menu & how everything is made to order & all veggies are seasoned w/smoked turkey. The decor, staff, the menu is Freshwaters' FINEST! I can't wait to return to try every single entree on the menu!  Come one  come all for fine Southern & New Orleans Cuisine.  Rosie B."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and freshly prepared to order and the owners are good stewards.  Charlotte is a very fickle community however that from my experience haven't supported good businesses like this restaurant and it was obvious by the lack of customers dining in when I visited recently.   The kinks in service needs attention.   Except for the outstanding service and attitude displayed by the young lady who had the dubious role of serving and tending bar; one server in particular was a little too vocal and abrasive in demeanor. The lack of professional servers alone is an unnecessary distraction.    This is a great restaurant with a delicious cuisine. It is surrounded by hundreds of residents occupying the many condos and apartments,  many which are in walking distance. I would like nothing more than to see them attract more business.  They are definitely worth a visit based on the food alone.   Wishing them the best going forward and although I reside in Huntersville NC ,  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO  And when you do get there, order the Phyllis seafood platter!   When I walked in I noticed pictures with multiple celebrities like Denzel Washington and Bill Clinton. I know why they decided to come to Freshwaters-because the service and food is straight fire.   Portions are big so come hungry.  Maybe ask for a to-go box in advance"}
{"text":"I walked into freshwaters at 6:25pm on a Sunday. They close at 7. Not only did they let me dine in but they were happy to do so. I received my order of crab cakes yams and Mac by the time I closed the menu. The food was piping hot and fresh. I was throughly impressed with their customer service. On top of that the food was AMAZING! I've found my new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"I always love the food here. I order the vegetarian plate with green beans potatoes yams and I have never been disappointed. Sometimes there is a wait but it's worth it"}
{"text":"A group of us came the day they first opened (I wasn't yelp savvy back then) and we were amazed at the food. Everything was extremely good! I was so happy to see that they are still open and doing well.   I ordered the fried shrimp as an appetizer and garlic chicken as the entree. The shrimp was crunchy,  hot and delicious. The cornbread muffin that came with it, not so much.  Then my entree arrived. It was shrimp (again)... I got my waitress' attention to let her know I ordered chicken. She was nice, said I could keep the shrimp (which she did end up coming back to get) as she ordered the chicken but not without  subtly implying that I did order the shrimp (as in to suggest that the mistake was mine and not hers). I felt prompted to gently correct her by informing her that I know I didn't order shrimp because I only like battered shrimp which is only offered as an appetizer.  As a result I ended up waiting an inordinate amount of time for 4 small bites of chicken. But overall, the sides were good and I will be back again."}
{"text":"This places serves more southern food in my opinion. The food is really good. I do think it is a little over priced due to type of establishment. I feel like prices are more high end and the restaurant itself isn't high end. The waitresses are always friendly and helpful. The female owner isn't always as friendly. The inside atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the service and management this evening. This was my first time at this restaurant and I would classify the management as lack luster based upon how they treated the presenters of a seminar that I attended.  While receiving valuable and life changing information from the presenter, management allowed a live band to begin to play and disrupt the seminar. Of the 27 patrons in the restaurant 25 were there for the seminar. There was no reason to begin the music during the presentation. Pure disrespect was displayed and an attitude which was reminiscent of what one would consider \"ghetto\". I will not return to this restaurant again as long as I am able to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our first visit to Freshwaters. The service was excellent. The food was outstanding. The atmosphere was great. We enjoyed the catfish and the salmon. If there were a drawback with the food it would have been the time it took for it to come out. Our server was on top of it and made up for the lengthy wait. The owner even came out to make sure we enjoyed our visit. GREAT JOB FRESHWATERS. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered crab cakes, mac n cheese and collards for lunch.  This was my first time at Freshwaters.  I must say it was good!  I will definitely be back as I love cajun & creole food.  My Mother grew up in Louisiana.  I know good cajun/creole food and the food outside of the state of Louisiana just does not compare.  The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is I felt the food was pretty high in sodium.  But being good ole southern food, that is what you'd expect."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place during lunch, its kinda hard to spot. We got there at 11:45p and had to wait till doors opened exactly at noon for lunch. We were quickly seated, our server was very nice and the manager was extremely hospitable, wonderful service and atmosphere. I ordered the fried crab cake with mac and cheese and collard greens. The food came out in good time. I loved the fact that the crab meat was seasoned and that there was no thick batter coating it. Despite being fried, it was extremely light and delish. The mac and cheese was good but, the collard greens came out really bitter and had a very porky aftertaste. It was my first time trying collard greens, maybe its not my thing...   Will be back for the crab cakes sometime! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Long story short: superior service. Welcoming and cozy atmosphere. Food didn't meet expectations however the portions were large."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with co-workers.  I really wanted to love this place because I have a special place in my heart for Simmons, which occupied the space before it.  While I found the staff friendly, the service was a little slow, and the food just okay.  Even though I ordered a grilled pork chop, they brought me a fried one.  However at that point I didn't have time to send it back.  My co-worker discovered what he thought was bones or something in his crab cake.  But he rolled with it anyway.    The lunch prices are reasonable, and the place is very well decorated. In the end, they emphasize the wrong aspects of the dining experience by over reaching.  For example, they take the time to put place settings at all tables, but they fail to get orders right.  My co-worker had a to-go order, and when he asked for a bag for his leftover entr√©e and dessert, the staff returned with two dinky brown paper bags which couldn't accommodate the containers.  What was particularly striking was while the owner was explaining their addition of jazz night and a full bar, she watched my friend struggle to squeeze the containers in the bag without any apologies or offer of assistance.  My advice is scale back the d√©cor, and hire more experienced staff for better service and quicker turnarounds on the tables.  Get larger bags for to go orders.  And drop the crab cake, it's not that great."}
