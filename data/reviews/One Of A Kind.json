{"text":"Seriously deteriorated. We've lived in the hood for 12 years and used to get take out quite frequently. Last night we tried them again. The order took 40 minutes when we were told 15-20. When I asked if they had started cooking it when I arrived to pick it up the surly waiter told me that it took 40 minutes to actually cook the meal. (really, I cook chicken parm at home in much less than 40 minutes). I asked him then to tell us 40 minutes next time if it really takes that long and he informed me that then our meal would be waiting and cold?? There will be no next time, this place is horrible. The neighbourhood has changed and it's no longer the only show in town."}
{"text":"Everyone in the hood told me this place was good and reasonable.  It was just okay for me. I feel I can make pasta at home as well and for less.  It's been there forever so must do something right...  It is what it is. Not a destination restaurant by any means. A good cheap alternative for food in a neighborhood, especially if you miss your Mama!"}
{"text":"The food ain't one of a kind.... and maybe it was a bad day for them but if a customer comes to you and asks for a take out menu , then you close your eyes and *sigh* (while giving them a flyer , not a proper menu), you make urself and your venue look ridiculous"}
{"text":"Forget pasta, this is the best steak in the city, hands down. The service is great, and it's a cute little place in a great neighbourhood. If I could eat here every week, I would."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've been to this restaurant once before and had a decent time of it. In fact, I went back because of some very dirty dreams I'd been having of their Shrimp Provencal appetizer.   Much to my chagrin, I learned that some things are better left to the dark recesses of my wilting memory.  We got there early, and despite the plethora of empty tables, we were shown one right by the open kitchen. Fine, I say, the better to serve me at. The wine list was adequate, and the prodigal (to my belly) Shrimp Provencal was fine, but will be staying out of my REM sleep in the future.  Somewhere between the appetizer and the slow-to-arrive main course, the kitchen's exhaust fan stopped working. Now, this would be less troublesome in the summer when the windows are open. But on that, the coldest day of the year thus far, we were treated to an aromatherapy session few can forget. You haven't experienced Italian food until you've done so with your nose running and your eyes watering. And may you never do so.  Then my main course arrived. I'd ordered the Zebra Linguine with Seafood or somesuch, and was to include mussels, shrimp, fish and lobster meat, and a salad. The salad arrived ON the pasta, which wilted it without delay. And as my nose was fully occupied trying to make a run for the exit, I had to rely on naught but my eager taste buds to salvage what was turning into a dinner from Dr. Mengele's Pasta Heaven. They tried valiantly but were unsuccessful.   Between the wilty (and by then, fraught with bitter disappointment) salad leaves, mediocre tomato sauce and... the worst ... overcooked seafood, the whole meal was an exercise in cutting one's losses. I could have borne all the misery and sensory smacks-in-the-face if the lobster had been cooked to succulent perfection, but it was overcooked and tasted tougher than chicken.   We didn't even bother to finish half our meals, just paid the bill and hurried out. On the plus side, once outside, we could breathe again. Worst meal I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Well another night another attempt at finding a good Italian delivery place. And another failure. The meat sauce was decent, albeit smelling pretty sweetly of nutmeg or cinnamon. The pasta was store-bought, not fresh. The same kind that comes in bags marked \"italpasta\". The carbonara sauce was full of cooked chunks of egg and little cheese.  Be warned when you order a side dish of broccoli, what you get is not cooked broccoli with olive oil, or garlic, lemon or Parmesan like you'd expect from An Italian place. You literally get a takeout tray of plain, steamed broccoli. For 895. Yeah.  But here's what gets the bad revirew: gets me is the meatballs. Not only horrid lumps of processed, condensed meat the consistency of wet mud, they were actually sour on the inside. They were disgusting, and immediately tossed in the trash. I have my suspicions they are the reason I've spent much of the past two days on the toilet. If you enjoyed that image, you can thank \"one of a kind\"."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 7 years now and I haven't been disappointed once.  The best mussels in town and their extensive pasta menu rivals many Italian places around the city.  I'm surprised to see how many people find the service to be off as I have only been raving about the friendly (and the same for years now) staff they have there.   Try the escargots and Indigo pasta.  Yum."}
{"text":"The food at One Of A Kind Pasta & Grill is excellent! Surprisingly excellent!   Our meal started out with complementary garlic bread, which was delicious and very fresh. We ordered the Butter Chicken spagetti and the Mac and Cheese and both were top notch. These dishes were completely different, but both were prepared with a level of skill that I was not expecting. My companion, who is of Indian descent and a self-described butter chicken snob, was very impressed with the flavour of the Butter Chicken sauce. The Mac and Cheese (rigatoni with Black Forest Ham and Peas in a Brie Cream Sauce but I got it without the ham) was fantastic, but quite different from what most people would expect when they order such a ubiquitous dish. The flavours were very nuanced; not bland but not obvious It's a bit hard to describe, but don't expect cheddar cheese sauce and a breadcrumb crust!     The portions were reasonable - not Olive-Garden massive but you definitely won't leave hungry -  and the prices were great. Dinner for two with drinks (but no dessert) came to about $55. We found the service quick and attentive, although the restaurant was not very busy on the night we were there.   I have to admit that I was a bit wary of this place initially - it doesn't look like much from the outside and I'm always suspicious of a large menu with seemingly random influences such as Indian and Asian (in addition to the obvious Italian theme), but somehow it all works. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Although I've living in the Queen West and Niagara for several years, I'd never been in to One of a Kind Pasta despite the rather quaint and kitschy ambience it seemed to offer. On a whim (and with a hankering for some yummy pasta), my boyfriend and I decided to try it out.....and were dreadfully disappointed.  We had gone in with absolutely no expectations other than good service and good food (and were definitely not expecting Italian gourmet). We were impressed with the affordability of the wine list and the selection offered, and enjoyed a glass as we looked over the large menu/book that we were given.  My boyfriend chose a meat pasta dish and I ordered the curry dish which the waiter assured me was absolutely delicious. Our meals arrived and we took a taste. My meal was completely inedible. The \"curry sauce\" was stale bricks of curry paste that seemed to have been swirled in with some lukewarm water and a bit of oil. It was still clumpy and had a dank flavor that couldn't be washed out with water or wine. The vegetables were not properly sauteed with the dish. It was not what one would expect from a $15.00 plate in the least. My boyfriend didn't fare much better. Although his meal was slightly better than mine, his California salad was not what it advertised itself as, merely a glorified garden salad, and his meat pasta dish was not cooked properly and also lacked flavor or care in it's preparation.   When the waiter asked us how the meal was, I told him my predicament with the curry dish to which he informed me that it was a very popular dish that the restaurant had been serving for 20 years. It tasted like a 20 year old plate if that's what he meant. He refused to do anything about it and charged us for it despite the fact that it was left untouched on the table when we left.   I found the waiter rude, as well as ungracious. This restaurant needs to work on it's customer service and on it's food preparation. If they could deliver what they say they can in the way of meals, they would be a great place. However, the food they bring to the tables now is a far cry and horrifically over-priced for the quality.  If you want pasta in this area, I recommend going over to Queen and Portland to Epicure. They are also very accommodating for people with food sensitivities and their prices are similar if not better than One of a Kind. Terroni's is also in the next block and is the best place in the  'hood for authentic Italian fare although a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Has been my absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto for the last 10 years. Cannot beat the quality of ingredients, portions, selections, caesar salad, and prices! It might be slower service, but it's always worth the wait. No matter what the occasion--break-up, date night, looking to gain a few pounds--One of a Kind is (and always will be) a top pick. If you haven't already, give it a try today. The pastas, curry, jalape√±o mussels and anchovy-licious caesar salad are amazing."}
{"text":"First off, if the owners of the restaurant are reading this - PLEASE take down those horrible neon signs outside your restaurant. From the outside, they make your lovely, cosy, intimate Italian restaurant look about as authentic as the Subway across the street. Honestly, my boyfriend and I came here a year ago and last night we travelled all the way from Queen East to Queen West just to try this cute little place again, but we ended up walking past it three or four times before realising that the flashing, neon-lighted fast-food looking place actually was the delightful restaurant we had remembered. Misleading!  At least the gross signage outside means you get a pleasant surprise when you walk in. This is a tiny, dimly lit, relaxing Italian restaurant complete with a mini-waterfall fountain and real Italian music and staff to boot. Gorgeous. The menu is expansive with some really creative pasta options. There's also plenty of non-Italian dishes for those who want something different.  I had the Caesar salad followed by 'jalapeno pasta' - which was linguine with Italian sausage, chicken, stir fried vegetables in a creamy sauce. It was delicious! The spiciness of the sausage and the creamy sauce balanced each other so well. My boyfriend had the pizza bread, which he loved, and then the beef stroganoff with linguine, which he said was great. Unfortunately the stroganoff wasn't his first choice - the pork loin special he wanted was all gone by the time we ordered.   The service was typically nonchalantly Italian, which I sort of liked! Definitely a bit on the slow and shrug-your-shoulders side, but it adds to the experience!  I thought it was weird how the server placed my napkin on my lap though (he did this last time over a year ago as well). He seems to do this with all the females in the restaurant - odd! It was also slightly annoying how he didn't rub off the pork loin special on the blackboard once it was gone. But no big deal. He was polite and helpful, and I loved the free garlic bread that comes as an appetizer!  This place is as good as you'd get in Toronto in terms of value for money.  There are deals all over the menu - e.g: 14.95 for starter and main course from a certain selection/ 16.95 for starter and main course from another selection, etc. The portions are HUGE. I was full after my Caesar salad (which didn't even have chicken), and I had to take at least half of the pasta home in a take-out box for the next day's lunch.    The wine was delicious and similarly reasonably priced.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here a couple weeks ago and the pasta is surprisingly good.  Quite a reprieve too from the area hipsters, as they don't go here since it's not a trendy place, just good food and prices"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has let me down when I had visited a few days ago. The quality wasn't consistent, there was a different asian chef cooking this time.  I ordered a Veal Provincal with multicolor fusilli and vegetables. The ingredients were all there but the taste I wasn't too thrilled. Sauce was too full of vegetables (yuck the brocolli) and the veal was already cut up into the pasta overpowering the flavour of the sauce. I thought the veal was going to be served alone intact -- not cut up. It made for a brownish reddish mixture of sauce that wasn't too appetizing to look at. Oh well going to go with something more simplistic if I decide to go back. :p"}
{"text":"Fairly-priced menu, large portions, hot and delicious meals.  Would definitely go back.  Casual dining at it's best."}
{"text":"Not sure what people are looking for out of a $10-$20 dollar dinner, but this place is amazing, even when you don't consider the reasonable prices. They have some of the most flavorful and interesting pasta dishes I've ever had. I don't care how \"authentic\" Italian they are or not, they hit the spot. I find myself craving this over any other Italian place I've ever been to. The menu items range from delicious cheap pastas to more expensive dishes with great combinations of ingredients, so you can really eat as cheaply or expensively as you feel like.  I usually get take-out, but it's actually a pleasure to dine in here. It's dim and cozy and romantic, but doesn't feel stuffy or annoyingly upscale. It's unfortunate the sign makes this place look like absolute crap, because if you can look past it, it really is a gem."}
{"text":"Just live around the corner from this place.  I felt i was in the mood for some italian that wasn't Terroni's so i thought i'd pop in with my girlfriend.  The host and server was a nice enough older fellah.  Ive never had a napkin laid across my lap so that was neat. but the good experience stopped there.  I ordered a spag bolo and when it came to my table, a roach skittered from under the bowl and paraded around my pasta.  So i left.  every time i see people seated in the restaurant i want to poke my head in and tell them to exit as quickly as they can."}
{"text":"Not terrible, and the prices are reasonable, but the whole place needs updating, along with the menu.  Everything about it is really tired.  Also, it has that telltale sign of a not-great restaurant: too many menu items.  Needs focus."}
{"text":"Only had a delivery a couple of times have never been in. Portions are good, no skimpy pastas here. I can usually split a pasta for lunch and dinner. Prices are cheap-especially if you get delivery/take out, most under $10. Their pasta fall into the cheap and cheerful category, not the most expertly prepared pastas or the use of the most quality ingredients but if you're starving and need some decent pasta to fill you up and don't wanna cook this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"A-OK indeed.  It seems like this place has had better days.. I've loved coming here for years but i think the service and quality of the food have slipped a lot in the past while.   I still love the ambiance. The wooden tables elbow-greased to a silky sheen. The old, quiet waiters who tuck your chair in for you if you're a lady. The candle wax that's that's been melting into the windowsill for decades probably, candle after candle, becoming a funny monument to this place's stagnancy.   I do love the shabby charm of the place, though. And I like the food. It's nothing near authentic or creative but its always been fresh for me, the flavour is generally balanced and enjoyable, and the seafood, veggies, and meats taste fresh and good quality. Comfort food. The menu is extensive, but I only ever order caesar salad and pastas. I love the hot and smoky and the squid ink linguine. Gimmicky, cute little dishes with good ingredients for a cheap price.   It's cheap to eat here and its nice and cosy to sit in the window and do some people watching. I like to go here for casual, comfy cheap dates.   I hate the idea of getting pasta for takeout because its so easy to make and so nice to eat fresh and hot.. but as a heads up their takeout menu is a couple of dollars cheaper for every dish.  It's a good idea to make a reservation if you're eating in because this place is tiny (and the seats by the window are nice and private). The most recent time I went to this place, which probably only seats 15 comfortably, the waiters had taken a boisterous group of ten or so and it was very distracting and disappointing. Best to go when its not crowded."}
{"text":"From the outside, the place looks like a crappy restaurant. I wouldn't have walked in on my own if a friend hadn't taken me there. But once you're inside, you realize this place is cosy and welcoming Italian restaurant.  I used to be on the fence about ordering pasta at a restaurant. Why pay money for something I can make myself for cheap? That is, until I came to One of a Kind. There is so much choice, I always end up spending 30 minutes narrowing it down to one dish. The pasta is always done perfectly, there are so many options depending on what you want/like (meat, poultry, seafood, veggies) and I have to admit their pasta making skills are way superior to mine, which I'm not too upset about.  I've never had a bad experience with service. Our waiter (always had the same one) was always attentive and speedy. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The menu is huge which is a red flag right away. If you have so many items on the menu, you can't possible do them all well. The green salad I ordered was swimming in so much oil that the leaves were wilted and drenched. The pasta was \"meh\", a bit bland.   The pasta was not homemade either and they did not have fresh parmagian cheese. (Sp?). The people at the next table were brought food that they didn't order and the waiter said for them to eat it anyway.  The server had some sort of argument with the kitchen staff and was yelling  at them in front of customers. Not pleasant to listen to."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place a lot: decent food and nice selection of menu options for a good value. The ambience is comfy. There are a number of interesting decor features."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome service and delivery. The best lobster bisque in the city, it comes with half a lobster tail in it for $11."}
{"text":"What immediately strikes you about One of a Kind is the size of the place.  It's pretty small.  Quite small actually.  But this is deceiving.  Yes, there are few tables and chairs, but the speed by which they are able to get tables through is a marvel to watch, like the chocolate factory episode of \"I Love Lucy\" but successful.  That said, even when you're in the midst of the organized chaos, you do not feel hurried.  The staff might, but how's that your problem?  Over-melted candles and other ornaments brighten the dark interior, but still make it fairly intimate.  The wine list is more than satisfactory and the staff, as stated before, are efficient and very courteous.  As far as the menu goes, this place does Italian and does it well, which is a testament to the throughput as well as the fact that every time I've been there, the place has been packed with people waiting for tables.  Though a great secondi is on offer as well, their pasta is fresh and accompanied by fresh ingredients.  Suggestion?  Bianco & Nero made with zebra linguini and an assortment of seafood.  Truly fantastic.  All this and they will also deliver and do take-out.  Not bad for such a small kitchen."}
{"text":"There's a universal truth when it comes to food: Never grocery shop when you're hungry and food always tastes better when you're hungry.   A friend of mine was visiting from out of town and after a long day of shopping and walking around, we found ourselves back in my neighborhood and hungry. She wanted pub food, but the closest pub to me was one we'd both been to and weren't crazy about, so we finally agreed to give this pseudo Italian joint a try. I call it pseudo Italian as it's sort of a steak/seafood/pasta joint. It has one of those 'been here awhile for a reason' vibes so I thought why not try it out, could be a hidden gem.  The menu is a bit confusing, but it's generally straightforward after a bit of inspection. There seems to be two levels of dinner specials: One with a side and one with a side and desert. They're listed on separate pages of the menu so I wasn't sure right away that they weren't just the same thing. I'm not a desert guy so I went with option A, which was $15.95 I think. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, and a side Caesar. Both were very good. The sauce was a bit thin and tasted a bit watery which I thought might be a red flag of it being powdered, but I think it was just a lighter cream. The pasta itself was excellent. Also, it was fresh pasta, I assume made in house or brought in but either way, I always appreciate fresh pasta when eating Italian. The Caesar salad was average (no bacon) but good, and came with a side of garlic bread. Total bill for two pasta dishes (one was Chicken Parm) and two glasses of wine and a Pelegrino was $65'ish. Very reasonable.  Service was decent. The server had to cover the entire dining room so he was busy. Although he had a very serious demeanor, he was professional and even smiled a few times and laughed once he could tell that we were good customers. A bit slow on the wine, but otherwise good.  I'd say it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect as reviews are mixed. It was GREAT!  Some people complain about the random decor but I really only care that it's clean and the food was hot, fresh and delicious! Also had no issues with service.  We arrived in time for the Early Bird special $11.95 for soup/salad + pasta. Large variety of pasta, many of which I've never had elsewhere. One of kind for sure, will be back!"}
{"text":"Hmmm interesting restaurant. Not what I was expecting but it was recommended by someone so we decided to check it out. It's not quite Italian as the staff are Chinese.. and it's not quite a pasta bar as their menu is quite diverse.   Let's start with the ambiance. The candlelight makes it romantic and cozy but the decor on the walls, the flashing lights outside the door and everything else make it not quite romantic just dark and cozy. We walked into an empty restaurant at 8pm which really isn't assuring.   The menu is diverse. They have the standard pastas, some fresh pastas which sound interesting eg the zebra pasta, the jalapeno pasta, etc, and they have the meats and fishes.   The most important thing about a restaurant is the taste of the food. Next is the price. The first is \"meh\". The second is good. So depending on what kind of diner you are, this restaurant could be a hidden gem for you. I tried the exotic mushroom soup which to be honest I can't figure out what was exotic about it. It tastes like Campbell's soup with another kind of mushroom tossed in. I also got the lasagne which tasted unconventional, no red sauce, quite meaty but the cheese on top was burnt and chunks of burnt cheese is no fun to eat. It was a $16 meal. Nothing to break the bank over but I'm not sure the value is there. In this competitive market, there's too many options that are within that price range. The portions were big enough though I'll give them that.   My partner had the conch soup, shrimp cocktail and the duck pasta. He seemed to enjoy his meal So there you have it. I'm always on the lookout for hidden gems but this one didn't work out for me."}
{"text":"I'd been to One of a Kind a couple of years ago. At the time, for the price, quality and portions, it's a relatively inexpensive meal, with pretty good service.   I was there about two weeks ago, on a Friday Night. I've never had such terrible service. The Server seemed like he couldn't really be bothered. Restaurant wasn't packed either.  All told, it was, from being Seated about 15 Minutes before he took our Order, another 30 minutes (to Boil pasta!), and another 15 minutes before he asked us how the meal was.   Service: .05/5 Food: 3/5 Value: 3/5   Took another 10 minutes for the Bill after we asked for it.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This petite pasta diner on Queen West is a good spot to go if you want a heaping dish to fill you up, but don't expect fine dining.  It's an odd little place; Buddha statues grin at you while Frank Sinatra serenades overhead, an elderly Caucasian waiter passes orders to the chatty Cantonese cooks in the back.  Despite the quirkiness, there is a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere here.  Garlic bread is often presented while you wait, although the garlic itself was somewhat sparse.  The fettucine prima vera falls short of good Italian, but the vegetables - including spinach, asparagus - were fresh and served generously.  The sauce itself was mediocre but a few heaping spoonfuls of parmesean (strangely offered to you from a small metal stovepot) did the trick for me.    Having been a student for the last year, coming here for a lunch date for approximately $10 isn't too bad.  Not a place I'd particularly recommend unless you're a jobless bum as well."}
{"text":"I brought my friends in the hopes of reliving past excellent experiences. This time appearances were not deceiving, but right on point.  The summer has clearly been unkind (or their old lousy air conditioner has been) and the place smelt vaguely of wet dogs. Personally I'd prefer the smell of pasta.The wine prices were outrageous (I clearly must have kept a blind eye to that in my last review) but I will say that the food was still tasty.   The real issue was the service. The service during dinner service was subpar and often we were forgotten. This is particularly frustrating when you consider there there was only 5 tables taken (including our own), so it wasn't very busy. But I guess our waiter felt that chatting with his friend was more important.   When we went to check out he noticed that my friend had tipped him lower for his poor service. He then asked her if his service was bad and got after my friend for tipping him low. Whatever your thoughts are on tipping, I shouldn't have to worry that my waiter will get after me or my friends for the tips they give. Needless to say, the experience at this restaurant was poor."}
{"text":"The name of this place is a bit misleading.  This place cannot seem to find its identity. They served butter chicken, mac and cheese other pastas on the same menu. The service was okay, closer to the slow side though indeed. The garlic bread that was put on the table was WAY to much garlic spread.  The food was okay, nothing spectacular. My Lasagna, looked kinda sad sitting on my plate by itself and came with no side; not even salad. It was unique alright. It tasted funny too. My Aunt, had the chicken alfredo which was WAY to creamy.  Moreover, if your looking for real authentic pastas, this is not the place for you unless your cheap, because the price was very low."}
{"text":"Friends who live nearby took us to this location as it was a safe place for any tastebud. It is a rather small location and it filled up very fast. The food was very cheap. I thought it would not be enough to fill me but I was wrong. I ordered the wall special and it was not only filling but also very tasty as well. Everyone else with me enjoyed their food as well.   The only reason why I don't give this 5 stars is the main complaint I see about this place, the service is slow. We were ready to go and it took over a half hour to get our bill and out the door. They are way too relaxed there if you are in a rush. (Luckily we weren't)"}
{"text":"I will not come back.   Service was slow. Food was so so. Period."}
{"text":"Ever since Captain John's was towed for scrap I was wondering what Toronto's worst restaurant is, and unfortunately I think I accidentally found it tonight with One of a Kind.    We ordered spaghetti Bolognese (spelled wrong on the menu) and a grilled chicken dish.  The restaurant was anarchy, no one was getting their orders in any kind of reasonable time.   Eventually the dishes came out;  without asking they had substituted the garlic mash in the chicken dish with a Pomodoro spaghetti (and this is a dish that comes with a chicken  gravy, am I supposed to pour that on the spaghetti??). They also announced that they had no meat sauce for the other pasta order.  And remember, this was nearly an hour after we ordered. Couldn't they have let us know when we placed the order?    An attempt to recover the night with another dish revealed the toughest meatballs I have ever tried to eat.  Reminded me of the little rubber balls I play squash with.   Also, this is a pasta restaurant where all the pasta dishes are made from dried noodles out of the box, like you'd buy at No Frills. There is absolutely no authenticity or effort to the cooking, nor any respect or customer communication on the part of the staff"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Italian dining experience for under $10, you'd better hotfoot it over to One Of A Kind for a charming lunch or dinner. Yes, the owner and chef is Asian and the restaurant describes itself as \"Italian with an Asian twist\" but it's done right, and you'll be wowed by the number of menu items, especially the seafood pasta options. It's truly...well...one of a kind. Average pasta plates are $9-11 and some of the more exotic options (veal, squid, duck, etc.) are in the $14-16 range. They also have delivery in the area as well as takeout (discount of 10%)."}
