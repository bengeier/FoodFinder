{"text":"Been visiting Duckworth's since I was a child (way too long ago).  My family would make our monthly pilgrimage from Hamilton to Duckworth's on Kingston Road.  Afterward we would visit with my Dad's sister who lived in the area.  Now I live in Scarborough and visit at least once a month.  Same excellent quality of fish and chips.  So nice to have a place with the high standards last for so long."}
{"text":"Wish they would figure out the plumbing problems in the mens washroom entire restaurant smells like dirty mop water and pee. The amount of business they generate shame on Duckworths for allowing this problem to persist.  I've always enjoyed the food. However, really turned off..."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful place to come with friends. Upon entering the restaurant, the place looked very clean and the staff was very kind when greeting us. We managed to find a table very quickly with not a single line-up.  The prices were quite modest at an average $15.00 or less. The presentation was decent but I felt as if there was way too much fries with my Haddock and Chips.  Overall it was a fun experience to enjoy"}
{"text":"Halibut and chips is the way to go. It's a little pricier than the other fish on the menu but it's well worth it. It's crispy without being oily on the outside and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Cosy little diner on Kingston Road.   I've  been told that they have the best fish n' chips - bar none.   Well, I am happy to report that friend was right!    Had the halibut and chips.   Mmmm. Good.   Not greasy like a lot of places I've been to..."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips - but not amazing. A bit pricey for what you get. The atmosphere leaves much to be desired -- to be honest the decor and interior vibe almost scared us away, but we had heard good things and decided to stay. Seems like you're walking into a time warp.  This place also doesn't have clam chowder which was totally disappointing. Not a bad place but really wouldn't make it a point to visit again.."}
{"text":"A scarborough institution.   By far the best fish and chip place in the city.   Get the bread.   A family business.  Price is unbelievable. At the end of the day, if there's any bread left, they sell the loafs for a really good price.   Go there now."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips, coleslaw and crusty bread. Clean as a whistle, friendly staff and what seems like instantaneous service. We're long time regulars."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to DW's in 20 yrs & was pleasantly reminded of childhood memories today. Fast service, hot food, & the batter was so crisp! There's a reason they've been around for eighty years: awesome fish!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this local hometown style diner. It's not much to look at but their staff is so friendly, their food is super yummy and the price is very reasonable makes up for any lack in fancy atmosphere. I celebrated my 40th birthday there with my parents and daughter, it was such a great flashback going back and exactly the same great taste and amazing service. Going back there time and time again is like going home again. My favourite it coleslaw with a half serving of fries and halibut. Mmmm so great."}
{"text":"a little pricey but some of the best Chish and Fips in Toronto......but I think they are closed? Anyone?"}
{"text":"Thin batter and plenty fish, unlike a lot of places which skimp on the fish and cover it up with batter. Quality is top rate, and they have unique extra huge steak chips:)"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and was not impressed. Over 14.00 for Halibut and Chips another 1.80 for a coke. Way over priced.  Fish ..it was very greasy and batter mushy Fries were meh! Oh well live and learn I just happened to be in the area. Wont repeat."}
{"text":"My dad recommended this place to me and I decided to check it out one day on a whim. I was definitely glad I did! The haddock and chips I ordered were awesome. The fries were good but nothing special, but the fish was absolutely delicious. The batter on it was perfect along with the portion sizes. I will definitely be going back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Customer service here doesn't not exist. Customer comes last. Never was really the best but it was good. They actually close 30 minutes earlier than the sign says which means it is an inconvenience. If you promote open until a time then serve up to that time and don't offer take out only. We went out of our way only to face a sign \"take out only\". I won't be back. I don't like places that show disrespect for customers."}
{"text":"Certainly a reliable place, not the best, but very very good. Thin batter which I like and always cooked fresh including the fries. This is the last of the old style fish and chip places. The location on Kingston road is better."}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips the halibut is great the coleslaw is awesome and the bread is very very fresh. Great place."}
{"text":"Family staple in our house. Been going since I was a child and we still male the drive in from Whitby for Fish and Chips. Never had a bad meal there ."}
{"text":"One of the absolute go to places in the east end for fish and chips. Always busy and never disappoint after decades of being in business. One of my faves."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips that I've ever had in the area. Halibut is my new favorite fish.  Big portions, absolutely fresh, and the perfect ratio of batter and fish. Chips are thick could have more variety of the cut of fries. Atmosphere is fast causal. The next time I'm in town this is a must have"}
{"text":"Came here for their halibut and chips. A little bit pricey for about $14, but the portion is big. The restaurant has been here since the late 1950s, and has that sort of old-fashioned feel. The fish was very crispy and well battered on the outside, but a little chewier and not as flaky as I expected (maybe that's just the nature of halibut.. i don't know). The fries are average, and sort of reminds me of the ones they have at swiss chalet (not particular crispy and lightly fried). The tartar sauce they include with the takeout is sort of sweet and very generic tasting, and I think having higher quality tartar sauce would enhance the fish a lot.   Nevertheless, I will definitely still come here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Duckworth's Fish and Chips for years.  We giggle at the fact that the decor has never changed.  However the delicious taste of the halibut and chips has not changed either.  Just consistently great food and service."}
{"text":"Definitely order the halibut, it's tender, moist and delicious. I watched the cook dip the fish filets in batter and drop them directly into the deep fryer so your order comes out piping hot. The batter is light and crispy like Tempura but very oily. The fries are nothing special. Not a place to sit down and enjoy your food, customer service is blas√©."}
{"text":"amazing!!!! best fish and chips I have had in the city.  prices are pretty decent for fish and chips, you get the quality you pay for."}
{"text":"Greasy as fuck!! It's soaked in grease and soggy! My husband loves it I on the other hand will not be getting anything else from here"}
{"text":"Duckworth's has always been a staple of the Fish & Chip restaurants in Scarborough, and having had it delivered after many, many years of not experiencing it, I am pleased to say that it was just as good as it used to be.  Ordered 2 of the Halibut and chip dinners, and yes, they are pricey to some, but halibut is a more expensive fish, and have to say that Duckworth's did not disappoint.  It was so delicious, and fresh and still even hot.  Seeing the food boxes wrapped in the newsprint took me back to my childhood from eating there previously.   It's great that people who don't drive, can now get it delivered. Due to the prices, and want for fish, it won't be a regular thing, but I'm happy that it now is an option and just as enjoyable as it always was.   Bon Appetite Fish & Chip fans. You HAVE to experience Duckworth's."}
{"text":"Haddock & chips, $9+. Haddock alone, $7.  Fish were fresh and wholesome. Chips were old-school. Customer service, genuinely good.  Expensive (5\" long fish) but truly satisfying.  Not oily."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips and fast service, never have a problem with the quality or freshness. Awesome spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The storefront and the decor is really old school but the food is amazing. The batter to fish ratio is perfect and they're fried to order so it's fresh and crispy every time. My favorite has got to be their chips. Good chips are hard to come by. Most places just pass out fries but the two are not the same. These chips are thick, soft, and soaks up vinegar perfectly. I can live on those chips alone.   You can pay a tiny bit extra to dine-in and grab the little seats by the window to really get that diner feel."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  VIBE - haven't been in; I've had delivery at home so the vibe is great! My parents get their Fish and chips all of the time. I'm happy to oblige.   I EAT  Halibut and chips of course! It's the perfect amount of greasy and not over battered like Off the Hook. Generous portion of fries. Very old time fish and chips. Lovely!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  No duck, but great halibut. Win!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but so worth it. The best fish and chips in the GTA bar none. My family and I have been going here since the 80's. Fresh food. Good quantity and great service. I hope it stays open for a very long time."}
{"text":"Hi all! I recommend this place because we really enjoyed the Halibut and Chips. FINALLY we got to go since the place has been around for years and we heard good things! The place is not fancy but the service and food is very good. Depending on where you live, I might recommended Fish Joy slightly more because they were a little lighter and less greasy (of course all fish and chips are greasy!). If you are closer to Kingston go to Duckworth. If you are closer to Brimley, go to Fish Joy. Duckworth has places to sit to eat but it is practical rather than fancy. That's not a problem since the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon while in Toronto for the day. Ordered the Halibut and Chips. The fish was excellent. Very moist and flavorful. The fries looked like they were fresh cut and were very good. A decent amount of food for around $12. Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Its Duckworths....they could never give you enough of that crazy delicious halibut.....I leave there full, wanting more...very deliciously odd experience. They work at making sure everything is spot on....did I mention the incredible fish that you cant get enough of???"}
