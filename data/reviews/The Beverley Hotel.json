{"text":"The hotel is super cute, has a modern new trendy style going on. Unfortunately the rooms are the size of Ikea bedrooms displays and the washroom is see-through. If you're using the toilet you could see EVERYTHING and same with the shower. Yikes! The rooftop terrace was super cute and nice to lookout over the city in the night time, but keep in mind it does close. The rooms had NO windows and it was SUPER hot in them. Let's just say that you could hear EVERYTHING from the rooms next to you. The staff was great though and the location is amazing If you are by yourself or need it for a night I would recommend it, if you're okay with see-through washrooms that is!"}
{"text":"I am writing in behalf of my boyfriend and I to let you know how beyond awesome my experience was at The Beverley Hotel in Toronto, Canada.  My boyfriend and I flew in from Boston to visit Toronto for 3 nights and 4 days for my birthday.   First want to compliment on the appearance of the hotel, it is very unique and the location is so convenient to all of the shops and restaurants. My boyfriend and I were very interested in the restaurants on Spadina Ave, and we were very pleased that it was within walking distance. The room that we stayed in has a homey feeling and that we requested a room close to the street viewing, which was absolutely beautiful to see. At first, the room temperature was set at the coolest and all we had to do was ask the front desk employee, which at the time was Michelle. She was so nice to let us know that the thermostat was behind the mirror and that we have to request for ice service to be sent up to the room.  She also was great at giving us a heads up that the elevator was very slow because it used to be a service elevator years ago.  Michelle was the first employee we met and she was beyond awesome, friendly, helpful and has a great sense of humor.   Secondly, I want to give a compliment on how well the staff was to us.  The next employees we met was McKenzie and Jeff who were located at the Do Not Disturb Bar.  We were so pleased by the friendliness and the quality of the drinks served to us during happy hour.  McKenzie was super knowledgeable with the drinks and took the time to learn the preferences of each customer (i.e. likes sweets, likes bitters, etc).  The deals on oysters were delicious and the cocktail sauces that were prepared were so addicting. Jeff was super helpful in making recommendations on where to go eat, shop, and site see (i.e. Art Museum, Mother's Dumpling, Kensington Market, Trillium Park, etc) .  We had a great time speaking to Jeff and McKenzie.  The next employees we got to met was Alex from front desk and Nicky from housekeeping.  Alex and Nicky was super helpful with tackling and troubleshooting the safe that was in our room. They worked a team to help us reset the safe to help us obtain our belongings that we had locked up the night before. Alex was so patient and worked with us/spoke to the safe company to help troubleshoot. Nicky did such a wonderful job to make sure we had our room re-freshened and made sure we had everything every day. Lastly, we got to meet Jennifer who helped us check out of our rooms and she was super helpful with making sure our luggage was stored away before we were ready to leave Toronto. She made sure we felt secure.    My boyfriend and I are so grateful and appreciative to have met everyone at The Beverley Hotel and to be comfortable asking questions.  This place is so unique and that everyone works as a team. It is truly a special place where the employees feel like family. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who may be traveling to this area and I would definitely come back again to stay at The Beverley Hotel.  We want to give a huge thanks to everyone who works at this facility and that we appreciate all of the hard work/5-star customer service that was put into making this hotel awesome."}
{"text":"**HOTEL** review:   Pros: swanky & clean  Cons: I felt like I was sleeping in a sweat shop/sauna/my grandmother's house when she leaves the fire place on in the summertime. I guess the AC was broken. SMALL ROOMS. Like the smallest I've ever seen. My suitcase wouldn't even fit on either side of the bed. I booked this hotel on Kayak and the photos were extremely misleading. Anyways don't stay here. $230/night for this is ABSURD!!!!!! Ok!!"}
{"text":"I went to Toronto for a concert and a quick overnight getaway. After much debate, I decided to give The Beverley Hotel a try. I had read a few good reviews online, and the price was compatible with some of the larger hotel chains nearby.  Here's the breakdown:  The good: This place is really going to be elegant and swanky, when it's finished. The bar, located on the main floor of the hotel, had gorgeous new seating for table dining, as well as a gleaming, upscale new bar, complete with craft cocktail menu.  The hotel gave us each a free welcome drink (beer or wine). That's always a plus, in my book.  The accomodations were nice. The bed was comfy, the shower was good, and they had a shampoo/conditioner/bodywash dispenser built into the shower (the scent was reminiscent of Aveda). The room was nicely decorated.  The bad:   THIS WAS THE SMALLEST HOTEL ROOM I HAVE EVER BEEN IN. EVER. It was like that Ikea section where they say \"only have 540 sq feet?\" and they make it work. The room was smaller than my bedroom at home. Also, the shower had a sliding class door - WITH THE TOILET PART EXPOSED - so everyone could see you pee. It was weird and cramped.   I had specifically requested a double room (which I thought meant a double bed). Turns out the hotel only has single bed rooms - some with king sized beds (which were their suites), and double bed rooms.   I can't speak to the rooftop bar (other than I love the idea) - because when we got there, at 4 pm, they were closing it up; it had rained earlier in the day, and they were worried about the furnishings. It's a great set up though.   The layout is weird, too. The main floor is the dining area/bar. You go up a flight of steep stairs to the check in desk. There is an elevator, but it's hidden (you don't know about it until they point it out) and it is tiny and slow. It says the elevator holds 8, but there were two of us in there and it felt cramped.  They have a lot of bugs to work out (hello, backup paper filing system in an index card box), and the staff seems really inexperienced. I expect that is just a learning curve, though (they just opened last month).  The room was way too much money for what we got. If they work out the bugs, I can see this being a good place for single travelers, or couples that don't mind sharing cramped quarters. But overall, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is for the Beverley Hotel NOT the restaurant/bar.I  'll just get to the point of it - DO NOT stay here if you value your time and safety.   As soon as I arrived I noticed that the heat in my room did not work. When I asked for a space heater the first one provided did not work. Luckily, the second one worked - the young lady at the front desk was very nice and apologetic. While this was very frustrating the young woman at the front desk handled it well. However - as soon as the late night staff came in any semblance of respect and customer service went out the window.   Around 11:30PM one of their employees knocked on my door - when I did not answer he continued to bang loudly. I had to get out of the shower and rush over to see what was going on.   As you can imagine, I was extremely distressed and demanded to know why it was necessary to bang on my door. This man first of all - blamed me for opening the door in the first place. Second of all - he said that I \"freaked out\" on him. I'm not sure who wouldn't \"freak out\" at the fact that a stranger was banging on their hotel room door as they showered in the middle of the night. Especially a young woman traveling by herself.   He then gave me a half hearted apology yet still had the nerve to BLAME ME for \"freaking out\" or opening the door in the first place. The fact that this man was \"apologizing\" yet still assigning blame to me is not only extremely frustrating but disturbing.  Furthermore, when I expressed how frustrated I was that this was happening at nearly midnight the young man at the front desk said \"well it's downtown Toronto people don't go to bed that early\" I happened to have been there on a business trip that required me to wake up at 5:45 each morning. Although, regardless of the reason for my stay his comment was an extremely ignorant and offensive. I'm paying hundreds of dollars to stay here....I should be able to have peace and quiet whenever I damn well please.   The staff here is incredibly disrespectful and at one point the man from the kitchen laughed at how distraught I was. What if this had been his sister or your mother? What if someone made her believe she was going to be raped and then laughed at how distraught she was? Or blamed her for opening the door in the first place?   After about an hour I decided that I did not feel safe in this hotel and checked out somewhere around 1AM. As I was downstairs waiting for an Uber the very same employee who had been banging on my door was making fun of me and laughing at my situation with his friends at the bar. At the time, he could not see me. Not only has this man made me feel extremely unsafe, at fault for doing so but he has now made me feel humiliated.   This kind of behavior is unforgivable and again, extremely disgusting.   A couple of my colleagues were also staying here and the next day they told me that they did not get any sleep due to the fact that there were several drunk people standing in the hallway loudly arguing. When asked to be quiet this ensued in more yelling and arguing. Needless to say the front desk did nothing to put an end to it.   Had the staff been extremely apologetic and accommodating and showed at least a shred of respect to me I could have forgotten about the incident and moved on. Quite honestly I hope that this hotel folds...they have no business hosting overnight guests.   Of note - the manager gave me a \"direct line\" in order for me to call and/or e-mail him. I e-mailed him two days ago and as of today have not received a response. Once again...the Beverley Hotel in Downtown Toronto shows its true colors."}
{"text":"I stayed during the winter when the prices were a little lower. The location is a prime location and kind of liked the brunch downstairs even though the service wasn't five stars. There are not enough channels in the TV which is not a huge deal if you are traveling. I enjoyed the design but didn't like that the heat was nonexistent except for a portable heater. And really dislike when the front desk let a couple of party people's stay for one night as they walk into the front desk already being rowdy cause they cause havoc to the time they walk in  checked in to the time they got out. It is more important to keep your longer guest happy than to make extra money on one night with people you know from the start are up to no good."}
{"text":"Love this cute hotel downtown in the hip queen west. Super nice staff, clean and awesome vibe. I recommend all my out of town friends to the Beverley. It's got a great vibe with boutique styled rooms that have everything you need while being right in the action. There's even a variety store at the front with some really toronto-esque things like Drake t shirts and so much more."}
{"text":"The Restaurant is lovely. It has an amazing ambiance and the it has a very intimate feel without being cramped. The service was wonderful and they were more than happy to accomodate amendments to their menu.  I believe they may have a changing menu; nevertheless, if you have the opportunity to have the dry rub ribs I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"HOTEL REVIEW.  NOT RESTAURANT REVIEW.  I stayed here just for one night alone. I booked the place because of the location and because it looked pretty hip. But when I left, I felt like I probably won't stay here again, unfortunately. But! Here's what I liked about the place! - It was hip! - Nice staff - Got in early and put my bags in my room as I walked around and came back to check in later. - Great location! In the heart of it all. - Quiet inside as well.  But! I'm giving it 3 stars for a reason. Here's what I was disappointed with... - Wifi was super spotty, and being from the U.S. where data isn't accessible, it sucked I couldn't rely on the hotel's wifi. - Room was small, this was a neutral thing for me, but for 2 or more, it is TIGHT. - No natural light. :( At least in my room. - No working elevator. I was on the highest room floor and had camera equipment with me, so it kind of sucked to walk down with the gear. :( - Expensive. I think the cost is really because of the location, but it's not cheap.  Wish it could've been better! Probably won't stay again, but try to get on a lower floor for the wifi if you do decide here!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finding this place can be a bit tricky, because it's tucked in the midst of a bunch of stores and restaurants on Queen street, however, once you find it, it is a rather quaint and likable place. The staff is extremely helpful and professional. The bartender even gave me a ginger ale on the house one night when I was in desperate need of something to drink. It's not too expensive for a Toronto hotel- pretty average for the most part. The room is small, though. It included a bed and a sink directly in front of the bed with just a bit of walking room. The bathroom was about five feet from the bed and didn't offer much privacy from the room itself. It was snug, but cozy if you don't mind that kind of thing."}
{"text":"This is a nice little hotel in a great location. I stayed 2 nights while in town for a conference. The location was great to walk around the city, with lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood.   The rooms are very, very tiny. Think of those model Ikea rooms to show you how you can live in 200 sq ft. That said, it was cute, clean, modern, and perfectly fine for 1 person on a short visit. I would have been cramped with 2 however. Especially on a longer visit when you have more than an overnight bag. Most also do not have any windows but they do have this lit frosted glass that almost tricks you into thinking it was a window.   Staff are absolutely lovely. Friendly, accommodating, and happy to help you with anything you need.   The restaurant on the first floor is very cute, but I wasn't blown away with my breakfast there. I'd probably eat elsewhere if I returned, but they do have a discount for people staying in the hotel which is a nice perk."}
