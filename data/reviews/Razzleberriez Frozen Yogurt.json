{"text":"This place is very clean and the service was wonderful! I think we sampled every single flavor before finally deciding. The salted caramel was sublime! I will definitely be returning. Perfect treat for a hot Phoenix day."}
{"text":"The yogurt is good, not great, and way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to the grocery store and get frozen treats for everyone in the family for the price of 1 here."}
{"text":"New business in the NW Peoria area ( Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant ). Me and my wife really enjoyed this new frozen yogurt place.  Possibly the best frozen yogurt that we ever had. The place is clean and people there were very friendly !"}
{"text":"Service was poor and my 5 year old spilled her whole cup of fro-yo just after paying for it and the employee didn't offer to help clean it up and then when we made a replacement cup, she made us pay for it again!  First and last time coming here!"}
{"text":"If you want a sample of the semi ok yogurt you have to wait until the cashier/attendant is available to assist you.... even if the line is long. So doing this with kids isn't very fun! Why hoard the sample cups?? Really??  The flavors tend to be watery, on the sour side, and some taste very similar.  The only reason this place gets busy is because of the specials they run like BOGO, and it's the only frozen yogurt place near Vistancia.  The toppings selection is good!"}
{"text":"We visited Razzleberriez yesterday.  We walked into an empty store. I thought it was odd.  The store was spotless.  The gals working were not super outgoing but welcomed people in and said goodbye to everyone leaving.  They were constantly doing something, cleaning up the toppings or wiping stuff down.  (Not used to seeing young people do this on the job-itt was refreshing.) We were there a while visiting and saw tons of people in and out...we just timed it perfectly.  The flavors weren't great but they had DOLE WHIP and it was delicious! I would have given 5 stars if they had fresh pineapple to go with it.  They did however have a great selection of toppings. (Don't get the gummy frog, it was gross. haha) We needed something lighter than ice cream and this was perfect."}
{"text":"Does anybody know the prices there? The yogurt is obviously good. Not an issue there. My issue is that we purchased two yogurt cups. One, which was maybe half way full, if that. The other was more full, but nothing outrageous. The total came to $16.93.... UHM, WHAT?! No thanks. Not again. Insanely priced!"}
{"text":"Razzleberriez always has many flavors and their frozen yogurt is good quality.  The facility is pretty clean too.  However, the girls working there are not particularly motivated and this is very consistent to most if not all of my visits.  Many times I have to wait for them to come out from the back to ring up my order so I can pay.  They don't offer lids or bags even though I'm often by myself, and purchasing 5 or more containers of yogurt.  Then, there is their rewards program that expires the last day of every month if you don't use it in the current month.  I was in a few months ago and again purchased 5 containers of yogurt totaling more than $35.00.  The girl asked me if I was a rewards member, and then took my phone number and rang my purchase up.  I paid then asked how much I had in rewards.  I might add at that time I wasn't aware that the points expire at the end of each month, which I think is totally ridiculous.  Anyway, she rang my purchase and I paid. Then asked my rewards balance.  She said it was $6.00.  I thought to myself, why didn't she tell me so I could use it.  Then I figured I'd use it when I came in the next week.  Fast forward 1 week ..... I came in to purchase some more \"to go\" yogurt, got to the counter and asked the girl to apply my reward of $6.00 to my purchase.  She rang it up, looked at my balance and it was ZERO.  I said I had $6.00 the previous week.  She then said, well this is the 3rd of the month so if you were here last week, it has now expired.  I was a little irritated.  I asked for the manager and of course there wasn't one there.  The girl gave me the phone number to the owner.  I called and left a message.  The owner called back about a week later and said she was sorry but she couldn't do anything about it.  SERIOUSLY!  For $6.00 she was willing to lose a regular client.  Very bad business in my opinion.  Bottom line, the girls need to use their heads and offer to use a discount especially when there is only 3 days left in the month, and they know the reward is going to expire the next day.  Lack of ambition or consideration is my biggest complaint and I might add that this attitude is extremely consistent.  Also, the place is very dark and uninviting.  The only place outside to eat it abour 2 feet from the parked cars (so close you can feel engine heat) and also in full sun.   I now go a little further down th street to \"Top That\" frozen yogurt it's a VERY nice place with lots of quality yogurt.  Beautiful yogurt shop with lots of windows and a beautiful outside area to sit and enjoy your yogurt."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quality froyo and really awesome employees who are very helpful. I LOVE YOU FRO-YO!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little frozen yogurt shop in North West Peoria. It is usually very busy due to the fact that they have a great selection of frozen yogurt and toppings! It is very clean inside. The few times we have gone in The staff is very young and they are very lackluster in their jobs, but the place is clean, the price is right, and they have a great selection of frozen yogurts"}
{"text":"We love Razzleberriez! And we are so happy there's no a location closer to where we live!! The flavors are so good, and we love to try new options. The staff is super friendly and never misses an opportunity to greet the guests walking in the door or offer a sample. This is becoming one of our favorite spots for an after-dinner treat!"}
{"text":"We checked out this place tonight as an alternative to cold stone. We all really liked it. My wife and I split a pistachio and pinnacle dole whip with marshmallow and chocolate sauce and the kids each had a vanilla with m&ms. Their vanilla was really good tasting and they liked it. The Dole whip was awesome. I would go back to this place just for"}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly and they make your samples for you! I guess they don't trust us to sample the yogurt on our own. Plus, the girl that made our samples rubbed her nose right before she made my sample."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of flavor options. The store is always clean and welcoming. The staff are friendly and willing to help. Even when the kids are taking forever to decide what lovely additions they want on their yogurt, staff are patient and helpful."}
{"text":"Yogurt was delicious ... my daughter dropped her cherry outside which was a pretty big issue and they graciously replaced it.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our normal go to place for fro yo was closed for the holiday, so we set out to find something open. We found Razzleberries and were so happy that we did! Great selection of flavors, the girls offered us samples, great selection of toppings and the price is fantastic!  The place is clean and the girls were nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this new location at the NE corner of Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant.  It is hard to find but it is facing Lowes along Lake Pleasant.  Lvoe their salted caramel ice cream and lots of toppings.  This is a great stop for frozen yogurt and a nice option instead of cold stone and 31 flavors."}
{"text":"Hold your nose! This place regularly reeks of sewer gas and it's disgusting. Please fix it! I can't be the first to notice and I feel bad for the poor kids who work in that environment. Make that repair and I'll give you a 5 because I love your products and friendly service."}
{"text":"We came here after spending some time in the sun - we needed to be refreshed and all I gotta say is...the Raspberry Pomegranate Sorbet is SO GOOD! If you come here, you have to get it! So delicious and very refreshing. The girl that worked there the day we went was very sweet as well. We had a great and yummy experience here!"}
{"text":"I like this place but the only fruit they had were strawberries and maraschino cherries.. bummed there weren't more fruit options"}
