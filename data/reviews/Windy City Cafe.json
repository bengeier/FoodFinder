{"text":"not great... was waiting so long for our food that i believe a manager or owner asked me if i needed anything else and i told him our food would be nice... omelet was overcooked, corned beef hash was obviously from a can... had a side of biscuits and gravy that tasted like dish soap... .. potatoes were of the previously frozen variety and more or less flavorless... its unfortunate because the breakfast joynt was actually a decent restaurant and i recognized some of the staff from its previous incarnation but perhaps the cooks were not some of the carry overs..."}
{"text":"Open for breakfast and lunch only, this newely opened restaurant is serving up some good stuff.     From the moment we walked in, the host (who I suspect was the owner) was very friendly and immediately sat us at a nice, clean booth.  The server greeted us soon there-after.  The service was awesome!  We had the turkey/bacon/cheddar panini and a veggie skillet.  Both were perfectly prepared and generously sized!   From what I can tell, we weren't the only happy patrons in the place.  While the place was packed, there were customers occupying about a dozen tables.  The best part if you're a sports fan, the big screen tv mounted on the wall.  No need for glasses, the thing is huge!  Will we return? Absolutely!   Great location, great service, exceptional food & tons of free parking.  Oh, speaking of free parking, this building is located right in front of the Tempe Discount Cinema (aka Pollack Theatres) at the southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot.    The building use to be occupied by Denny's."}
{"text":"Any place that serves breakfast past 11AM is the place I want to eat! When you work nights and sleep til noon, yet breakfast is your favorite meal, you'll want to get up and roll down to this cafe! Their breakfast is served in generous portions, the staff are friendly and the new management cares about what you think! They are out walking around asking how your food is and greeting the customers. A real down home atmosphere!  I've read some of the reviews on here and can't believe that it could have been that bad for someone there, considering our experience. However, I also realize that \"You can't please everyone\" and \"Some people won't be happy, even if you offer them the moon!\""}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure where the other reviewers ate. Maybe they don't know good food.   Let me first say that the staff was very nice. That said, lets talk about the food. I ordered the patty melt, which considering that we were the only people in the restaurant (2 of us), took considerable long to get to our table. When I picked it up, there was a lake of grease on the plate and all over my hands. Since I was starving, I tried it. Not sure how rye bread can be tasteless, but it was. And then the meat, low grade, no flavor and was not seasoned.   Needless to say, I sent it back. So instead I had a Gyros, how can one mess up a Gyros? Well let me tell you. The pita was oddly small, there was a good amount of meat, but....... the tyziki sauce was generic with no flavor. Something you would find in a fast food place, not a sit down restaurant. It's not expensive or difficult to make, show your food some love and throw some together!!!!!  I was told by the waiter that I'm not a fair critic, because I'm from Chicago and a chef. WHAT????!!!!!!   I'll probably go just to check their beef sandwiches, but for the love of God will people in this valley stop using the Chicago reference unless it's good food? Oh and the hotdog was obscenely priced"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! Place was dirty. Food was terrible... Breakfast food at Denny's is better. I only ate about 1/5 of my meal since it was so terrible. Cold eggs. Chicken fried steak soaked in grease. Waitress didn't care. I believe some managers or owners were just sitting around like there was nothing to do. I could think of 50 things to do. Try cleaning the nasty booths or dirty blinds and window sills. Icky. If this poor excuse of a restaurant doesn't go out of business soon, I would be totally shocked. I felt ripped off. If you're thinking about going there...just go to a dirty ally, eat some garbage, and burn a $20 bill. Same experience."}
{"text":"Ehhhh.  Service was slow and inattentive  even though we were only one of three tables. They got my husband's order wrong - which he didn't send back because it took so long for food to come out that we didn't want any more delays.  Food was ok but not great.  Too many other good options - we won't be back. I hope they get it together for their sake."}
{"text":"Blow Me Down, Mate By The Rue  Windy City has a great breakfast selection, My order didn't need any correction, It was cooked to perfection, The staff showed lots of effection, The waitress left me with an erection, Ask her out? Scared of rejection, Eggs, bacon, sausage, toast for digestion, McClintock and Elliot are the cross section, Make sure you're going in the right direction, Don't vote for Obama this election, Clean tables to see your reflection, Don't come here with an infection, Go ahead and sell the stamp collection, I gave the place a good inspection, Silverware doesn't require disinfection, Maybe you and I have a connection, This my opion and my prejection, Windy City doesn't get my objection, In the bedroom wear protection, Be careful of premature ejaculation.   NUT!!!"}
{"text":"Our group recently held a meetup here.  Service was great and they were very patient and tolerable of our group of about 15.  They even mentioned we could return if desired.  Okay about the place... Decent and clean decor.  Service was outstanding (server Matthew). Pretty good menu selection but decided on the Italian Sausage Sandwich (the other tempting item was the Spinach Pie) which came with waffle fries and small bowl of chicken noodle soup.  The food was tasty and it was a good amount of food for the price.  Even saw owner or manager check in with customers.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We use to eat here a lot. But after the service or lack there of, we received the last time we were there we will NEVER go back. To many friendly place near by with just as good if not better food. They now rank below Dennies in my book."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant quite a few times now with my coworkers. It's a great place for breakfast lunch or dinner.  From the eggs Benedict to the pancakes to the country fried steak to the club sandwich. And the portions are always great and I haven't had to spend more than $10. Their customer service has always been great. Even better they deliver not just for lunch or dinner but for breakfast also. So if you want a good meal that's fairly priced and not skimpy on the portions  Windy City Cafe is a great place to go. Located in Scottsdale, AZ in Sonora village by Golds Gym."}
{"text":"Ok, First off let me say I just got back from visting Chicago and I had An Italian Beef Sandwich at different places everyday  I was there and they were all amazing for the most part, So I was craving another. I had one here today and I most say I was impressed I knew it wouldn't taste like Chicago because any food connoisseur knows the water and the bread in how it is cook makes a differents and AZ water sucks. But anyway back to  The \"Windy City Cafe\"  this was my second visit here I went two months ago and thought it was just ok, Had a different sandwich by the way but now I know better glad I came back once again I had great services. She saw that I needing a refil and with out me asking she brought me another water. Also I wanna point out where my seat was I could see the kitchen I saw my plate come up the she was taking back a dirty plate back after putting it down I saw her wash her hands before grabing my food thaought that was amazing also some places wouldn't thing to do that."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, had some delicious banana strawberry pancakes.  They have plenty of selection, reasonable prices, in a fun atmosphere.  I enjoyed my visit, and I wished I could have gone to the Friday Fish Fry (which happens every Friday) but I was only in town for a short while and couldn't make it.  If you're in Tempe, be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food was awful and very bland. The only thing good was the service. We will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on friday, great service, great food. Had the spinach and cheese omlette, awesome!!! Local business.....SUPPORT IT!!!! See ya Friday morning!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best country fried steak I have ever had! So tender you could cut it with a fork! I try this dish at every restraunt I go to and have never had one this good! My husband got the corned beef hash it too was delish! Enough corned beef down to the last bite.The breakfast was huge and reasonably priced! This is our favorite new breakfast spot!  Cant wait to go for lunch to try the chicago dog!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are from the north side of Chicago where I grew up, and this place reminds me of so many easy but delicious diners back home. The owners are so nice and it's really refreshing to have just a simple diner like this (with old fashioned kind of greasy food) to be able to go to."}
{"text":"**New Owner Killed this South Tempe Cafe**** DON\"T GO***  First, let me say, my wife and I LOVED this place.  I went there before I met her and always enjoyed my morning breakfast.   I enjoyed Windy City so much that i get their emails...lame, I know. I remember the day the owner sent an email saying, I have sold the business.  My heart sank.  But, we figured we would give the new owner a shot.    I order the same thing i have always ordered, Country Fried Steak and Eggs.  This was my favorite menu item and truly was the best I have ever had (outside my Grandmother's of course).   IT WAS AWFUL! The hash browns had the taste of freezer burn and lacked in seasoning.  The country fried steak i loved so much was lacking and tasted frozen then flash fried.  It was also dry, meaning it wasn't fresh. It was so bad, that i didn't finish it.  Something that has never happened at Windy City before.   I emailed the owner to let him know.  Although he responded quickly, and very professionally, I was shocked that he didn't offer us a comp breakfast.  Telling us that \"We cook to order\" and \"We pride ourselves on quality food\" and \"We hope you give us another chance.\"  after what i told him, seemed like the perfect opportunity to offer up a $10 comp.  I am not going to spend my own money because his \"Cafe\" can't produce quality.  But, i guess the regulars that live in the area and have made this business a success aren't his target market.  And, with The Crepe Bar open a mile away, he should figure it out soon."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant multiple times now in the last couple of months.  I have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is friendly, the food is excellent and my girlfriend and I eat like pigs and get out of there for under $30 (including tip).  I've had the breakfast burrito 3 times now, and this morning I also tried their whole wheat pancakes with fresh bananas on top.  Awesome!  I washed it down with one of their new iced coffees, (mocha's my favorite).  I truly enjoy the atmosphere and the home cooked food.  The menu has such a variety of items, I can't even get around to them all.  I'm looking forward to trying the fish fry soon!"}
{"text":"All I can say is FAN-freakin-TASTIC! The new management is amazing from the service provided for the take out order to the food! We ordered two different types of skillet. The corned beef hash skillet was probably the best skillet I've ever had. I will definitely be coming back. No idea why someone would go to IHOP over this place being that they're right next to each other!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I found out there's a place that can deliver breakfast to my office... I was even more excited when I found out there's no minimum for delivery!   After much review of the menu and careful consideration, I had decided! Two breakfasts! Then I changed my mind....... I don't know what it was.. Either the time consuming process of figuring out what you want to eat and if you're still going to want that when it arrives. Or it was the deeply profound discussion of one of my employees acting like a child stating she only wants a taco.   Anyways, I decided to get lunch. Looking through their menu and salivating over pictures & dreams of a full stomach, I placed my order. It arrived in record time and NO DELIVERY FEE!!! (that's a big plus in my book)  I opened my Styrofoam box ready to devour the food that was inside like a dinosaur, or the vikings of old! To my dismay, what I ordered was lacking several meats it displayed in the picture on the website. I called back, desperate and hungrier than an Ethiopian child that had not been visited by the famous con artist, Sally Struthers.   I spoke to the manager (Kevin? Kenny? Kent? Something like that), who was very nice. He told me it was a new website, and he hadn't even seen it yet... Cool story bro... THEN! He told me he would send the guy back with the right sandwich! Glorious day!!!   All in all, I'm satisfied with my experience and how the staff handled this hiccup. I look forward to ordering again, and hopefully upping that star count! Next time, I am definitely ordering two breakfasts. French toast and crepes! Sugar overload? I hope!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast at the Windy City Cafe late on Saturday Morning.  I was on my way to Chompies and saw this new place much closer to home.    Lots of free parking.  The place is new and the pleasant host was from Chicago of course.  The restaurant is new and recently remodeled with cherry-wood tables and booths.  There is a giant TV on one side for the sports fans.    The staff was very friendly, and service was superb.   My waiter was pleasant and attentive.  Often greeting other customers by name, or welcoming them back again.    I had breakfast.  My waiter sang the praises of the lunch menu to other patrons.  He said \"And the breakfast menu is breakfast\"  That should have been a tip off.  The breakfast menu was sort of lame.  It contained the basics, omelets, eggs, waffles, and pancakes.  I even saw two varieties of Eggs Benedict.  My breakfast was not very memorable.  Very heavy on the luke warm hash brown potatoes, light on everything else.  On the bright side the coffee was good and hot, and thanks to the attentive service my cup was never empty.    There are better places for breakfast.  The lunch menu looked intriguing, with Chicago style hot dogs, beef and Italian sausage. I will stop by to lunch it a try."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday morning. I hadn't checked any reviews so I told my husband I had low expectations. Unfortunately, they weren't low enough.  We were turned off by the overflowing garbage can outside but continued inside. There were only three other occupied tables. We had a timid waitress. The decor is dated. My husband thought the place was closing. :(  I ordered a ham and Swiss cheese omlette. I got a ham and cheddar cheese one. I would bet you money the \"eggs\" were poured out of a milk carton--these were not fresh cracked eggs. Small pieces of ham. Large portion of hot but undercooked hash browns (I like them to be at least a little crispy). I got a side of pancakes. The menu states they come with powdered sugar on them. I don't know why they bother with the menu notice OR the sprinkling since here was so little on there it didn't make a difference in taste or appearance. They were tough to cut with a fork, even smothered in syrup.  Hubby also got an omlette but with a side of biscuit and gravy. While the gravy had good flavor, you'd need a microscope to find any sausage in it.  The water tasted like well water.  All in all, just not good."}
{"text":"Really great home made corn beef and hash, with biscuit and gravy. This place will become a regular stopping place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch during the week is great here. It is a laid back atmosphere, a mix of ole school music and really nice staff. The food is really good, although I am stuck on the country fried steak, I have tried other items. they serve good sized portions and it is reasonably priced. Great choices of food. this is close to work, service is fast (not fast food fast) but I can take my time eating and still get back to work on time. very satisfying experience. Just too bad there isn't a cot at work for the \"I have eaten well and am sleepy\" afternoon nap. I will continue to eat here until everyone else discovers this place and it gets too crowded."}
{"text":"Had an Italian sandwich here, loved it. Looking forward to trying more of the Chicago oriented items on the menu. Definitely captures some of the Chicago essence."}
{"text":"Got the corned beef, was so so and the tuna avocado wrap which was very so so. Not worth the price. Clam chowder was ok and so was the onion soup. But nothing to write home about - food was a bit greasy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from Chicago, so we had to give WC a try.  The inside of the restaurant is fun and kitschy and shows off loads of Chicago pride.    The food is good and there is a lot of variety.  The servers smile a lot and the place has that fun-family-run-vibe, I had a dessert today cooked by the owners wife (it was delicious)."}
{"text":"Windy City gets three stars because it's a locally owned place, but otherwise it's an average greasy spoon.  Huge portions of over-greased, under-seasoned food (hey, there's a salt shaker on the table, right?). The menu could be a little more imaginative, the service a little more professional, the overall experience a bit less dreary - but sometimes you just need a diner - and Windy City will do."}
{"text":"My first experience with the Windy City Cafe was yesterday (a Sunday). Hubby had been previously and said it was good, so he suggested we go for brunch. We were seated fast, but after that, it took FOREVER for someone to even take our drink order. The busboy actually did it! The joint wasn't THAT busy, so I didn't understand the lack of service. So anyway, finally ordered. I got the country fried steak & eggs with a side of pancakes. Hubs got the corned beef hash skillet. He asked for extra hash browns instead of the toast/pancakes/biscuit&gravy option. The waitress acted like it was a big deal and said she'd ask. It turned out to be ok. Cool. The food came out faster than I expected. Small portions, but with the toast/pancakes/biscuit&gravy option it sorta makes up for it. My food was ok, nothing to brag about. Hubby didn't care too much for his, but it was at least edible. More than I can say for my pancakes! OMG I swear it was like I was sucking on a dirty dish rag. They were awful. I'm not one to waste food, but I couldn't get past a few bites. I have no idea if it was the kind of batter they use, or what, but they seriously need to look into it. I'll never go back for breakfast, but may try their lunch items to see if it's any better at that time of day."}
{"text":"The place is a refurbished Denny's that could have used a little more refurbishing.    We were not greeted right away when we entered.  We were seated by person A, then person B came up and asked us of person A took our drink order.  No, so we order drinks.  Person C comes by and asks if person B took our food order, no.  I had to get up and get our third place setting myself, and we were never offered extra napkins.  I had to wait 5min plus for a tea refill.    The polish dog was  dry with only a small bit of onion, the flavor wasn't but split sausage was overcooked and there was a lot of bread for the size of the sausage.  The house chips were overcooked too.   My kids didn't like their fries, said they weren't crispy enough, but I think about 99.8% of kids would have eaten them without complaint.    The burger was well cooked but seasoned with something like celery salt pretty strongly.  The chicken tenders had a fine cornmeal type of coating that I thoughts was pretty good but the kids still found room for complaint.s"}
{"text":"I so wanted to find a wonderful breakfast place in Scottsdale. Alas, it's not to be. At least, not here.   I had the cheese omelet, hash browns and an english muffin. Pretty easy order, right?   The omelet was okay, but then again, it's probably the safest menu item to order when trying a new place.   The hash browns were awful: pressed down flat like a pathetic pancake, super- greasy, and tasted horrid.   The staff were very nice, and personable. However, the food was not good.   Once again, I'm heading back to downtown Phoenix to Matt's Big Breakfast..."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant, and it was a little bigger than I thought. Food was good and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place lacks consistency. I have eaten at this restaurant five times now.   The first time I had a Chicago hotdog. It was terrible. Waffle fries not so bad.   Second time, a French dip like sandwich. It was terrible. Onion soup was the worst I have ever eaten. Everything tastes canned or previously frozen/frost burn.   Third time, I figured hey I will try breakfast. They can't screw that up. I lucked out, chicken fried steak was amazing. Eggs were cooked well, obviously fresh cracked eggs.   Fourth time, I dropped by with my dad. Breakfast again, this time we both had ham. It was average at best.   Last time I will ever walk into windy city, Philly cheese steak. The steak was RAW throughout the sandwich. RAW, cold and RAW.  Not rare, not pink, red and RAW. It was frozen cold, like they missed half the meat they were cooking.  This place is always empty for a reason.   The waitresses are helpful and kind. The manager always asks how the meal was. They offer a survey after each meal.   Here is the answer, why your restaurant is always empty:  Your food sucks. Get a new cook. Seriously, your food is terrible fix it, that's embarrassing.  It's not terrible, its TURRIBLE (charles barkley bad)."}
{"text":"Sunday morning family breakfast gathering place. Companion had spinach and feta omelet. Spinach fresh and crisp, feta with a bite, perfectly cooked omelette. (way too easy to go soggy on these!) My chorizo and eggs scramble was warm, like it had sat in the pass a little while, and cooked slightly past where I prefer, but understandable with the meat mixed in. And they have a very good salsa! Buttermilk pancakes side were excellent.  Service was slightly disorganized this visit, but a lot of new faces were evident in the front of the house prepping for the mid morning Sunday rush. Generally service here is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Nice staff! Server was great. The potatoes served with plates needs to be cooked more and browned on both sides.  No huevos rancheros! Let's get it together now and place this on le menu ;)"}
{"text":"Bummer.   I was so excited to visit this place!   First, the service is excellent. Excellent folks! Attentive, accommodating, helpful -- everything service should be.   But, wow, I was disappointed in the food. I went with a breakfast skillet. Goodness, whoever is handling the marketing should get gold stars. The menu is fabulous and that skillet sounded like it was going to put me out for the rest of the day.   No such thing happened.   It was a teeny-tiny skillet with overcooked hash browns and the smallest sampling of eggs. The most forward taste? The vegetables, which would have been wonderful, but the chopped up bell peppers were somewhat glossy in flavor. You know the taste I mean -- like the vegetable had been wrapped in cellophane before being cooked.   Crud.   I think I just ordered the wrong thing on the menu. My companion gloated about her breakfast offering.   I would go again, but I would try something else off of that gorgeous, expansive menu!"}
{"text":"After visiting the Breakfast Joynt on several occasions and being in the area, my family and I went out to breakfast only to realize that it is now the Windy City Cafe.  We gave it a try, and found the restaurant a pleasant experience.  There were few people there around 9 AM (probably since the Windy City Cafe is so new...or perhaps it is simply too hot outside to leave home in Phoenix today).  We also received very quick service after sitting down.  There is free wifi and they offer delivery service.    I ordered an \"Eggceptional Breakfast\" with hash browns, toast, eggs, and bacon.  My father ordered a similar dish while my sister took advantage of a special that included chicken and egg whites.  While the food itself was good, there was some miscommunication with the signage outside where it wasn't clear what came with what, and my sister ended up being overcharged.  When we pointed this out, the management did clarify the signage and removed any overcharging.  Everyone we interacted with was nice and quite reasonable though!  I will definitely plan on coming back another time."}
{"text":"I sat here for 3 hours and drank tea while using their wifi. I didn't order food but I saw what other people were eating and everything looked delicious and smelled great. The wifi and a/c were great for my purposes. Keep in mind only one table in the main room has a power outlet, so make sure your computer is fully charged. This is a rare unpretentious place in Scottsdale with good food and reasonable prices.  I hear they are about to get their liquor license, which will give their patrons more options."}
{"text":"Honestly upset I wasted my money at this place. Went for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The place was pretty full and everyone in there was running around like their heads were cut off. Bad service...bad management... The food came out cold (after waiting and 35 minutes to get it), my drink was empty most of the time, and they forgot to bring out my pancakes until after I had already finished eating. Maybe it was just a bad day for them..but when the manager (or who I thought was the manager) came by and asked how everything was, she started leaving before I even said anything. But when I stopped her and told her the food came out cold and wasn't very good she gave me a bug eyed look and asked if I wanted a box...for the food I just told her wasn't good... I wasted 20$ and an hour and a half of time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere for your casual dining experience in south Tempe.  Meeting place of the Tempe Exchange Club,  your local American Service Group, join us every Tuesday morning at 7."}
{"text":"Burger of the day was Avocado Jack...GREAT burger!! Cooked just the way I asked. Lunch was served within 10 minutes...perfect for my lunch break. Great menu selection...will def be back for breakfast. Also great service!! Will def tell all my friends!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy. It reminds me of Chicago very much. Lots of smiles and quick service. THE FRYS ROCK!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today, late morning, because I was starving after having to go to the doc for blood work (no food!) I just really wanted some good old comfort breakfast food and I got it!  The place was almost empty, but my waitress was lovely and greeted me right away. She was attentive throughout the meal. I ordered their waffle special which came with 2 eggs and bacon. The waffle was delish! Light and fluffy and just how I like them. Good strong coffee and I was a happy gal!  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and they are very pleasant.  Service is good, food is good -- you have to try it out.  Right next to Gold's Gym so you could go there after your work-out.  Their wi-fi works fabulously as I have a tablet I use for everything and need this service.  I agree with another review -- the corned beef hash was perfect!  I am from Guam and we know good corned beef and are willing to spend way too much money on canned products -- why when you can go to this restaurant.  Coffee rocks!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Windy City Cafe and I have really enjoyed the service. It has been a little tradition going there after church on Sundays. The new owner always remembers and sits down to talk and hang out. The food is always done correctly, and just this past week I ordered an Italian Omlette and this is the first any kind of omlette that I haven't had to put ketchup or hot sauce on. The Marinara dipping sauce is great.  Every meal I have had here has been amazing, I love supporting local restaurants and Windy City Cafe has the freshest food I've tasted at a restaurant yet! After talking to the new owner there will be changes with the menu to make it more authentic Chicago style!  Trust when I say family, Windy City Cafe treats you like family."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Windy City Café since it opened. They are a few blocks from our house and the owner wanted to build a neighborhood restaurant. That attitude and the food made me a regular. There was a comment about breakfast just being breakfast food and eggs, bacon and hash browns can be pretty similar fare everywhere, unless you like breakfast and know the difference. I like the coffee hot with flavor, the eggs over medium, the bacon crisp but not burned, and the hash browns hot, just a little crispy on the edges and not dripping in grease. I get that every time at the Windy City. So far nobody I have referred there has had complaints. They like regulars and there are a bunch of us they know by name - so stop in and be sure to introduce yourself."}
{"text":"The breakfast and lunch are good, they don't serve dinner. I like the scramblers and salads. Lots of selection. Great service, the owner David is usually there and seems to know everyone. Good portions and great prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time last Sunday to eat breakfast.  I had a build-your-own omelette with hash browns and biscuits and gravy on the side.  My wife had a belgian waffle with eggs and bacon on the side.  We both enjoyed our meals, and the coffee wasn't too shabby, either.  Most importantly, they had Cholula hot sauce available upon request; breakfast is never the same without Cholula!  The service was pleasant and the owner even came by before we left to introduce himself.  All around good, and what you would expect from a traditional diner.  We will return the next time we are looking for a hearty breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"BEWARE: NEW OWNERS!!  I live right down the street form the Windy City Cafe and i go there to eat quite often, NEVER AGAIN!  I went there yesterday morning (Sunday 3/17/13) with na friend who also frequents there (ALSO, NEVER AGAIN!)  to get what i normally get there for breakfast.  I did not recognize any of the staff, they were all gone.  The menu was changed. We sat down, one waitress asked if we wanted something to drink, we ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 glass of water, a different waitress brought us 1 cup of coffee and 2 waters.  A third waitress then took our order.  As i always order whole wheat pancakes, i asked if the pancakes on the combo platter were the same size if you order just a stack of pancakes, she replied \"yes, they are\"  I asked for my bacon to be very crisp and my eggs to be over-medium.  While our breakfasts were cooking (we sat down at 8:10am and we got our breakfasts at 8:45am)  way to long to wait for breakfast.  Oh, did i mention that i am a retired restaurant worker and chef with 32 years of experience under my belt?  The entire time we waited for our breakfasts our coffee cups were empty, and i didn't see anyone breaking a speed record to refill them.  Finally, our meals arrived, barely warm.  Our VERY SMALL (half the size they used to be)  pancakes were rough and crusty on the top telling me that they were under the heat lamp for awhile before delivery. My bacon was pure fat, not even resembling crispy, and my eggs were barely over-easy with broken yolks, not even close to over-medium.  No one checked back to see if everything was good until we were 90% done with our breakfasts, i complained about the bacon, still sitting on my plate, never to be eaten, and the waitress said \"sorry\".  When i got the check, the bacon was still on there, and when i paid for the check i should have gotten $11.87 back, i got $11 back and she apparently kept the $0.87 which i included as part of her tip which was 10% in my book.  I used to be a store trainer for a chain of restaurants, no one ever trained these people.  I WILL NOT GO BACK THERE!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Saturday morning right before 10am. The breakfast rush was just ending and the restaurant slowly cleared out. We were greeted immediately and seated near the back of the restaurant in a booth. I liked sitting in the booth - at other restaurants, we usually get seated at a two person table. The waitress took our drink order - coffee for myself and an orange juice for my husband. The menu is extensive - three or four pages full of both breakfast and lunch items. They have everything here - eggs and egg dishes of all forms, pancakes, waffles, French toast, crepes, skillets, burritos, sandwiches, etc. It was hard to decide. Our waitress had to come back a few times before I was ready. (I originally thought I wanted a crepe but then decided on a skillet.) I ordered the chorizo skillet - salsa, cheese, eggs any style all over hash browns with a choice of side - toast, pancakes, or biscuits and gravy. I went with sourdough toast. My husband ordered the corn beef skillet with a side of biscuits and gravy. Our food arrived quickly and we were informed it was piping hot. My toast was really good - nice thick slices that came with plenty of butter on the side. I also really enjoyed my skillet - however there was way too much! I had to take it home for breakfast the next day. Next time we could share a skillet! My husband liked his skillet but really loved his biscuits and gravy. I agree they were really tasty! The biscuit was really fluffy and melt in your mouth with large sausage hunks in the gravy. I would definitely order more biscuits and gravy next time. I'd also like to try some of their other items - the crepes sounded delicious and I'm a sucker for pancakes. Overall, it was a good experience and a nice addition to the breakfast scene in the area."}
{"text":"After going to Yupha's Thai Kitchen and the line was out the door we needed to pick a new place and I fired up Yelp and found the windy city café right across the way...  Upon entering the staff was really friendly and seated us right away. The menu is huge lots to choose from hard to pick just one thing... I ended up going with the beef & sausage combo (Italian sausage, Roast beef, Spicy Giardiniera on a French Roll with Au Jus Served with waffle fries. What a meal so good the waffle fries are like the east coast fires I miss and the spicy giadiniera so good. I will be back for sure to try new things off the menu."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot....  Met-RX PROTEIN pancakes :) ummmmmm....OK!!  Chicken & Kale omelet...tasty!!!!  Potatoes and Home fries that aren't oily...yes please....  Kids loved it, gluten free pancakes and the largest yogurt granola fruit parfait I've seen in a long time.   Without the high prices.  Service was awesome, mom and pop feel.   BOOM!"}
{"text":"I went here with my son on Sunday March 24th 2013 for breakfast. We learned it was under new ownership. The waitress Candy seemed nice. I ordered hot tea. Candy dropped my tea off with no spoon, no cream, no lemon... no nothing. They dropped plenty of condiments to the patrons that ordered coffee, but what to do with a tea drinker seemed to stump Candy. The tea pot was made for loose tea, yet I was given a tea bag. As a result it made a puddle on the table when you poured the tea. I mentioned the lack of condiments and the wrong tea pot to Candy, she just blamed the restaurant owner for the pot and the other waitress for the lack of condiments and NEVER cleaned up the spill.   My son ordered the Denver omelet, I ordered eggs over easy, corn beef hash and a blueberry pancake. While we waited the waitresses tried to pour coffee in my tea 4 times. One attempt almost made it.   When the food arrived my son's omelet was so cold the cheese inside was still hard and cold. His toast didn't arrive for 5 minutes after he started eating. My eggs were cold, corn beef hash was cold, only the pancakes were hot. So we figured all of our food waited for my pancakes to cook. We pointed it out to Candy, she blamed the cook. My son asked for water. It never came.   At the end of the meal Candy asked how everything was. I listed all that had happened; the cold food, the tea, never getting water for my son, the toast... I even mention the half used sugar packet on the window sill with a couple bugs munching on it. I handed her my credit card and she responded with absolutely no remorse or apology, \"do you want to fill out a comment card?\" I said, \"why, I just told you everything.\" She just walked away.   The Windy City is 2 minutes from my house. I will never return."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Our breakfast this morning started off on the wrong foot. We entered this establishment with 7 people. When our waiter took us to a 6-top table and started setting out the 4 menus he brought, I politely reminded him we had 7 people. He proceeded to count the 6 chairs in front of us aloud, and then rudely told me that if I moved aside, he would add another chair. At this point, I lost my appetite completely. He did make an extraordinary effort to be polite to everyone and the service was good. When I did not order an entree he asked me if I was keeping my selection a secret. I explained that I was not hungry. When the food arrived, he asked me if I wanted some crayons to draw with. I am a 26 year-old woman. When I declined his offer he said, \"well the kids love crayons.\" I am not a child. The breakfasts my family ordered were nothing special, just ok. I could not get out of there fast enough. There are much better \"brunch\" spots in the city. Don't waste your time here. I'm headed to \"Essence Bakery and Cafe\" to start my day over."}
{"text":"From the name, I had previously assumed that this place was a restaurant that served Chicago style pizza.  But it came up in Yelp as a breakfast joint when I was frantically searching for somewhere that didn't have an hour wait on a Sunday morning. They got us seated right away and someone (manager, I think) brought us our coffee lickety split and left us to look over the menu until our server freed up from helping other tables.  I had the banana nut waffles and the hubby had his usual steak and eggs.  We both liked our food but agreed it wasn't blow-your-mind fantastic.  Best part about this place was the great service and cute, retro diner ambiance.  The menu for for dinner seemed to have a lot of good old fashioned American basics, too.  A little bit of Chicago sprinkled in but not overwhelmingly so.  Not really to my taste, but I'm sure we will be back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, great friendly atmosphere, and reminds you of the great Windy City, what more can you ask for?  We went here for brunch/lunch, and tried the Reuben, and a breakfast scramble.  Their breakfasts are prepared simply, but the ingredients are very fresh and well prepared.  You have the option of upgrading your pancakes to strawberry pancakes for $.50, which is worth it since they pack in a lot of strawberries inside and on top of them.    The Reuben was very good.  It was a good mix of ingredients, with no one ingredient overshadowing the other.  In some restaurants, they over stack the meat and then skimp on the quality of the bread, and in others they do the opposite in that there is not enough meat and all you taste is bread.  In addition, it was nice that the bread was grilled to give it a nice toasty texture to contrast with the sauerkraut and the meat.    Service was excellent.  They really want to make sure you have the best experience here, and it really shows that they are passionate about the restaurant and the quality of the food they serve here."}
{"text":"There's nothing that is greater than supporting small businesses. Occasionally, I am disappointed with the \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, but in this case, I was impressed. The setting was very homey and cozy, versus the two hour line that I wait in, in order to get a table at Denny's or even IHop. My husband and I were greeted by a friendly face and from someone who was proud to be working for the cafe and for its owners. In regards to the most important thing, the food, it was fabulous! The first time we went there, I had the corned beef hash plate that really hit the spot. The second time, I had one of their awesome sandwiches, the Beef and Sausage Combo that had Italian sausage, roast beef, and some of their wonderful marinated peppers, all on a French Roll. That hit the spot as well and will be one of my favorites when I go back there. My husband and I had such a great experience and love the atmosphere and will continue to return. Whether you are looking for breakfast or lunch, this cafe in Tempe will not let you down."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have gone out to a new place for breakfast every Sunday for the last 6 months and I must say this place is in my TOP 5!!! My friend and I are both from Illinois and having visited Chicago many, many times we felt right at home. The staff was very friendly and attentive to anything you need. They have a few TV's for your football or other viewing pleasures.  The menu has a wide variety of dishes for both breakfast and lunch. Now I will admit when I go somewhere new I am always watching the plates come out of the kitchen to help me decide what I want. All I can say was everything looked delicious ;)    I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone"}
{"text":"It was just a matter of time!  The restaurant was way to large the food was not consistent and the servers bathed in strong perfume and then served your food!  It was nice to see ya but better to see you go!  Good luck back in Chicago"}
{"text":"When there's not good coffee I barely want to come back.  It's somewhere I atop of him in the area for work.  Good and service is good.  If they could improve the coffee I'd give them another star.  Ambiance is fine, nothing special to it.  It's next to golds gym so traffic can be crazy.  Outdoor seating available.   It's never packed.  I think they just changed the menu."}
{"text":"A nice little spot in Tempe to stop in for breakfast or lunch. Nothing too fancy going on here - really more of a diner. Expect good food from good folks. I'll pick this over Denny's anytime."}
{"text":"This past Sunday we decided on breakfast out and being a little later than usual my partner and I headed over to Windy City. They have great food and you can usually avoid the big crowds you'll find at many places on Sunday morning.  Windy City really is an overlooked gem, and that's good for us. We arrived about 10:00 AM and the place was bustling, but not so busy that we couldn't be seated right away.  Our waiter brought us drinks and took our orders promptly. A good thing because we were both getting hungry. The choices they have for breakfast and lunch are AMAZING. I settled on the Greektown Skillet with a side of Pancakes and my partner chose Pork Chops and eggs with a side of biscuits and gravy.   Now let's stop right there. Very few other places in the Phoenix area I know of offer your choice of Toast, Pancakes or Biscuits and Gravy for your SIDE with breakfast. PLUS the prices are the same or better than the places I'm not such a fan of (The Good Egg, Mimi's and many others.)  If you want a great breakfast and a wide variety of choices at a reasonable price, head on over to Windy City."}
{"text":"I have had no complaints until today. The food has always been good, good portions, etc, but I ordered the protein pancakes with blueberries this morning ($7.50 for the cakes PLUS $1.50 for the fruit) and they were the size of the side cakes. 2 very thin cakes. They tasted good, but if you are going to make them that small, you should consider changing the price. I'm not happy I just paid $9 to still be hungry."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast yesterday and it was alright, but nothing special. I got a skillet meal (can't remember the name) but it had mushroom, bell peppers, onions, and other veggies, cheese and a couple eggs which I got over easy. It's served over hashbrowns. I felt like the veggies weren't super fresh and the meal was lacking flavor. It wasn't bad, just kind of boring. The BF got the banana pecan pancakes and they were large but the pancakes were somewhat bland as well. The coffee was tasty though, so that was good. I would definitely like to try this place for lunch because I love vienna beef hotdogs....but for breakfast, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly slow on a Saturday morning, walked in about 8 am and there was nobody here! Lucky me! ordered the classic eggs Benedict and I will have to admit, it liked my taste buds and didn't last very long on my plate. simply delicious! Only nit picky thing is that the hash browns were not very crispy like i ordered, and unseasoned, but edible. I also ordered a side oF biscuits and gravy. It was good, very salty, nothing too special and didn't stand out much. The place was a little hard to find for me. just incase your wondering its next to golds gym on the north side of it, little hole in the wall place, but that's what makes this place personable and quiet. I wish this place was  busier so they don't go out of business because it's a real gem. great customer service! Don't know if it was the lack of customers, but they took really good care of me and my coffee was never empty. Menu is rather big, but only because they have every topping you could want on you French toast, pancakes, crepes, you name it, they can probably make it happen. Apparently they deliver, I would love to wake up in the morning, And get my breakfast delivered, how about you?"}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I came recently thinking we were coming to the Breakfast Joynt. Since we were already here we decided to dine in. The layout is similar and they serve breakfast during lunchtime, too.   For $10, I ordered a build your own omelet with 3 items and a choice of cheese. It also comes with your choice of toast or pancakes and hashbrowns. I had them add avocado, spinach, onions and feta cheese. I enjoyed my omelet, a lot, but found the feta puzzling. It seemed spongy, if that makes any sense. Regardless, the omelet was very tasty. I did not enjoy the hashbrowns and found them to be tasteless and mushy. One of my favorite things about Breakfast Joynt was their hashbrowns with diced onions. Too bad this new restaurant did not stack up.  My friend's sandwich with waffle fries looked really good.   The service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfasts I have ever encountered. The only redeeming quality was the friendly waitress who refilled our coffee. How can you mess up English muffins, I ask you? Damp, untoasted, and tasteless. How can you mess up hollandaise - sticky, gooey, flavorless. How can you mess up eggs? Overcooked and dry. How can you mess up hash browns? Cold and greasy. Enough said."}
