{"text":"The best around can't beat the prices,  friendly service, very clean, I go by whenever possible! If you want a sandwich or a snack, gas or even a car wash, go by,  they even have crushed ice for soft drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is really good I have personally eaten on there on my own as well as order for our company luncheons.   Great service"}
{"text":"Well this certainly wasn't what I was expecting , a deli in a gas station did not sound appealing , but the service was great and the food was amazingly delicious.  This sandwich is a 6-inch sandwich but could easily feed two people with the amount of meat. The baguette bread was toasted and delicious , Subway Quiznos, and Jersey Mike's could all learn a lesson from this little Deli."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing! I saw the reviews on yelp so I decided to give it a try. I didn't think it would be this good so I'm so surprised. The veggies are fresh and everything has a ton of flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!! And very fast. Not a large variety of meat, but it doesn't matter. I got the turkey with bacon and it was WAY better than subway. Unlike another review I read, I WOULD go out of my way to eat here. Very good. And prices are good too. Got a 12 inch sub to split with my husband, 1 bag of chips and 2 sodas for $11."}
{"text":"Located inside a gas station, definitely worth trying if you're on this side of town.. Fresh bread fresh ingredients... highly recommend.. way better then your  average chain sandwich places.."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place. One of the better deli's I've been to. The sandwiches are fresh & tasty. My bf & I both got 6', big portions. Cheap prices!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit! Coming from the east coast it's hard to find a great sub. This hidden gem was an amazing find here on Yelp! Perfect rolls, lots of meat, and quality ingredients. Don't let the gas station vibe defer you from trying it out! It's 100 perfect worth the try!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com cheaper and more fresher than your subway and other sandwich places. Try it!"}
{"text":"I'm not posting a photo with my review because....well I ate most of it before I decided to write a review. On my way into the office this morning and as I'm sitting at the light. this little sign that said \"Roy's Deli\" on the side of a gas station at Craig & Simmons caught my eye. So I decided to check it out. Man am I glad I did! Looked like a regular mini mart gas station when I walked in. As I'm scoping out the deli counter, the cashier asks if I need a sandwich today. I figured, \"why not, I'll give it a try.\" He said to just fill out the sandwich slip with what I want and someone would make it up for me. Very nice lady comes up to take my slip and greets me with a smile. She could tell it was my first time here, and offered me a deli club card, because she hopes I like it enough to come back. Unlike subway, the sandwich wasn't just thrown together as fast as she could. She took her time with her craft. I went ahead and ordered the 12\" just in case. Not knowing what to expect, I thanked her, paid for my order and headed to the office, where I stuck my sandwich in the fridge. 1 pm, rolled around and I decided it was time to give this sandwich a try. I wish I hadn't waited. This sandwich was huge and packed full of flavor. I had a turkey with bacon, swiss and all the fixins. Couldn't even finish it (so I guess there's leftovers for a snack later)."}
{"text":"Delicious...way better than a subway!  The ladies at the counter are so friendly.  I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"What a surprise in this gas station. The sandwich was delicious!! Better then port of subs. Must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. Ordering process was pretty straight forward. Picked roast beef and turkey 12\". The sandwich was a manly size! Plenty of meat. Delicious. Would I come here again? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"This is really a great place for sandwiches. Everything is fresh and with great value. You couldn't tell from the outside because it is inside a gas station, but it is really good.  People making the sandwiches are friendly and they are not stingy on the amount of meat they give you like other sandwich places.  I like it enough that I've become a regular customer."}
{"text":"As a \"Regular\" here !(Between 6a-2p M-F)  I am ADDICTED to their Awesome deli sandwiches that Crystal or Beth make for me  just about everyday !! They even heat the bacon up for ya !!  Everybody is so friendly there. It's a great place to start your day...."}
{"text":"When a friend said the best sandwich in Vegas is made at a number of gas stations I thought his idea of quality and mine were probably different. Until he brought me a sandwich from Roy's Deli. Holy cow! Hands down the best sub I've had in Vegas by far. Will never go to a chain sandwich shop again. After several visits to two different Roy's Deli locations I finally figured out what makes their sandwiches so much better than everyone else's. The staff make each sandwich with a lot of love! Do yourself a favor, hit this place up next time you want a good sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a quite some time now when I want a good, basic sandwich. You wouldn't expect anything great from a gas station, but they do a really great job. With options like Subway and Jimmy Johns so close by and I consistently come to Roy's, that says something.   You just write down what you want on the paper they have you fill out, give to the attendant, and they make it for you there. There is also a few tables located in here so you can eat inside. It's a great little spot!"}
{"text":"Great little unknown deli. An actual 12\"(more like 14) sandwich, unlike the crap you get from Subway, Port of Subs or Firehouse. The little trick of dicing the onions, tomatoes and pickles, transforms these sandwiches. Try it and you'll see. A little pricey at $8.99 for the 12\" with only 2 meats, but well worth it.  Attention to detail is what makes these sandwiches worth the price abd even a 10 mile drive. The guy that works the late afternoon/evening shift tends to create the better sandwiches."}
{"text":"Well, let me get the obvious out of the way: this is a sandwich shop inside a gas station. Yeah, that seems kinda shady, but don't be so quick to dismiss Roy's!  The bread is good (it comes from Great Buns - yay for delicious and double yay for supporting a local bakery!). The meat and cheese are good, although they pretty much just have the usuals (ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, tuna, I think).  There's a good selection of veggie toppings.  The sandwiches are fresh made as you order.  There's an excellent selection of fountain drinks (duh).  Service is friendly and quick. Prices are awesome! $4.99 for a sandwich, bag of chips, and a drink. There is a small seating area inside if you need a break, but it's probably much more enjoyable to eat at home.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Roy's, but it's definitely a solid sandwich option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have seen this place. Any time on yelp and in person. To be honest I'm hesitant to buy a sandwich from a gas station. Most of the time however it smells really good. So the other day I decide to go for it. Sandwich was about 6$ for a  6\" sub. Well it had tons of meat and was delicious. Great value and great sandwich. Glad I tried it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were excellent and inexpensive.  Service was good too. They couldn't lettuce wrap my sandwich but they were willing to turn it into a chopped salad for me which was great.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is unique because you can customize your own sandwich. I would definitely choose this place over Subway and Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Holy moly! This place was a surprise. Literally inside of a gas station store...6 in sub is only $4.99, and it's so simple, you order on a sheet, hand it to the employee, they make it for you, you leave! And seriously one of the best cold subs I've had! Especially for the price. Subway sandwiches are trash and they charge like $8+ now. Roy's will be my new place to get a sub! Can't beat the price. Delicious sandwiches as well. Definitely the best sandwich I've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Forget about Port of subs or Jersey Mikes! Im coming here from now on when I want a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect there sandwiches to be so good, a gas station with a little sandwich shop. It was a little sketch because it was right next to the cashier. Well golly, I was pleasantly surprised...the sandwich was just what I was craving. The bread was evenly toasted, it had just the right amount of veggies and they had these amazing crunchy PICKLES! Yes pickles, it brought the whole sandwich together! Some of the best surprises come from hole in the wall places!"}
{"text":"We found this gem on Yelp on our way to Lake Mead with our boat. We hit it up both days we were in town on our way to the lake! The sandwiches were awesome quality, delicious and the kind gals making the sandwiches wrapped them up extra special for us so they would stay fresh in our cooler. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Made a quick pit stop to this gas station and saw these fire sandwiches. We ended up getting one just to see what it was all about...let me tell you, it exceeded all expectations of a sandwich. They let you choose many different types of deli meat without charging you extra for each. It's a set price based on size. I will definitely be coming back for another sub."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would!  After reading rave reviews, we decided to see if the subs and service lived up to what people wrote.  From the minute we walked in it door, it was one of the most AWFUL situations we've ever experienced! There was a red haired woman, approximately in her 60s walking around as if she owned the place, and asked us what we were looking for. We said, \"The Deli.\" She said, \"You're not getting anything at the Deli. She's (Marie)  working here by herself and can't make anything for you!\"  I said, \"Excuse me, it states online that the Deli is open 24 hours. Why doesn't it say that is pending staffing?\"  Marie, who was working behind the counter was pleasant, and said she would make sandwiches for us. We thanked her and filled out the order form. While we were patiently waiting for Marie to help other customers, the red haired woman came up behind us, smelled of alcohol and had obviously been listening to the conversation my husband and I were having. She said to me, \"Why don't you stop complaining. You LOOK as if you're going to eat this entire place (eluding to my size.. obviously not knowing that I have a disability that causes me to gain wait.\" I told her she was rude and asked if she worked there; She refused to answer. However, if she doesn't work there, Roy's is in strict violation of Health Department regulations, because she was back and forth behind the deli counter, touching food, and even took a pizza out of the oven!  We were going to overlook her behavior, attributing it to the alcohol that we smelled on her breath... Until she said, \"And YOU BETTER TIP HER!\" ENOUGH.. We decided to leave. And, as we were leaving, she continued to run her mouth.  I don't know if the owner of this establishment is aware that this type of behavior occurs there. If he/she does.. Shame on them. I will be calling to try to find out.  I will also be making this known on every form of social media I can find... And, I will be contacting the Health Department.  If you want to take a chance if being treated this way.. check this place out. If not, I guarantee you there are PLENTY of places in town that have better looking food, and FAR SUPERIOR SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp or never would I ever have normally stopped in this place for a sandwich! After reading all the positive reviews I decided since it was right up the street it was worth a shot and to my surprise it was inside the gas station I go to vacuum/wash my car frequently and never took a second look!!  I must say the boyfriend and I throughly enjoyed our sandwiches that were made to order. Ingredients were fresh and my toasted bread almost tasted like a yummy French banquette (bf said his untoasted was some of the best white bread he's had that wasn't made at home). We will definitely be heading back next time the sandwich craving strikes."}
