{"text":"I have been raised on great Italian food, this was ok but overpriced for what we had.  One waiter was condescending, we should have left."}
{"text":"If you like the classic old look,, you will feel right at home in this very rustic trattoria that has been in business for more than 25 years. The chef owner Pasquale makes the best spagetti carbonara I have ever had (no cream in the recipe)and my wife's chicken parmgiana was delicious. We asked for some pen arrabiata with the chicken and there was no extra charge \"for the pretty wife\". The waiters Mauro and Franco were friendly and not pushy. The starter suggestion calmars and zuchini hit the spot, and the house red was surprisingly good and at a fair price. 

For those of you who like a trendy looking diningroom, you will not be happy. The two diningrooms are part of a basement which is 5 or 6 steps lower than sidewalk level. The design of the restaurant reminds me of a style that was common in the 1970-1980's. Remember how some restaurants would create a wine cellar out of round clay bricks set in the walls? Well. There is a diningroom where they have it. And the cllay does keep the wine at a good temperature; so says  the chef Pasquale

The wine list is not a huge list, but if you want a prestigious wine, there are some; but for me, the house red was fine while she drank her martini.
We opted to skip the dessert. There is no valet, and parking can be an issue. If going there before a hockey event at the Bell Center, I suggest parking west of Guy on Rene Levesque there is a hotel on the south east side of St Mathieu and the rate is reasonable and it s indoors.

What is great about this restaurant is the food.
The chef wants to please and it shows.
As for the waiters, my better half liked the Moe guy.
Hopefully he will be there next time because if she is happy
it makes me happy too."}
{"text":"Love this little Italian restaurant! After walking the city all day we were tired and starving. The comfy, home-style Italian food from this place was just what we needed! The waiter said that they stay open for as long as people come in, so it's a great place for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant - a little quiet sanity in the craziness of Crescent St. in Montreal.  This place really feels like a legit small family Italian place.  I kept it simple - an antipasti plate and pasta with marinara sauce, plus a glass of House red wine.

The antipasti plate was exactly what I expected.  Very good.  The fresh tomato was *really* good.  Just a bite, but now in August, it was everything a good tomato should be, and did not taste like an industrial product (sad joke, given just how bad grocery store tomatoes in the U.S. are these days).  The mozzarella went with it very well.

The bread was a bit of a disappointment - it would have been great to have some really fresh bread, but it was okay.

The pasta and sauce was just fine, with fresh grated parmigiana cheese and fresh cracked pepper on top.  Just the way I like it.   I go for the simple straight forward dishes.  If they can get these right, then the more complex stuff is usually good as well.  Again, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked just right.

So I would suggest this place if you are looking for a good place in Montreal with that family-run Italian feeling.

BTW, I looked at the selection of wines and it looked great."}
{"text":"I am enjoying a pre fixe meal which I selected the escargot provencal - which was excellent - veal masala with mushrooms also delicious and a quarter liter of house red. The choices for the pre fixe are good. I am deciding on dessert after the main course."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Beautiful atmosphere and kind of reminds you of Italy. Authentic, delicious food. We popped in after a long day of sightseeing and they took great care of us. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cozy and romantic atmosphere. Fancier but still reasonably priced. Really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a recent visit to Montreal. Food was very good overall a little salty. Pasta and sauce were fresh we had the chicken fettuccini and veal parmesan . The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's got a cozy feeling to it inside. At the end of your meal you get a bowl of walnuts and clementines which was a nice touch :) overall it was good!"}
{"text":"Am giving this place four stars for making me feel like I stepped off a street in Rome and ducked into a cozy little cafe, plus all of their pasta is house made, a big plus for me. You can order house wine by the 1/4 or 1/2 liter. The house Italian Chardonnay pairs beautifully with the linguine and clams."}
{"text":"Eating at Trattoria Trestevere is the cheapest way to travel to Italy!!! I'm so glad I found this place. Everything is just absolutely authentic: the atmosphere, the service, great wine, excellent food...."}
{"text":"Last time I visited this wonderful restaurant was way back in 1992. Alberto and Guido always greeted me with the warmest smiles and hospitality.  I cannot believe this trattoria is still amazing.  Warm atmosphere, delicious home style food that you simply cannot go wrong with.  It's not just a restaurant to me where I can have heartwarming food that nourishes my soul, but an old friend you can rely on who is unpretentious and stable.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Trattoria Trestevere is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in Montreal located conveniently downtown.

My family has been going here for years. It is our go to for a celebratory meal. The salads and minestrone are delicious, as are all of the pasta dishes and desserts (tiramisu and tartufo). 

I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Tortellini Gigi was amazing and one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It is packed with rich flavors. I will travel back to Montreal just to eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been here four or five times before and I am always happy with my meal! Tonight I had the Homemade ravioli and it was amazing, probably the best dish I've had here. If you like rosé sauce you would love this dish! Also the coffee is delicious, a perfect way to end a meal in an intimate setting. And don't forget to have the Spumoni for dessert which is homemade!"}
{"text":"Urgh! This is a frustrating review to write because I think that I made the fatal error of just ordering the wrong things. You know when you look around and you think, \"Wait a sec...all of their food looks really good...why does my food not look like that?\"

So I'm gonna give it another try, and will update if necessary.

Here's the deal...we both ordered off the table d'hôte. And it really was not worth it, in my opinion, for the tiny salad and kind of average dessert that you spend about ten extra bucks for. (Also, you gotta gimme a heads up if all your desserts are soaked in alcohol. Homie don't play that.)

I don't quite recall our choices, but I do recall that they were almost entirely composed of cheese, upon cheese, upon cheese. And not much else. I get it Italian food has cheese. But not that much. I will say, it was quality, not your random shredded pizza mozz. But it was just overwhelming. 

The service was great though. And I liked the ambiance pretty well."}
{"text":"Located on lower Crescent Street, you will find Trattoria to be homey, comfortable and friendly. 

It is an older restaurant, but that only makes it more fun. They make you feel like family. Each dish is great. They have a shrimp dish you must try and save room for desert.

Their wine list is very nice and will not make you take out a second mortgage. 

You will love this place. The locals seem to and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"A charming Italian restaurant just off Rue St Catherine.  We sat outside until the rain drove us in.  Not busy at all on a Saturday night, but Americans are always early enough to beat the crowds.  We both had the prix fixe, and each dish was excellent.  In particular, the caprese was as good as any I've had in Italy and maybe the best ever.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful with good suggestions.  The $$$ is about right and well worth it."}
{"text":"Ravioli was machine pressed. Rosé sauce was velvety. But the bruschetta was below average, tiny bites. Great refuge from the cold long lines of St Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper tonight at Trattoria Trestevere.

Avelino brought us some appies ... the bruschetta was delicious.  He also brought us some warm rolls ... they were soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.

Gord started with a Caesar's Salad and he said it was the best Caesar's Salad he's ever had.

Gord ordered Spaghetti carbonara and said it was delicious.  He liked that the pasta was fresh and he said the sauce was good.  He'd get it again.

I ordered Lasagna al forno and it too was delicious.  The pasta was fresh and it was a large portion.  Yum!

After our meal, Avelino brought us a bowl of walnuts and nectarines.  Alas, we were too full to enjoy them.

I mentioned that Gord's birthday was tomorrow and Avelino bought him a piece of cake.  I just had a couple bites and it was good ... it seemed to be soaked in booze and the icing was creamy.

If you want traditional Italian food, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Classic old style Italian in a cozy intimate setting.  The outside is deceptive--you can almost overlook it with Hurleys pub next door. But once you descend the stairs you are cocooned in a intimate setting that is a throwback to another era. Unpretentious but excellent food served with attentive service.   Highly recommend their pasta and homemade spumoni..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant got so many good stars. Our service was normal and the food was not that great. I personally would not come back here the final kicker is when we got the bill and notice how outrageously priced it was. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"I was genuinely disappointed by this restaurant because I saw the pretty good rating and felt tricked. The food was too salty and did not stand out at all! The meat they cooked was not that good, seasoning is too heavy. Overall I didn't enjoy my dining experience, period."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy has this place maintained its luster over the years, the food, table and wine service is as top notch as you will find any where and the food, well you'll just have to go for yourself as words simply cannot adequately convey the delightful experience that awaits you at Trattoria Trestevere. 
  I started with the escargot in a heavenly sauce that was just plain awesome, followed by a piece of perfectly grilled Dore. Dore is a very delicate mild tasting fish but the flavor was enhanced by a subtle grilled smokey charred flavor served in a lemon butter wine sauce, simply out of this world delicious. The accompanying pasta with tomato sauce was as perfectly done as anyone could possibly expect or hope for in this life time anywhere. Dessert was a creme caramel, it too was excellent and an espresso short with a glass of Sambucca with three coffee beans, là vous allez la conclusion parfaite!
  Do not miss this Montreal Italian food standout,  I trust you will be as mesmerized with your experience as I was and am with mine."}
