{"text":"We are frequent visitors to Toronto and love to try new places! This place is too notch! Everything we tried was delicious.  The crostini, the salad the gnocchi! The dessert! You cannot go wrong ! The drinks and the bartender are also top notch!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there recently.  Everything was spot on.  Loved it.  Prices were reasonable but portions were a tad small."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night with a reservation. 

Food: Okay, but nothing to write home about. We shared the saucisson sec & gruyere to start which was good but what I would expect for an apertivo, not a $12 app. I had the gnocchi with oxtail ragu which was incredible. I would have ordered two! My beau had the sausage pizza which was overcooked. Thin-crust pizzas don't need much time in the oven before they become too charred around the edge. After all that, we were still hungry (portions are small) so we ordered the stracchino & tomato crostini which was good, if average. For dessert we had the rhubarb crostada which was a disappointment. :( 

Service: NOT GREAT, BOB. Our server was MIA for most of the meal and was more focused on trying to turn over our table than see if there was anything else we needed. I'm also not a fan of the, \"It's a new restaurant and they need time to work out the kinks\" line. The owners are seasoned restauranteurs. 

Overall: Probably wouldn't come back here for a meal. Their takeaway options might be good if you're having a picnic at the park, but otherwise there are better places to dine in the neighbourhood.

TL;DR: 
-Order the gnocchi 
-Skip dessert 
-Don't expect service"}
{"text":"The new place to be this summer. La Palma is an incredible place with as beautiful aesthetic as food. The outside of the building and inside decor is perfect for many (many) Instagram worthy shots. As for the food- just wow. For vegetarians this place is superb. Their cauliflower is so delicious, flavors dancing in your mouth. The Stracchino Cured Tomatoes & Oregano Crostino is 5 out of 5. And the pizza is also a fresh take on an Italian favorite. The staff is very familiar with the dishes and extremely pleasant. The dessert is a whole other reason to make your way in (but be careful because it's sure to have you come back the next day)
Overall- this is our new spot, a great addition to the West end. I can't wait to try Brunch here this weekend"}
{"text":"I'll keep it brief but I'm starting to get disillusioned by Toronto restaurants.

If youre talking atmosphere, the ambiance is fun. Very Florida in the 80s, with 80s music and loud conversation. I loved the décor and the vibe.

Where I get disillusioned is Toronto restaurants are all now 'family style' which is code for small sharing plates at full sized entrée prices. Food presentation was lovely but the food overall was alright. Nothing to go home about, nothing to go out of your way to tell others about.

We ordered the Tomato and Mozzarella salad, the Oxtail Gnocchi, the Miami Style Ribs and the Swordfish,

The tomato and mozzarella salad was alright, nothing really popped and I would have given more credit if they used buffalo mozzarella.
 
The Oxtail Gnocchi was good. I liked the gnocchi but as for the oxtail, I wouldn't have known it was oxtail because it seemed like left over brisket or pulled pork. Nothing about the flavor was reminiscent of oxtail.

The Miami Style Ribs were the biggest disappointment. First off, they shouldn't be called Miami Style. They should be called Korean BBQ Ribs, because that's what was served. They had meek flavor, and neither of us picked up on the coffee rub. I would liken them to day old Korean Ribs you heat up in the microwave.

The Swordfish was my favourite of all dishes. It was well cooked and its accompaniments were suited to the dish. 

So that's my take on La Palma and the trend I'm noticing with Toronto restaurants. Lots of (expensive) sparkle but very little substance."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant as part of a large group reservation when it first opened. The service was terrible- it took over an hour to be seated, and another half hour to get the drinks we ordered at the bar when we first arrived. We watched the bartender spend more time schmoozing than pouring. They put one server on a table of 15 people- and she was understandably overwhelmed. We got our first plate almost two hours after we arrived. The food was pretentious- but without the taste or creativity to back it up. I was really really disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the greatest 3 hour lunches I have ever had!  My lunch date at I tried our best to order one of everything, and our server was awesome in helping us navigate the menu.  Two bottles of wine and multiple cocktails later we rolled ourselves out of there, fat and happy."}
{"text":"My third visit To La Palma and amazing again! Excellent service, delicious and unique cocktails. Favourites include cauliflower, salmon, chicken pate, potatoes. Haven't had a bad dish yet. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Meh. Service was good, but slow. Ordered the grilled octopus and rose. Octopus was over cooked, which was disappointing. Service was half clueless. I was not given a wine menu until 10 mins after I was seated. Overall, meh. Staff and food output needs to be quicker especially since it is a tapa style restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food but portions are kind of smaller for the price. service is slow but not slow enough to keep me away haha"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here this past weekend. I called earlier in the week to make a reservation and was told that their section for reservations was small and booked up already, but that they kept most of the restaurant open for walk-ins. When I showed up with my family I found out that I was in fact misinformed and most of the restaurant was for reservations. The hostess was extremely unapologetic for my being misinformed saying \"well I don't know who you spoke with but no that's not how it works\". I then asked how long it would be for a table and she did not even bother to look in her book or at her computer she said \"well it will be a really long time...but its the same chef across the street if you want to eat there\". 

I understand mistakes happen, but it would have been nice of her to say I'm sorry you were misinformed, unfortunately we will not have space for you tonight, would you like to reserve for another night? 

I left with a very bad taste due to her poor customer service skills, it almost felt like we were bothering her...I likely will not come back here"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fabulous time here. There was a slight mix-up with our order, but they more than made up for it. Service was top notch from start to finish. The must try in our opinion would be the pork chop - paired with a nice glass of red. The salmon was a close second. The lasagna was also good, but everyone has their own preference on this dish. All in all, we'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came to try the famous lasagna and was admittedly disappointed. It was not as cheesy and saucy as I would have liked, and looked much less so than what was in their advertising videos too on \"how it's made\". The crispy factor from making each layer just like the outside layer did pull through though. 

Not too fond of the service there as no one offered to try to explain their menu which is just words in Italian for most of the appetizers? With no descriptions on the dish either on the menu. Yeah I can make out some meat and cheese words but I would like to know what I am ordering.. the waitress when asked to explain just said \"basically meats and cheese, unless you want me to explain further if you are interested? \" So basically implied she didn't want to spend any time on it if we weren't going to order anything. 

However! I did really love their chicken liver crostini.  It was very fragrant and reminded me a lot of truffle oil/ paste smell. I would totally eat that again and maybe try their pizza next time. 

Last negative bit was my Bellini was quite sad looking at just half a glass full, and also got swished around prior to getting to me so it just basically looked half drunk."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocrity. Tiny portions with price tags that don't measure up with what is delivered. All show and no go. Great venue, atmosphere and ambience but the food is simply not that good. The gnocchi were way too salty, the cocktails ($16 each) were not well balanced (too sour in my case) and the fish was a tiny piece ($32) and didn't have the flavor or innovation to justify the price. For those prices you better step up your gourmet game if you're gonna cater to the true gourmand. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious. We were a bit turned off at the hipster vibe but honestly you get over that in the first 5 minutes because it looks and smells so good inside.

One of the best toilets and toiletries I've used in a while.  

Amazing cocktails and super friendly staff who know their flavor pairings.

We shared: 
The crostino - a little burned but the flavors were a sensation
The corn, feta, quinoa, chuckpea salad - perfectly seasoned and a good sharing portion
Grilled brocillini - not the best.  Tasted quite bitter 
Sausage pizza - urgh - so so good 
100 layer lasagna - I doubt its 100 layers but it was pasta and cheese and sauce and I was down.

We also had a mocktail with grapefruit and then I added a tequila to mine on the waitresses reco.  She was a smart lady.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice, fresh, light and cosy place to have your breakfast lunch or dinner. 

Prices are very reasonable and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I loved La Palma. Some of my favourite dishes were the Kale and the pizza. The Cacio Pepe (pepper and pecorino) pizza was yummy but really all the pizzas looked great. Service was attentive! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm curious to know what their dinner menu tastes like, because if it was anything like the brunch we sampled today, it leaves something to be desired...

My friend and I had the breakfast pizza, the croissant benny, and a cheese scone. General notes:

- Pizza portion was small for the price. Especially given that it's brunch, i expected a round pizza and not a long flatbread. Flavour was good.
- The hollandaise sauce in the benny was SO acidic- but perhaps it was partially from the vinegar that was likely used to poach the egg. The flavour balance was all off
- Sausage patty on the benny was a little peppery for my taste 
- Cheese scone was great- we didn't get the butter as it was $2 (ARE YOU KIDDING lol)

I hope the dinner menu is more complete than the brunch menu. Basically very few of the items on the menu come complete. For example, there is a poached eggs dish that is similar to an eggs in purgatory dish which is commonly eaten with bread. HOWEVER, of course La Palma doesn't give you bread with the dish- you have to order it for an extra $3. There is also an avocado toast or something like that that would normally come with a poached egg, but at La Palma you have to order the poached eggs to go on it. That's how we narrowed down what we wanted to try- because our dishes had most of the food groups. 

The interior is BEAUTIFUL, of course, so it's a \"pay for ambiance\" type of restaurant. 

Wouldn't come back for brunch. Would be curious to try dinner- only if my main comes with bread, of course."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and atmosphere. Disappointed in the slow service at times. Ordered the lasagna and it was burned. Notified the manager who apologized and sent it back. Returned in two minutes with a lasagna that appeared to be half the size. While it was delicious, I was disappointed that we weren't offered some compensation for the issue. It would have been nice to knock off the price of one of our apps or perhaps offer us a free dessert. Oh well, I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is very good.  Food portions are small and desserts are tiny except for the croissants.  I found it odd that the had some savory options on the dessert menu such as grilled vegetables on a baguette.  My friend joked that they're there because you're still hungry after eating the mains"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I went for dinner on a Saturday night - great ambiance and great food. I went with 3 friends and we shared a bunch of dishes, which I definitely recommend as the portions are not that large.

The most memorable part about our dinner was our server. She probably checked in with us 5 times throughout our dinner, just to make sure we enjoyed everything which I really appreciated.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because we waited 25 minutes for our reservation. We were standing around awkwardly waiting to be seated which wasn't ideal. But, the customer service following this definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"My boss brought my team here for our holiday dinner. We had the tasting menu and everything was amazing. Everything was fresh and flavoured perfectly. It's hard to have a favourite dish since everything was lovely but the Cornish hen and crispy potatoes were definitely my top two. And the dessert was ahhmazingggg.. I would come back just to get the millefoglia alone, perfect dessert that's not to sweet and has the perfect mix of crunch and decadence. I would seriously recommend the tasting menu, it was truly a great experience as we got to try a bit of everything and everything was super delicious! Nice atmosphere and decor. Service was also really nice, helpful and definitely informative about the food. I would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch or dinner. Well priced and well made brunch. Best part is the details. Really great cocktails mixed at the cute bar and you'd ve crazy to skip dessert.
Grilled donut benny can be made veggie, and does not disappoint.
Great service."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about La Palma, and finding it impossible to reserve at any time other than 10 pm via its website, decided to drop in at 5 pm. We were seated promptly in a near-empty restaurant (though it filled up quickly within 30 or so minutes), and warned by the mechanical but competent hostess that our table would be needed at 8 - which was fine - in fact we left around 6:15. Our table was on the kitchen side of a partition; some people might like this view of the kitchen; some might feel disturbed by the proximity of the nightly briefing of the staff, and their subsequent comings and goings to the pass - didn't bother us, though one didn't get the open, white-toned \"feeling\" of the \"hip\" restaurant, as a 20-something with me referred to it.

As warned by earlier reviews, the food comes out as the kitchen has it ready. Our absolutely charming waitress asked if this was all right - we might have demurred had we known the first four plates would arrive within 10 minutes, followed by a bit of a wait for the next two. Not a problem - but one did feel they might have been eager to turn tables. Anyway, service was warm and informed, a pleasant surprise; and that included the three different individuals who brought the dishes to the table. We had drinks, and then set to enjoy the varied menu items, each of which were of a smaller size than what one might expect, but not \"small.\"

The absolute hit of the evening was the first dish to arrive: Chicken Liver with Vin Cotto - on the moussish side of a spread more than a firm paté. Delicious! On seasoned and well toasted crostini, the meat spread was topped with a few slices of grape. Don't be afraid to try it if you're not a fan of chicken liver, as it had a unctuous palate feel more of richness and \"meat\" than of liver per se. This was followed within a few moments by the arrival of the dry sausage and gruyere. Didn't taste the sausage, though friend said it was flavourful and not \"dry\" in any unpleasant way. But the gruyere, usually my favorite cheese, was a disappointment: pre-cubed, a bit dried out and extremely bland, not at all as gruyere should be.

My friend then had a fairly substantial flatbread pizza of mushrooms, and figs, which he said was very good - and a chilled king salmon with avocado and citrus- healthy portion, and he called it delicious. He then devoured a lentil and corn salad (growing boy!) which he enjoyed. Couldn't have paid me to touch it - but then I am Mr Meat and Taters.

Meanwhile I consumed the much vaunted \"100-layer\" lasagne. Not sure via what numerical base they arrive at 100 - I would have said five or 10! It arrived, custom fried so that the edges were pleasantly charred, and sitting in a pool of ok bolognese.. However, it was no different than many well-meaning attempts at lasagne; the pasta seemed to have a faint raw/undercooked taste, though nothing wrong with the texture; the cheese and sauce somehow contrived to be at once both bland and salty - again, not \"bad\" just dull. Terroni does a much better one with less fuss. 

Only I had room for dessert: another let down in the form of a \"Caffe [sic] Corretto Mousse with a white chocolate ganache.\" It looked beautiful - a hemisphere of glistening chocolate topping it. In fact, one only tasted the thin chocolate outer layer, as the pale beige mousse it covered tasted one-note: sweet: no palpable coffee-ness, no liquor or liqueur \"correcting\" said mousse, and the so-called \"ganache\" being a pool of a white runny substance that again tasted just sweet. Actually I was too generous in calling it a \"let down\" as it was more truly a disgrace to any pastry/dessert-maker's art. Form over substance. Appearance over taste. One wonders who in the management has tasted this dessert and found it acceptable for a restaurant evidently striving for high standards.

Bill before tip for the above food, two cocktails, a glass of wine and sparkling water came to around $160. My friend thought it was great. I thought it was undistinguished: tries for great things and falls short, though there were for sure some pleasant moments.. Its sister restaurant Campognolo is imho a much better bang for your buck: great food, spot-on service, a much more pleasant room + patio though this may be particularly a matter of taste - and the feeling that some sophisticated managers are in charge and on top of things. I won't return but will tell my 20/30-something friends to give it a try: they'll enjoy the vibe and quite possibly much of the food, as well."}
{"text":"Cute little place - popped by for lunch. The lasagna was good but not mindblowing, the salad had interesting textures and flavours, but the coffee rubbed ribs were absolutely delicious. The one thing that did irk me was that my glass was dusty and our bottle of white wine wasn't in an ice bucket. Yes, this makes me sound pretentious but if I'm ordering a  bottle, I'd like it in a spotless glass and kept chilled."}
{"text":"La Palma... I really wanted this to work out but unfortunately - it's not me, it's you. At first glance, you looked nice but it's all just an illusion.

Our table ordered all three of their pastas: the 100 layer lasagna (bolognese and mozzarella - $23), the potato gnocchi (chestnuts, taleggio fonduta, and rapini - $20), and the linguine aglio e burro (sausage, shrimp, basil - $24). We also ordered the arugula pesto pizza ($19). Safe to say, we were very excited to try all these flavorful, unique-sounding dishes. When the waiter brought our food out, however, our jaws DROPPED. Prepare yourself, the food is not served on plates - all the pastas come in these tiny little bowls that give the illusion of looking huge in pictures. Not wanting to write the food off immediately, we tried all the dishes. Unfortunately, there was just something missing in each of them - the lasagna was lacking substance, the gnocchi was too salty and lacked any hint of flavor, and the linguine was way too lemony (think Asian inspired linguine, rather than Italian). The only dish that was somewhat acceptable was the pizza, but I'd rather get more flavorful, filling pizza at Queen Margherita. If you're going to dine here, make sure you \"pre\" elsewhere, or you're going to need to go out for a second dinner/snack after like we did.

Thank god I didn't order their $15+ cocktails - those things are also just as tiny! Come on, La Palma, we're serving adults here, not children. 

When we brought our complaints with the food to the attention of our waiter, he blamed the experience on our taste buds rather than apologizing, bringing the manager, or offering some sort of solution. Overall, we just left this place entirely unimpressed and starving. The best way I can describe this place is pretentious and hard to love."}
{"text":"Overall a wonderful dining experience with great company. Wonderful atmosphere, 100 layer lasagna lived up to expectations however I would prefer a little more tomato sauce to accompany it. The service was amazing, waiter was very observant after noticing the pizza was getting cold as we got carried away from our conversations and offered us if we wanted to reheat the pizza. We thought it was a very thoughtful gesture."}
{"text":"I give it 4 as service was a bit slow , but good was amazing , ambiance lovely , different kind of fusion Italian . We were 2 and ordered 4 plates to share."}
{"text":"It's sooooo expensive but for no reason I might as well go to Alo. I had the lasagna, it tastes ok. It's  just served vertically. Big deal. It's $20 for a small slice. Servers were unattentive. Had the too cool for you vibe. Hostess at the door does not know how to pour water, get a server for a customer or even smile. After app and drinks dessert, one person can spend $75. The room is pretty but no vibes, if you wanna come here for a conversation with grandma. Then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I wish I could give La Palma 4 or 5 stars, but there are so many amazing restaurants that I'd rather spend my money on in TO.

The dishes were good, but on the salty side. I ordered a rose, took one sip, and asked to switch to a cocktail. They charged me for both, even though our bill was over $100...poor service in my opinion. Those little things go a long way, and actually can tip the scales for folks who may not return as a result.

Especially with an Italian flare to their menu, I assumed their rose would be on the drier side (as Italian roses are) I did notice afterwards that they sourced their rose from a Ontario vineyard, which just doesn't really pair well with the cuisine.

I would say slightly overpriced for what you're getting, you're paying a premium for the stylish interior and insta-worthy platings."}
{"text":"Overall, an exceptional dining experience. Food and service were great, and the atmosphere was relaxed even with the fine-dining feel, i.e. frequent water service, pre fix menu, and changing plates for every course. 

They accommodated both vegan and pescatarian diets and went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. They were so generous with the courses that we had to take a lot home."}
{"text":"Visited this cute italian eatery beginning of fall. Nice modern simple decor overall. Love how the windows slide open at the front of the restaurant to allow the breeze to come in. The food overall was decent - nothing mind-blowing. Cute spot to have a meal or just drinks w some friends to catchup"}
{"text":"Summary: came for dinner, great space and concept, vegetarian friendly, pleasant staff, but as a new place still needs some work in terms of service timing, flow and staff training. 

Dishes we liked: Lasagna, Carrots, Albert's Leap Ashely (goat cheese from Alberta). 
 
Food: The food is light and tasty with a great vegetable focused section on the menu. Salty in some cases (cauliflower and breads). The heirloom carrots with tahini dressing were the winner on our table. The lasagna is delicious, the layers thin as paper and airy (if you can even describe lasagna as such). Octopus ok and nicely cooked. 

Price: Dishes are small and meant to be shared. Even mains aren't that big and reasonable pricing reflects that. 

Wine: Their wine by the glass list is ok, but nothing stands out. Red wine served so hot we had to ask for it to be chilled to cellar temperature at least. We tried the NZ Pinot Noir and Cote du Rhone Paul Jaboulet. 

Dessert: Did not try the desserts, we weren't offered a dessert menu after our mains were finished and cleared for a while. Since we weren't sold on it we didn't even ask for it and headed out. 

Service: friendly but little slow - growing pains of a new establishment perhaps. We were told one of the dishes is salmon and turned out to be a cured meat (good but the bread is salty). Two of our servers didn't know what one item on the menu is. They were super friendly about it and acknowledged there were some new dished and promptly asked a maitre d to explain them to us. This is something that should've been covered in pre-service briefing. 

The timing between dishes was long, which worked great for us, as we were enjoying our time chatting and drinking, however if you were hungry or in a rush I would let them know to speed things up."}
{"text":"Very nice vibe and the service was great. We had a few dishes including the cauliflower, the eggplant, the 60 day dry aged steak. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointed with my first experience at La Palma. Based on reviews, we chose to have the lasagna, lamb chops, broccolini, and mille feuille. Regrettably, the lasagna was cold and dry, with hardly any sauce or cheese; the lamb chops were mostly fat; the broccolini was okay, but the flavors weren't very memorable; the mille feuille was very dry and hard. The only upside of our visit was the lovely Spanish wine, service, and atmosphere of the restaurant. Sadly this isn't enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Eh, was just average and not worth the hype. Ambiance is nice and very 'hip'. Food was pretty good, but I thought dishes were over priced considering the sizes. Even though the server mentioned that most dishes are meant to be shared/tapas style, I just expected fuller portion considering the amount of money you are paying."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and cozy atmosphere!! Came here and expected to be seated near the window but it was packed. So were seated in front of the kitchen which wasn't that bad.
Ordered the selection of pastries and it was delicious. Came here with a girlfriend to catch up and doing so over warm pastries and tea was so nice! Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant but was not able to get a Friday/Saturday night reservation.  I happened to walk by at lunch time and there was space.  We shared the gem salad, cauliflower and pizza.  The waiter was able to accommodate dietary restrictions by putting certain ingredients on the side.  Everything was delicious and I loved the decor.  The portions were a bit too small.  The menu could also use some more pasta and pizza options (although for lunch we were happy with the lengthy vegetable menu!)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my radar for awhile now. I finally made my way here yesterday for Easter brunch. It's easy to drive right by this place unless you're on the opposite side of the street. The interior is very cute and Instagram worthy. I was annoyed with the hostess as my boyfriend and I came in first, but these 2 other ladies were greeted before us.

We shared the Miami style short ribs. These were amazing. I ordered pizza with pancetta & ricotta. Very good, the touch of sea salt was perfect. My boyfriend got pasta with sausage & shrimp. We weren't a fan of this dish at all. It was lacking flavour and tasted like citrus oil. It definitely needed a heavier cream base or some cheese. Service was decent. Their menu changes often so we'd maybe consider coming back again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the gnocchi and the 100 layer lasagne as well as some beautifully made cocktails. The gnocchi was amazing -- the taste of the sauce was out of this world. Creamy, but not too creamy. Just perfect. Definitely will be back here"}
{"text":"Got a bit of a price tag on it and the potions are small, but the food is good. 

The service is a bit too slow. I understand the leisurely pace at a nice restaurant, but idk how I felt about this one - especially with it being extremely loud with the big window open. Obviously what happens on the street is not their fault, but it was difficult to relax and enjoy conversation to accommodate the leisurely pace. 

The food did arrive at a good time after we had ordered. It was just waiting for the server to take our drink orders, then food orders, coming around to give the bill and then coming back with the machine. 

The pizzas were fantastic. The Pesto Pizza was a long flatbread. It had lots of flavour, was fresh and light! The jalapeño gave it a nice kick. The Pancetta Pizza was good as well, but not quite as good in terms of flavour, in my opinion. 

The 100 Layer Lasagna was definitely not 100 layers on the plate, but very good according to my friend. It's not quite a sharing size, so I wasn't offered a bite! 

The last dish (don't remember the name, I think it was the broccolini) was REALLY good. I had a bite and felt that it had an interesting and excellent 'sauce' lathered in - lemony. 

Also, the washrooms were big, clean and offered Aesop soap and cream! 

Nether less, my experience was mediocre, which is why I'm giving it the 3/5."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to La Palma for our wedding anniversary dinner, we had a good time. Service was good, waiter was attentive, food was wonderful. It's sharing style and they recommended 2-3 dishes per person. My hubby and I shared the following:

- grilled cauliflower
- tagliatelle with shrimp ragu and arugula sauce
- lamb chop
- seared tuna

They were all delicious. I especially loved the tagliatelle. The cauliflower was also great, and that says a lot coming from a person that normally is not a fan of cauliflower.

One star off because the restaurant is open to the busy dundas street and every time a street car stops, generates a lot of dust that ultimately end up in your food or drink... Also the space is a little cramped, your neighbouring tables can hear all your conversations. Lastly the portion is a bit on the small side for the price, like many others have mentioned in their review.

Overall the experience is great!"}
{"text":"Really good service and amazing food. I recommend the chicken liver pate appetizer; one of the best tasting things I've ever had in my life! We got the lasagna and the waiter recommended it to share between two people but in my opinion its more like a one person portion. Best lasagna I've ever had!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR BILLS. 

I would have given a great review for this place except they added a $24 linguine to my bill (most expensive item on my bill) which I did not order nor received. 

When I brought it to their attention - they did nothing to explain how it got on the bill and did nothing more than just take it off the bill to rectify their mistake.
.........


food was surprisingly great. hats off to the chefs. most memorable dishes were the Ashley goat cheese, ricotta & pear crostino and pomodoro pizza. to finish - get the panna cotta dessert"}
{"text":"I arrived here half-hour before closing last night (a Sunday night). There was only 2 of us in the entire restaurant, aside from the workers. Our server was great (a blonde woman, her name escapes me) -- although they were near closing, she never rushed us, provided us with great service, and offered insight/advice on the menu. We ordered the 8oz steak, swordfish, and some vegetarian sides, all of the items were delicious. The space itself was also beautiful and comfortable. We had a great experience at La Palma and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"No Caesars or ketchup and it's still 5 stars. Potatoes and salads are the way to go here. Decent vibe if you like cooler music and Queen west Jean suits and side plates."}
{"text":"Extremely RUDE staff alert! The hostess and serves are completely rude and entitled. They probably get it from the owners. Also, the food is over priced for what you get. Taste is ok...Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a relatively large and polished interior. Was expecting something more grungy like other restaurants in the area. We had the tasting menu. Reasonably priced for what you're getting at $60. Really enjoyed the food and the experience."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite meal of the year.

I read the reviews from my fellow Yelpers and came away with this -- you may disagree with the path that a restaurant takes, but it should not be the focus of a negative review.  La Palma is fine dining in a wonderfully casual setting.  It is expensive because preparing good food is costly.  The smaller plates are intentional and the chef's prerogative.  Be prepared to order correctly and to pay fair dollars for your incredible experience.

Giancarlo explained (what I had previously read) that we should build a dinner which included more than two \"entrees\".  I wanted to try the 100 layer Lasagna as our appetizer and then we selected the Chilled Salmon and Flat Iron Steak as the entrees, which we shared.  we also ordered the BBQ Crispy Potatoes and Grilled Broccolini.  Giancarlo's service was spot on from beginning to end, which I greatly appreciated.  

The Manhattan was perfectly muddled and poured. The lasagna was excellent -- crispy, rich and a wonderful bolognese sauce.  A great beginning.  

The chilled salmon may be one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  It was cooked to perfection in a sous vide which made the chilled salmon both rare and creamy.  Add avocado to heighten the flavor and creaminess.  It was in a citrus sauce with orange and grapefruit.  I was not keen on the bitterness of the grapefruit, but the orange/citrus was perfection.  Take each bite with all three.  I wished I had ordered several pieces of fish, it was that good.

The steak was done perfectly and I enjoyed the truffle sauce.  As good as it was, tender, beefy and full of flavor, it paled in comparison to the fish.  The broccolini was transformed by the char of the grilling and the chili/ginger sauce.  And the BBQ crispy potatoes was my favorite side of the year. The flavors (bbq, smokey mustard aioli, pickles) and the crispy texture was a riff on potato salad.The chef respects flavors and pairs them perfectly.  

Two complaints.  The space was too loud for me, but I'm old.  It did not detract from my enjoyment.  Second, do not insult me when you seat us and say that I need to be out of there in 2 hours.  I understand that tables need to turn.  The hostess was young and I am sure that there have been issues.  An innocuous sign would  be better than to personally insult a party who are about to spend $160 for dinner.  It was still a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on new year's day and this place made it more special with their amazing food & great service! The 100 layer lasagna looked smaller than the pictures on social media, but for that reason I'm glad it wasn't too big either since it was very rich in flavour and I wanted more room to try out other dishes during my visit. The cauliflower with grapes was also very good, but eating it on its own was a little salty because of the miso dressing, but it wasn't overly done either so that was ok.  I would definitely come again to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Venturing in Dundas West and checked out La Palma thru recommendation from friends. A small restaurant with few tables but food was absolutely wonderful! 

Crostino tasted well, bread was dry and crispy and topping of cheese and tomatoes added texture to bed. 

Next came the 100 layer lasagna and this was to die for. The bolognese sauce mixed so well with the pasta and it was roasted perfectly so that the sides were just slightly burnt. The texture of pasta was slightly too soft, al dente would make it more robust in taste.

We sat at the chef's table and it was fun seeing all the actions that take place in a restaurant kitchen. 

Secondi was a flat iron steak. Presentation was great but meat was slightly too rough, would rather have the spring chicken! 

Saving the best for last- two desserts were my fave: millefoglio was the best. Filling was made with fresh vanilla beans and the pastry layers were very crispy! The beat of its kind. 

We also tried other desserts like gingerbread white mousse but we found that it was not as good! Definitely a thumbs up and would recommend to friends and family! Worth the trip completely!"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try out La Palma on a Thursday evening while we were in town for the Rotary Convention. You'll want to make a reservation for this hopping little joint. We walked in without a reservation but still scored a nice little spot at the chef's counter overlooking the kitchen. It ended up being a fun way to watch the dishes being prepared and the articulate approach to each dish. The service was friendly and impeccable. The lasagna was amazing, paired with Primitivo Zinfandel! We also had the Whipped Ricotta Crostino, to die for! Can't wait to get back to Toronto for more of this menu!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to hit this place up for a while - the food looks delicious and the restaurant itself is IG worthy.  Finally, I managed to get here a few days ago.  I wasn't disappointed!

The decor is divine - clean lines, modern bar area, fresh almost a Miami in the 80s vibe - but in a cool way.

I sat at the bar and ordered the Cardamom Spritz (light and refreshing) and I ordered the Pomodoro pizza.  I was originally thinking of the grilled cornish game hen, but when asked what it came with, they said nothing.  So basically you just get a slab of meat???  I guess you could order sides ($$$$$$$$) but nope, not going to do that.  Pizza it is!

The pizza was actually pretty good - fresh, with lots of mozza.  The crust was nice and crispy.  It was just the perfect size for me, and it would be great as a sharing app.

I also ordered the Sumac Panna Cotta.  I was actually surprised by this dessert b/c it's pretty big.  I was expecting a small portion to be honest.  It was ok - nothing earth shattering that would make me want to order it again.  It had a nice consistency of custard with the crunch of nuts on it.  The sumac gave it a slightly off putting flavour after the first few bites.

Overall, while I find the menu a little pretentious (meat and no sides for a dish - say huh???), I do like this place and would like to try another dish or 2.

The service is super friendly.  While I sat at the bar, the bartender was really nice- always checking in on me, wanting to know if I wanted anything else, refilling my water glass right away..asking how I was enjoying my meal.  All done in a sincere way and totally not overkill at all.

Highly recommend to make reservations.  I was here at what I thought was an off time (2pm-ish) and the restaurant was still quite full (it can hold about 50 people) and people kept coming in."}
{"text":"You turn the corner and the street is suddenly ALIVE..  beautiful summer day, la Palma has the windows open.. Inside it's packed, loud, cool..
Nice touch with the uniforms, exterior sign font.
I'm probably too low brow (and hungry, overweight..), for $20.35 I felt the 100 layer lasagna was expensive and small portion.  Double that order size, I'd be back!  Excellent flavour, taste."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Fun and LA Cali vibe. Amazing food! A little restaurant with garage like windows that open up in the summer. The decor is so cute, very clean, and staff are all great. We ordered fish, pizza, drinks, veggies, and dessert. We cannot pinpoint what was the best because all were equally delicious. Highly recommend trying something for each category."}
{"text":"This is more like a 1.5/5.

I love Campagnolo, so I expected the same quality of food from La Palma, given that they're both owned by the same people. I was, however, extremely disappointed. I think this is a case where a restaurant places more emphasis on ambiance and appearance versus quality of food. 

The restaurant itself has a great California-cool, laid-back energy. Feels like summer when you step inside, with lots of white and pastel green. The servers all have a uniform, which I thought was a little bit tacky, but evokes a retro vibe and fits well with their theme.

The food left a lot to be desired. My friend and I started with the 100 layer lasagna. It looked great but I'm sure any Italian grandma would be sorely disappointed. It was not fresh. The noodle sheets were rubbery, and some portions of the lasagna (near the middle) were downright COLD! Also, there was a severe lack of cheese, save for a gentle grating of mozzarella on top. There was no ricotta or any cheese detectable between the noodle layers. The bolognese sauce was nothing special and strongly reminded me of jarred spaghetti sauce that is reheated and served in a school cafeteria. 

We also ordered the sous-vide/grilled octopus, which was quite tender but lacked flavour. Our side of roasted cauliflower was overcooked till rubbery and limp, and served cold with an extremely salty bagna cauda dressing. 

The only good thing about this meal were the chorizo meatballs, which were hot (finally, a hot food item!) and flavourful, and served on a juicy, blistered red pepper with a side of crusty, grilled bread. Note that the sauce was SUPER DRY and had formed a skin. 

Unfortunately, dessert was not much better. We ordered millefoglia with vanilla pastry cream,  passion fruit and mango. Sounds delicious, right? This was actually such a disappointment. The puff pastry was not light and flaky (it felt thick and hard, like Skyflakes crackers), and more importantly, THERE WAS ESSENTIALLY PASSION FRUIT OR MANGO. There were two thin, decorative lines of coloured gel on the side of the plate - one of passion fruit, one of mango. THAT WAS IT.  What is the point of even having it there?

Overall, the food looked amazing but the quality was very poor and both my friend and I were not impressed at all. I would not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to La Palma with a group of 4 on a Saturday morning for brunch. I'm generally disappointed by the brunch that I've had in Toronto but left feeling very satisfied.

We ended up ordering the Croissant Benny, the Breakfast Pizza w/ Eggs, the Breakfast Croissant and the Baked Egg. All of the dishes were really great and full of flavor - highly recommend the pizza, delicious cured meat on top with some great cheese and fresh herbs/chili on top. The Baked egg was also delicious. The tomato sauce was very flavorful and fresh with some delicious bread to dip. Would recommend any of these dishes! The espresso drinks were also great and were made with some beautiful latte art.

The place has a beautiful aesthetic - a neon blue cursive sign outside, large windows with lots of natural light, marble tables and white walls with a vibrant, colorful design. There's a bar towards the back and the crowd was generally trendy. The service was also incredible; very friendly and attentive staff.

This place is absolutely worth trying and cant wait to come back for lunch/dinner sometime. It's also not too expensive, ~$15-$25 per person depending on how much you order."}
{"text":"This is a really cute date spot in the west end! Love the decor and the ambiance. The food is also pretty good. 

Went there for the 100 layer lasagna, not sure if it is actually a 100 layers but it looks gorgeous. It doesn't look like a traditional lasagna, but it was tasty. We also got the Cavatelli with Braised Veal Shank, the meat was tender and juicy. Really enjoyed this. To finish it all off, we also got the Gnocci. The service was great, I would recommend reserving a spot in the evening as it was very busy. 

I've heard they also have brunch which I would like to check out. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"AmaZing!
Chef from Franks Kitchen was behind the open flame & working his usual magic
Great food ,cocktails & 9.00 wines by the glass
Best char broiled Rapini i have ever tasted
Welcome to the hood!!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place because of all the rave reviews and because Campagnolo is my favourite Italian in the city so I had to try its sister restaurant! The space is beautiful, bright and inviting. The service was attentive, polite and courteous. The only downfall is the food. Nothing was amazing, everything was just ok. The miso on the cauliflower was way too salty and overwhelming. The capers on the eggplant was also too overpowering. Both the cauliflower and eggplant were cooked well, but the accompaniments were not cohesive to the main show. Our pork dish was probably the best, cucumber salad was a clever idea. I would try to come back after some months after they solidify the menu."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Sunday.  They don't have a designated brunch menu, but rather a 'breakfast' menu + the regular lunch options.  I love the casual vibe of this place - beautiful, bright space + loud music.

I enjoyed the La Palma cocktail & baked eggs - love the tomato sauce. I also tried the 100 layer lasagna which was pretty good as well, although the top was very burnt. Portions are relatively small."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch.

La Palma opens early. I came here only after the pizza place nearby did not open until noon, and my colleagues and I needed 11:30. (I think they open here at 8 for breakfast and don't stop until 11 pm).

I had very good service. Everything came out quickly on my visit (I noticed some reviewers encountered slower timing on drinks, food, etc). 

Our table shared a few of the sausage pizzas (flat bread pizzas served on a plank-13$) and the potato gnocchi with oxtail. The pizzas had a delicious crust and (as if by a miracle or just real skill) managed to have flavourful sausage without being salty. The gnocchi was also delicious.

The atmosphere here is breezy, classy and casual. If you need a place to meet friends for lunch, this is a great option. There are many places in the area, yet few where you can have table service in a relaxed, comfortable setting."}
{"text":"3.5/5.

I had high expectations for La Palma and was slightly let down. I think any comparison to Campagnolo is inevitable, but even on its own merits, I just don't think La Palma is worthy of the hype it generated. 

Pros: The resort-inspired atmosphere of the restaurant is definitely a mood-setter. Servers are generally friendly and helpful with any questions you have. Both of the cocktails I had (La Palma and Honey Basil Smash) were above reproach. The main dish I ordered--a pasta dish with pork and a creamy sauce--was very tasty. 

Cons: Appetizers/side dishes I had were middle of the road. Sausage and Gruyere dish had no imagination to it and felt like something you could get at Alice Fazooli. Roasted Cauliflower was more successful, but there was nothing really about the flavors which popped. The Miami-Style Ribs that my friend ordered were not half-bad, but still probaly fall into this category just because I could barely make out the coffee rub and sesame flavorings. 

Overall I had a nice enough experience at La Palma and wouldn't be averse to going back, but when you break it down to brass tacks, the food here just isn't on par with the frou frou dining experience cultivated around it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my radar for a little while now this past year as it has been given a lot of really great reviews... needless to say when my best friend wanted to try a new restaurant for double date, I immediately thought of this place!

Ambience is really nice - very cosy, almost like a modern diner feel but more quaint :) We were able to make a reservation for a Sunday dinner and the restaurant was mostly filled by the time we got there. 

My hubby and I ordered an app to share and then each of us ordered a main and shared 2 desserts, and here are our thoughts on them:

Ricotta, Pear and Honey Crostino - cute little dish, came with a big piece of bread so i had to cut it in half to share with my hubby. I loved the pairing - the pear and honey gives a bit of a acid and sweet tone along with a savoury spin from the ricotta - you really can't go wrong with these ingredients on a nice piece of bread :)

100 layer lasagna - this was the highlight piece of the night - both me and my best friend got this dish and believe me when I say this, this is amazing and almost to die for! The noodles are fresh, thinly layered, and mixed with the classic bolognese sauce with mozzarella - this is a great twist to the classic lasagna dish. Pasta lovers, if you ever set foot in this place, you HAVE to try this dish!

Crispy Pork Belly with Savoy Cabbage and apple - my hubby chose this dish and although the dish doenst' look like it's a lot - it's actually quite rich! the pork belly was crispy and yet juicy and tender when you bight into it, and i really liked the vegetable pairing - cabbage is a great accompaniment to this dish and i love the apple taste - can't ever go wrong putting pork and apple together :)

My best friend's hubby had the cornish hen - crispy skin, juicy and tender on the inside. The portion is actually quite large for an entree - lots of meat! He didn't finish all of the hen and packed some of it home.

Dessert round came along and at that point all of us were feeling a bit stuffed up after the entrees... so we ended up sharing the dessert: 

gingerbread mousse - amazing mousse - light and smooth with a very heavy tone of gingerbread.. anyone who likes gingerbread will appreciate this dish! It also came with some honeycomb and verjus pear and it was a nice balance of sweetness - the citrus from the pear cuts the sweetness just a bit which was nice - I didn't find it too rich!

Bombolone - this is basically what you would call a stuffed small donut. Fried dough on the outside with grape jelly added on the inside topped with some icing sugar. Very light and fluffy - the smaller sized donuts make it a great dish to share!

All in all this is a great place! I saw some families eating in there so aside from being a great place for date, it can also be okay for kids as well. We also had La Palma cocktail and it was great!!! 

Def would recommend this place if you're ever in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah! I have found somewhere that is up to the standard of my favourites (such as Museum Tavern) in terms of food quality, service, ambience etc. 

This was my first time here - the wall colours/design are somewhat reminiscent of Miami bars circa the 80's. The seating is elegant and comfortable. I LOVE the marble table tops and the spaciousness. The washrooms (same floor, wide doors and stalls, looks to be accessible - bravo!) are clean and open. Great hand soap and hand balm (sadly didn't get to try the latter) too! Note: coat hooks are conveniently located on the wall across from the bathroom doors.

David was our server - attentive, friendly, professional. Couldn't ask for more. The menu isn't huge but I'd be willing to be that everything on it is excellent. I'd ordered the Pinot Grigio but they were out (fortunately) so David offered a different one from Portugal. For the life of me I can't remember the name but it was GREAT!!! I had the potato gnocchi with grated truffles $32 (not cheap, I know) but FANTASTIC!! The texture of the gnocchi was perfect. The buttery goodness that they're deliciously drenched in is what I would like to bathe my entire body with. They didn't scrimp on the truffles at all - what a wonderful treat! My dining companion had what was their equivalent of the Margherita pizza - as soon as I bit into it, I recognized the tangy dance of San Marzano tomatoes that were used in the sauce. Also excellent! Desserts were good as well. I had the mille feuille - good but I wanted it to be eggier and more like a Napoleon - my problem, I know. My companion had the vanilla gingerbread mousse, which was fantastic!  I d DEFINITELY come back here. Everything here from start to finish was absolutely perfect! Also? They text you a confirmation reminder of your reservation. Brilliant. If you haven't been here - you should definitely check it out. Added bonus? You can hear your companion - fun background music and not annoying crap. Win/win!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Absolutely everything about this place is exceprionl! Loved the ambiance! Service! Food! Have to admit, I've been very picky lately, but La Palma has everything I am looking for in a restaurant. Delicious food. Friendly, but not to nosy waiters. Loved, loved, loved it!"}
{"text":"Salty and slow, and not sure about sweet!

After driving by La Palma and getting a good vibe from the white exterior and dim lighting inside, we decided to give it a try. If I were rating solely the food, I would probably have given it a 2 out of 5.  We had the chicken liver crostino, the tomato-basil-burata pizza, the Miami ribs and the grilled broccolini. Every dish was very salty. And every dish would have been great with less salt.

The ambiance is French bistro with a large open kitchen and wait staff wearing similar outfits. The hostess was great and worth a star on her own....not pretentious and very professional. The service overall, however was slow. I really wanted to try the mille feuilles, the signature dessert dish but after waiting almost 20 minutes after I received my coffee and over an hour at that point, we decided to pack it in and leave. And you know that uncomfortable feeling when you say, forget the dessert, the waiter is stunned when it doesn't arrive and takes it off the bill but says it will be here in 2 minutes and its free anyway? And you don't know whether to stay or go? Well we left.

La Palma is a hip place with comfortable bench seating along the front windows and a few nice tables for four. However I would avoid the tables for 2 along the West wall as the person facing the wall misses out on the overall ambiance. The best seat for two is at the SW corner of the restaurant. That table made the 90 minute plus service for an app and a couple of entrees, worth the wait. But even a great corner seat isn't enough to overcome a lengthy table service.

I also don't like the serving concept of runners for the food. We had a good one and a bad one. The \"good\" runner drops off the food, describes it and asks if you need anything. The \"bad\" one drops off a coffee quicker than a speeding bullet and leaves you waving your arms frantically for some sugar (either that or you will be drinking a cold coffee when you finally get your sugar).

If I gave La Palma another try, I would tell them to go easy on the salt, I would reserve or wait for that corner table for two and I would order everything upfront. Either that or I would just come in for a cocktail and some appetizers. Also, have a look a their menu online. The pizza and pastas are limited and the starters are few as well."}
{"text":"Came with a large group of 20 and they arranged a long table up front.  We had 3 courses and tons of food.  Close to everything on the menu it looked like.  Everything was delicious and we had a great time.  BUT -- the WORST acoustics ever.  We had to shout to talk to each other.  My throat and ears were killing me.  This was Sunday lunch.  They were playing loud R&B thumping music which made people need to yell even louder to be heard.  They need to decide if they are a dance club or a restaurant.  Turn the music down or off.  Install acoustic tiles on the roof so we don't have to yell to talk.  A friend said she came for dinner and it was the same problem.  Not a romantic place if you have to yell at each other.  People want relaxed quiet conversation over delicious found.  Pretty simple fix and then I would return."}
{"text":"We went as a group and had a family style dinner the following was incredible:
Cauliflower 
Fig pizza
Seared tuna
Pig cheek
Eggplant pasta
Kale
Salmon 
Endives salad

And the list goes on. I will say the meat is a bit salty but it was delicious and the family style dinner is well worth the price tag. You really get to enjoy the chefs choice.  
You can tell the staff takes great joy in the space and the food and the experience.  
I definitely recommend going with a group"}
{"text":"Cool ambience! Went there on Thursday around noon and breakfast was no longer an option so went with their apps -- pretty good but def pricey for the portions ."}
{"text":"La Palma does almost everything fairly well, and one thing extremely well. 

There's a reason why this restaurant has seen success - and it's the same feature that I find many popular restaurants in Toronto have maximized on. 

La Palma's Venice Beach theme is appealing to most, and does provide a good vibe for the summer. 

We ordered a few dishes, all of which floated in the area of \"good, but not great\". 

The ribs were excruciatingly well seasoned - not to salty, like I find many restaurants make it. At the same time, I found them a little fattier than I had expected.

The chicken liver crostini was a fine appetizer, but far from the best part of the meal. 

Where we had a grand time was when we had the lasagna - which, in taste, was similar to other lasagnas, but different in its texture. The 100 layer lasagna's layers were placed vertically, rather than horizontally, which seriously added a completely different dimension to the dish. This meant, primarily, that the cheese cooked a different way. Completely different. 

We also ordered desert, the pana cotta. Also good - but too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"Had such a great dinner last night with girlfriends! The food was delicious and the service was amazing. If you're into sharing plates, this is the place to go. I can't wait to visit again and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Our favourite spot in Toronto.  Such a beautiful space with truly amazing dishes.  We have a hard time choosing what to have every time we go.  Favourites have been the 100 layer lasagna, flank steak, pizzas.  It's honestly hard to choose.  They gave a white negroni that I order every time as well.

As I write this review I'm looking at my calendar to make my next reservation..,"}
{"text":"Seriously not great. The food just wasn't delicious and the restaurant, though beautiful, had a bad feng shui. Prices are exorbitant for such minute portions. Every dish is totally lacking in flavour, temperature, and presentation. I don't think Joanne Kates would be impressed. 

BTW I counted all the layers in my 100-layer lasagna. They were all there but still not a fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"It has become one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. As many have stated with the ambience, it is refreshing to go into a Toronto restaurant that isn't just bare light bulbs and live edge wood. The decor creates an atmosphere that makes it fun to eat there. The open kitchen is fun to watch, and at the end of the night the Chef has even been open to letting some customers get a tour of the grill station. 

Some of the dishes feel like they worked at Campagnolo, but don't really pair with the summer-style light menu that La Palma has to offer.  On the other hand, everything that I've ordered that comes off of the grill has been excellent. The swordfish, coppa, and steak were all excellent. The pizzas were great and light too.

Absolutely coming back."}
{"text":"Overall had a great meal! We showed up for brunch on a weekend afternoon but we came too late so had to opt for the lunch menu instead. The portions are smaller but great for sharing. The ham and cheese croissant was heavenly, flaky, buttery and perfect. The pizza was more like a flat bread. The interior is as beautiful as I hoped. Service was attentive. Would want to come back for the brunch sometime!"}
{"text":"I had a reservation to La Palma for 1.5 weeks. I got a text confirming my reservation 6 hours prior. Me and 2 gfs were having a drink at a bar in the neighbourhood and 30m before our reservation, we get a call saying that they're giving our table away because we haven't responded. We were confused and taken aback. If it weren't for the two other people in my party, I would've happily forgone my reservation. I found this extremely unwelcoming behavior. 

That said, once we got to the restaurant the service was fine, at best. The waiter was clearly overworked and it was difficult to get his attention. Once we had a bottle of wine, no one came to take our order for ~15+ minutes. 

When we finally ordered, here's what we got: 

Seared albacore tuna: 2/5 very small portion. The fish was OKAY, but at any other restaurant, you would get double the portion and the quality would be much better for the price.

Flatiron steak: 3/5 while this was cooked to our liking (rare), the meat was still tough and hard to chew; sauce was a nice touch. 

Cauliflower: 4/5 this was a great dish in terms of sauce/flavors and grilling, but the heated grapes didn't do much for me, and they were on the vine which was annoying to have to pick off. 

Endive salad: 4.5/5 This was the 2nd best dish of the evening, the flavors were spectacular, and the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. Could have ordered another.

Cocoa pappardelle: 4.5/5 this was absolutely delicious and perfect in almost every way. Could have been a touch more al dente. 

Overall, this was a good experience with mostly okay food and one great pasta! 

I do believe this place is 99% hype and only 1% delivery on quality food."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service but not properly trained on the menu so the server was not sure about some of the items, food tastes good but nothe exceptional. I had the cardomom infused gin with prosecco which the bartender forgot to mix the ingrediant so the top was just prosecco and the bottom was just gin. Also tried the eclair which was stale. Price point is little high since I had to eat three dishes. I paid $75 for three dishes, a cocktail, an eclair and espresso before tip.

In general it was mediocre and with so many better italian option in the city I wod not come back at least for a very long time."}
{"text":"This restaurant might be my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. I was hesitant about coming here because every time I've called to get a reservation it's fully booked and I hate having to potentially wait two hours for a walk in table. I decided to go regardless at 6:30 and was luckily sat right away as long we left at 8:30 which was fine. We ordered the meat and cheese plate which was really nice. Based off other Yelp recommendations we ordered the cauliflower which honestly was one of the best vegetable dishes I've ever had in my life. As I was eating it I thought to myself I could eat another plate of this and that be my main, I don't ever want to eat anything but this cauliflower again in my life. My friend also asked me \"how is this cauliflower so good?\"  As my main I ordered the 100 layer lasagna which was heavenly. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was so good. I also liked the spritz cocktail I had that came with a piece of grapefruit in it. The only thing that wasn't great was our server. She literally barely even spoke. I'm not sure if the restaurant was too loud that she didn't bother to talk but when she came to take our order she didn't even say anything she just kind of looked at us and I assumed that meant it was time to order. Kind of strange but at least the food was great which is what matters most."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Great space, tasty but tiny portions, and generally good service.

Ambiance - the space is gorgeous, but can get very loud - so, conversation is difficult.

Food - very tasty, but also tiny.  For example, the 100 layer lasagna is appetizer size.  And, for $24, it's a pricey appetizer.  As an aside, it also appears to have increased 50%, from it's original $16, a year ago (although, I'm pretty sure that the cost of cheese, meat, and pasta hasn't...).  $3 for bread is also disappointing.

Nonetheless, the vegetables were excellent.  Both the asparagus and broccolini almost stole the show.  The lamb and octopus were also quite good.

Service - very attentive.  Our waiter was great.  However, the food runner brought us another table's dishes, on two separate occasions.  If we hadn't noticed, we would have begun hungrily devouring them."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...

\"The most talked about dish--the hundred-layer lasagna ($20)--was baked in tradition. The recipe was handed down from Chef Craig Harding's nonna, and offered a crusty edge with a lukewarm inside--likely from frying the pre-cooked lasagna before serving it instead of reheating it in a convection oven. Layers upon layers of sheet-like pasta held barely-there bolognese and mozzarella. The overcooked square was finished off with fresh parsley and powdery Parmesan (I would have liked to see freshly-grated). Call me un peu snob, but I turned my nose up at the overly bland dish. The rigatoni ($19), unfortunately, did not leave a good taste in my mouth either. The two pasta dishes proved that the kitchen doesn't know the meaning of \"al dente.\" Desolé, but Nonna wouldn't approve...\""}
{"text":"Great time on a Tuesday night after Labor Day. Best gnocchi ever !! We ate several dishes amd very happy, so amazing everything completely homemade top notch .wine menu was so so. Dessert amazing. Prices reasonable"}
{"text":"Ok here's the dill... food is good, can't complain. Traditional Italian with a modern twist. I thought they did a good job with the choice of ingredients for each of the dishes. The lasagna for$20 ? Really.. guys it's a basic meat sauce with a multi-layer egg Pasta??? The papperdelle was decent but an acquired taste. The place is truly a 3.5* in my books, but that's the overall sentiment with food, service and price. They lost due to poorly managed waitstaff who feel they know food but they really don't and we waited for 28 mins before we got the drinks we ordered and then they brought our starter items and mains together??? Really? The tables along our entire section was saying the same thing. Our waiter thought he was doing us a favour by us visiting this venue, he's not the happiest camper either. We asked for some chilli oil and the guy forgot 4x'... and then bringing out the bill for 3 people at $163...we had only one drink each. On top of all this he charged us for additional food items on the bill and when I pointed it he didn't even apologize?? Anyhow , I won't be returning anytime soon:)"}
{"text":"Popped into this place for brunch on Sunday. Great atmosphere, wonderful waitress (always smiling) and food.  The salmon dish was very good!  I would not have thought you could pair salmon with avocado, mustard and grapefruit but it works wonderfully!  Will be back with the whole family next time to try dinner."}
{"text":"La Palma is worth the hype, hungry people!

This afternoon, my posse wanted a really good cocktail and a hearty meal while our kiddo slept in her stroller. This is a bit of a tricky request, and we were getting close to giving up after being rejected by a lesser-than Italian joint, but my hanger got the best of me. I decided to call La Palma and see if they had room, figuring their rush was over and knowing their interior was big and airy. They had the perfect table for us. Hooray.

We had a pimms and a spritz with chicken liver crostini to start. I mostly stuck to the cocktail for the first course, but was still very pleased. For my main I had their Cavatelli Milanese and I'm obsessed. Like, I'm actually kind of stalker-y about this pasta. I instagrammed it from my personal *and* work accounts within 20 minutes of eating it. I should probably get a grip and make another reservation for next weekend."}
{"text":"The essence of La Palma is geniusly hidden in their wifi password. If you're not Canadian and too cheap to pay for an international mobile plan, you'll quickly learn La Palma's wifi password- VeniceBeach. The entire restaurant is modeled after Venice Beach.

The space itself is gorgeous. It's open, spacious, and the walls open up during warmer weather. It's minimalist white washed design has a few art pieces throughout that match their style. Even the signs on the restrooms work. It's design forward, inviting, and calming.

The service is attentive and fancy. For example, the server will fold your napkin for you even when you leave briefly to use the restroom. 

The drinks are light and refreshing. Their sweeter drink, the Oceano Fresca, is simple yet very nice and perfect for the summer.

The food was good, but not Michelin star worthy. My wife ordered the 100 layered lasagna and I had the tomato pizza. Both were good, but not note worthy.

Surprisingly for a nice restaurant, they had a high chair for our 16-month old suggesting kids were welcome? Maybe?"}
