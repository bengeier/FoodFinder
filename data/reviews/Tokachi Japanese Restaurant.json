{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend, which happened to be their happy hour special (2-5pm every day). I got their spicy salmon roll ($4) with a couple other pieces of sushi/sashimi ($1.25/piece). It was a great deal given the portion sizes. My only qualms are that the sushi was slightly cold when it arrived (with the rice, it isn't supposed to be far from body temperature) and the rice easily fell apart as I picked up the sushi."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. The place was basically empty so we were sat down pretty quickly.  The interior of the restaurant was nice and very comfortable. I would say that the prices are quite typical of a Japanese restaurant. We had a couple of rolls and some tempura and a beef tataki dish; the total came to about $80. They also had a deal going on for the rolls; buy 3 get one free. Overall, I would say the servers were very nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"If you're around Chinatown and need a lunch place to eat, I think the price is reasonable. The lunch special makes you full enough, and you get to eat Japanese food! The food is nothing too outstanding though, but it serves the purpose of having an overall yummy lunch. The miso soup came out warm, but there was a weird slight alcoholic aftertaste. My chicken was slightly drier than I expected, but still edible. The sauce on the chicken was slightly sour. Fish quality was reasonable. The salad dressing was good. The rice tasted like it was rewarmed and didn't taste fresh, but it was appropriately chewy. Ingredients overall felt fresh and clean. Overall, it was an average experience, but satisfactory."}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout for dinner. Really nice service and I really enjoyed the coconut shrimp. One of the best I've had actually. Tried some Maki rolls were pretty average. Miso soup was good bc there was more seaweed in it than you'd normally get."}
{"text":"Pretty place, good service but the food is meh, nothing stood out. Their sides tasted better, sushi was good too. I suggest the lunch box special when you're here for lunch you get two entrees with salad, soup and rice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ditched my old haunt to go here instead and it was so worth.  Okay, background info. I know my way around a kitchen, and I dont bother eating out if I can make it better myself at home. And sushi is a favorite.  So about the place. Great location? Excellent view of the city and calgary tower. And atmosphere is nice and clean. I hate the music station, feel its a little out of place but I think the servers deserve to listen to what they like.  Food. Excellent. Sushi is always fresh and cold, rice is soft but not mushy, and the rolls seem to be made to order so nothing thats been in a fridge for hours.   Prices are great. 2-5 happy hour is the highlight, and a really reasonably priced 'all you can eat'. Also surprisingly delicious Ramen.   Servers are fine. Always polite and not too pushy which is what I want in a server.  As a final note, the mall attached always has a pokemon go lure going on. Worthwhile to stop in and eat during happy hour and catch some pokemon!!"}
{"text":"Great value for money! I went here (as usual) with my husband, and my mother in law for lunch. Their lunch specials left us all feeling full and happy. The specials come with salad and miso soup, both of which were tasty. All of our sushi, both nigiri and maki, was quickly devoured, a good sign, and we had no leftovers to take home. I had chicken katsu with rice as my main entree, while the spouse had beef and mixed vegetables. All in all, the feel of the restaurant is relaxed, the bathrooms are clean, and the food is worth the trip to the cool, if slightly out of the way, neighborhood! My husband tells me that their bubble tea is also excellent."}
{"text":"Located in Chinatown (can I call it that? Well let's try), Calgary downtown core, this was my first experience with Japanese cuisine in Calgary.  Entrance is through a mall so went in with limited hope. Wasn't hungry so unfortunately couldn't order a Bento box and stuck with appetizers.  Miso soup was pretty good. The salmon salad and green tea ice cream both were standard affairs. Our hostess was a nice lady who helped us understand the options. Place is clean and tidy. Not too expensive either.  My colleagues were happy with their extensive dinners so I guess I will return to try the main course."}
{"text":"Went here for the happy hour $1.25 per sushi.  The pieces were a bit small.  There were five of us and the bill came out to about $28 per person.  It would have been a better deal to get the all you can eat option at about $19 per person.  If we knew the pieces would be so small we would have chosen better.  Also, our server, although very nice was a bit clueless when I asked her a simple question.  I asked her if she could ask the chef's and she said she couldn't.... uhhh... yeah sure."}
