{"text":"Finally tried Palma Pasta today and got the meat lasagna daily special! It was a great price around $14 for a medium tray that feeds 4 people comfortably. We broke it down to 6 small servings. If you are short on time or don't want to cook this is a great option. It took about 3 minutes to run in and out of the store. They sell their premade pastas either frozen or refrigerated.  I asked for mine heated for the same price but they advised me that you have to call at around 10am to preorder a heated one to be picked up for that afternoon. Disappointing but good to know for next time.   I ended up heating my lasagna in the oven for 40 mins and it came out great. The lasagna was fresh with lots of cheese and sauce. Definitely better than what I make at home.   However, the only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars is because of the amount of salt in their food. I love salt and eat lots of salty and processed food but for a homemade style pasta this was very very salty. Much more than any premade packaged pasta from the grocery store. I was unable to feed it to my toddler because of how salty it tasted. I was also disappointed that I didnt see any nutrition labels on the package itself or on their website so I dont know exactly what the salt content is. I still feel an uncomfortable salty taste in my mouth after eating. I will try other pastas from their menu in a few weeks but I definitely won't be buying from them regularly if all their pastas are this salty.  Too bad because it was pretty good quality pasta."}
{"text":"Best lasagna Ive ever had! Hearty portions for a decent price. Lots of selection. Will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed . As someone who enjoys cooking and understands what things can taste like, especially home made Italian food I have to say everything was pretty bland . It was expensive also , to me I know what I'm getting myself into when stepping foot into one of these specialty shops . Fresh ingredients , especially ones that go into Italian food can be pricy so I expect things to cost more and that's ok . Unfortunately , in this instance it's almost as if these guys have found a way to use cheaper ingredients comparable to what you'll find massed produced in grocery stores . Nothing stood out as exceptionally good .   I'd only come here if I where looking for fresh pasta , I wouldn't buy any sauces or ravioli etc ."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Italian pasta! The meat lasagna is to die for!! The veggie lasagna is also excellent.   Both the chicken and veal parmigiana are huge servings. The tomato sauce is tasty - it is clear that this recipe has been passed down over generations.   They have a great selection of fresh and frozen pastas, sauces and meats.  This place will not disappoint - whether you need dinner in a snap or a meal catered.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Years later , they're still strangely unfriendly. The food is reasonably good and they are conveniently located nearby. Wouldn't kill them to say hello or smile a bit."}
{"text":"Palma Pasta Why make your pasta at home when you can just go to Palma Pasta and buy better pasta then most of us can make at home . They make it fresh though out the day so you know it's always fresh. We like the meat raviolli it's just to die for. Its always packed with meat they definitely aren't cheap on it. If quality is what you want they have it. A must try is there lobster Ravalli  and even the spaghetti if it was cheaper this would be the only pasta i ever buy."}

{"text":"A busy place with lots of choices for busy people. Every weekday after work the place is packed with desperate working moms picking up some ready made pasta on their way home from work. The uncooked pastas are pretty good, but I'm not a fan of their sauces because I can make much better at home. However, mine is a minority opinion on this so you might like it a lot."}
{"text":"Bought a lasagna to cook at home. Worse Lasagna I have had in a long time. Not Italian I can tell you that. Worse than some frozen ones. Very little meat. No Ricotta and sloppy."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. If you have an event, that requires food and you're not down for paying a caterer OR if you need food for dinner and you're not in the mood to cook OR if you're visiting friends for an occasion like bringing food to new parents or for more somber occasions, take the thinkingnout of it and just go to Palma Pasta.   Frozen and cold pasta and meat dishes ready to go, as well as sauces and even garlic bread (basically anything you need for a dinner) are readily available daily (subject to availability) as quick as it would take you to order McDonalds. And the bonus, it's as good as homemade (or better if cooking isn't your strong suit).   The service is helpful and friendly at any location but specifically this location that's hidden near Hurontario and Queensway.   They also have uncooked pasta if you'd like to put some of your own twist on dinner, but even that is fresh and ready to go. Its basically an Italian version of M&Ms but better.   I say stick to the pasta dishes they're plentiful and highly affordable (a medium tray ringing in between $12-17.50) but perhaps avoid the meats as 4 chicken breasts (while delicious) were a whopping $25.   Love it though would order from here anytime. You should too"}
{"text":"Considering how much it costs to buy a package of ravioli and sauce, then drag out the pots and pans....you are better off just buying their products. By pass the grocery store next door if you are looking for nice Italian take out. You have to be pretty picky to not like this food.   In case anyone missed this...Palma Pasta is not a restaurant. It has typical Italian hot table and home made pasta and sauces in oven ready containers. Frozen too. When I was there they were giving a free garlic bread."}
{"text":"I was new to the area and stumbled into it, thought I will walk in and check out what they are upto. I got a very unwelcomed vibe. No hello... nothing. I asked if the one I need comes in small size....she was like \"No, we are closing in two minutes\" . I don't understand how they cant think that to run a successful business, more than anything.... customer skills are important....looks like it's a family owned business. Never experienced anything like that especially when run by a family. I am never stepping inside again...got other options in the area. No matter how good their food is. Everything is secondary if they don't know how to treat customers"}
{"text":"Ravioli is a 2.5, over cooked and tasteless :/   Lasagna and bread was delicious and the service is always good.   The pricing is a bit more expensive than traditional Italian hot tables.   Lots of frozen quick food for purchase too!"}
{"text":"Ok is it just me or does anyone else think these people are rude. Idk why but I always get the same vibe from every one of them. Don't buy specials just buy what you are going to eat not family size when there is two of you!! It happens to me all the times aaahhhhh"}
{"text":"Palma pasta had been my go-to when i need a quick dinner for family and myself. The meat lasagna is great and the large portion can easily feed 6-8 people. The lasagna has generous amounts of ground beef, and sauce. Id wish there was a bit more cheese but i cant complain.  Make sure to come early during the day as the larger size dinners can be sold out by 6-7PM! Its also very busy during holiday times so make sure to go early."}
{"text":"Super cute little home-style Italian takeout place. The prices are very reasonable and the food was so good. Definitely the go-to place when you're feeling like pasta but don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I just moved in the area and stumbled into this place.  I ordered the family size meat  lasagna for $13 and I was lucky enough to get it as the lady took them out of the oven.  I paid and was on my way with fresh \"home style\" lasagna in 5 minutes.  That the extent of the service.  Fast and efficient.     The lasagna was really good but in no means an expert.  Sauce was great and the pasta was excellent.  The size is its only downfall but for $13 it was enough. I would buy it again no problem.  The store was clean and there were lots of parking.  They had loads of what looked like fresh uncooked pasta which will come in handy for quick dinners.  Glad I have this place right by my house"}
{"text":"Wonderful for take-out. We had a birthday party for 7 people and ordered the following which were all amazing. All home made fresh pasta. I recommend calling at least a day or 2 in advance to pre order.  Spinach and cheese ravioli with the rosee sauce  Seafood lasagna Beef cannelloni  Vegetarian lasagna.  They have small, medium and large sizes. You can choose your sauce whether it is rosee, Alfredo, tomato, and a few others. To give a sense of size, the medium cannelloni has 10 pieces while the small has 6.   Definitely check it out. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a Mississauga small business gem that is hidden in plain view. The storefront is simple and unassuming and doesn't cry out for your attention. The largest attraction in the mall is the fantastic Michael-Angelo's and Mastermind Toy store.  Once you step in the store, your nose will be pleasantly tickled with the scents of fresh pasta in a rose, Alfredo, or marinara sauce.  Perhaps it might be fresh mushroom ravioli instead or freshly made Eggplant Parmesan.    Though the store specializes in fresh made to order pasta of many different flavours, it also caters and offer lots of Italian hot plate meals to go. You can find fresh white fish plated with lots of healthy sauté veggies or the really good mile high meat lasagna.  The store recently changed to be more focused on the hot plate and frozen meals.  The freezer section used to be bigger and stored many great quantities of frozen pasta. They still have them and they're still great but they expanded to include fresh in house pasta sauces (red clam sauce is awesome) and imported cheeses.  So far, everything I've ordered has been great. My favourite is the seafood agnolotti and chicken tortallini in the freezer section.  The spinach and cheese gnocchi is a close third.  As for service, you cannot find a friendlier bunch of Italian aunties. They have phenomenal memory of every customer and they do everything with pride.  They treat my family as if we are their number one client.  I highly recommend this place for great Italian pasta."}
{"text":"Great tasting fresh made pastas. They have a hot food or take home for a great value. Daily deals from mon to Friday are great. Would recommend"}
{"text":"On our way to the cottage we picked up some garlic bread and a medium lasagne. I think the garlic bread was $2.50 and the medium lasagne just under $10. For dinner we made some cesaer salad and had the lasagne and garlic bread, and it satisfied three hungry women with a bit to spare!   The lasagne was good - nothing too fancy, noodles, sauce and meat. But it was very tasty with a homemade feel to it.  Great to pick up a few things for dinner on the nights you don't feel like cooking!"}
