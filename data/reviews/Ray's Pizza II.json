{"text":"I called in a large pepperoni tonight. It  was piping hot when I picked it up about 15 minutes later.  I wished I had ordered two of them after only getting two slices....not that i need more, it was just tasting pretty good.  I don't usually  leave reviews but I had it up on my pc after dinner and I noticed some of the really bad reviews and felt like I had to say something.  The pizza has always been pretty good at Rays.  It's not   a fancy setting that's for sure, but it's been around a long time and a lot of locals like the place so I don't know, I would recommend them.  The guys are always friendly and the prices are fair.  Try it yourself and see what you think."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed food from many different Rays pizza locations and upon entering this establishment I expected no less. Since I wasn't very hungry I just wanted something small to watch a few mins of the game while on break from work. However they didn't have a menu board anywhere so I looked at the menu card, great 6 wings for 4 bucks! I order and go to pay they tell me $5.55 I handed my card and then asked are they not $4 and the guy said \"no, that's the old price\" so I looked at the to go menu and guess what? 6 wings $4 there too. So I say hey it's $4 here and there the only 2 places you have any items listed for sale it should be $4. The mgr told me no, that \"they are still cheaper than anywhere else\" I asked for my card back and left. I'm sure the food is good there but the short interactions of rudeness and dishonesty is enough for me to never go back to this location. (I would have paid the $5.55 if it was the menu price btw)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's okay.  I usually order the calzones. The wings are alright.  I liked the food from the one at 35 & Union Hills better."}
{"text":"This is an older review, from a few months ago..just getting time to finish it! :o)  We went to Ray's Pizza because I had to get my tire changed at Discount Tire. This place seems a little run down and the staff seems a bit unkept.....smoking right outside and then comes in to make the pizza. I actually found a very friendly staff and good pizza. We had the veggie pizza. Cooked perfectly and not greasy at all. I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend for taste and the friendliness."}
{"text":"when i first moved here I thought this pizza place was the bomb but apparently I came on a good day. I have ordered pizza twice since my last post and have been disgusted. I asked the girl on the phone for a bbq chicken pizza, and she says they can make it. So when I came to pick up my order, the pizza literally had hot wings on top... HOT WINGS!  i have never seen a bbq CHICKEN pizza with hot wings on top, however despite the disapointment in my pizza and the rude service, I figured I'd \"try\" it. I was repulsed, tossed the pizza and called papa johns. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, We love the monster Sicilian and the pricing is very fair. The Calzones are also elite. Great down to earth service as well."}
{"text":"We went here on our way to flagstaff, and it was great! I had a slice of pizza with garlic, tomatoes, and spinach and it was delicious! The bottom was crispy, and there was plenty of tomatoes and garlic, and the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. And it was warm and cheesy deliciousness!  My sister had a salad had a salad, and the olives were good. The spaghetti and meatballs were good too, and really big portions too. Just for anyone who doesn't know, a \"garlic bread\" is a LOAF of bread. We didn't know that and I ordered an extra! At least we got plenty of leftovers. Definitely recommend it. The staff were friendly and personable."}
{"text":"I haven't tried this place until tonight even though it's one of three choices of food nearest to the house. Plus I had read reviews and obviously assumed I shouldn't waste my time even going.  But, tonight I was offered to have take out brought back to me, and I decided to order the hot eggplant parmesan hoagie. This was a major leap of faith because most places I go can't even make a regular eggplant parm the right way (where the eggplant slices are paper thin and all you end up tasting is the fried coating) So the fact that I went with this choice worried me.  The food arrived in barely closed tinfoil wrapping the sandwiches, but the smell was appetizing. After the first few bites I realized this was probably one of the best hot subs I've ever had. The eggplant was delicious and the flavor came through perfectly, even with all the bread, sauce, and cheese covering it. I think I saw a few big slices of onion and tasted them as well. The bread was soft and chewy but crispy and toasted on the outside. It was cut in half, and usually I would leave one half for leftovers. This wasn't one of those situations. I ended up finishing the entire sub! Delicious.  I can't say anything about service or interior because I didn't go, but I will be headed there sooner or later to try more food! So after that I will give a review of the in person experience, and second time dining. Maybe this was a beginners luck type of deal, who knows. But I will say I am surprisingly satisfied and full and that to me is all that matters!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm here at least once a week and I live over 20 mins away in Scottsdale. Great pizza, great sandwiches and always a few laughs!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here! Especially the veggie mins olives plus pineapple... It's SO good I really struggle not to just eat until I burst... I've come close.. LOL"}
{"text":"OMG don't waste your time.  Went in for a couple slices of pepperoni,  what I got well not quite sure.  Looked like pre cooked frozen and thawed then placed with pepperonis on it and re heated greasy horrid mess.  The dough tasted like a bad bisquick mix recipe turned into a pizza dough.  Taste mediocre at best.  The place is dirty with dust webs hanging off of fake plants on the wall, tables have a layer of grease on them that feels like its been a loooooonnnnnggggg time since properly cleaned.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely foul! I can't believe that anyone likes this place!  It's so disgusting and greasy.  I ordered sausage and it was shredded and salty.  So gross.  And what's the deal with having them on every corner?  Worse than Starbucks!  I swear there are about 3 or 4 within about 5 miles of my house on Carefree Highway!"}
{"text":"Sketchy inside this place and it's unlike most Ray's in the valley.  The kitchen prep area isn't as viewable as most places, staff looked really scruffy and unkept, and the pizza was mediocre.  Found a solid piece of something in my ice once it melted."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. ... steak and cheese sub is my personal favorite .. service is always good"}
