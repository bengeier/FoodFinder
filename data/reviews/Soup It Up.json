{"text":"I don't know what all the people below are complaining about - safe to say, I have never had any of those issues! I find the service great - the women are always friendly and quick. The soups have all been great (least fav so far is lobster bisque, but the clam chowder is great). The salads are a great deal (combo with soup for less than $10, with 5 toppings). The topping portions are generous for the salads.  And there are lots of options for sandwiches (though perhaps not veggie as per the comments below)."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here 4 times.  First and third was the clam chowder with nice clams but terrible broth. Overdosed on starch i think. The second was the spicy thai and while the broth was fine. There was no pieces.  the last time I had the lobster bisque and that was very good.  My recomendation is to try for lunch as it's fresh but avoid late afternoon as the soup suffers from being too hot too long in their tureens."}
{"text":"Paying $6 for a bowl of spicy salty nothing is not exactly my favourite way to go. Furthermore, as I work in the building I have run into the owner more than once in the food court and hallways. Not only is his restaurant dismal and flavourless, but he himself leaves much to be desired. Pro tip: don't have ignorant, intolerant conversations where the world can hear you. No wonder your employees look miserable. I can only imagine what they have to put up with, considering the things I've heard come out of your mouth."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a quick grab & go light lunch in First Canadian.  They have a variety of soup options as well as chili every day.  The location is oriented to people who want something to take back and eat at their desk - so it's not a restaurant per se."}
{"text":"Maybe the mistake was in getting a sandwich at a place called \"Soup It Up\". I've had their soup though, and it wasn't all that better...  I choose places with freshly made sandwiches because I'm a little picky about what goes on them. Today my bread was sliced with a knife that already had mustard on it. Unfortunately, mustard and I are not friends.   The guy at the register offered to ring through my sandwich while I was waiting. Nice. Except, when I turned around to give some direction as to what went on my sandwich - it was already wrapped up and in the bag, with no question as to what I might have wanted on it. Fail.  They had a basket of bananas at the register. FYI - they charge $1.14 for a banana.  I can get a rip off banana at Starbucks for $1.00, thank you very much.   Apart from all of this, it was probably the most offensive tuna sandwich I have ever tasted (like spit it out in a napkin bad). And I heart tuna, but I did not heart that sandwich."}
{"text":"I know average service is okay for a fast food restaurant in a food court. But missing the items customers ordered and asking them to go back to the tail of the line to reorder is NOT acceptable, especially at lunch time."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Had Lobster Bisque, only had half, didn't finish it... too salty and too creamy. No thanks.   Side baguette was warm and fresh. Soup+Sandwich deal looks nice, may try again with different soups. Wouldn't try any of their cream based soups again."}
{"text":"Please note the Soup it Up! location at the 20 Bloor Street East is NOW CLOSED! Since early 2014, the closest location is now at Toronto General Hospital (200 Elizabeth Street).    Location map:  http://www.soupitup.com/locations/#map_top"}
{"text":"So a coworker got me into a salad, soup craze for a while and then when I was craving it and was too lazy to walk to Esther's soup kitchen (at Yonge/Bloor, I work at Church/Bloor), I would come to this place.  I've had their chili and chicken noodle soup.  The chicken noodle soup is better than Tim's but not by much.    The chili has a smallish kick to it, but it's nice and filling enough so that your coworkers won't bother you for the rest of the day (thank god I  have an office).    So for the chicken noodle - 1 star and for the chili - 4 stars  therefore average is 2.5, round to 3.    Esther's soup kitchen is much better and healthier (though a bit pricier)."}
{"text":"Their clam chowder was atrocious. I ordered a large and threw it away. It tasted like something you'd get at dollarama. Their coconut curry soup was better but nothing can make up for that awful chowder. Their prices are a rip off too. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I used to eat hear all the time when I worked around the corner.  I'd say my favourite soup they serve is the Beef Barley, Tomato & Leek and Tomato Florentine.  I've had their sandwiches but I don't really like the bread they use....reminds me of the bread Tim Horton's used for their sandwiches.  Never tried their salads, but they don't seem to look that tasty or appealing.  When craving the soups I mentioned above I also get off Yonge & Bloor Station going home work."}
{"text":"just had the vegan vegetable soup - very bland and salty. also, how is a vegan soup with mostly carots and a few beans a \"premium soup\"? def not worth $6 for a small. will be sticking to soup nutsy."}
{"text":"If you want bland tasting soup, this is the place for you.   Usually I stick to my other soup provider, Soup Nutsy, but it was late in the day, my lunch wasn't filling enough and this place always has a line up at lunch, so I figured that they must be good, right?  Wrong.   I ordered their small beef barley soup which smelled good but the taste didn't match up. The consistency of the broth was thick and gelatinous, it didn't taste like beef at all. I paid for $4 for something that wasn't even appetizing and that I couldn't even finish. Disappointing and a waste of my money.  Plus they don't have Interact - what an inconvenience! I had to go to the nearest bank machine to take out money to pay for crappy food. If I could give this place no star, I would. It deserves it."}
{"text":"First Canadian Place Location Soup of the Day - http://www.soupitup.com/locations/first-canadian-place/   I go during rush hour 12-1pm. Most cases there is a line up but it moves at a good pace. What can I say its soup, and its good soup. Good variety, especially for vegetarians. Reasonable pricing for the amount you get. Consistent taste. From my experiences no issues.  Veggie Cream of Tomato - 10 times better than the Tim Hortons version. Add a dash of hot sauce :-)  Veggie Chili with Quinoa - Packed with the veggies. Great broth, not overly thin.   To be fair to the other reviewers I only tried the soup so cant say much about the salads and sandwiches. I still put Soup Nutsy on top, but once again if your looking for soup and your in the area, would recommend."}
{"text":"The two star description of \"meh.   I've experienced better\" pretty much sums it up.  Like you'd imagine, this place specialises in soup.  They also do sandwiches so that you can have something more substantial to get you through the day.  Location is good-it's in the food court at Toronto General Hospital.   In theory, this would be perfect.  It's handy for me when I'm at work, they have a range of soups which should fill the gap on a wintry day.  The staff are very friendly.  Unfortunately, they fail on one pretty important thing-the soup.  I've tried the chili, the veggie chili and the chicken noodle.  Both the chilis were pretty tasteless.  Warm and filling, but didn't really taste much like chili.  The chicken noodle smelled a bit funny, had oily spots on the surface and didn't taste particularly nice.  Like salty hot water with an aftertaste of something unidentifiable...but not chicken! I may try some of the other varieties so that I can update the review, but for now it will be relegated to days when I really need soup-like if the dentist tells me I can't have solids and I forget to bring food from home!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place ONE more time since last visiting it in 2015. (New Year and people change... right)  I got the meat chilli and a buttered roll.  The buttered roll was surprisingly excellent ... freshest bread I have had in a long time.  The chilli that was really hot (too hot) and okay. nothing too spectacular. The service has not changed. the girl servinging me was in a rush (no one was behind me) I asked her for a medium chilli and a bun and she looks at me and says loudly ...\"AND\" ..and nothing else. The cashier rings me out and slides the bag to me, no thank you, have a nice day... nada. Real soup nazi feel in that place. Sadly the chilli won't make me come back. Gave it an extra start for the bun."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and it's just not the same. The portion sizes have significantly decreased (I always feel like Oliver Twist when I go there now) and the prices have gone up.  I also just really miss the old staff - they were far more friendly and personable.  Additionally, I find that they never make my favourite soup, the mushroom bisque, anymore so I've just stopped going.  Worst of all? It's CASH ONLY now! Please! Who carries cash around nowadays?"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a zero. I decided to give it a try today since I'm vegan and not a lot of places offer options for me. They had a deal for $8.29 for a soup and a sandwich and I though I would give it a try. I got a regular size vegetable soup. Then when it came to the sandwich all the put was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and asked me what else I want to add...I look and there was nothing else, but beets. How do you offer a veggies sandwich and have nothing to put on it. then they asked me for dressings...I asked if they had anything vegan and what appeared to be the owner said...oil and vinegar! I had to say yes to that as I was not going to eat my baguette just with lettuce and tomatoes. Then when it came to pay, they charged me $12.30. I asked why and the owner said my soup was premium. How can a simple vegetable soup be a premium soup? Then he went on to argue that if the guy next door (kupfert and kim) can charge that, why cant he and that vegetables are very expensive? At the point I just stopped myself from continuing this ignorant conversation. Once I got back to my desk and took a bite of my sandwich it was the most horrible food I've ever eaten. The bred had gotten wet from the beets and the lettuce and tomatoes were saggy. I for sure am not coming back here again, but do yourself a favor and order from their neighbors as the food and service there is far from desirable."}
