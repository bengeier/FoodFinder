{"text":"Food is ok, not great but not exactly bad either... too bad it's apparently got a lot of 'locals' there drinking beer and watching tv (c'mon, really? Go home it's a freaking Chinese restaurant not a bar!) so I won't go back because these people look seriously sketch and the food is just not worth that hassle"}
{"text":"I am so happy I was able to find an affordable yet good-quality chinese restaurant that delivers. The service is fast and efficient and the food is always great. I'm on first-name basis with their delivery personnel, so that should be an indication of how often I order from them. 

You can't go wrong with their Stir Fried Egg Noodle (Beef). It's a very big serving for the price and just one serving is enough to feed my family of four with left overs for the next day. From them I have also ordered the following: 

Vegetable Fried Rice 
Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls (comes w. 12 pieces)
Sweet and Sour Spareribs (they we're a bit too dry for my taste, but so far this is the only thing I wouldn't reorder from them)
Sweet and Sour Pork (Cantonese style)
Stir Fried Mix Vegetables (could use a bit more seasoning but I do that myself to taste--beats getting something that's too salty)
Breaded Shrimp 
Lemon Chicken

I'm slowly making my way through their menu but I've yet to be disappointed. The food is always flavourful, plentiful, and can't be beat for it's price. The service is very friendly and as I mentioned before, the delivery service is very quick. 

They offer free delivery with a $15 minimum order. I usually order the noodles with one side of veggies and one meat option and it lands me at about 20$. Very reasonable. 

Big thank you to the staff at New East Garden for always providing quality food!"}
{"text":"I found this place from Just Eat and decided to try it out. I was very impressed! The portions are huge and the price was great. We got shrimp lo mien, vegetable fried rice, spare ribs, a shrimp spring roll, and 2 egg rolls for $28 (and that included delivery and a tip for the driver)!! Definitely can't beat those prices. The delivery took a while, but only because I live quite far from the restaurant. I was actually pleasantly surprised that they delivered to my area, as not a lot of places do. The food was still steaming hot when it arrived too. This will definitely be my go-to place whenever I'm in the mood for some Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Really wish I checked these reviews first!!! Ordered through 'JUST EAT'. The restaurant received and accepted our order. 2hrs later and no food and no refund. Are you kidding me?? We have to wait 6 BUS days for a refund. Just Eat told us that the restaurant has to accept the order in order for us to get a confirmation email which we did. On JUST EAT website they are rated 5*, but on here they are rated a 3*. Both the restaurant and JUST EAT lost yet another customer. Way to go guys, way to run business."}
{"text":"This place wasn't for me. The fried rice has hard bits of rice in it. The egg roll was all bean sprouts, not very exciting. The chicken balls had mushy coating and the meat was very tough on the inside. My boyfriend got the Singapore noodles and refused to eat it. He will eat anything. The wontons in the wonton soup were severely overcooked. I was not satisfied at all with the quality of the food.

On the other hand, minimum order of $15 for delivery and free delivery are nice. Also open until 11 even on Sunday night. I still don't think I'd chance ordering from here again, though."}
{"text":"I usually order takeout from here.  They are always very fast and courteous with orders and delivery.  The shrimp rolls here are my favourite from any other place around!"}
{"text":"Decided to get some delivery as my truck was out of commission. Was craving Chinese and New East Garden's prices won me over. Definitely recommend the Shanghai Noodles and the General Tsao's. I would avoid the Ginger Beef as there were HUGE chunks of ginger throughout. (Yeah yeah, I know it's called Ginger Beef...but the ginger should be chopped up quite a bit finer) Chef's Special Chow Mein was pretty decent but a little bland, good with the hot sauce. Egg Rolls were standard. 

Quick (free!) delivery. Nice driver. Would order the Shanghai and General Tsao's again in a heartbeat, would try other menu items to go with them though."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the \"Just Eat\" district for this restaurant, on there it is given 5 (yes 5) stars. Here 3.5,  I need to give it more like a 2.0. After some nonsense with the driver not being able to find the door code on the receipt (which I found first glance, after going down 10 floors to fetch my order) that aside, the guy didn't seem to understand numbering. The food...wow. My roommate orders the General Cho's Chicken, me the Pad Thai, both were so over spicy it was inedible. The chicken fried rice he ordered was greasy yet dry (yes contradiction here but proven now) as if maybe a heat lamp had been employed?? Very disappointed with the cream corn soup, putting this  health warning up for the next person. As the most recent review is from 2015....(yuck)"}
{"text":"Got it as take out. The fried rice was really hard and wasn't the greatest. The spring rolls were good. It's really affordable but wasn't the greatest Chinese take out. I would not try this again. You can go to a mall and have better Chinese food."}
{"text":"They used to deliver to my address. Multiple times in fact. Seems they've recently squeezed the size of their delivery zone which is a shame. Used to order here all the time. We have tipped the driver well too. Here's another chinese restaurant cheaping out on everything they can cheap out on. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Quality Chinese food, with no MSG. Affordable, and delivery is pretty quick too."}
{"text":"We had a craving for the old style Chinese food like we had when we were kids in Toronto. We ordered from New East Garden. Their delivery time was fantastic. The portions were good but the food was average. I cannot say it was bad. It was decent but I wish it was more like what I remember as a kid. It was just okay. I just wish it was a bit more flavourful. The shrimp dumplings were really good. The Cantonese Chow Mein and Chicken with Almonds were just okay. The Singapore Noodles were spicy."}
