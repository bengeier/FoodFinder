{"text":"This place is right across the street from work, so I've been here many times. On days that I'm too lazy to pack a lunch, I'll do almost anything to avoid the food court at college park. Which isn't to say that eating here is an act of desperation - i've never been disappointed, but I'm not expecting much. Cheap (3.99 chicken shwarma), fast (though I once ordered the chicken gyro instead and that took substantially longer than the shwarma), and as yummy as any other standard shwarma place.

I also enjoy the selection of baklava and Turkish delight towering in the counter. I've never ordered those things, but seeing heaps of them makes me smile.

It's solid. I like it well enough. But if I didn't work right across the street and never ate here again, I wouldn't notice the loss."}
{"text":"Great value. The falafel sandwich is delicious and a fantastic price. One of the better falafels I've had."}
{"text":"Bah, don't bother. nothing is fresh"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pitas I've had before?The chicken sharwama's chicken is well fried, and the tomatoes inside creates a fine balance. The samosa triangles are also outstanding! I highly recommend this shop, plus brownie points for the nice employees there;)"}
{"text":"The food here isn't very good - but it's cheap (like 3 samosa for $1, 2 falafels for $5 and $5 daily shawarma deals cheap).  For those prices, you really can't go wrong.  It's an okay for quick cheap lunch...

... actually, scratch that.  It's okay for a quick cheap lunch when *you're at work*.  Otherwise, it's meh."}
{"text":"First off, I really miss Jasmine Shawarma.  

In our epic trek to find good shawarma, Mike S and myself had a few cheap lunches here at Pita Pure.  Mediocre at best, with a weird off taste with their pickled turnip.  Their shawarmas and falafels are cheap, less than $5 each, so if you're like that, you'll love Pita Pure.  

However, every morning, I walk up Bay St., there is a box full of pitas set outside of the door to this place.  How long it's been sitting there every morning is anyone's guess."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken, veggies and rice, so I stopped off at the Pita Pure House on my way to the office from a meeting. For $9.03 I was surprised by what you get. The portion is pretty small and it does not come with a drink. For shawarma I found the pieces of chicken to be too big - I prefer lots of finer pieces, not huge chucks - but that's just a personal preference. And I had to ask for the pita, though it clearly states that it comes with it. 

In sum, because of the small portion, pretty high cost, and not the freshest ingredients, I would not return."}
