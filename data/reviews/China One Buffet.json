{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful. We've always enjoyed our meals here and the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I recommend coming to this place. I love the food. It's a basic buffet Chinese restaurant but the food tastes good. There's also different sauces you can get at the buffet for your food, especially chili oil, which is very spicy. The combo plates you get are huge portions, with huge pieces of roast pork in the rice. If you go there before 3:30 you can get combo plates for 4.50$, which I've never seen anywhere else. I've been to this place many times, and I'll go back again, for sure."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere different. The food was good. Everyone that was there were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I think I added a tetanus shot to my list of things to do today. First time I ate here I would give 3 stars. Food was not bad but not that great. \"AVERAGE\" run of the mill Chinese at best. Lots of seating but the actual buffet is very small. Not a ton of options by an means for being a buffet style place.   This second time around was just outright bad. Food was soggy, cold, and some of the meats tasted funky. Lunch price is just under $6 and $8 for dinner. Price is a good reflection of the value you are getting. Not sure if I will be coming back, unless I really have a craving for some Chinese out in an area that is dominated by fast food chains."}
{"text":"Basic Chinese buffet.  Typical Chinese buffet style foods. Most of the food wasn't hot on the buffet.  Nothing spectacular and nothing terrible.  Pizza rolls were cold.  Beef cobbler was an interesting menu item.  Didn't brave the sushi but looked fresh. I would give it 2.5 stars at best.  Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Don't miss this newly opened, but very little advertising.  It's in the same location as a previous similar restaurant so many don't know it's open! We've been looking for a decent Chinese buffet since we moved to the area and this one exceeded our expectations! Clean, quiet, EXCELLENT service and the food was AMAZING!   Prices are only $4.99 for lunch and $7.99 for dinner.   This place far surpasses any other Chinese buffet in the area and we've been to all of then within a 30 miles radius! We will be back."}
{"text":"Inside seemed clean, all the meat was suspect, other than the fried shrimp - it was crispy and good. Noodles were good, sushi was subpar. Highlight was hand dipped Ice cream. Not busy for an evening meal. Waitress was nice and ninja-like. I guess you get what you pay for 7.99 buffet. Take care"}
{"text":"I am not a huge buffet fan because the food is never warm enough.  That is certainly true here also, but at least the food is good.  Everything I had tasted just fine, just wasn't hot.  The one thing that was piping hot was the wonton soup and it was very good.  Large wontons and broth full of great flavor.  If you are not a fan of Chinese food, they do have some American food which looked like nobody was eating.    The atmosphere is nothing fancy and the service was good.  For just over $20 we both ate dinner and had hot tea to drink, so not a bad deal.  Just wish they could figure out how to keep the food hot."}
{"text":"Just sitting here at the booth of this place, right now I'm so stuffed that I don't want to move. That's exactly what I expect from a Chinese buffet and guess what it's only 7.99!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Spacious.  It's a staple of my weekends, enjoy eating there.  Excellent pricing for the food.  Especially for their lunch buffet."}
