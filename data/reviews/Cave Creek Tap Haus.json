{"text":"So disappointed with this place.  We participated in a bike week ride and the ride ended at the Tap Haus.  We got a booth right away and then waited and waited and waited and waited while several waitresses walked by our table.  One  of our group went up to the bar to get us drinks and said no since we were in a booth we had to have the waitress serve us.   We finally got a waitress to talk to us and she said it wasn't her table.  We asked who was, she didn't know... but after saying we had been sitting there for 10-15 minutes with no service, she finally agreed to take our order... REALLY!!   If we weren't waiting for the rain to pass and the prizes to be given out we would have left.  I have to say there were empty tables and seats at the bar, but service staff seemed to be unorganized and more into checking their boobs and looks and each other than customers.   So we finally got drinks ordered chips and salsa and potato skins.  It took freakin' forever to get it...   We were going to order dinner but by then the rain stopped, and the prizes were given out.  We asked for our bill and that came instantly.... surprise!   Couldn't wait to get out of this place... it was horrible service and crappy food and the attitude of the staff was as if they're doing you a favor by freakin' waiting on you.  Whatever, we'll go to Harold's across the street next time."}
{"text":"They go up and down - it's hit or miss.   The food is good but some of the staff could go to charm school.  There is some red head behind the bar who is as mean as they come.  I think she used to work at the buffalo chip"}
{"text":"Went in on a rainy Saturday.  Hostess was very friendly as was the waitress.  Prompt seating and service.

The special was salmon tacos and the waitress said they were excellent so we went with her suggestion.  

Our food came and the first notable items were the apparent store bought taco shells.  The fish was not seasoned and very bland. The salsa tasted/looked like it was from a jar.  The food was essentially bland and ill prepared.  

The building was excellent.  The beer selection was great for the area.  Parking was good.

My money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"They didn't know what a hot toddy is. And the coffee was cold. I know this is Arizona but c'mon, it's December."}
{"text":"The owner has done a lot for Cave Creek. Hate to give this place such a bad rating. Tried twice. Bad both times. Need to continue to support The Hideaway and Harrold's. Food bad quality. Left hungry again."}
{"text":"Owners please read this... (By the looks of other reviews they obviously have not been reading their Yelp reviews)

Is all I can say is Go Somewhere Else!  I tried this place  twice and will not do it a third time.  Bad customer service, Bad Food, and very slow to serve. Even the people at the table next to us was upset with the service. It took them over one hour to get their appetizer. I could go on and on but I don't want to bore you.  There are a lot of other good restaurants go somewhere else."}
{"text":"WENT BACK FOR A SECOND VISIT 1 YEAR LATER!

Everyone deserves second chances right?  It is bike week and we were in Cave Creek,  so when looking for something to eat and a cold beer that was more \"family friendly\".  We decided to give CC Tap Haus another try.  After all, it had been a year and we figured they had time to work out the kinks since opening....  Not so much!

Here's the update:

1)  The beer was actually cold this time, but the glasses were dirty.

2)  The server and the food runner had ZERO personality.

3)  The food runner slammed the food tray holder onto the floor and had no idea who got what....  which means they do not use seat numbers.  He looked like he was 14 and acted like he was in a bad mood.

4)  The street taco plate looked like a train wreck and did not taste much better.  It says chicken and beef, but the beef is ground beef...  not steak.  Beware

5)  The lettuce on the burger was sooooo wilted, it looked like it died 3 days ago.  Really people?  Thats like placing a salad in a hot bowl and then placing it under the heat lamp for the food runner to run it out.  The fries were limp like Limp Bizkit.  COOK THE DAMN THINGS!  HELL, TRY DOUBLE FRYING THEM.  FIRE THE COOK!  Notice I said \"cook\" and not Chef.

6)  The water they serve had floaties in every glass.  didn't even try it. I am sure it is not filtered.  WHATS UP with the lame fancy water glasses that don't match (size)?  You are a tap haus....  use pint glasses!

7)  The band sucked.  Sorry band, you did suck.  Quit playing at 6:00 on a Thursday...  Thank god!

8)  Way too expensive for what you get....obviously!

Bottom line....  the service sucked, the food was 1 star, good beer selection, but don't drink out of the glasses, crappy decor,  place is dirty.  I have been a server, bartender, and manager in many restaurants.  I can be fair, but this is bad.  It is obvious this place is run by amateurs.  If you have had a year to read your reviews and have not fixed any of the complaints....  YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT PLAIN AND SIMPLE!  The place has potential but will never reach it.  Too bad.  We should have gone to the dirty mexican restaurant down the street instead...lol

DRINKING HOLE ONLY.....  Oh wait, we can go to Harold's or the Buffalo Chip for that.  Never mind!"}
{"text":"The food was just awful! I'm not one to complain but the steak sandwich was worse then something they feed in a jailhouse. There are plenty of better options in cave creek, this place should fail soon!!!"}
{"text":"That's being generous and it's pretty much because the beer was good. The entire staff was on their cell phones or laptops. I almost felt like we were an inconvenience and they were dead.  Our server was not exactly friendly I didn't know if she could crack a smile. We ordered the signature nachos with chicken which was virtually non exsistant and disappointing.  I really hope they improve it because the location is awesome and they are a Bears bar/restaurant. I will try them again down the road but this experience was sub par."}
{"text":"I must say I am more than disappointed with the food and service here. Upon our arrival, my boyfriend received his beverage right away but then waited another 10 min for a bartender to inquire about what I would like to drink. Another 4 min passed before we had to ask for menus and then another 15 min to take our order. There were maybe 10 people sitting at the bar with 2 bar tenders so they were not busy. When Adriana, our server/bartender, took out order she not only didn't know the menu bit gave us a bit of an attitude about the menu and told me I was wrong when I inquired about cheese on the Haus burger. Upon bringing us the INCORRECT order, she apologized and took the wrong order back to the kitchen. My boyfriend was waiting for me to get my food but it was taking a while so I told him to eat as his was getting cold.  The food was not very good and small portions for the cost. Not to mention, he asked for 2 or 3 beers that were on the menu but either changed or no longer offered but no one told us. I work at a restaurant and was VERY upset about the service or lack thereof. The bill came and no % off was offered for the mistakes. I don't look for a free meal, but this was a terrible experience and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I went back to visit my new favorite German restaurant...and I wasn't disappointed. I tried a couple of the new items. For my entree, I tried the Sauerbraten. It was rich & flavorful...with a touch of vinegar. A satisfying meal. Not wanting to miss out on dessert, I tried Grandma's Blueberry Crumb Kuchen. It was a great end to end a great meal."}
{"text":"We live here and have watched this building change hands many times. We were hoping to get a reasonable restaurant . . . no so much.
Ordered Chimayo chicken, said it had two breasts - got one. Implied it had flavor - got none, well except for the diluted pink ranch dressing.
My wife's Ruben was barely OK, vastly better than the chicken, ordered Coke, got diet Coke with explanation that the lines were mixed up.
Beer was pretty good.
Avoid this place, it'll change hands again probably over summer when nobody frequents."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the Taphaus. We were excited to finally try it on Sat during the Wild West days but won't be going back. The service was not good, slow at best. We ordered chicken tenders and pretzel for starters, both were obviously frozen pre-made crap. I wouldn't have cared so much if the pretzel and really really terrible cheese weren't seven freakin dollars! The same pretzel is cheaper at a Dbacks game. Don't know how this place will stay in business much longer which is a bummer b/ it's a cool place."}
{"text":"Service HORRIBLE...STAY AWAY...Go Across the street to Harolds, or down the street to the Hideaway....Took 45 minutes to get a beer...food never camer. Server RUDE BLONDE. Tried to enjoy my Saturday off with a beer and a salad....NO BUENO!!! Was told that she was busy...I actually waited for my 50cents back on my beer!!!! That is how bad the service was. Asked for the manager was told...We dont know where he is.
Great idea, horrible follow through. Hire new staff and manager...NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not up to par either. Beer selection was great. Although, I don't know that I've ever visited a tap haus with Guiness on tap but not Bass. They attempted a black and tan and failed. The appetizers were okay. Salad, tap haus, was bland. We ordered the daily special to split. They apparently were kind hearted and replaced our order with a semi-charred steak instead. They had run out of the fish special which wasn't helpful to my vegetarian wife. The steak was okay. I would have never ordered it otherwise - this isn't Durrant's. The side items were mostly cold and somewhat bland. 
The beer selection saves this place but the food needs some help."}
{"text":"Visited last Friday after driving by and seeing that they were playing the Coyotes game. They have a really nice selection of beers on tap, and prices weren't too bad considering the location. We weren't very hungry so only ordered the spinach dip to share .The dip was good and the chips seemed pretty fresh but were way too salty. High marks for having exactly what we wanted: to watch sports and drink good beer."}
{"text":"Ugh, we really should have read the reviews before coming here.

We decided last Saturday night to ditch the Arcadia or Scottsdale dinner scene and drive up to Cave Creek for the evening. Thank goodness for the great weather and live band outside at Heralds that we could hear from our outdoor table. 

When we arrived, we asked if could sit outside (we saw seats available when we were walking in). The hostess went outside and then came back to let us know there were none available and we would have to sit inside, then walked away. Not wanting to sit inside (all I saw was an ugly red interior and a huge, empty restaurant), I asked the other hostess how long the wait would be. Luckily, she went outside and there were two tables for us to choose from! Thank goodness for her.

We asked for water right away, that came about 10 minutes later. They did have a nice beer selection, however, my beer was room temperature, hardly cold. When we ordered, I made sure they had bbq sauce as that's what I dip my hamburgers in (weird, i know) - she said that was no problem. So our meals came - apparently they \"discontinued\" carrying bbq sauce. My burger was just ok. My fries were good though! My boyfriend's steak was barely edible. He said his baked potato was the highlight of his meal.

Oh, and not that this matters, but we found grammar errors on the menu! And, the menu itself is quite basic in food offerings. Nothing unique at all.

I think this is the first one-star review I've ever given. However, it was sadly, a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Worst Sunday morning service ever!  We've been there twice. First time was pretty good, but there was no Bears game on. This time there was a Bears game. You would have expected more servers and better service. Wrong! Totally understaffed, never received our food after an hour wait. Finally walked out after asking about our order twice.   Being from Chicago and the service industry, it was hard to understand why these people were un-Chicago-like and unhappy.  They could have a great following here but can't see it lasting more than a year or so. 

Disappointed Bears Fan!

PS. Didn't want to give even one star but had to n order to post!"}
{"text":"Excellent bartenders... Danny & Helen are awesome. Very friendly & efficient. I don't get where all these bad reviews come from. Are u all comparing this place to the Fairmont (a five diamond resort)? Come on.. It's a great hangout \"bar\" & restaurant. The food is great and lot better than 75 of the places in town. Try the soft pretzel and nachos... And the burgers are good too. All in all this place is a great place for lunch or dinner... Give it a try."}
{"text":"Should have known better when all the other places around were busy and their parking lot was empty.Server sucked, no ice in our drinks, cold fries, nasty chili or dog food, over priced frozen bar food and our orders were incorrect.  We had a party of 9, even my daughters grilled cheese was cold and not grilled. Huge bill for nasty food, weird service and a regret for not just going to Harrolds. I could make a list of things wrong with the food but I would be typing all day. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The place is what you expect on the inside for design.  A Cave Creek version of fake rustic.  The service was a 5 out of 10 because she was slow and didn't know the menu items.  Philly cheesesteack was tiny and didn't have a lot of meat or cheese.  All of the serving sizes were very small considering the lunch pricing.  With all of the other great options in that part of the city, they will never see me again and I don't recommend that you waste your time or money there."}
{"text":"Went back yesterday, and we were disappointed.

My burger? Could have gotten more food AND a better burger at Burger King.
Her tuna melt? Just craptastic. 

Both of us didn't feel great after our lunches.

On the upside, the service on this rainy day was a lot better. 

None the less, gave them two choices, and I'm not going to give them a third."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a number of times and have always enjoyed the food and beer selection. On our most recent visit we paid our bill with a credit card that included a tip.  
When we looked at or credit statement that came later in the month we found that they had added an extra $1.00 to the bill. I'm finding that this is happening at more places all the time. 2 on this statement alone.
May not seem like much ( only a buck ) but it is stealing after all 
Watch your statements if you eat here but the next time I'm in Cave Creek I will have a talk with the manager before ordering."}
{"text":"If you love beer this is the place for you. My husband is a beer aficionado and was in heaven. Try the taster set. You get to pick 4 beers for your taster for a great price. Adam, a great waiter, told us they just changed the menu. The food is simple but delicious. My husband had the wild boar sausage sandwich he thought was excellent. I had the Haus salad which was o.k. I thought it was overdressed which wilted the leaves quickly. We shared vegetable chips as an appetizer. The chips were perfectly crispy. I think the chipotle dipping sauce should be change to a lighter sauce. It was a little heavy for the light airy chips. The    Interior is cool. Lots of wrought iron with an upscale roadhouse feel. A great place to have a beer or two after work."}
{"text":"I feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far.  Especially as it seems most of them went during the first 2 weeks the place was open (usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant).  Personally, with the limited selection of tap beers in the town, this place is a gift.  Tons of micro brews and local suds - some that I haven't even heard of.

Like piano music playing classic hits was nice- not crazy loud.

Service was just fine - very friendly.  We ordered a salad with chicken (way too much stuff in the salad) and the fried mushrooms (surprisingly delicious).

Overall, suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft/local brews on tap, this place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great tap haus.  Very biker friendly.  We like to arrive on our Harleys and Hondas"}
{"text":"This place looks like a cool bar/restaurant but it was terrible.  We waited 30 min for a burger and then the server charged a $5 split plate fee because my husband and I split!  He didn't even make us aware of the charge until we got our bill and then told us that it was noted on the menu so he couldn't reverse it.  We called the manager after we left and he said he would credit our check.  Well he never did it!
The burger was overcooked and the fries were cold.  I would NEVER visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Go for the beer only. Lots of good beer on tap at good prices. But everything else is terrible. The service was so bad we were speechless. The food was mediocre. Veggies came out cold and food was luke-warm. Kids mac-n-cheese was soup with noodles. They ran out of diet coke before we got there but it was still on the bill and the waitresses blamed the manager. But the beer was good... if the food was good I would have looked past the service issues as that's more the server, not the place, but we will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Once again terrible service at the Tap House! After 5 visits and continuous poor service we must share!  so many of our friends will not come with us because the food is mediocre and the wait staff are consistently rude and never  around. terrible!!! Management please invest in training your staff. It is critical!  The only reason we keep trying to come back is the awesome music on saturday nights! We love it!"}
{"text":"I seriously want to love this place. I live in cave creek and I love and support local businesses. But what can I say? Fix your menu and educate/train your staff. They are so nice but clueless when it comes to the menu. 
Please fix it because I want to come back."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant in late June 2015.  Excellent food!  The grilled chicken barbecue sandwich is awesome.  You order at a window, find a seat and they'll call you when your order is ready.  There's also a large bar with a great beer selection on draft.  The place feels relaxed and casual.  Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"God I hope with the new branding they got it right and found new cooks. Great place, nice people and ambiance, food was terrible. Cave Creek needs a restaurant that can serve decent food. Harolds, Buffalo chip etc don't have it. Cartwrights knows how to make a good meal but that is different type of place."}
{"text":"Went into Tap Haus for breakfast on 12/29/13 to check it out since we had never gone in there before. My experience was not pleasant. I ordered biscuits and grave and a side of eggs over easy. You would think that the time it would normally take to prepare such a meal that it would not take very long. Actually it was just the opposite, it took approximately 20-25 minutes. When I received my food the eggs were stone cold and the biscuits were so hard that I could not put my fork though it. The waitress was really nice about and took it off my tab. What I found very disturbing was when we were leaving the response from the woman that appeared to be the manager. I told her about it and her response was, \"we are aware of the issues with our breakfast.\" I was obviously stunned. The only thing I can say it unless you are drinking do not order any food."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Tap Haus and I didn't quite get the same experience of shitty service that many have been complaining about.  Our server was good, always on top of our table as we were there to do some drinking and a little eating.  However the managers on duty were a different story.  We arrived and were being taken to our table by the hostess when a manager stopped her and pulled her away to give her some random task while we just stood in the middle of the restaurant like two idiots.  I'm sure whatever he had to tell her could have waited the 45 seconds it was going to take to seat us but I digress.  I'm not Mr Important by any means, it was just awkward.

The food wasn't pure shit but it wasn't anything to write home about.  We ordered the chips and salsa which was definitely Pace Picante from a jar.  The hot wings weren't hot and had an odd taste of game/fatty that I couldn't put my finger on.  My burger was ok, don't bother ordering to temperature though as my medium rare came out well done.  I opted for the sweet potato frys as it's a personal fav of mine and they were soggy and blah.  Again, it wasn't the worst nor was it great and my expectations going in wasn't that I was about to have a great meal.  

However one thing I will say was bad was the beer.  I was thrilled to see the quality selection of beers, especially hop knot from Four Peaks which is one of my all time favorites.  The problem here is that the beer is WARM.  If I had to guess it's probably somewhere between 40-50 degrees and that is not something that's easily forgiven.

Despite this review, I would go back but manage your expectations.  If it weren't for the warm beer, I'd give it 3 stars.  This place has some good potential if they would just improve a few key things.

Ohh and one last thing, we went on Comedy Night.  Wow what a shit show those comics were, it was funny just to watch them bomb but that's of no fault to the establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out and have a beer but the food pretty blah. Seems like most of it is frozen."}
{"text":"Love the variety on tap here & food is good bar grub.  If at the bar there are enough tvs to catch most sports going on any given night or weekend"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before heading out to buffalo chip for the bullfight show. We were expecting to see a casual menu of sandwiches, burgers etc and were surprised to see a more expanded menu . And prime rib special for $22 that night!  My friend and I got that and my husband got new york strip . We all agreed it was delicious and a good price. We were pleasantly surprised!  The service was good too."}
{"text":"Very good!  Nice atmosphere (we sat outside on a Saturday night....music inside was too loud), good food, good service.  I thought that their selection of beers was good, and their food was definitely a couple notches above most bar food offerings.  My steak, which I'm usually picky about, was cooked very well.  Disappointed I couldn't substitute mashed potatoes for baked, but the baked potato was good nonetheless.  We will keep this place in mind in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a wedge salad and there was a moth in my lettuce. The waitress was flat on her response, just said sorry without any emotion. Flies were all over the windows and while they comped my meal (big deal) I ordered a beer after the fiasco just to kill whatever I may have ingested, and they charged me for it!!!! Dirty and stained menus.
They should not even get 1 star but our lunch came out quickly and that's the only reason they get 1."}
{"text":"I always get excited when a new bar or restaurant opens up in Cave Creek but this one doesn't really keep me coming back. There is nothing really wrong with it so far, it's nice on the inside and they have a lot of beers, but there's nothing that has made me want to come back really. The few dishes I have had there were nothing to write home about. They need to get a better happy hour going here to compete with Harolds across the street. They guy that owns The Hideaway down the street is owner of this one as well. I know a few bars have been at this location before that didn't succeed and I hope the Tap Haus can pump it up a bit and get some more locals in there. Service can be a bit spotty as well."}
{"text":"Have eaten their 3 times hoping things would improve.  They haven't; beer is good, wings suck, pasta sucks, potato skins suck, service sucks, burgers are Okay, music is good.  If one is to put that much $$ into a restaurant they should seek help on the menu and food preparation.  Give it up....their goin down in flames!

Things have improved!!!!  new menu and chef have delivered a long overdue remake on the menu.   Got to give them credit for making changes.   Much better."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of Tap Haus and wish they could have executed it better. The bar area has a ton of beers on tap, with a lot of local choices, which is awesome. The inside is nice and would be a good place to hang out with friends. However whoever set up the taps & kegs made some sort of mistake or the volume of customers Tap Haus gets is too low because our beers were all flat. Like flat flat. And then it took forever to get the bartender's attention to get new beers. Service is another issue here - we came in on a Saturday around 5 pm for beers & appetizers. The restaurant was empty, with about 5-8 people at the bar. There were tons of servers just standing around, doing nothing, since there was no one dining. None of them pitched in to help the 1 bartender. Once we finally got new beers, his was better (perhaps the tap tube just needed to be flushed) but mine was still kind of flat. I got a different beer...which was kind of flat too. After that we gave up, finished our beers and french fries, and left."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a business trip and enjoyed it. Our waitress was personable and quick and didn't hesitate with recommendations. She knew the menu well as well as all the various beers available. 
While my prime rib sliders were a bit on the dry side, the cheesecake was awesome! 
There are plenty of TVs throughout and the outdoor seating was perfect for a night of drinks, food, baseball and laughs."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep coming back. We live up the street and when everything else is crowded in cave creek we end up here because it never is. And every time we swear we will never be back. The food is ok but the service is terrible. We have been there when our server is literally sitting at the next table to us on the patio, smoking cigarettes and playing on his phone while we are trying to get another round of drinks. I have never been somewhere where customer service is this awful. Food takes forever, drinks take forever and all the staff is annoyed to be there. I felt we were bothering them. It seems when mark is not there babysitting this staff they take full advantage of being lazy and not working. Do not waste your time or money here!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Chicago Bears bar and so, my husband and I, who are Bears' fans, thought that it would be nice to go further out of town for a change to watch the Bear's game.  We had been here once before and it wasn't anything spectacular.  This time around we sat at the bar.  Before I go any further, it's important to note that this place will reserve seats for you....During football season....on a Sunday....At the bar (or in booths)....  Have you heard of anything more ridiculous?  I've always been around Sunday Football and have learned that you need to get there early or you don't get a seat.  That's part of the package that comes with watching football at a bar or restaurant.  Anyways, we managed to find 2 of the few seats that were not reserved.  But, I know the people, who were sitting next to us had sat down before the \"reserved\" signs had been put up, so the Bartender later told them that those seats are reserved and the people who reserved them has until, I believe, the 2nd quarter to show up.  So, those people had to move (because the ones with the reservation were there).  We noticed that the bartenders were really nice to them and bringing them refills right away and chatting with them, while my husband had to wait a long time for them to bring him another beer, even after 2 of the bartenders walked by at least 10 times (no exaggeration).  So, basically, if you make reservations you get treated better, which doesn't make any sense.  

Plus, the prices were ridiculous.  Especially, for the service and treatment we were getting.  I do not recommend going here.  Maybe the Buffalo Chip across the street treats their customers better.

This is really sad, because, I don't want this to reflect poorly on Chicago, or Bear's fans or anything associated with the two.  This place needs to figure things out and hire new staff.  The reservation thing needs to go.  That's just stupid."}
{"text":"I tried the food here  during an extremely busy biker event. Not a good experience but they were buried in customers. It's far too dark inside, this place needs some windows and a MUCH larger deck for people to sit and enjoy themselves. Keep working on it boys!"}
{"text":"Now ROADHOUSE...We were pretty disappointed. The new renovation is a great upgrade although they aren't at the point of looking authentic and it needs work BUT that was the only positive thing. The service wasn't good ...at all. Our waitress took forever to do the most simple things like get water, yah I'll take a Bud Light (10 minutes for a beer, which was flat) \"oh sorry I forgot\" etc. there weren't more than 8 other people at the bar either. The food was awful. The menu is very generic. Nothing special sadly and the previous Tap Haus menu was better. My husband got chicken fingers, easy right? Wrong. He said they were the worst he'd ever had. Despite the incredibly flat beer that nobody seemed to notice all day until we mentioned it, my husband said the fingers were all breading and crunchy with maybe a pencil sized chicken inside. Sad. We were really let down by the entire place and unfortunately we won't be returning. My husband is really easy to please, good cold beer and decent food, and when we left he said \"wow I don't think I've ever been anywhere in 40 years where everything was wrong.\""}
{"text":"Went there tonight with another couple. We wanted to go to Harrold's but they were too busy. We ordered drinks and it took forever to come out. Then we ordered dinner. After that, we asked for water all around the table. that took an hour to get to us and we had to ask 2 different people. The waitress made it a point to tell us she was new. We completely understand when someone is new but the mistakes were ridiculous. Then our dinner came out and we all had burgers. When I went to cut into my burger, it wasn't a burger, it was chicken. We asked to see a manager. He came over in 5 minutes and we explained about our water taking an hour and my. \"Chicken\" burger. He took the chicken back, never apologizing and we never saw him again. We definitely told him how unhappy we were with the service. He didn't seem to care. My friend and I ordered another drink and the waitress brought  them and said \"these are on me\". Really? When I finally got my correct burger, it was horrible. Not seasoned and it just tasted like a pile of beef. I ate a few bites and couldn't eat anymore The sweet potato fries were soggy. Then we decided to order the half baked cookie. 30 minutes went by and nothing, not even the waitress. I went to the restroom  that and on my way back, I told the hostess where we were sitting and to cancel our desert. Then the waitress came by and said \"for future reference, if you order that  this desert it takes a little longer\". Really? Why didn't she just tell us that? We would have happily waited if she TOLD US! Food and service terrible. Never again!"}
{"text":"Too bad these guys just don't get it, they operate the Hide Away Bar, this is a restaurant so food has to at least be fair no matter how many beers they have. My wife and I have given this place a chance time and time again hoping it would do better, but, someone needs to get their head out of their ....to make this make it, fire the cooks and hire real cooks."}
{"text":"The food was nasty. Cold BBQ sandwich, burned french fries. Grilled Chicken salad with cold pre cut, pre cooked  bagged chicken brought out in little cups. A simple chicken salad & it didn't even have any cheese it was pricy enough to have cheese. With so many places to eat in Cave Creek we picked what I sure hope is the worst one, cause if any are worse the town has problems. 

The staff was very nice and courteous tho."}
{"text":"Biketoberfest! Great time, great bikes, great ta ta's. Had lunch with my girl and a obnoxious biker friend. Fries are spiced nicely, chicken Philly I had was awesome. Wife had sliders she loved. A hole had a burger that he loved, but who cares. Nice atmosphere. Service: 8 out of 10.  Will go back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us... Beer only. But it was pricey, warm and the happy hour didn't look much better so we didn't bother to come back. The guy who greeted us at the door was overly eager and excited to see new/more people. The bartender was lackluster and didn't know how to make an eclipse and it wasn't great even when I told her how to make it. This is a one time only visit."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch we were the only table but there were 4-5 people at the bar. The food was ok nothing special.  There was no beer list and the server didn't know so I went to the bar to order my beer.  This was ok because if you wanted to order another beer you might as well go to the bar because you going to need to get other things like napkins or silver ware and your bill when you want to leave.  It is $13 dollars for a chili dog with coleslaw ( a hot dog w/ canned chili)... My burger was also $13 and came 20 minutes after the chili dog with a soggy bun.. Never will I eat here again expensive food  and poor service"}
{"text":"Tried this place as recommended by a friend. Chef Larry was very nice and came out and greeted us. The place was clean, fun, and lively and I loved the Periogies! I ordered the Pork Yeagar Schnitzle and the first one came out burnt. 

They took it back and redid another one for me. However, Schnitzel is pork pounded flat, off the bone with a lemony citrus light battered crust. This was a heavily battered chop on the bone with no semblance of lemon or schnitzel about it. The Speatzle was a bit rough and too too doughy. I ordered a goat cheese and roasted beet salad and even my husband noticed the beets were canned. And he doesn't eat beets. I was disappointed in the food. 

However, that all being said, I would go back for the periogies and the beer and just the fun atmosphere. Just not for dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Went here shortly after it opened. We had dinner and not sure if they were still training the wait staff and cooks, but it was not a good experience. May return to try the bar, but it will not include dinner."}
{"text":"We popped in for a draught before dinner at Binkely's and sat at the bar. Service was courteous and helpful. There were several beers to choose from (familiar and new to me) and the bartender was helpful with descriptions and samples. Plenty of TVs and a stage for live music."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a round of golf.  First time in Scottsdale area and glad I stopped by.  Good beer and fine waitresses yet the food wasn't the best.  Good place to catch the games at but wouldn't eat there"}
{"text":"Concept is GREAT!
Building is GREAT!
Food was just, well, meh...
Atmosphere is COLD and service SUCKS ASS!

Soooooooo much wasted potential here.  I hope the owners pull it together.  Cave Creek NEEDS a nice place like this but they need it done right not half-assed."}
{"text":"I seriously can't imagine a worse place.  On the positive side, they have a good beer selection, mostly focused on local beer.  Negatives: (sorry there's a lot...) There was a 45 min wait when we got there, but fortunately found a table in the bar. We didn't get acknowledged for a solid 20 min, but weren't in any hurry (and always have a bit of patience for a new place anyway). We ordered beers and the waitress didn't ask what size.  When the come out, they are all the large 24oz glasses. Not what I was looking for since I wanted to try a couple different brews, however didn't say anything as I didn't want to wait.  Ordered food, waited 40 min and finally came out.  I ordered a simple chicken sandwich with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. What came out was a chicken sandwich with grilled onions.  Ok, sucks, but it happens.  Politely told the waitress about the error and she promised to fix it.  5 min later it came back... Uh oh... There were still bits of onion on the chicken, meaning they didn't fully scrape them off.  The pineapple was cocktail pineapples and cold, and the cheese was still cold.  Eww.    Told the waitress about it, in which she wanted to help out.  Wasn't about to wait another 40 min for a  entree at this point, and who knows what they would do at this point... Manager came over, had little knowledge of what happened, which I explained. She rushed into the kitchen and came out a few min later.  At this point, we're ready to go.  Rest of my party had already finished, so there was nothing she could do.  She offered to remove my beer and our appetizer. (thanks for saving the 8 bucks..) so I simply told her I would grab something on the way home, she stormed off with no response like a pouting 3 year old.  As we were leaving, we walked by and she could only give US the dirty look.  

In summary, slow service, bad food (so I hear), piss-poor kitchen, attitude of a 3 year old from management.    Feel like this place is going to have the same result as the previous places at this location... Maybe only serve beer and they'll have a chance..."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM.  A little busy, but the service was fairly quick.  Large selection - mostly bar food.

Girlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili.  Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty.

Prices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a snack after a long hot day of exploring the local area.  Staff was friendly, had a great beer selection, and a good menu for happy hour foods.  The bartender let us sample several of the beers that we hadn't tried before and was helpful and attentive as we made our selections.  I like the sports bar in a barn type theme, combined with the service and great beer selection.  We'd like to go back when we can spend more time and not have to worry about driving after a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Ive eaten there three times and sent back two out of three... Drink beer... or something safe like a hamburger... avoid anything extraordinary... because they  are not.."}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy our lunch today. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a couple of sandwiches. The place didn't seem busy but the food and service was especially slow. When the food arrived, it wasn't amazing. Sorry to say but I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Why would I ever return?    (I know this is long, but laugh and cry with me.)  We have been here several times and were reasonably satisfied, and thus, I did not understand all the criticisms.  Now, I understand!  

We made reservations, three weeks early, with one of the mangers for an outside table on July 3rd (and we also confirmed them twice).  We asked for a table so we could watch the fireworks in Cave Creek that night.  Knowing that it would be crowded, we arrived early for our reservation but found no outside tables were available because all outside view tables were occupied by \"walk-ins\" who had long ago finished eating and were camped out for the evening.  We found the same manager who made our reservation.  He acknowledged our reservation, and then said \"I remember it because you were the first to make a reservation for tonight.\"  OK, here is now rough outline of our evening.

* My first proposed solution was to ask the table occupants who had finished dining to leave the table because a reservation was pending for it.  He said he could not do that.  I have often been told when I have walked into a restaurant early that I must leave the table before a pending reservation arrived.  I am not sure why this would not work.
* His counter was that we wait for a table to open up inside, but then we would not be able to view the fireworks.
* My next solution was to rearrange some tables on the outside deck to make room for our party, but he said he could not do that because of fire regulations.
* By this time, the rest of our party found room at a table set up in their parking lot.  They said they would be happy sitting there.  However, the manager said he could not serve us from the menu in this area because he did not have enough servers.  However, we could purchase a ticket from the bar server outside and get a choice of three sandwiches and a small, individual bag of potato chips.
* When we decided that we were getting hungry and would eat the sandwiches, he, then, offered us an outside deck table in the rear of the building where we had no view.  We decided to stay in the parking lot.
* When we ordered, only two choices remained available and only one lunch-sized bag of chips.
* So our dinner consisted of luke-warm bratwursts on cold pretzel rolls, no kraut or pickles, but we did get mustard (okay ... we helped ourselves to that out of a large jar) and the one small bag of potato chips for the six of us.
* The manager never apologized, offered a discount on return, or offered to give us a round of drinks.  In sum, his attitude was \"tough @#@#.\"
* On the plus side, the fireworks were great, Thank you, Harold's!

When the Tap Haus opened, we were excited because a seemingly unique restaurant would be available.  Added to our positive expectations was the fact that the owner of the good and very popular Hideaway was a joint participant in this venture. After my experiences, my advice to him is to cut his losses and close this place now ... or at least find new managers!  It's doomed without a complete overhaul.  They have also just changed the menu to a German theme which in my opinion will fall flat in this location.  Stick with the idea of a \"craft beer\" pub offering \"pub grub\" casual-style food. They tout a new chef and my advice to him is leave as quickly as possible.  Your up front staff will doom you.

Now, after writing this, I have discovered why I may return.  Unlike other reviewers, I found the beer cold this night.  So, I may return to have a good beer and bid the business a fond farewell.  Maybe the next, and fourth, venture in this building will succeed.

P.S.  The next day we were at a 4th of July get-together along with some of our group from the night before.  I happened to overhear one member of our party describe our experience as one of the worst she has had.  She saw me and was embarrassed ... so was I that we had invited them to such a poor choice of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Beer selection, mediocre food. This place has one of the best beer selections in the valley and good prices. We wanted to love this place, but the food was so-so. The crab cakes were terrible. There were more like bread cakes. The mussels & clams were good, but were not served with any bread for dipping into the sauce, even though in the local paper they show the dish served with toasted bread. The portion was small too. The soft pretzels were not even as good as what you get in the malls. (Best pretzels and dipping sauce are at Rock bottom) The only thing that tasted good were the sweet potato fries. If we come back, it will only be for the beer."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst food places in all of Cave Creek, and horribly expensive for what you get.  The draft beer is way too warm for Phoenix, expecially during the summer time, and bad food with warm beer has chased away most of the local business in the brief time they have been opened.  A place with great potential delivers nothing to bring you back, and I have been there several times now since they opened.  Clearly, a restaurant destined to close if they don't get it together."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Wasn't worth $15. Beer wasn't that cold. 

Would I go there again? Maybe. Just thinking the prices don't match up to the quality, nor quantity of the food. Usually one or the other justifies the higher price, unless it's the location, which wouldn't be the case here.  

Granted I was aware of the price of what I ordered, and sometimes it's worth paying more for getting more.  Not so much this time. 

Perhaps my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"I was skeptical based on reviews but gave it a shot one Sunday afternoon. My friend and I had the best salads! And we knew we were taking a chance ordering salads since it appears to be a sports bar. They were amazing and the fruity light summer ale the waitress suggested was awesome! Would def go back, prices seemed good too. - Ordered the Harvest Salad -"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer so I could see how this place is during Bears' games.    My favorite thing about this place is the fact that I discovered Deep Eddy's grapefruit vodka there.  Just wait if you haven't partaken in it yet.. it's amazing.

We did not eat here so this is based just on service, drinks and such.  I'm not sure why this place was so empty the night we were there because the live music was fantastic.  The service at the bar was also wonderful as well. The drink prices were great that night as they had a special going for Deep Eddy's WITH glasses you could keep."}
{"text":"Lets be honest, things change and you can't ways get it right the first time, but I have to say the cave creek tap haus is a great place to go. I've been here several times over the last 10 months and every time the service was great (ask for Sandy).  I just had a burger-fantastic!  Also, they have this tequila (not your typical tequila)...called 'dirty tequila'...and its really good.  Moreover, the atmosphere is relaxed, cool, and memorable. Step outside of the everyday routine and make this place your new normal. Cave creek tap haus is great."}
{"text":"Concept good, execution could be better, but really very little to complain about. Our server was an English guy, who was very attentive. It was a Sunday night so the place was not full, although  there were lots of people in the main area, we requested to sit in a quieter location. The hostess also turned down the volume in the room we were in, without being asked, which we had all to ourselves. The food was 4 out of 5. Will go back again for sure. Lots of choices of beer!"}
{"text":"Its no wonder this place was DEAD on a Friday night and every other restaurant/bar around it was packed!!  We should have known .. but we tried it anyway as we left because of no service and walked over to Harolds which had a 40 minute wait for 2, and then went back.  The service at the bar was horrible (we sat there FOREVER before one of the cranky bartenders asked what we needed), the food was God awful (Had the French Dip -- was the worst I've ever had)and the drinks were SUPER weak and expensive.  Then we waited FOREVER for our food and again, the place was EMPTY.   Not to mention the stupid menu's they have.  I would think it shouldn't be open for business much longer.  Oh, maybe the bartenders would cheer up if they didn't have to lug their own cases of beer up from the back."}
{"text":"It appears that the Tap Haus is becoming a larger indoor Hideaway. Took clients there Sunday to watch a game and have some good beer. The bartender should go back to the Hideaway. Two male clients came in and sat next to us when she let loose with several F bombs and gave them the finger several times. Apparently she knew them from the Hideaway however the entire exchange was really inappropriate. Needless to say everyone found it uncomfortable.
They just can't seem to get the staffing issue right. Staff turnover is quite high and the majority of staff are always overwhelmed significantly impacting service.
The best thing about this place is the beer selection. I'll be sorry to see them go."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant with an outstanding beer selection and great food, this is your place. Long ago, their food was not good - but they've made great strides in the kitchen and now it's tough to find anything on the menu that's not good. Ribeye steak is very flavorful - French fries are A+.   Burgers are gourmet in quality. 

As a beer aficionado, the only quality that would make this place better would be to see more rotating taps. I want to see more new and unusual beers, more often."}
{"text":"This place is now called Roadhouse. I'm an AZ native, so cave creek biker bar and grills are a staple.  We sat at the bar for about 10 minutes. No one even made eye contact or acknowledged we were there. They were busy, but we sat and watched the two bar tenders pass by us about a dozen times without so much as a \"I'll be right with you\". It's also over 100 degrees and they have the doors all open. It was sweltering. It was hard not to feel like they didn't want us there for some reason. We eventually got up and left. No one seemed to notice. Look for this place to change hands yet again in the near future."}
{"text":"Live bands covering Blues, country, rock. Excellent music. On a weekend this is a good stop in Cave Creek for a beer or to see a friend play. A couple could even dance a bit. The house is big and bold. Very western style. Reminds me of a cat house saloon. 

Saturday, January 26, 2013, Bluesman Mike Anderson and his Blues Review will be there and Mike does a great show."}
{"text":"As per my motto about calling it as i see it..... i've been tough on this place in the past. and i should have... it sucked. I stopped going.

But, a friend pulled me kicking and screaming back for a lunch there one day. I gave in, held my nose and tried it.

I'll give credit where credit is due. Not sure about their dinners or drinks but the burger i had with the chili was great. chili was good, other toppings fresh and nice cheese. Watching my carbs i didn't have a bun but... they fixed it right for me, it wasn't dried out and a pleasant experience.

I'll move it from the yuck 1 star category to the possibly 3 star ok level. we'll see if i get pulled into a dinner there what that's like but for now... it was good one time out of the last 5 or 6 i've been there. Keep up the work guys ! ! !"}
{"text":"Not So Hot here. 3 Stars was for the food n beer, beer choices are great. Trust me get a beer not a mixed drink. 1/2 Star for the staff....I give them a half because they showed up to work. Bartenders have NOOOOOO personality what so ever and do not know how to make a simple Long Island. Food was good, the food has gotten better with the new menu. Just sad.....great location and a great owner, he just needs to clean house on the staff and get some staff in there that care about the place. The Staff there acts like they all hate their life and they do not want to be there, I say this because it really shows. Sometimes when the drinks are not good and the food is not good either, but your bartender has a great personality and interacts with their guests they seems to forget about the okay food and okay mixed drinks. Cheer up or go home don't pull a place down because your miserable working or working there."}
{"text":"Ordered a jack on the rocks. It came out clear. Hmm I wonder if they water down their liquor. Yea, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband (Dave P.) and I had lunch at the TapHaus yesterday (6/16/12), and I woke up this morning wanting to go back for more. A friend had mentioned that their Rueben sandwich was a piece of food art, so we decided to check it out. 

We had previously visited the TapHaus in the winter, for a drink only, and were left with less than enthusiastic feeling than we had hoped. We had sat at the bar, and even though the bar was somewhat busy, the bartender & staff didn't seem too concerned about paying attention to the customers. Yesterdays experience was completely different.

It was a late lunch/early dinner for us and neither of us were super hungry. We decided to split the Soft Pretzel appetizer. The pretzel (apparently made in-house) was hot and delicious, with a spicy cheese dipping sauce. We also split the lunch special, The Harvest Burger. Brittany, the bartender, suggested it, and I'm so glad we listened to her.  

Another poster - Scott S. - was at the other end of the bar (we were that couple that were raving over the sandwich) and I'm sorry he wasn't able to try the burger. Outstanding. Ham, apple, cheese, and burger on a pretzel roll. Doesn't sound right, but don't be fooled. The fries were good portions, hot, with great seasoning. This visit well exceeded expectations.

The staff were all attentive (even those not serving us), welcoming and gracious. Mark Bradshaw happened to be there as well, and gave Dave a sample of the Orange Blossom Cream Ale. It is delicious. We had an opportunity to chat with Chase, the manager, and they acknowledge that they had a rough start, with a bad menu. It seems as though they got back on track, and we look forward to going back to check out other items on the menu (specifically, the Rueben). Everything is being made in-house, and you can tell by the quality.

Chase, Brittany, Mark, and all the rest of the staff - thanks for a great meal and enjoyable time! If you haven't been there recently, or had a bad experience prior, give them another chance! I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Tons of draft beers leaning towards American microbrews. Good deep fried mushrooms. Dani at the bar is very friendly & efficient. Good stop."}
{"text":"I think this place is getting a bad reputation for some reason... not really sure why.  They were out of something I wanted, but what I got was fine.  Foodwise I ordered a burger and fries and it was decent.  I really enjoyed sitting on their patio and seeing the view of the mountain.  I think it's one of the better patios in the Cave Creek area.  Service was good too for the most part.  No major problems.  The only problem at all was that they handed me a menu that had two pages and both the pages were the same page, but they fixed it right away.  I hope this place sticks around because I think it's kind of cool.  I don't think the food and service were over the top good, but they definitely weren't bad either.  I think this place maybe just needs some time.  That and some events going on."}
{"text":"This Tap Haus has 60 taps, almost entirely craft beers (several faux crafts like Blue Moon).  Open room, mixed atmosphere of wealthy cave creek old folks and bikers in Harley black leathers.  Service was atrocious.  Dirt parking though, meh.  Food is American meat focus on steak, chicken, fish plus a lot of fried apps.

Update: had to leave bar without being served - after given menu, was ignored by bartender after numerous passes and a raised hand... and it wasn't busy at all."}
