{"text":"My wife and I visited this place since we heard good things. We went for my birthday and ended up waiting about 1 hour and 45 mins for our food to get to our table. My steak was fine but my wife ordered med/well and they pretty much brought out a rare steak. They eventually took it back to cook it, and then brought the steak back another hour later. After spending about 4 hours in the place, we paid the $200 bill and left. The next day I noticed they charged me $1043 on my debit card! That is totally ridiculous! I called and spoke to John Simich and he said he would \"make everything right\". So after a week of not hearing anything and the $1043 still on my card, I talked to Chase to get it removed and Chase eventually took care of the fraud. I guess John Simich talks a big game but can't back it up."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended.  Location and the interior is very nice as well as the ambiance.  We were welcomed when we came in and we were told that three people would be waiting on us. After the waiter took our order we had a cocktail and then my wife asked for some wine, they took my wine glass away and I never saw the waiter again.  The dinner good but not worth the price.  After dinner we were given a creme brûlée for our anniversary and charged for it.  Now I would think that if we were going to be charged for dessert we would at least get a choice.  But that's just me.  The experience was odd."}
{"text":"I know this is supposed to be some kind of great restaurant, but I have eaten at MANY exceptional and expensive restaurants (because I love food) and this one was TERRIBLE the night my husband I ate here.  It was Xmas Eve 2016.  We were totally expecting an amazing experience and were willing to pay for it.  We both ordered ribeye steaks- you have to order steak at Donovans, right?  My husband usually gets his well done, and when he received it, it tasted funky. I can't think of a better word to describe the strange flavor. He thought it was strange and had me taste it.  I agreed and told him to send it back- we were paying a lot for this meal, and he should be able to get a steak that tastes good!  The waiter acted kind of weird about this, like there was something wrong with us for sending back a steak at Donovan's.  But we honestly felt like the taste indicated something was wrong with it. When Steve got his replacement steak, it still tasted weird, and not that good.  We were totally expecting our steaks to be excellent and they weren't even close. He ate it anyway because of the reaction we received the first time from the waiter and the manager. Later that night, he got VERY VERY sick and was up ALL night on Xmas Eve!!!  It ruined our holiday!!!!  We thought that surely a restaurant of the caliber of Donovan's would make this right for us.  We had spent $300 on our meal, only to have our holiday ruined.  I sent a letter to Donovan's to explain our situation and to ask for a refund of at least my husband's meal.  We didn't receive a response for quite a long time, and finally the manager at the Phoenix location called and explained to us that we were wrong about having a bad steak and that they could not issue a refund.  Wow.  You would think a restaurant that is supposed to be \"high class\" like this would want to protect their reputation and make it right with their customer.  Instead, they treated us like we were cheapskates, trying to get a free meal. How disappointing this was. I then sent a letter to the owner in San Diego and never received a response. I was trying to give them an opportunity to resolve this situation and would not be writing such a bad review if they had made an effort to resolve it. But they completely blew us off.  We will never again go to Donovan's. It's completely overrated. Durant's is a FAR better choice for both service and steaks in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Good service nice staff. But the food is over priced. My steak was cold in the middle. In my opinion you would be better off going to someplace else for a good steak."}
{"text":"Great experiences at Donovan's. Friendly staff and bartenders. (ask for Jordan or Ken). One of best steak places in Phoenix. Good happy hour and wine list as well."}
{"text":"Very happy with this steakhouse.  Our first visit was a great one.  The price matches the environment and the food quality.  Solid service, almost too much service but that isn't really a bad thing when you are well taken care of.  We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Went to a group dinner here while at a conference.  We were all very impressed with the food for a large (40ish) group.  Those of us who ordered steaks were happy - good meat, perfectly cooked veggies.  Those who asked for vegetable plates were happy too.  Our group closed the restaurant but we never felt rushed.  The ambiance was lovely and the main dining area looked very nice.  If I lived out here, I'd definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"WASTE OF $$$! Go to MORTON\"S!!! Donovan's food was disappointing. We ordered the bone in NT strip for $79 and the market price king crab for $65 with mac and cheese with bacon. The mac and cheese is low quality and horrible; very disappointing. The quality and size of the crab legs was barely average. My husband had the scallop potatoes with his steak and although thin, lacking taste. As a notorious and historic local steak house over all the food was horrible and not worth the price. Morton's is much better; Joe's Stone Cold Crab and Smith & Wolensky's in Vegas are way better; Don Shula's is way better. We drove from Higley & Riggs Rd to try this talked about historic restaurant and were terribly disappointed with the food. Service was good but that does not make up for the food.Disappointment! Will not be back."}
{"text":"We go here for special occasions and the food is fantastic and the service is top notch.  Pricey though...but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had a living social coupon for Donovan's tonight. When we walked in the place was very dark and had a musty odor to it. Our first impression was what the hell? As our waitress, Sarah F., became familiar with us she offered a special wine that was mid priced but limited in offering. It was incredible. Next the food, very good and very appropriate serving sizes. But I got to tell you that I would have gladly had a serving of oysters and two bottles of that wine. (Random Ridge) Wow! Besides the atmosphere, this would have been easily a 5 star evening."}
{"text":"There is a simple equation that I like to use to rate restaurants. (Quality of Food/Cost of Food) + Service = satisfaction. Fortunately the service saved this restaurant from 1 star. Otherwise, average food that is really expensive. I've had better salads, better soup, better steak, better lobster, and better desert(chocolate cake I think?). Anyway, find one of Phoenix's more exceptional restaurants, even if you are on a business trip just trying to find the most expensive place to use the corporate card."}
{"text":"I went on recommendation for my birthday and will not be returning. The steak was marginal (though I am very picky about my steaks), the sides were greasy and lacking flavor, and the service was slow and not very friendly. Way overpriced for what you get, with all of the great steakhouses in the area I would not recommend this one!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've been spoiled by great food in my travels, but everything I had here was sub par. WAY to expensive for a terrible steak. Also, I asked for it to be medium rare (as all good steaks should be) and it came well done, no pink. A note for the chefs, if you're going to be cooking at a steak house, please at least be able to cook a steak."}
{"text":"Up till now, I've only used Yelp to read reviews when I wanted to try a new restaurant. Tonight, I am giving my own.... My girlfriend and I had never dined at this restaurant.  We would always dine at other establishments like Maestro's (I just prefer steaks in butter).  We decided to give this a try because a national online discount company (LS) had a $40 for $80 offer AND we read pretty good reviews about Donovan's.  Let me start by saying that service makes everything better.  The food was good (3.5*).  Our servers, Jose and Augustine, were tremendous and genuine.  They made the food taste better.  But, here's the kicker... I watched the GM go to 4 tables around us, during the time (1.5 hrs) we were there, and asked \"How is everything?\"  I kept counting down with my gf as to when he was going to ask us.  Tick tock tick tock..  He's got 20 min, 10 min, TIME! He walked by our table at least 5 times. Finally, as we were walking out, he finally acknowledged us.    Was it because he knew that we were a \"discounted\" table and we were \"cheap\"? Not worth the time?  I'm sure he did because we had to mention we had the offer when we made our reservations.  After all, the tables around us got a special visit.  MR. GM, (Tom Brewer)  Although there are people who take advantage of these discounts, customers like us use it as an opportunity to try a restaurant that we wouldn't normally try (and we tip well!).  If it's great, we're in!  Isn't that your goal?  Isn't word of mouth just gold to you?  If you, as the leader of your restaurant, can't give equal attention to ALL of your customers, what should you expect of your staff?  Again, Augustine and Jose were the best.  Too bad the leader of the restaurant tainted that and knocked this rating down 1.5*.."}
{"text":"had a groupon... Great deal. Sat in the bar and enjoyed dinner. Ken was great, and the food was too."}
{"text":"I normally like Donovan's, but I made the mistake of going there for restaurant week and ordered that menu. Started with the lobster bisque, blandest I've ever had. Mostly cream and served in a ramekin. And skinned over, so been sitting there for restaurant week customers. Tritips for the main was what you'd get at your nephew's wedding - raggedy and smothered in sauce to hide it. Creme brulee to finish, which they should have served in the ramekin and used that size dish for the.bisque. The half I ate was good, so obviously not a restaurant week 'special'. Service was slow, manager stopped by and asked how it was. Ignored my less.tjan enthusiastic response and wished us a good experience, when our experience was pretty much finished. Dude, if you don't care, don't ask. Restaurant week is not a Groupon - if you don't want to give a good taste of what you can do, don't do it! A waste of our time and yours, and instead of winning customers, you've lost them. Take a tip from Capital Grille on restaurant week."}
{"text":"Wow. ShamWOW! It was great. As always the service is super. I was here last year and I can say this place impresses me all the time. I had the special which was a Kansas City strip.   I started off with the iceberg wedge with vinaigrette dressing. It was nice and fresh and not too sour. Now the main dish. The steak was nice and tender. It had a nice flavor to it. The mash potatoes were good too.   The one waiter remembered me from last year. I think it was because he saw me take a picture of my meal and I did that last year. They didn't interrupt while talking or eating with my mouth full. That is always a plus.   I'm looking forward to next year to try and have a great steak again. I ate the whole steak and that's rare! No pun intended."}
{"text":"Most disappointing dinner I've had in years.  Was excited to go to Donovan's for the first time tonight and now question how they got a reputation for being so good.  Ordered a medium rare filet and scallops wrapped in bacon with a baked potato and broccoli.  The steak came over cooked and room temperature.  When notified, The waitress offered to bring me another.  Second time around  the meat was cooked correctly but the baked potato was then undercooked and the broccoli was replaced with snow peas.  The service was well meaning but so unprofessional and not appropriate for a restaurant of this category.  When the manager came by to apologize, he showed the same professionalism complaining how busy they were, how he did not have control over the kitchen and how rough life is in general.  Way too much information, thank you very much.  Needless to say, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The manager at Donavans contacted me about my review and offered us a reservation to try again. We accepted and went. The service was still not up to parr for this type of place, however it was better. It was very difficult to understand our server who had a very thick spanish accent and was soft spoken. For the money, i still dont feel like this place is 5 star but i appreciate the attempt to make our first experience right."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, due to friend's recommendation. Food was blah, definitely not worth the $180 tab for 2 (no alcohol included). The service was excellent from valet to wait staff to hostesses. Their skillet potato was supposed to be their signature side... I'm not impressed. I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Crab legs tasted old and salad tasted like it had been in fridge a day. Store bought bacon bits ."}
{"text":"Old School Steak House.  Great food and drinks.  Has to be good to be in business so long.  Problem with the preparation of my fish dinner.  Chef came to table, apologized, and refired it himself."}
{"text":"This place willl always have a place in my heart, My husband took me here on our first date and it was amazing, Im only 25 and was a single mother of 2 at the time so I rarely got out and especially anywhere fancy, I was a bit uncomfortable but it was nice to be waited on and they make you feel very special.The bill was about 200 I think for the both of us wowza! The food was great I didnt have a problem with anything and the steak was perfect,the second time we went was right after my hubby asked me to marry him atop the mountain to the northeast of the steakhouse, still amazing and this time I got the creme brulee for dessert OMG so delicious! actually the first time ive ever had it but dont think anything can get better than that! I got steak again with mashed potatoes asparagus and baby carrots so yummy! I would recommend only going here for a special occasion because its so pricey unless your rich I guess. the service is great and very attentive, after we paid our bill and walked out our waiter ran outside to find us and shake our hands and give us his card,pretty sure he was happy about the huge tip my hubby gave him lol! then the valet,made me feel wierd the first time I was laughing and thinking dude im not some rich snob that cant even open their own door,but what are you gonna do they do it anyways.Overall great place to feel special and get a great meal but be prepared to shell out loads of cash, I would say bring 400 for 2 people just in case you have a date that orders alot of wine or drinks,the 200 for me and the hubby was without drinks, tip to waiter,and tip to valet."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday with my girlfriend. It was nice had a New York Strip Steak that was awesome. We used either a group on or something like that or the bill would have been extreme. Food is acceptable ambiance is excellent had it not been for the discount it would have been overpriced. It was a nice evening for the two of us so in that regard I will say it was worth it. I give them a 3.5."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful, anniversary meal at Donovan's. They had our table decorated with rose petals, which I thought was a thoughtful touch. The food tasted amazing, and the service was fantastic. The staff at Donovan's made our night memorable. We will definitely be back for next year's anniversary!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Donovan's for her birthday.  Over the past three months we have been going to the \"better\" Phoenix area steak houses and were looking forward to Donovan's as we had heard good things about the restaurant.   On the plus side, a good wine selection for every budget and taste from Screaming Eagle to run of the mill CA wines..  We had a Pommard at $155, a reasonable price for the French wine. Also good wait staff. Initial service was excellent. I had the bone in strip ($78), my wife had the shrimp filet combo ($52), both included choice of potato and side vegtable so fair value. We both enjoyed the back lit menus easy to read for our older eyes.  A staff member checked to see if steaks were cooked properly. However our server did not check once we started eating and we had to ask for him once we discovered a problem.  The food from the Caesar on was poorly seasoned - way too much pepper. My steak was edible once I scraped the pepper off, my wife's too much pepper for her to eat. No problem returning the filet but when the manager offered to comp our dessert, and noticed the scraped pepper piled to the side of my dish, he should have realized that they already were comping dessert for my wife's birthday and either offered another adjustment or just apoligized noting that the chef had a heavy hand tonight with the pepper. I expect more professionalism at a restaurant of this caliber.  All in all, not as good of an experience as we have had at the other steakhouses."}
{"text":"Others have said great service.   Well, our experience was not so good.   2 hours 45 minutes later for an anniversary dinner.   First, seated quickly - but the waiter disappeared and came back with apologies.  Okay - having a good time.   Then the food - mushy crab cakes - better use lemon because the tartar sauce overwhelms the crab cake; calamari - breading crunchy but a bit much - same tartar sauce so lots of lemon is better.  Ribeye - for $60 not close to Capital Grille or even the old standby of Durants.   The manager was apologetic but it took us 10 minutes to get the bill - by that time - the restaurant was pretty empty.     Not even a close chance we will return after this experience"}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed. It's expensive and the side dishes weren't that good. The fillet was great and dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting my daughter for the Holiday, I wanted a night off from cooking Christmas Eve and googled the top 10 Steakhouses in the Phoenix area. Donovan's was listed.  Magazines also listed it among the top 10 steak houses in the country, so I thought it would be worth the money. I wasn't impressed and will not return.  The place is pretty nice, quick valet service, great doorman. The best part of the evening was the wait staff. Friendly and professional, knowledgeable and attentive. All in all the ambiance was a solid four star rating.   But when it comes to the food...  The bread was hard and stiff. I don't know what type of bread is used, but it was probably not the best choice for a fine dining location. The taste wasn't bad but it was just too tough.  My daughter did enjoy the spinach salad.   The side of mushrooms were completely black, I'm not a mushroom connoisseur, perhaps it was simply the type of mushroom that bears such color; however, they tasted burned and were extremely dry.   I ordered filet mignon, medium-well. What was brought to be was quite nearly jerky. I did not want to complain; however, this wasn't a meager $100 dinner, so I thought I should enjoy my meal given the price. I requested a re-fire, which was quickly handled. The second try was much better, but still only a 2 out of 5 stars. I enjoy filet, so I frequent every day establishments. I have to say Texas Roadhouse has a far superior cut than Donovan's. Perhaps I should stick to places like Ruths Chris and Morton's...   I asked our waiter to recommend a wine for my daughter, which he did, and was wonderful. And I don't even care for wine. Apparently, their wine list is a huge point of note.    The wait staff was outstanding, and I found it very unfortunate that they must work in such a wonderful place, yet, are forced to serve such disappointing meals.   If this place was half as expensive, it may be worth a 3 star, simply due the impeccable service, valet, and doorman. All in all, could be a great place for a drink, but avoid the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked the original Donovan's Steak House in La Jolla when we lived there several years ago, so when we moved to Phoenix we were glad to hear that a second Donovan's had been opened here.  We invited my in-laws out for a nice dinner on a Wednesday night and decided it was time to investigate this place.    Honestly, we were a bit disappointed.  Donovan's Phoenix has the same ultra-low lighting and dark wood-panelled ambience as its big sister in California, which wasn't a surprise.  Even so, the dining room felt particularly stodgy;  the low light seemed more oppressive than elegant, and the dining tables are strangely small and feel crowded. (Luckily, we were able to upgrade to a booth when my father-in-law told the waiter that he couldn't read the menu in the room's low light).    The menu itself was relentlessly predictable.  I realize that Donovan's touts itself as a classic steak house, but they could stand to show a little more verve in their appetizer and side dish selections - even the dessert selections were nothing I wouldn't expect to see in a thousand other less expensive places.  Our steaks were, eh, OK;  I ordered mine rare (I like 'em bloody), but it came definitely more medium-rare.  Neither my husband nor I felt that the quality of our cuts was what we'd hoped they'd be for the price point.  All told, the meals were enjoyable, but I came away feeling underwhelmed, like the kitchen was phoning it in.  Again, understanding that Donovan's is aiming for a classic vibe, it still seems to me like they could try harder to maintain that character and still show some inspiration and creativity in the details. Our search for a favorite steak place in the greater Phoenix area continues."}
{"text":"Donovan's has been on my list of must-try steakhouse in the valley for a while, and finally here I am! Maybe because it has been on my list for quite a long time, my expectation has risen higher than that I should? My overall first experience was not all that impressed.   A few things to mention:  1) Compliment valet 2) Seafood tower was a good try if you like raw oysters and cooked shrimps, lobsters and king crab legs that are served ice cold.  3) Steaks were cooked at the right temperature, though the accompanied bacon wrapped scallops with my steak were not so great. Generally you can't really go wrong with bacon, but this time, bacon and scallops were a bit odd, didn't taste so right, and not to mention the scallops were slightly undercooked. 4) The place was dark, and noisy level is on the high side. 5) Great and attentive services!"}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is similar to that of a dungeon - very dark and dim with old decor! The filet mignon was good, but the mashed potatoes were flavorless, along with the vegetables. What bothered me most is that I started questioning the cleanliness of this place - the seats were so sticky, the fabric made a crackling sound every time I moved and the glasses were stained. The saddest part is that the cheesecake tastes like refrigerator. Must not be moving food quick enough!"}
{"text":"It seems Donovan's has taken over the top tier reputation for steak and chop down the Camelback corrider and I was let down. I've experienced nearly every steak place in Phoenix and Scottsdale. I have a descerning eye and taste for steaks in town. Could have been an off night, but the steak was good not great. I love when steaks come sizzling to the table, in butter or not, and I appreciate they need to stand for as much as ten minutes before cutting in, but the Donovan's steak just look like it was waiting back in the kitchen too long. I ordered a NY strip charred medium rare + and it came back marginally charred and decidedly medium rare, Waiter up-saled on the seafood tower. $68 for nothing special -- oysters, crab legs and old lobster tails. Everything else was just fine. Wine list was dissappointing. Almost impossible to go frugal, so that you can justify (2) bottles. Table for 3 was nearly $600 with tip. Ultimately -- for me -- I'm there to judge the steak. In the last (2) years, my best steak was Ruth's Chris in Scottsdale on Indian Bend."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I have dined at Donovan's just a couple of times. The first, a few years ago for a late afternoon bite and a Happy Hour drink. We were disappointed by the (all-male) serice staff who were stuffy and borderline rude. We felt this was as a result of not ordering expensive wine or steaks. The dark wood and white tablecloths along with valet service made us feel special and important but the quality of service had the opposite effect. Recently, some friends of ours encouraged us to give the place another try as there has been a change of hands in onwership or something. Sadly, no real changes were noticable. If anything, the experience was worse! Though there are now female servers, the quality of food has decreased (our side of potatoes was served cold and my steak was overdone) and management seemed disinterested in our displeasure. As a matter of fact, the female manager on staff in a tight fitting business suit could not be courteous enough to stop by our table even after we requested her to do so. We will definitely NOT be back this time."}
{"text":"It was time for me to experience Donovans Steakhouse, so we did. Party of 5. Well, I have to admit, it is awesome. Perfect in every aspects. Service (Tina, Brett and Angel at the table or Jason at the bar), the food, (perfectly executed steak, the Rib Chop was divine); the succulent apple tart, great espresso... The manager stopped at the table, the ambiance is top notch. A flawless experience. I know now why Donovans is the best Steakhouse in Arizona."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve ... Fail.    It was clear the wait staff was eager to get you in and out of there to accommodate all the reservations.  Yet, when it actually came to service it was less than ... and certainly not worth 20%. {still tipped 20% but wasn't happy about it}   It was disappointing they had a limited menu and not willing to make any additional accommodations.  Recommendation for Donovans: Make sure to inform people while they are making a reservation.  Now for the actual food review ...   Crab Cake - Had better for the price Baked Potato - Good NY Strip - Good, even better the next day with breakfast Creme Brulee - Good ... but definitely NOT award winning  Cocktails - Perfection, bartender has a heavy poor to your benefit   Would I come here again? Nope. There are better options in town. Sorry Donovan's, times have changed for the Camelback area. And if I am gonna spend $250 for a steak dinner for two ... It needs to be worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  I'm probably a little younger and more casual then the average Donovan client but the food is GREAT and the service is AWESOME!!!  if you do not know, they have really good steak. What surprised me was how amazing the Salmon and Shrimp was. SURF and TURF!! I am now a huge fan, I had no idea how good the seafood was here.  I have to also say the service of gentleman we had waiting on us did a fantastic job :)"}
{"text":"Well, I only went here because my ex wanted to go.  I am a vegetarian so I can't say how good the meat is.  But I will give my oppinion on the ambiance of this place. Stuffy would be one word. The decor was quite pretty, but somewhat heavy. It is definitly for an older crowd. We were early in meeting some friends so we went to the bar to have some drinks. When we were being escorted to our table, I could not carry my own drink, the waiter carried it for me. Pretty cool. I think if I was a meat eater I would have liked this place even more, since I'm not ...I would recommend to open a window or two and let some air in."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Donovan's. I will say that the service is excellent. Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.  Prices are at the higher end, and the food was prepared to perfection. The portions are on the smaller side, but that's fine with me, as I am not one to over indulge.  If you like an old school dining experience, I would recommend Donovan's to entertain clients, celebrate an anniversary. or just to treat yourself to a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour food was great but the service was a little slow. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Although I'm not a huge meat eater, this girl loves a good old filet on occasion.  You test the waters at Donovan's and you my friend will find yourself doing the backstroke of happiness for the rest of the week.  I actually dated a staff member (hence discount city!) but I would still pay full price to dine here.  It's about as nice of a steak house as it gets in Phx.  It could easily hold it's own to any NY, SF or LV fine dining establishment.  As I mentioned before I had an \"inside connection\" to certain things not on the menu.  Such as the seafood tower.  Pricey-Pricey but again completely worth it!  The tower had giant shrimp cocktail, bacon wrapped scallops and fried calamari.  The seared lamb chops are my FAVE appetizer and runner up would be the Maryland Crab cakes.    For the main course you would be a fool to not get the filet but to each their own.  I opted for sides of asparagus, garlic smashed potatoes with the peppercorn gravy.    For dessert we had a jaw dropping epic portion of Cheesecake (they had me at cheesecake) and strawberry sauce.  Creme brulee has just never been a favorite of mine but if that's one of your choice desserts I'm sure it can't be bad.   The staff is unbelievable, you have 3 to 4 people ensuring you have a marvelous meal and it is all in all probably one of my best places to eat.  Whenever I have visitors in town I always take them here and time and time again their blown away by this place!!  They have locations in SD, La Jolla, Biltmore and coming soon to North Scottsdale.  To me it beats City Hall, Capitol Grille and a few of the other over-hyped see & be seen steak houses of the Valley!"}
{"text":"My peppercorn filet was delicious! My husband's porterhouse was overcooked.  When they realized this I appreciate that they offered to get him a new one, the replacement was cooked properly but a grisly, fatty piece of meat.  I know it costs them to replace a meal but it's not our fault we expected a $70 steak to be cooked right. They shouldn't have offered to replace his steak if it was going to be with an inferior one.    The servers were all nice but felt like they were hovering more than I cared for. Overall I wouldn't return. It wasn't worth the money and a steakhouse replacing an improperly cooked steak with just a bad one isn't acceptable no matter how many glasses of free wine you offer. That's not what I'm there for."}
{"text":"The Australian Cold Water Lobster is the best I have ever had. All of the other food is very high quality and well prepared but the lobster stands out. Service is superior. Environment is a bit fancy for my taste, but often good food comes with the whole \"well to do\" interior design."}
{"text":"Just had a group dinner at Donovan's and since it was my friend's gift to us all, we sampled half the appetizers and ended with the chef's special desert for all.  All dozen of us were picked up in Donovan's shuttle and this is a great way to go if you have a group this size.  The room they sat us in is a perfect fit for 12, and one side of this private room is glass paneled showing  all the wine from floor to ceiling.  A very, very extensive (expensive) wine selection if that's your thing. Me, I like beer... cuz I get thirsty and wine and water don't do it for me.  But Donovan's has a poor beer selection.  Nothing on tap, which suits me fine from all I know about tapping beer, but how come you can't have a decent selection of cold beer, especially since they do have a bar area?  Not enough fridge space? I had the special Kansas City cut, bone in, 20oz... enough left over for a couple steak sandwiches, with baby carrots and peas, and I chose the garlic smashed potatoes.  My medium steak was very tender, just a bit dry, but great flavor.  The veggies and one choice of side (the skillet fried potato slices include a sauce that goes well with your meat) come with all entrees. And, during the summer it doesn't seem they press the 'dress code'.  In sum, a great place for a special occasion.  High level of service.  But poor beer selection and the high entree prices (20oz porterhouse $55, 12oz NY strip $45) take away a star for me.  If you're on the west side of Phoenix, try Skye."}
{"text":"We went there on a busy Saturday night and the service was excellent. The staff even welcomed us back and it's been at least 9 years since I was there last. The shrimp were fresh and good size. My wife loved the halibut and my lamb chops were cooked to perfection. We had a wonderful time at Donovan's."}
{"text":"Great! I had the steak salad and bacon Mac & cheese...one of the best steaks I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Next time I will opt for Outback. Steak is far more flavorful. Client and co-worker had the Halibut and both were disappointed, the fish was over-cooked and dry. Well, sometimes you have to take small consolation in the sides. For instance, a delicious dish of handcrafted Macaroni and Cheese. This was not to be the salvation of last nights meal. Where was the cheese? Is there a cheese shortage in Arizona? Dry, completely lacking flavor. I'll take Kraft Mac n Cheese any day of the week over this travesty. More to follow."}
{"text":"My first time to Donovan's in many years and now I realize why it will be my last EVER!  My lady friend and I are there two minutes before 5pm for our 5pm reservation on a Saturday night and yet they tell us they can't seat us and recommend that we have a seat in their lounge. Really, it's middle June on a Saturday and I have to wait an extra 15 minutes for a restaurant that just opened for the evening.    When we were seated their were several others already seated and the place wasn't even a quarter full at this time.  Makes me wonder if their staffing was just not prepared for the evening. We were seated nicely and offered fresh cold water upon arrival. Bread which I would say at the best was no better then a small loaf from Fry's was served right away with two small dabs of cold butter!    I will say the bacon mac & cheese was excellent as was the wedge salad and they were very accommodating to supply me with extra blue cheese crumbles and dressing and the salad as fresh and cold served on a nice ice cold plate. What you old expect for a wedge salad.   Now on to the fun part, I say this tongue & cheek as this part was not so much fun. I ordered the most expensive ala carte meat choice on the  menu, the Porterhouse.  Upon presentation not bad, vegetables looked nice and fresh and the steak looked cooked well. But from the moment I tried to cut into the non filet side I was disappointed. I struggled to cut the meat with the knife at first thinking it must be the blade was not sharp enough but hey I'm a big tough guy I can cut through this right!  Then came the part to chew. My first piece I chewed and chewed and chewed never once being able to break don this piece of meat, so I spit it out as I couldn't swallow this fatty, grizzly piece of meat. I tried again, same result. So after waiting what seemed like 15 min for someone to finally come over and asked what I thought of my meal I explained this wasn't going to cut it, pardon the pun.   The waiter seemed put off that I would Question the integrity and quality of their steak, I felt put off that I would be challenged & questioned at such a high end establishment. Finally he realized I was serious and he offered to bring out another porterhouse. Within 5 min or so what appeared to be a manager named Jeffery came out to offer his sincere apologizes as it appears they researched this cut of meat and found to be in agreement that it was not to be up to anyone's standards for a $70 cut of meat. He not only offered to replace it for free but threw in to free deserts to my date and I. It was a nice overture and the right thing to do.   But I will agree with others, the steaks here are overly seasoned and take away from the flavor of a good cut of meat. So was not impressed by the steaks, but the Mac and cheese appetizer,  that was a Homerun!    All and all not a bad dining experience, but far from the best ive ever received."}
{"text":"I prefer their La Jolla location. Went with a large group and the staff handled us pretty well. Only complaint was that the staff didn't pull the the empty wine glasses when we ordered a different bottle. Is it too much to ask for a new glass for a new wine?"}
{"text":"Horrible service for a very expensive steak. If your looking for a fine dining steak house this is not the place the place to go. Nobody wants there $70 steak to be butterflied our waiter was very hard to find when we needed him and never checked on us. Next time I will stick to Mastros   At Donovan's you do not get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"We went because we liked the wine list. The service was excellent. The place was perfect for a working dinner. Our chief complaint though is that the steaks were dry. It was overall good, but I expected a little more on the food front. That being said, it's a good restaurant with a nice ambience."}
{"text":"My first outing to Donovan's was by far the best. The customer service was out of this world... Unfortunately every other time after this it diminished bit by bit. But I'm hear to speak about my most recent and regrettably, my last trip there. I always order my steaks/lamb chops medium rare. Well tonight we were celebrating my fourth week of pregnancy, I had just found out that morning, I thought- let's give it one more shot! It started off well and continued until I received my lamb chops. They were red and raw in the middle. Normally I would probably not mind but as a new mother-to-be a friend had instructed me to order my meats medium or more done- so this is what I did. I did not think I needed to consult the menu guide, silly me- as I said I have been ordering my steaks/meats medium rare for FOREVER and I prefer them this way. But the little girl or gal under construction needed a more cooked meal. To me medium is MAYBE a bit pink, not red, and definitely not raw. Again, my apologies I didn't read the menu from top to bottom... When I alerted the waitress to the fact that my lamb chops were \"severely undercooked\" she decided it was an appropriate situation to berate and condescend. This was not necessary. I'm sad because I want to love it here. A lot of the staff has been here forever and I looked forward to their familiar faces- the man who works at the bar and serves up the delicious sandwiches at happy hour is one. I just wanted to let everyone on Yelp know the food is good, but it comes with a price, literally and figuratively. Come prepared with full pockets and a sturdy back bone, because if you make any of the servers just a bit offended they will definitely make you pay the price."}
{"text":"Started dining at Donovan's 3 years ago.  At that time, the food was excellent and the ambience excellent, too.  Last year (2011), the food continued to be excellent, but there was an incident with management about Open Table.  Instead of Donovan's resolving the problem, they did nothing.  Still basing past experiences on the food and ambience (sitting in a booth against the wall),  a reservation was made through Open Table for Valentine's Day 02/14/2012, requesting a booth against the wall.  Received a confirmation from Open Table. Walked into Donovan's and they said they didn't have a reservation for our party and they were all booked up.  Our reservation was for a party of 4.  Offered us 1 table they had available -- the worst table in the restaurant where people first walk in. We waited a long time to receive our food.  After the early arrivals began leaving (shortly after we were seated), there were many empty tables.   Our bill for 4 people -- close to $300.  We didn't believe their story about not receiving the reservation since they managed to find our 'name' in the system.  To have to experience 'drama' in that type of high end restaurant after spending that kind of money, plus bringing 2 new customers, I can guarantee that we won't be going there again.  I'm usually an accurate guesser.  I don't think Donovan's is going to be around for the long haul.  There are definitely problems there."}
{"text":"First time eating there It was delicious worth every penny juicy steaks great tasting!! The customer service was perfect or waitress was very helpful in suggestions of what to try and she was on the money everything she suggested turned out to be delicious! Will definitely be back and suggest to others"}
{"text":"The food was good, but that was about it. The place is just average. From the decor to the service, it was just like every other restaurant."}
{"text":"Had better, more flavorful steaks for the same price. My filet mignon was thin and dry, while others at the table had the same and theirs was thicker and juicier. No seasoning on the steak. Mashed potatoes were just that...potatoes. UPDATE(started the review few months ago)-was there again (free dinners so why not) and they were amazing. Not sure if there was a new chef or what, but I would recommend it (though I do prefer other steak places if I'm the one paying)."}
{"text":"Impeccable!  Fabulous fine dining or special event dining place.  Fantastic food, refined and masculine ambiance, and superb service."}
{"text":"After 40 years in the valley this Steak & Chop house beats them all hands down! Keep up the good work, don't get comfortable and keep putting out first class steaks."}
{"text":"There once was a time when this was one of the best steak houses in town. Sadly, this is no longer the case. Similar experience to the majority of the other poor reviews. Avoid this restaurant, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I came here for a business meeting with some people who already came here in the past.    The establishment feels like a steakhouse, dimm lighting, dark woods and white tables cloths and waiters in black suits. Service was very good and responsive, 4 stars for that.   We split the bacon wrapped scallops (4 per serving), lamb chops (4 per serving) and the crab cakes (2 per serving).  Lamb were delicious, cooked perfectly and served with a nice ranch sauce. Scallops were overlooked, thank God there was bacon on them. And the crab cakes where ok, nothing special with some baby greens and 2 sauces.    For dinner they had specials and we geared towards them. One was 3 small filets topped with crab meat in a hollandaise sauce and served with asparagus, they said it was delicious. I had the 20oz bone-in NY strip, that too was a special. It's still a 16oz maybe more strip, but a little more flavor. I ordered it medium rare, but it was more on the rare side. It had a good flavor and crust to it. The side dishes of mixed vegetables come with the steak, which is nice, but they were under seasoned and under cook, basically raw. We also ordered a side of sautéed mushrooms and same there, under cooked and not seasoned. Not too impressed.   The wine selection was very pricey, lowest bottle was around 65 dollars, by the glass was over 10.   This is a pricey place, and frankly I've had much better steaks that were more tender and cheaper elsewhere. Total bill for 4 people with a dessert and a couple drinks was $575. Too bad, as this place had potential when we walked in. The nice thing it has complimentary valet and we got free bottled water on the way out! The most expensive bottled water I've paid for."}
{"text":"Dinner with family on my daughter's 21st birthday. Food was excellent, however service was poor. It's difficult to pay $60.00 for a tip when it took 45 min. for the salad course! Lest you think I exaggerate, when the waiter brought entrees to a neighboring table & announced the dish , I heard the gentleman say \"I guess- it's been so long I can't remember what I ordered!\" Again, the food was wonderful, but 2 hours for a 3 course meal is ridiculous. Definitely NOT a place to go before an event."}
{"text":"If you ever want to be treated with the best service this is the place to go never had a bad meal allways hot when orderd i will recommend them to friends.  I want to thank the cook for a well cooked steak you made my anaversery a good one."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal and dinning experience... superior service and presentation of detail."}
{"text":"I've seen Donovan's name all the time in the airplane magazines listed among the top 10 steak houses in the country so I went there like 3 years ago. I wasn't impressed and that's why I never went back.   But I believe that everybody deserves a second chance so I went back.  The place is pretty nice, the service was friendly and professional and all in all the ambiance was a solid four star rating.   But when it comes to the food...  The bread was hard and stiff, I don't know if it's the bread type or it was old. The taste wasn't bad but the texture wasn't good in my opinion.  The house chopped salad was flavorless and it was too much salad.  The Mac and Cheese with bacon was barely ok.  I asked our waiter what to order since I wasn't impressed by their filet last time and he recommended the rib eye (I asked specifically between those 2 dishes).  I ordered the rib eye and it was good but nothing impressive. If this place was half as expensive, it would be a four star.   BTW, all the dishes were extremely hot, like \"hell, I-burned-my-mouth-roof-and-it's already-peeling\" hot.   Anyways, good place for a date but don't expect much from the food and be ready to pay some extra money."}
{"text":"Yep.  It was that great!  Service was flawless - immediate refilling of glasses before they were below half full, waitress heard me comment about temperature and immediately offered a sweater (which was needed), drinks were quickly brought to the table (and my mixed drink was described with a few extra details to ensure it's what I was wanting).  Food was perfectly, and I mean, PERFECTLY cooked.  Grabbed some of the peppercorn sauce for my smashed garlic potatoes.  While the taters definitely stood on their own, I'm glad to have had the crazy delish gravy to douse my potatoes with.  The veggies of a single carrot and snow peas were cooked fine, but being a veg-head, I'd have wished for a lot more.  Regardless, my filet, potatoes, and veggies were more than enough for an over-the-top gluttonous meal!  The manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was to our liking and cooked correctly.  Even valet was seamless with the experience.  Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned we'd find our steaks under-seasoned, and I even thought about asking for extra seasoning.  Alas, it was absolutely perfect as is.  Definitely a splurge-worthy meal!  Bonus: the happy hour offers discounted cocktails and free steak sandwiches...we didn't imbibe since a steak sandwich before my steak meal seemed a bit over-the-top-fatass-American."}
{"text":"Meat, a filet and a rack of lamb, were correct temp and seasoning but undistinguished. A few snow peas and a small carrot don't count as a vegetable in my book. The potato dish would not measure up to a real Lyonnaise.  Mine seemed soggy and bland. I did not care much for their decaf and the half bottle of some Russian River pinot was insipid at $38.   Overall: Maybe ok at half the price.  At 172 including tip, not so much."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, start to finish. Jay is the best waiter there, he is knowledgeable about the menu and recommends the best glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Grat ambiance, great service, but if you are looking for a char on a medium rare steak, this is not the place.  Grill marks are as far as you get.   Disappointed, in that they advertise 1800 degree cooking temperatures.  There are other restaurants that can do it, so  I doubt that I will return.  Salad, potato, and veggies were mostly fine."}
{"text":"I just had the best anniversary dinner here.  Me and my hubby we super happy with our delicious steak.  The service was great.  I had such a good time with my husband we hardly get any alone time.    They offer complimentary valet and the setting on our table was perfect with rose petals and a cute card.   More desert was rich and scrumptious best creme brûlée in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve and all I can say is... Eh.   My boyfriend and our friends love to try all the different steakhouses around the valley and had chosen Donovan's to ring in 2015. I had looked up their menu online and was SO EXCITED to try their creamed corn and key lime pie and was incredibly disappointed upon arrival. They had a limited menu for the occasion which did not include those two desired items above. When my boyfriend asked if we could still order those, our sever (very rudely I might add) replied no. Total bummer!   My friend was not a fan of the vegetables of the evening so asked if she could substitute them for asparagus. She was told it would not be a problem, but when the meals came they had charged her for an additional side of asparagus instead. Not that big of a deal but it would have been nice if it was explained that way instead of making it sound like it would just be replaced.   The steak was cooked exactly how I asked for which is always nice, but other than that nothing special. All the other steakhouses serve up steak on a piping hot (literally 500 degree) plate and this plate was cold which on return cools the steak quicker... Minus a star.   The atmosphere was still decorated for Christmas which was beautiful and definitely helped to brighten up what kinda seemed like too dim of lighting.   It was good, but not great. Considering all the other steakhouse options in the Phoenix area, this one is a pass."}
{"text":"i went to donovan's to try the az restaurant week tasting menu with friends.  although we had a reservation, it took them an additional 40 minutes to seat us.  normally not a big deal, but the atmosphere at the bar is boring and pretentious.  once we were seated, our waitress was personable and informative.  as for the food - the lamb chop appetizer was very tasty, but slightly overpriced in my opinion.  the caesar salad was underwhelming and had too much cheese on it. (reminded me of paradise bakery..)  i think i can find a better steak in phoenix.  i make better garlic mashed potatoes at home.  the scampi were covered in a weird cream sauce that made them entirely unappealing.  the seasonal vegetables consisted of half a baby carrot and.. was there anything else? i don't even care to remember.  the creme brulee was good, but too big.  the wine selection is decent.  final word: save the $$ and time for a restaurant you will actually enjoy."}
{"text":"I'll say it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Service was great. No problems there. The bread was crusty and delicious. The shrimp cocktail shrimp were large and cold but not cold or crispy enough. They weren't ocean club, peter Luger caliber. The filet mignon was totally flavorless. Like I don't even think any seasonings were used at all. It was served with a medley of vegetables which was depressing and a choice of a potato. We chose the augratin. It was also underwhelming. Our side was cream corn casserole. This dish was peppered with jalapeños. It just wasn't what I like or expected.  Bottom line: It wasn't bad. I don't feel robbed or anything. I'm not food poisoned. However if I'm going to spend $100+ on a meal, I want to be impressed. It's not outback but it's not steak 44 or mastros either."}
{"text":"After experiencing many of the other \"finer\" steak restaurants in the area it was only inevitable that I try Donovans. I have had a gitt certificate from there for sometime, thus we had a reason to try.  It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy for the country being in the midst of a recession. My husband and I got there a little before the rest of our party. We sat at the bar that definetly had a cool vibe. I had a decent glass of wine and my husband had an overpriced martini, that he enjoyed.  Once the rest of the party arrived (my brother) we were seated. There seem to be some confusion at first to who our waiter was and this set the mood for the rest of the evening.  I am a huge fan of Mastro's and Capital Grill, therefore I compare all restaurants to their quailty and service. Donovans just could not meet that burden.   Seared Ahi = ehh. It looked as if it had been sitting out for awhile. When I eat ahi i like to look as fresh as it can, obviously.  Wedge = My husband orderd the wedge. It was the weakest wegde I have ever seen. Honestly, they should be embarassed.  Ribeye = I am not a fan of ribeye, it is too fatty for my taste, however, I hate ordering my own steak because I never finish it so I share with my husband. He is on a ribeye kick at this moment. Anyways, I found it charred, dry, and overly fatty.  Peppercorn filet = My brother ordered this filet and seemed to enjoy it. Though he did note that it was definetly not worth the sticker price,  Mac and Cheese = AWFUL... go to capital grill you will thank me later!  Overall had I not eaten in other steak restuarants maybe Donovan's could fool me. If you are going to spend the money definetly go to Mastros, Capital Grill or even Durants (very cool place)!  In the end it was just ehhh and not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Yeh, we have had better steaks at home! The atmosphere is great & the service is wonderful. We were celebrating our anniversary & the restaurant put rose petals & a card on the table, very nice! The food was just ok, I really think you are paying for the location & name. My husband's steak (bone in NY strip) had no flavor & was supposed to be medium rare...it was more medium with not much flavor. I had the turf n surf for $90... and it was just like any steak & lobster tail I would get at a moderately priced restaurant. They did de-shell the lobster tail table side which was nice. The veggies were ok, baby carrots were under cooked. I ordered a Texas mule (Moscow mule) & they were $15 EACH! The night before I got the same exact drink, in the same exact cup with the same exact vodka for $3 at our neighborhood bar.   So with all that said, we did have a $300 gift card & ended up spending $305 including tip for a 2 person average dinner. I WOULD NOT spend my own money here! It's just too expensive & the food is just ok. Again, service and atmosphere are an A+!"}
{"text":"Great food with attentive service.  Had a delicious peppercorn crusted strip steak with peppercorn sauce on the side.  Bartender recommended a wonderful wine within our budget that complemented the meal.  I noticed the manager was quite attentive to all so I got her name, Kaity Alverson.  Thank you Kaity for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"What a complete disappointment this place was.  We had a client who had heard this was \"the place\" in Scottsdale, and even though I know it is a steak house the waitress was insistent that the Halibut on the menu was \"to die for\" and I unfortunately took the bait...heck, on reflection I wish I had been given bait as the char-broiled brick of halibut they brought out was the worst fish I may have ever had.  Thankfully In-n-Out Burger saved the day for us!  Total waste of $500.00. But by all means go if you are looking to impress your stripper girlfriend like the guy seated next to us, or you are just killing time until Jesus comes to take your hand like the rest of the crowd we saw there."}
{"text":"While I  knew that I wasn't going to get out cheaply,  I wanted to take my beautiful Janet somewhere special for New Year's Eve.   Because I had waited too long to make reservations my options were limited,  and there were no openings at my favorite downtown steak restaurant I took a chance on Donovan's.   My girl had the 8 ounce filet mignon and I had the 10 ounce.  Both were done expertly and were perfect. The rest of the meal -- well everything costs extra other than the one round loaf of bread, the lump of mashed potatoes and the 8 green beans and one carrot that were to serve as vegetables.  Salad?  $12.00.  I'm glad that I just had water,  because any more drinks would no doubt have made the cost of the meal even more daunting.    The atmosphere was wonderful,  the wait staff attentive. Go there for the steak and the ambience,  but expect to pay dearly for those.   $200 out the door with a tip, and I'm sure they thought I was a piker.  I will probably be returning to my primary downtown steakhouse from now on.  My wallet hurts a bit after last night."}
{"text":"As usual,  our service was top notch. John, the manager, stops by to say hello and ensures everyone is well taken care of.  Our main waiters,  Brett and Nick were fantastic. When I'm in the mood for steak,  I typically order the ribeye but last night I thoroughly enjoyed a 24oz rib chop. It was the best I've had and would highly recommend. Ended with a tiramisu which was just perfect. Now this is a well run restaurant that knows how to value its patrons. Can hardly wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place by quite often cuz I'm going to a different Steak House so fine decided try them and I was really impressed number one the service was probably the best I've had quite some time they work in three-man teams and they're quick to get you anything you need drinks or never half empty Baskin refilled those funny I knock my Fork off the table and even before I could ask for no and it was already at my table great service very good at explaining things and what they do and making good suggestions on things that you might want no for the food start off the calamari I didn't particularly like it just something this Bland about it the sauce was pretty good but not crunchy enough or not enough tentacles and then it was just okay now what I do like about the places for the 50 bucks or whatever you spend for the steak it comes with the starch and a vegetable I opted for the ribeye steak and the pain fried potatoes with the peppercorn sauce it was amazing the potatoes if I wasn't so full I would order another one now the stink it was great far as tenderness and seasoning but the wet age their meat instead of dry age which is a little bit different flavor not too sure if I like it or not my son didn't like mine he had the four way which I tried his it was really good but didn't have much sour flavor I would say so I think next time I'll get the filet also have the creme brulee I would skip it didn't like the texture was enough custard it was more like pudding consistency no good for creme brulee I definitely will go back I'll get the filet this time overall will be at 4 but the outstanding service just pushed it over the top that's what you expect for a fine dining restaurant in my opinion cuz you're paying more for the experience in the food at those kind of prices"}
{"text":"When I think of a steak house, this place nails it. Quiet atmosphere, business casual, amazing wait staff and bartenders. The filet was cooked to perfection, and the bacon wrapped scallops were on point. They take reservations via open table, and I recommend doing so as there can be a wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"The salmon and seafood chowder was very good, definitely would recommend. The filet was over cooked. The menu items are a little overpriced for the quality of food. The ambiance and service was great."}
{"text":"Ate with a large party, so only saw limited menu. Steaks were excellentt, had Filet, very tender. Vegetables were slathered in butter, kind of nasty. Caesar's Salad very good, nice tasty anchovies on the side. Cheesecake was good, but not great, crust not thick enough.  Service was very slow, sat with empty wine glass most of the dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service   Very attentive.   The variety of selections were very extensive.   The quality of the beef was as described    A must when in the area.   Great wine selection"}
{"text":"I have been to Donovan's twice now. Both times were for parties. The first time, we had the wine cellar room, which was an unbelievable atmosphere. It was extremely nice to have our own room. The service was exceptional, which was expected at the price we were paying.   My first filet was overcooked, but my second filet was perfectly cooked at my desired medium rare. We had a party of 12 the second time we went and we were once again placed in a private room. The room was not as nice as the wine cellar, but it was still convenient to have our own room. The salad was unique with heart of palms, which I am not a fan of. The bread was warm and delicious. We had a nice Justin red wine that complimented the filet extremely well. The vegetables were cooked perfectly and very tasty. The mashed potatoes also had an amazing texture and taste.   The wait staff was knowledgeable and willing to answer any question we had as well as being personable. You definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was surprised not to see any reviews for Donovan's.  In my opinion, it's the best steakhouse in Arizona.  (One of the top in the country)  It's a very typical steakhouse, just like Morton's, Ruth Chris, etc...  I prefer Donovan's over the others, maybe because the steaks are better or possibly becasues it's not a big chain and I really don't like National chains.    The bone-in 24oz ribeye is outstanding.  Because of the bone, you can get this either medium rare or medium and it's outstanding (usually I just get med rare but they recommended medium and it was excellent as well).  Their hosue chopped salad is top notch as are most of the sides (lyonnaise potatoes, asparagus, etc.)  As far as dessert, I was pretty impressed since most nicer restaurants serve extremely small portions.  We usually order the chocolate brownie with ice cream and fudge and find it nicely sized and very good.  The service at Donovan's is best in class.  Each table gets 2 servers that are their at your beckened call.  Expect to pay around $50-100 per person (depending upon alcohol consumption).  Without drinks, you can usually get away spending about $120-$150 for a couple."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! My husband and I have been here during restaurant week and during normal weeks as well. Their surf & turf is the best. Steak & lobster. How can that go wrong? Superb service & delicious food. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I sometimes have dreams where I am at Donovan's, only to wake up in a sad state knowing that it was all a lie. This place is the place I go to when I want to thank my taste buds for doing their job 24/7!  So far I have been there two times with some friends, and each time I went I felt like it was Thanksgiving all over again: trying to fit just another delicious bite of food before heading home. A doggie bag / box is a disgrace to the food! Both times I have been there I have had the prix fixe menu with the twin steak medallions with blue cheese and port demi-glace. It's amazing! The blue cheese works well with the demi-glace with a mix of sweet and tangy-creamy tastes as the opening gig, followed by the main show of the amazingly tender and slightly bloody steak. This was one of the only places I have been to that cooks the steak rare plus, which provides all the melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a lot less blood that rare sometimes gives.   The soup is always great, the first time I had lobster bisque, second time I had vegetable and hearty chunks of bacon. They always supply you with a fresh loaf of sourdough bread, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside: perfect for sopping up the soup!  As for the dessert, I can't get over how awesome the crème brûlée is! It is about the size of a small football, and around 1.5 inches deep. Simply divine!   Both times I have been to Donovan's the servers worked as a team and introduced themselves as such. We had three people attending to our needs, and everything was brought out speedily including some samples of the sides. Never had such great service, it seems like they weren't competing for tips, leaving a table belonging to another server to hang out and dry just because it wasn't there's. It was very refreshing to know that at all times someone was looking out for you.  Finally, the happy hour here is the best I have ever been to! From 4-8 you can get 7 dollar cocktails and martinis that are very good for the money, although at normal price I would shy away from the drinks. Not only can you get half price drinks, from 4-6 you also can have all the prime rib sandwiches you can eat. Mini sandwiches filled with tender prime rib, dripping with cheese, with grilled onions and mushrooms rounding out this complimentary wonder of the world!   I may have not been to as many higher end steak places as some of my fellow yelpers, but I do suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Obviously if you are coming here you are expecting an exemplary dining experience and top notch steaks. They did not disappoint. My steak was cooked perfectly. My guests steak was slightly overcooked. Not enough to send it back though. Sides were excellent as well. Veggies were cooked perfectly slightly 'al dente'. The au gratin potatoes were great, not too heavy with cheese. Another guest at our table had lobster. It was what lobster should be like. Lobster can be overcooked so easily. This was not. Very tender and sweet. It is cleaned from the shell at the table for you by your server. Nice touch. Our server was very experienced and it showed. Her knowledge of the wine list and wines in general was beyond expectations. This dinner was for my birthday. The sent out a complimentary creme brulee. Which leads me to my one and only complaint. The custard were perfect. The brulee had obviously been done long before serving. It was not the hard candy crust it should have been. One very tiny fault, but a very easy one to remedy. Overall an excellent evening. I give it 4 stars due to desert and quality versus price ratio."}
{"text":"I have eaten at most of the top steakhouses across the country, and this one definitely is in the top 3.  I was in town for my college graduation and my wife picked the place and made a reservation.  When we got there it was a bldg that hasn't been there for long (10 years max).  The valets took the car and we walked in.  The lights were low, very low.  I've been in a lot of \"romantic setting\" restaurants and this was suspiciously dark.  We were seated quickly and had servers at our table immediately.  We ordered our filet mignon's and ate some bread.  Then we got a little bummed out.  The bread plates were very tacky, they had a rendering of the restaurant with the name on them.  We were worried the steaks were going to be crap because of that (tacky) display.  Then the bacon wrapped scallops came and they were wonderful, lots of flavor.  After that, the steaks came quickly.  And I have to say, the filet mignons were perfect, slight buttery flavor and melted in our mouths.  We could have eaten 2 more they were so good.  They were seared perfectly on the outside and perfectly red on the inside.  I have never had a steak taste as perfect.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Oh, and the hostesses are smokin' hot as well."}
{"text":"First time here for NYE dinner. Awful experience. Service was S L O W. We made reservations, arrived on time, but we were seated 20 min later. Drink orders were taken 15 minutes after we were seated. Our entrees were served 1.5 hours after ordering, but they were served cold. We complained to the manager and our server. The manager did a horrible job of apologizing. He was not sympathetic at all. Just telling us lies that our food should be out shortly. If they knew their Kitchen was backed up, they should've told us from the get go.   Also, whoever was letting the food leave the Kitchen cold, should be fired.   The manager did eventually comp our entrees. He also should've comp'ed our entire dinner AND given us vouchers to come back and give them another chance. Our server Joey was very apologetic and sympathetic. The person who was refilling our water and ice teas, did a good job also.  Donovan's is a $$$ restaurant, but Highly over-rated. It is most definitely not a 4-Star restaurant. With a $$$ restaurant, you expect a certain level of food & service...but you're not going to get it here. There are plenty of other reputable steakhouses in the Valley that live up to their rating and provide exceptional service & food: Eddie V's, Steak 44, Any Maestro restaurant, etc.   ATTN Owner of Donovan's, here are a few tips for you: 1. OVER staff on high peak holidays 2. Limit menu to a Prix Fixe dinner only (so you can order enough and not run out of au gratin potatoes) 3. Send the Mgr (who was working NYE) to acquire 4-star restaurant skills - he wasn't cutting it. Someone who is not honest and sympathetic to unhappy customers, should not be in his position.   I hate to say it, but Donovan's was an awful way to end 2017.   Hopefully the owner reads these 1-star reviews and makes the changes needed; otherwise they'll be putting an \"Out of Business\" sign on their door."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star option I would choose that! I can in with a party of 6 for New Year's Eve dinner it took 50 min to get our cold steaks out to our table. After asking they reheated them, I began to eat my baked potato and a large piece of plastic ended up in my mouth, I asked for the manager she very unapologetic and unprofessional her name is Jennifer Smith make sure if she's the manager on duty while yor out  for dinner to leave."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and very attentive service.  Had filet mignon served rare, and it was perfect and tender.  Seafood chowder was also delicious.  Prices are stratospheric, but you get what you pay for.  Would recommend for special occasions, but unless you are a deposed dictator, this isn't an everyday place."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, the food and service at this place are top notch,The atmosphere was old school steakhouse , the service was outstanding and The steaks were very good and cooked perfectly, the seafood was  excellent and our waiter Marc was on top of everything, I will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"In all the years I've lived in the valley I've never tried Donovan's.  I'm so glad they offered a special on Livingsocial because if it wasn't for this who knows when I might have tried them, if ever.  Wonderful, from my martini, wedge salad, king crab legs and bone- in ribeye.  Everything was excellent !  I will visit again and very soon.  I'm already craving one of those martinis and a ribeyes!  Service was also very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Great service.  Our server was fantastic, as were the others on his team helping.  Don't come here in a rush.  My steak took about 30 minutes or more to prepare, and it was still a bit rare, so 5 minutes more for it to come out perfect.  This is definitely good for a special occasion.   I saw some tables with roses spread all over.  I would recommend getting a big steak and sharing it with two people.  One thing I can't wait to return for are the Complimentary Prime Filet Mini Steak Sandwiches during Happy Hour.  What a great deal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Donovan's (Phoenix) on 08/13/2013 for our 13th Anniversary.  Upon arrival, we were greeted nicely and soon seated at our reserved table.  It should be noted that the table was decorated with fresh, red colored rose petals; a nice added touch to accentuate our special evening.    Interestingly, we were seated directly behind the waiter's POS station, therefore making us privy to how their nights were progressing.  This was actually a nice thing. Being as my wife and I were in the business for years, and having owned & operated our own restaurant, it made us feel as if we were \"in-on\" the behind the scenes action.   Our team of wait staff was very professional.  They all worked well together and were attentive, yet unobtrusive.  Our water glasses were never less than half full.  We appreciated how knowledgeable the waitress was about the menu, the history of the restaurant, and also the wine list.    I was going to order a beer (and this is my only complaint about the beverage selection) but was disappointed to find out how Donovan's does not offer beer on tap.  Just a minor suggestion, but there are a few local craft breweries that would make a great fit on the Donovan's (draft) beer menu.  There is nothing like a, poured fresh from the keg, pilsner glass full of ice cold brew!  We ordered appetizers: I had the oysters Rockefeller and my wife had the seared scallops.  Both were cooked perfectly, and we accompanied the starters with a bottle of Prosecco.  The sparkling wine was very nice, with hints of green apple and peaches.  For the entrees:  My wife ordered the rack of lamb with a baked potato & steamed veggies. I in turn, had the petit filet covered with blue cheese, accompanied by shrimp and a side of vegetables. Both dishes were spectacular.  I paired my meal with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, while my wife continued to enjoy the Prosecco.  Additionally, the restaurant did a great job of catering to my wife's gluten and whey allergies.  Unfortunately, while enjoying our meals, the table behind me was occupied by an elderly woman and her much younger male acquaintance.  The complaining coming from the two of them was ceaseless and it made me want to change our table location.  We actually heard her instructing the young man on how to get food comp'd! Their complaints were unwarranted, and the waiter should have said to them, \"Is anything alright?\"    Desserts:  We were presented with an amazingly light and flavorful crème brûlée in celebration of our anniversary.  My wife had decaf coffee and I had a double espresso.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Donovan's to anyone looking for a romantic, fine dining experience, fit for foodies - particularly for those special occasions.   Five stars!"}
{"text":"We enjoy a nice steak dinner frequently. We frequent several of Phoenix's top rated steakhouse  locations.   Tonight we were reminded again that we overlook Donovans far too often. The welcome, greeting, service and food are all superb. With the current thing in steakhouses being so noisy-the calm and quiet of Donovans is a huge welcome.    Each aspect of service and superb hospitality is aligned perfect-right down to the back lit menus.   Every dish of our meal was perfect: scallops, salads, steak and lobster.   Thanks Donovans for keeping classy-so cool!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner and couldn't have had a better experience. Everything tasted amazing and the steaks were cooked perfectly. The service was on point, and everyone was really friendly. We will be back soon- they have a great happy hour menu that I can't wait to try out!"}
{"text":"Used to be a \"VIP\" and frequented 4 or 5 times a week.  Was appreciated, respected and acknowledged, as one would expect.  Today the place is a lost dump.  The same can be said for their San Diego and LaJolla restaurants.  Too many much better run steakhouses to choose from.  If you're in Phoenix, give Durant's or Mastro's City Hall a shot....you won't be disappointed!  If you're in San Diego, definitely try Truluck's....it's fantastic!  Donovan's is a shit hole that's circling the drain."}
{"text":"Donovan's is as good as it gets, in my book. I have been 4 times for celebrations and they treat you with the best service! Friendly, yet top of the line wait staff. The food is original and basic at the same time! Jose is our waiter each year as we request him, and he is fantastic! The free shuttle van comes to Tempe to get us at the hotel and waits until we are done to drop us back off!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place, with pretty good food, but not what I was expecting. Had a Living Social voucher which seemed like a good value, but turned out to be a drop in the bucket.  Compulsory valet is a major turn off, since I had a vehicle damaged in the past by these sort of hacks in the past. Had no issues self-parking by driving around the line and just parking in the back of the lot, but still unwelcome for this reviewer.  Restaurant itself is very nice and clean, but very dated decor and staff uniforms. I guess that's the look and feel they're going for. We had a very strange table, placed right in the middle of the floor right off the hostess podium. Not particularly intimate or inviting, but they were totally booked, so what can you do.  Service was odd. I knew something was afoot when we were asked if this was our first time. Smash cut to a 7 minute run down of how they do this and how they do that. Don't need a briefing, just bring me a drink. I don't get the \"team\" thing. Both guys were attentive enough, perhaps too much, but I don't see how one person couldn't do this job.   Prices on the menu are absurdly high for what amounts to aged Prime-graded corn fed beef you can get at any decent butcher in town. I would expect an aged, grass-fed, Arizona raised steak from The Meat Shop to garner these sort of prices, but not meat that was trucked in from a few states away.   My girlfriend got a Porterhouse, which was cooked to a perfect med-rare as requested. It was pretty good, but not out of this world. I wasn't too inspired by their turf offerings, so I got the tuna. I will say it was one of the greatest pieces of tuna I've ever had. Sushi-grade and then some. Exquisite, I wish I could find a fish monger in town with cuts this incredibly fresh and high quality.   Our voucher barely covered one of our meals/drinks, so I will say be prepared to open your wallet wide. It was a good meal, but not worthy of the price. I loved the tuna, but not enough to make a trip back again."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for what seems like a decade and finally decided to take my mother there for her 81st birthday. We normally go to one of the fancy chain steak houses (at her request), but tonight was special so we decided on something different, so we hopped in my limo and off we went.   The ambience was very nice, and the staff was attentive. I ordered the pre-prohibition manhattan at $15 and it was a superb drink.   No appetizers (mom doesn't eat that much) then we ordered dinner. Myself the $52 8oz fillet and mom the pork chop. After all the talk about USDA 100% choice beef I thought I was in for a real treat, but ordered medium and got medium rare. The edges of the steak were cooked to medium the rest more to the rare side. The GM agreed that the steak wasn't cooked correctly and offered to have it reheated. At $52 I would have thought it would have came- out close to being correct the first time, so I declined the offer and took it home. Needless to say I have $52 steak in my breakfast burrito, which isn't too bad now thats cooked.  The pork chop was good, no complaints there. The bill came and we received the complementary birthday desert, also very good, and a VIP discount of $15 for my drink. Im not sure if the discount was due to the limo or my steak not being cooked the correct way, but I would have gladly paid the $15 for the superb drink and would have rather got the discount off the steak. 6 of one half of dozen of the other I suppose.  Anyhow there are plenty of satisfied patrons of this establishment so take my one off-night for what its worth, but I'll probably stick to my usual \"high end steak house\" selection instead."}
{"text":"We had a living social discount and I was excited to try the steakhouse. I was not impressed with Donavan's. Went to the uncrowded bar and no one served us while we waited for about 15 min. We got sat down to a table that was weirdly in the spotlight. All other tables had that dimmed mood lighting but we were right under a super bright recessed light. Service was slow at first with getting our drinks and they even ran out of the drink that I wanted from the menu. Service did get better towards the end. Food was okay, kind of bland for my taste. We tipped a little over 20% of the full price b/c I think there's a stigma that groupon/living social users do not tip well or for the full price. There are better steakhouses out there like Durrants or Mastro's. Won't be back."}
{"text":"While I understand this is a high class steak house I would expect the waitress to be more friendly. But maybe she doesn't make under minimum wage like other waitressesd Either way you shouldn't act like a stuck up to your patrons it's kind of rude. Also I think the food is pretty overpriced I went here on a date so I didn't pay for it but if I did I wouldn't have come here. I can get a steak just as good at like lonestar or outback"}
{"text":"Very good steak house.  Steaks are high quality and the service was very professional.  Attentive, but not hovering.  Classic menus and atmosphere for this kind of restaurant. No surprises. A solid option, but not a clear favorite compared to other restaurants in this category."}
{"text":"So I had real high hopes for this place.  My cousins were in town and they wanted to go here because they had been to the two other locations in San Diego.  Service was impeccable. Really top notch. Food was really good!  But really for the money I expected it to be phenomenal! I guess you pay for the service.  But should be more about the food.  I am not saying it wasn't good.  It was really good.  I had the peppercorn steak.  Very good steak! I should ordered it medium instead of med rare, but still a good steak.  It was just a forgettable meal, food-wise, hence the three stars with being on the cusp of 4 stars.  5 star service, 3 star food.  So maybe 4 stars but I weight the food more...so 3 stars.  I am glad I was able to experience it.  But don't think I'd want to drop over 100 bucks for dinner if the food doesn't make me want think if I had a last meal, this place would be it."}
{"text":"Came at 10p with the intention of having dinner. On yelp it says opened until 11p. Met by the hostess who says they close at 10p. Sorry. Curt and feigned apathy are not my taste. I was looking for a place to bring my grandmother for her 85th birthday but will reconsider for a more delightful reception from a hostess that genuinely cares about what is advertised. My money will be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"For years my husband and I have been saying we want to try Donovan's but never got around to it until last month. It was our 11 year wedding anniversary and we had made reservations at another upscale restaurant. After asking for an outdoor table on 4 separate occasions, they tried to seat us indoors.  Then told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait for the patio. We decided not to patronize the nameless restaurant but were now left in a jam. It was our anniversary, a Saturday night at 8:00 and we had comedy tickets for 9:30. We called Donovan's on a whim and were immediately delighted by their customer service.  Within 15 minutes they prepared a cozy booth for us and had red rose petals on the table. The waiter was aware of our time crunch and went above and beyond to expedite a delicious meal. My husband had the large filet, cooked perfectly, and augratin potatoes. Just a side note: Donovan's is one of the very few local steakhouses that serves \"Prime\" cuts of meat. And that higher quality makes all the difference! I had an iceberg wedge salad and a side of asparagus. Which were perfect for this super picky eater. Finally, they presented us with a sensational creme brûlée with a candle in it.  Bottom line: Great food, excellent service and attention to detail. They put the other restaurant we were supposed to go to, TO SHAME!"}
{"text":"Great old school steakhouse, great service! We had the living social and that did not affect the way our servers treated us. I got a cheaper bubbly and it was very nice. We started with the mushroom app, it was good, but not great imo. It had a good texture and balsamic, red bell peppers, and goat cheese.   Now the steaks, I got the filet (medium rare) and shrimp scampi with the garlic smashed potatoes, he got a ribeye and at the server's wonderful suggestion charred rare with the au gratin taters. My filet was so tender, the veggies were good nothing special, but it was nice to have some veg, my smashed potatoes were good, I definitely got garlic the first couple bites, but then it faded maybe I got used to it. The au gratin potatoes were good, but not as good as I expected, His ribeye was so flavorful, the charred rare was the way to go, although I find rare too chewy, I like medium rare.   I wish I had ordered the larger filet instead of the scampi because my shrimp were quite over, they were very tough. I only got 2, so we ate them, I didn't mention it.  Our server recommended the oreo pie and we got it even though it wasn't out number one pick. It was good, but got very rich. He though it was too chocolatey so I ate most of it. I would personally pass on it next time."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Donovan's. service was excellent... Our server was Terrance and he clearly is very passionate which came through very clear and made the experience \"enhanced.\" Never had an empty glass of water the entire time either... The attention of the whole staff was super. My special, the surf and turf was perfect. My wife was not as impressed with her seafood scallops but still enjoyed her meal overall.  We will be back, thanks for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing in every way - food, service, atmosphere, and ambience. I had the filet and Australian lobster and it was the best lobster I have ever had. The wine selection was fantastic and the creme brulee was wonderful.  And they offer a free shuttle that dropped us back off at our hotel after dinner - A greatly appreciated service!  I can't say enough good things about our whole experience here. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved! My sister and I dined in the lounge. During happy hour they serve complimentary prime rib and chesse sanwhiches. Delicious! Ken was our sever/bartender. He was funny and knowledgable . Also meticulous with manicuring our table. We will be back to see him.  Our dinner was fantastic. We started hot bread and a wedge salad that was smoothered in bleu cheese dressing and crumbles( I like smoothered ). My sister and I shared a porterhouse with augratin potatoes and snap peas/carrots. Everything was cooked to perfection. We finished with Oreo cookie pie. Wow!  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this steakhouse on my brothers recommendation. It was a good steakhouse but overpriced. The meat was of good quality but the sauces used for their \"Oscar\" style and their skillet potatoes overwhelmed the dish.  The real value of this restaurant was their staff. They were helpful and friendly even though it was almost closing time on a Tuesday night. I recommend that if you do go here get the sauce on the side and add to your taste otherwise it may be all you do taste:-)"}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious.  I don't even think there needs to be anything other than that.   Everything we ordered was amazing, and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my cousin's birthday. The place has a dark décor with very sophisticated waiters dressed well. Since you are at a top notch steak house, you will be dropping some serious dough here. All the steaks are prime and delicious. I was very surprised that a steak house did not have any steak tartar or carpaccio. I was very much in the mood for it that night and felt a little let down. The butternut squash soup was very tasty and full of delicious heavy cream. They also had some amazing oysters, my wife commenting, better than the ones we had in Seattle and Portland. I had the Kansas City Bone in New York strip and ate the entire thing. I was actually pretty amazed how much I piled in that night. I would love to be able to come here at least once a week but I don't think my wallet will be able to afford it. Parking is complimentary valet, you just need to tip at the end."}
{"text":"Wow.  VERY very good!  If you've never been here, definitely plan on doing so.  You'll be attended by the most attentive and professional wait staff I've ever encountered.  Everything here is top-notch.  Your food will be cooked exactly to your specification without fail.  I got the veal chop, my brother and father got the NY, and my son got the salmon.  The salmon was tastier than that of Bluewater Grill, and the steaks were far better than Morton's.  The salads and sides were given the same level of attention that the steaks were.  Yes, everything is a la carte, and this place is pricey.  The portion sizes are very generous, and you'll have trouble leaving room for dessert.  I'm looking forward to another visit on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been craving a steak since March and Its restaurant week. Naturally you should pick the most unaffordable place ever and Georgie S. has brilliant ideas. I make a rez. We arrive 15 minutes late, fashionably, of course. Complimentary Valet is available which is always a star. This place is classy, and full of old men. We receive not one, but two waiters, Ben you're amazing. Spend over 2 hours drinking overpriced wine and eating a $29 three course meal that included a chop salad, filet Mignon with shrimp scampi & crème brûlée - all on a perfectly spotless table because the bus boys don't allow you to even drop a crumb. SCORE, what a deal! All of it was perfect/delicious, except the cream corn which was more like soggy corn bread. Barf. My crème brûlée was heavenly and the caramelized sugar was perfect. We left fully fulfilled, literally, and I liked it a lot, but I probably wont be coming here much outside of restaurant week cause its pret-tay pricey.."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate our 33rd wedding anniversary dining at Donavon's. My brother was generous to give us gift cards for this place. When you drive up, they have valet parking. I was hoping this place would be nice but it was beyond my expectations! Our table had rose pedals sprinkled on it. The service was great, we were pampered throughout the dinner. We ordered fried calamari for an appetizer.......crispy and not greasy. Very good. I had the French Pinot Nois wine, absolutely devine. My filet mignon was delicious, very tender and cooked perfectly. The scallops wrapped in bacon were yummy. Potatoes augraten were the best I have ever had, not mushy, the cheese that was used was flavorful, the dish was stacked into a neat square. The asparagas  salad with roasted red peppers in a balsamic dressing was refreshing. My husband had the prime rib steak which was very good but too fatty for me. He had a potato that had a gravy over it, the potato was sliced and crispy, I would of liked it without the gravy/sauce. The spinach salad with almonds was ok. Bread is served at the start which was good.  We were given cream brule' to share, it was in a bowl that was placed on a platter with Happy Anniversary written on it, with chocolate. Amazing!  I was under the assumption that there was a dress code, but I witnessed folks in shorts, flip flops etc. Be prepared to spend more than a car payment. But overall it is worth it!  A truly fantastic experience. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Donovans.  Exceptional food and excellent service.   We have had the New York steak, ribeye, and the seafood tower...WOW. Love going there for happy hour where we enjoy the steak skewers, calamari, and CEO martinis.    Be sure to see Katy and Ken in the bar - they will take great care of you."}
{"text":"Very high end steak house in town, with great service and ambience. Be prepared for the valet only parking lot, dont want to nick those ferrari's and in the parking lot. As far as the food goes, it was pretty good. It didnt stand out to me, but I did enjoy it. They do have some good options and will custom make you some things if you ask for it. Their home made soups are very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an excellent experience on Valentine's Day. Reservations at 9:15 - we were a few minutes late. Valet parking is a big plus. Service was on point and unobtrusive. I ordered the 14 oz filet with demiglace and blue cheese. Perfectly cooked to medium. Best filet in a long time and worth every dollar. Wife ordered huge Australian lobster tail. OMG - it was the biggest I've ever seen and she said it was the best ever. Ambience is opulent without being stuffy. Definitely an upscale meal. Will be back next chance we get."}
{"text":"Brilliant! Simply divine. Our waiter Jay made the experience an absolutely perfect evening!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself at Donovan's. The atmosphere is really nice and he food was good.  Granted this is my first experience with a fancy steakhouse other than Flemmings. We sat in a room that had some sports memorabilia on the wall which was very classy.  I ordered the filet mignonette with bacon wrapped scallops. I really liked my food.  I wouldn't mind retiring to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"One of the best meals in the Valley of the Sun, maybe the best. We haven't been often but our experiences have been great. (If you don't like red meat or you accept the advice of a professional not to consume red meat you might as well stop reading). It has great steaks. I have had ribeye and Kansas City bone-in cuts. Both were great steaks, cooked perfectly. Wife and one friend had veal chop and both were happy with it.  Meals come with potatoes and there are good choices. We didn't bother with appetizers but all of us had salads. My tomato and onion salad with blue cheese dressing was pretty good. The onion was hot so I didn't finish it.  My wife said the beet salad was ok but she wouldn't get it again. One friend had the chopped salad and said it was great. Fresh carrot and snow pea sides were good but not important to me. I skipped dessert but wife and had a brownie and a friend had an Oreo ice cream sundae and both liked them. The wine list is expensive but I found a very nice Australian Shiraz for $60 which is cheap on the wine list. Everyone loved it.  The martinis are great.  Which brings me to price: it is expensive. I don't flinch when prices are high but this is definitely a \"special occasion\" place.  I like it a lot. Be prepared for \"sticker shock\". It is worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Donovan's for the first time last week with my husband using a Living Social voucher.  I was very excited to have amazing prime beef steak. I was a little disappointed.  We ordered shrimp cocktail which was perfect. They were huge and yummy. My roasted beet salad was very good, but drowning in dressing which I asked for on the side, but the kitchen messed up on that. My husband's wedge salad was very good, but also overloaded on dressing. I ordered my filet med rare, yet only the center core was cooked properly, the outside was medium. I was a little disappointed with that. The broccoli and baby carrots were only slightly cooked, so very very crunchy still. Husband's rib eye was cooked perfectly. Although I have to say, the steaks are blandly seasoned. The cappuccino was perfect.  I want to say that I did bring up the salad mess up to the waiter, and he offered to bring me a new salad right away,  but I declined as I don't like to waste food. As for the steak, I didn't complain because I just couldn't bring myself to waste a whole steak like that.  I wouldn't normally return after this experience,  but this restaurant has a wonderful waiter named Shane, who really tried to make up for my experience.  He loves his job, and was so kind and enthusiastic about Donovan's restaurant that I think I would give this place another try. Donovan's is fortunate to employ a server like Shane. His attitude and service will bring customers back.  Next time I will try the Chilean sea bass or the Halibut! ;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! The decor is \"old traditional steak house\" with the dark woods and low light. The food is fantastic and the steaks will melt in your mouth. We ordered the petite and 10 oz filet mignon. You can choose your starch (i.e. smashed potatoes, au gratin, baked potato etc) and your entree also comes with a fresh vegetable medley. Everything was cooked to perfection. Desserts are $11 regardless of which dessert you order. The apple pie was ok. The apple filling was good but because the pie is served in the same dish as a scoop of ice cream, the crust is mushy. The creme brûlée was perfectly done as was the chocolate mousse cake. Service is impeccable. The wait staff works in a team of 3 and are very attentive. A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to go to relax, meet friends, and have great food.  Really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Don't let the looks from the road fool you.  this place is as swaky of a steakhouse as it gets.  You are paying for the top notch food, service and atmosphere.  They were so accommodating for my request for cremed spiniach and veggies that weren't on the menu.  Had their Ribeye, which was cooked perfectly, the right thickness and great flavor."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I REALLY  wanted to give it  five stars but I just don't feel the whole in my husband's pocket was worth the food we got. The food was good don't get me wrong but definitely not $235 for two people good, and one of us wasn't even drinking! I thought the pork chops were sub par, I asked for med well and it was well done. The lobster tail was nice and sweet though. The ambience is nice, lovely and cozy. I appreciate attentive servers but this was a little much...you have a few different waiters and they come fill your water after a sip is gone, kind of annoying. Bottom line, we probably won't come back unless they knock their prices down a bit. If we want fancy food we will go to Dominicks or Flemings, same quality but way less money!"}
{"text":"Ok food its just way to fancy for me. Anytime i took. A bite of bread there would be a waiter running up to scrape off bread crumbs off table. Lol but other than that it was ok"}
{"text":"I had Filet Mignon as usual and it was not as good as Ruth's Chris or even Sweetwater Traven in VA."}
{"text":"First time here. Extremely sub par and feeling very disappointed. I'm here with a large group for a presentation and have no reason to return.  The appetizers, bread and salad have come and gone and our tables are still littered with menus and many empty, unused wine glasses. The bread was nearly impossible to cut through because it was in the breadwarmer too long. My starter salad was bare: dry, wilted and flavorless. Furthermore, there was condensation on the plate indicating that the salad had been pre-made and stored in a fridge for who knows how long prior to it being served. We've been here two hours and just received our entree ten minutes ago. Sadly the other two large tables have yet to receive their food. I'm almost dreading dessert. Can they mess that up too!?!  Not the fine dining experience I expected. Not returning.  Update: Dessert just arrived and our table is still littered with empty, unused wine glasses and menus. Everyone at our table has dessert except my friend next to me because they forgot to take my dessert order and then gave me hers. Ten minutes later they still haven't brought her her dessert. The even messed up dessert!!!! Furthermore, as our dessert arrived, one of the other tables in our group just received their entrees. I overheard someone just shriek \"They're already getting their dessert and our dinner is just arriving!\" This experience is SO sad!!!"}
{"text":"In case you did not already know it. This place has the best service i have ever had in my entire life. Better than the french room in Dallas or Sparks in NYC.  Last week after an event at the Wrigley mansion i was to go to dinner with friends, but it being after 9pm on a weds night there aren't many options until the leader of the pack dialed Donovan's up and they said come on down and stayed open until 1:30 am serving us in the wine room. I have been here before and had experienced great food and service, but this was beyond compare as i do not know of many restaurants anywhere that would stay open past closing for us \"normal\" people.   The lobster Appetizer was amazing as always and my 10oz Filet Oscar style was cooked to perfection. and that was not even the best part of the evening. My many thanks to the staff for their grace and willingness to serve much past the time they should be there.  If you want to impress then bring your clients / loved ones here and you will rest assured that they had the time of their life."}
{"text":"Dinner has arrived.   Overall it is good but for a high end steak house one should expect more. Service was very average. For example they brought a birthday Desert. Plopped it down and walked away - never asked the other seven people at the table if they wanted anything. Eventually we got coffee - then had to flag down a waiter to get a refill  I'd say the good was good - been there and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food is good but a bit over priced.  Hubs ordered filet medium rare and it was cooked perfectly but at $50 the steak better blow your socks off. Meh... One thing that did blow our socks off were the skillet potatoes! Sweet baby jesus those are good. Skip the mashed potatoes and order the skillet potatoes - you'll be thanking me later.  I had the halibut because I wasn't feeling like steak. The fish was slightly overcooked and the sauce was SUPER salty. I like salt, but this was like eating a spoonful a salt with every bite . Lesson learned....stick with the specialty. If you're in the mood for dessert like we were, order the oreo ice cream pie/cake. MMMMMM huge portion of delicious oreo crusted ice cream cake. You may hate yourself the next day at the gym but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Donovan's is one of those places you would never go to unless you're trying to impress someone, or someone is trying to impress you. In my case, I think it was a little bit of both.  It was a Thursday night, and we were late for our reservation. The parking lot was packed, save for a couple spaces in the back, and I figured we had lost our reservation, however on walking in, it surprised me to see that only a handful of tables were occupied. Where did all those cars in the parking lot come from? I will be eternally grateful to anyone who figures it out. I digress....  My intial experience was not good. On walking in, the manager very kindly asked me to remove my hat (I wear my newsie hat practically all the time, reference profile photo), which I had no problem with. But, after the hostess led us to a booth, and we had sat down, he came over again, and insisted, very politely, and very insincerely, that we sit in another booth, in our best interest. We slid out, walked over to the other booth, and slid back in. Sure, it's a minute detail, but this passive act of disrespect/rudeness really got under my skin. What kind of restaurant tells you (not asks, mind you) to move to a different booth, after you've already been seated?   The restaurant itself is what you would expect when you're paying $50 for a 12oz steak. Polished wood, brass fixtures, overweight, overpaid businessmen (me in 10 years), and old money on double dates (cuuuute).  Beyond my initial experience with the manager, the service itself was excellent and they took good care of us. The calamari was fresh and crisp, the sauteed mushrooms were sauteelicious (did you see what I did there?) and my sliced potatoes with onions and peppercorn gravy were illinnnn. And the steak? The steak was pretty good, but given the venue, not as good as I'd hoped. It further reinforces my belief that the best steaks aren't in the fancy steak/chophouses with suited waiters and over-priced wine - on the contrary, the best steaks are in the shack by the road, the local butcher, or the little house by the railroad track.   Good atmosphere? Yes. Good service? Yes. Good food? Yes. Worth the price and pomp? A resounding no (unless some sort of need to impress is involved as previously mentioned). Honestly, I'd rather be at the Outback across the street drinking cheap beers and boxing kangaroos...that's what happens at Outback, right? It's been a while since my last visit."}
{"text":"I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.  We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments. Low key, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list. Serve bread, bring water, fork on the left, soup spoon above the plate, ask about appetizers, talk about specials, etc., etc. I got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place, and while I *was* wearing a tie that evening, I wasn't expecting a by the book, average service with our $50 meals.  Where to begin? I hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong, but here goes.  - requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive.  - the drinks we ordered took 20+ minutes to arrive. - wifes steak wasn't cooked to order. The waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order, she said yes. It was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it. - we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that didn't actually come out with the meal. - I had to remind the waiter that we didn't get our brussel sprouts - the sautéed brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits, not bacon - I've had way better and for a lot less $$. - the steamed vegetables (a carrot and snow peas by the way) went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies. - option of baked potato, mashed potato, and potato au gratin as your included side, how much potato do you think I eat? - run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system.  My expectations were that I would get an amazingly delicious meal, nice friendly evening, perhaps some live ambiance music, a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder, and service that happened a bit faster. I understand that kitchen problems aren't the fault of the wait staff, but I assumed at the cost of these meals, the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish, and a steak that wasn't butterflied.  If you care to know, yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order, they did comp the brussel sprouts, they did cook the steak a bit longer, the manager came to the table to apologize, and we did receive complimentary desserts. Although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups; not that I was fishing for free stuff. I certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong. I was generally expecting a *nice* place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience.  Donovan's sure knows how to make a special evening, well, not so special."}
{"text":"First class old school done right! Better than Flemmings"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this steakhouse. I am new to the area and I read great reviews on Yelp. Upon arrival it was nice to have a complimentary valet.  We had reservations for Friday night 7:15. So we figured it would be very busy but it was kind of empty which was surprising. The atmosphere was old school steakhouse but sometimes that is a good thing and yes it was a good thing.   We were greeted by the hostess who was very pleasant. I will say the service was outstanding and we haven't even sat down yet. I am a stickler about service and It was definitely a great start to our evening. While ordering drinks I inquired about a certain wine and I was offered a sample of that wine to see if I liked it. That was very nice and it made ordering a new type of wine more enjoyable.   Reviewing the menu I was a little surprised at the prices. My expectations now we're set extremely high. For dinner I ordered Filet and Scallops and my friend ordered Filet and Shrimp. Our food arrived and we both were very surprised. Our Filets were barely bigger than my scallops. The steak was very good and cooked perfectly, the seafood was ok. The service was impeccable.. We had a very pleasant evening but we laughed at the portions. Our side vegetables were green beans, squash and carrots but she should've said carrot  because I only had one carrot and those were cooked perfectly just enough crisp. All in all the food was good but the price for portions were not proportional.     It was a nice experience but not one that I will repeat in the future, it is a little far and super expensive. The best thing about this place is the phenomenal service but that is why a 6 oz steak is $50 and the price is why I didn't give it at 5 star."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 40th anniversary at Donovan's and had a great meal. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. This place is my definite go to place on a Sunday night. Everything on the menu is amazing, very well seasoned and has a gorgeous presentation!"}
{"text":"This place sucks for a PRIME steak house.  The 16 oz Ribeye steak at $51 was horrible.  First they couldnt even cook the steak to the correct temperature ordered !! Come on, you are a steak house for petes sake!!  Then when the steak was taken back to the kitchen to bring up to temperature it was returning to my table within a few minutes.  Come on again!  The only way that steak was brought up to temp was not put back on the grill but Nuked in a Microwave.  The steak then tasted like a bad pot roast that I could have ordered at Dennys.  Poor handling of the situation by management was the topper.  This place doesn't even compare to other Steak houses in the valley.  Sad to say I have had a better steak at Lonestar or Outback.  That's said to say....  Try one of the other 10 steak houses in the area and pass on this one."}
{"text":"We went to Donovan's last night for my wife's Birthday celebration. It's a lovely place, in a sort of \"typical\" Chicago or NY style steak house style. Dark, nice wood, lots of staff to take care of you, and a really nice looking bar. We felt the food was of overall good quality, but we were disappointed in a couple of ways. As customers, we'll get a little pickier when the price goes up. I'm used to Durant's for this kind of food -- it's a bit more reasonable, and always good.   I have an allergy. I told them about it two weeks prior when we made the reservation. They remembered it when they introduced themselves to us -- which was nice. But then, the first thing they put on the table (the bread) they had absolutely no idea what was in it. Our server asked a person in the kitchen who said one thing. Then, the main chef said another thing, and basically I was left on my own. (I risked it and turned out OK). But, for the money, this place should have a book they look at for all ingredients and allergens. Really -- if a McDonalds can do it, they should be able to.  Our filet was served Medium and it was bright red, cherry red, throughout. I feel that's a bit underdone. It tasted very good, however. The side dish we ordered of creamed spinach was very small. I'm used to Steak Houses providing family sized portions when you order side dishes. Our server deserted us throughout the bulk of the meal. She was a delightful person, but she spent more time at the larger tables and never asked us about our steak.  Overall, a pleasant evening but not everything that it could have or should have been. Added on Jan 3, 2015: We had an email from Donovan's, from a manager, who said \"C'mon back and get a couple of free deserts. We want to take care of you,\" and then she never sent the coupon she promised. Later individuals had no idea what we are talking about. Figures!"}
{"text":"I thought Donovan's was fantastic. I had the 10oz Prime Filet because I wanted some leftover for steak and eggs in the morning (which I almost didn't have because I ate so much!). It was cooked perfectly and as tender as it can be. I always add butter to my steak and personally I think most need it but that's just a personal preference. Wouldn't have minded just a tad more seasoning though. The server recommended the au gratin potatoes - and with good reason. They were fabulous.  Again, cooked perfectly with great flavor without the need for enhancement. For me the big disappointment was the wine list by the glass. Yes, they are known for their extensive wine offerings and it really was some great selections. However, there was just the two of us and my husband doesn't drink wine so I just wanted a glass and was disappointed with my options and what I ultimately ended up with. I gave the server credit though as he gave a recommendation for what I was looking for (which was red, dry, full bodied) and the best option wasn't that good and I didn't feel it paired well with my red meat - too fruity. Again, that's just my opinion. Outstanding service. All in all, however, I would try Donovan's again; just wouldn't have wine with my meal."}
{"text":"The food is very good but extraordinarily expensive for what you get.  Everything is al la carte except tap water.  Steaks are very over seasoned so if you like the actual taste of steak, ask for less seasoning.  Had the halibut this time which was excellent, as it should be for $45!!  The restaurant is EXTREMELY dark, more like a 1920's smoking club.  Horribly slow service.  The whole experience is an acquired taste for $$."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday  for Happy hour. This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The prime rib Quesadilla is fantastic,  couldn't  eat it all finished it off today.  Highly recommend this restaurant, can't  go wrong on anything on the menu.  Just wish it was closer to Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"A really great experience at Donovan's last night! From bread to bacon wrapped scallops, prime ribeye to Alaskan king crab, the food is a ten out of ten. It's worth mentioning that the service at Donovan's is a cut above. The staff has always added to the experience and last night was no exception."}
{"text":"I bought an $80 gift cert for $40 a while back and have been dying to use it and finally was able to drag my wife here.  I got the certificate on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) - honestly their coupons are the best thing ever and SOOOO worth it.  No restrictions like on Restaurant.com.  After navigating their clusterfuk of a parking situation (you'll see what I'm taking about if you come from the east side of the street) we valeted the car and headed to the bar.  It is a pretty classy joint and we were the youngest people in there by several decades.  I like that because it means it will be quite and the service is good in a place that caters to an older crowd.  I was correct on both accounts.  Anyway, my wife had a glass of wine and I had an excellent vodka martini with excellent blue cheese olives.  The bartender was fast and friendly.  Anyway, here is what I had:  * Wedge Salad - I listened to my wife and ordered it with thousand island dressing which was stupid because I probably missed out on all the good stuff like chunks of blue cheese and bacon and stuff.  The thing was very very small and not worth it.  Just a tiny wedge of iceberg with some thousand island on it.  I may try it again but the way it is supposed to be served - with blue cheese and all the good stuffs.  * Rib Eye - very good, very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I would order it again.  The veggies and potatoes that came with were also pretty good but also pretty standard stuff.  I split this with my wife and it was more than enough.  She didn't like it because they split it at the table and not in the kitchen but I don't care.  She also doesn't like the rib eye because it is fatty but I love it and think it is great.  * Mac and Cheese - This was just ok as well.  Not as creamy as I would have liked and they use weird little noodles that I'm not really a fan of.  I would not order this again but it was worth a shot.  The service was very good and my diet cokes came very fast and without asking.  I would return again.   PRO TIP:  Get the local dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) gift certificate !!"}
{"text":"Ignore the prices..because the experience is totally worth it. The food, service and ambiance are all wonderful. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In a world of top flight steak houses, Donovan's is remarkable. Fantastic steak, wonderful crab cakes, fresh vegetables and perfect service."}
{"text":"This place has amazing steaks. The service is always great as well. You definitely  get what you pay for in the steak department. However as great as the steaks are this place could improve the salads and sides. I feel this restaurant  could be tops if they match up the quality of the sides to that of the steaks."}
{"text":"Took my Uncle Larry here for his birthday and it was outstanding.  As promised, the steaks were tender and no knife needed.  Larry had the filet and I had the rib eye.  Both were fabulous, but next time I'm going with the filet.  Steaks are not a la carte and actually come with a potato and veg! Don't pass up the au gratin potatoes with gruyere cheese.  To die for.  The wait staff was very attentive, bordering on too much.  Maybe I'm not used to that much attention.  They treated us to a creme brulee in honor of the birthday which was very nice.  The creme brulee was perfection.  The crackle was spot on and the strawberries were the perfect amount of acidity paired with the cream.  This place is pricey but worth it.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Easliy the best steak house in AZ! Its a bit pricey but worth it! My wife and I come here on our anniversary and everytime we come we have a fabulous time! The best tasting steaks delicious fresh veggies! Calm comfortable atmosphere. Friendly customer service. Our favorite steak house!"}
{"text":"Had a work function there last night so the menu was limited.  Service was excellent and discreet during our dinner.  The food however was rather mediocre.  The ceasar salad was uninspiring.  My filet was cooked to medium but lacked flavor--since we were a group I was wondering if they had precooked to rare and then finished them--the mashed potatoes were pretty good--but the vegetable was an undercooked carrot and some snow peas.  Not sure I would be running back anytime soon but willing to give it another go during restaurant week."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for New Year's Eve and the service (specifically Merlin and his manager) was so bad, we had to leave.  To start, we sat at a high top table in the bar to grab a drink while waiting on our table, and waited for over 20 minutes before anyone came up to get our order, which was after we asked to be waited on.  Then after an hour waiting in the bar we were seated at our table.  When our waiter Merlin took our order, we were informed the au gratin potatoes (a fav of ours) were sold out.  Merlin was unapologetic and extremely condescending - we brushed it off and ordered a couple other options instead, trying to make the best of it.  After waiting another 40 minutes, we were finally served our salads.  Then another 40 minutes passes by, the manager stops by asking us how we are doing, and we informed him we were a little disappointed because our meal hadn't been served.  He didn't apologize at all and said it was coming off the fire and would be there shortly.  Another 10 minutes goes by and our food is finally served - cold.  We flag down Merlin to tell him our food is cold and no joke, he walks away while we are in the middle of informing him of this.  At that point, we got up, paid our bill for what we already ate and drank and left.  Management didn't offer an apology or credit for the bad service and food.  We ended up going down the street to Capital Grille where we were seated and waited on instantly.  The food and service was fabulous!  If you want to go out for a special meal, DO NOT go to Donovan's - highly recommend Capital Grille instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the first time Saturday night and we were both very impressed. I had a filet & lobster tail special, and my wife had the filet and scampi. Both meals were excellent. The steaks are USDA Prime, the best you can get, wet aged in house. The wait staff was delightful (especially Jay) and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a top tier steak house: dim lit, dark wood and understated elegance. I really appreciated that the steak dishes come with two sides, unlike the ala carte menus of other high end steak places. I also appreciated the complimentary valet parking and bottled water they bring to the table. We had an $80 Livingsocial coupon (that I bought for $40) that helped take the edge off of the bill. We will be going back to Donovans!"}
{"text":"This was a phenomenal dinner!  The prime rib was melt in your mouth great!  Barely had to cut with knife.  Service was wonderful and the timing was perfect for the group I was with.  We did not feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place, they really do everything right.  From the valet parking to the host staff that greets you, you know you're in for a great time. First time I ever dined here was while vacationing here in 2011. I've been back several times since and it never disappoints. The salads are full portion, the sides are also generous in size and expertly prepared (we had Lyonnais potatoes and Asparagus). The steaks were perfectly cooked and I loved the seer they had on the surface.  Great wine list and the selection of spirits are first rate. A world class establishment all the way around!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Everything was cooked appropriately, as promised. I'd definitely go back to Donovan's. I'd give it 5 stars if I felt that I got great value for what I paid but like most steak houses you have to figure on a big bill even when you go for the smallest steak on the menu."}
{"text":"It's just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix.   It's expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple.  I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good.  Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.  Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for.  Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.  Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.    Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.  I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.    It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought.  Anyway, great experience, great food.  A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef."}
{"text":"If you think Donovan's is just merely a steak house then you are dead wrong.  Order a glass of wine first dish was the Shrimp Cocktail with 4 jumbo shrimp in it, and soon came the calamari.  I thought both dishes were excellent.  I ordered the Filet medium rare with Bacon wrapped scallops, and an Asparagus salad.  I would suggest next time to ask the server about the \"Oscar\" styled sauce on your steak.  The Scallops were fresh and tender, and obviously the steak was brilliant.  My group of coworkers also ordered Mac & Cheese on the side ( it was pretty amazing actually).  And for desert i ordered creme brulee with a cup of coffee.    Over all i had an amazing time there, i would strongly suggest everyone to give it a try :)  (and they do offer transportation with the \"Donovan\" if you live around the area..if its available).    Ohhh and i forgot the Lampchops!! loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Donovans, how can you go wrong.  Had some guests in town and some fantastic steaks paired with some great cabernets.  Really enjoyed my filet and lobster."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service but waaaay overpriced (I'm not cheap or even frugal). With all of the great places to eat in Scottsdale/Phoenix, there's no reason to go back and get ripped off like that. I won't be going back unless someone else is paying for it."}
{"text":"First time to Donovan's. My girlfriend we're excited to see what they had to offer. We started off with the seafood tower, the 10oz Australian lobster tail split in half did not disappoint, the 1LB King crab legs was also fresh and delicious, however the 6 Oysters On the half shell seemed to be dried out (they had been shucked what seems to be hours ahead of time) our waiter Augustine, was extremely attentive and because of the oyster disappointment the chef offered Free dessert.  The steaks,  mine the 20oz NY Bone in which Augustine recommended was freaking amazing and cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the 8oz fillet also cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We all heed the warnings about drinking and driving especially on New Years Eve. I do need to warn folks of another danger that I experienced this past New Years Eve. This would be eating then driving. I took my lovely wife to Donovan's Steak and Chop House to celebrate our anniversary and NYE. I had the wedge salad, filet Oscar style (awesome), lobster tail (best lobster we ever ate), garlic mashed, veggies and chocolate mouse. When we finished they had to get a hand cart to wheel me out to the car because I was so full I could not walk. I then had to drive us home (I was the DD) which was extremely difficult with the buttons popping off my shirt and ricocheting all around the car. At one point I thought we were being shot at because one button caught me in the back of the head after it bounced off the ceiling. It was wild. So be careful when over consuming kids! Oh and of course the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I love Donovan's. I have been coming for years. The filets are my favorite to do Oscar style. The fried potatoes are unlike any other. I've gotten a wide range of soups and salads here. The lobster bisque is probably 1000 calories but delicious. We usually start off with calamari, crab cakes or scallops. I have yet to find an oscar style I like anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to Donovan's for AZ restaurant week. My three course meal started out with lobster bisque as the appetizer. It was extremely tasty with lobster bits. My entree was two 4 oz medallion steaks with crab cake on top. I have to say this is the best steak I've ever tasted, it was savory and melts in my mouth like butter. My last course was a chocolate mousse cake. My date and I had our first bite and felt like we died and went to heaven. I definitely recommend Donovan's to everybody. The atmosphere is amazing, the service is excellent, and the food is heavenly."}
{"text":"Service was great. The décor was masculine and earthy. The place was huge. Everything was presented nicely. The lamb appetizer was well seasoned. I had the oysters Rockefeller. Why doesn't anyone make the classic version anymore. It should be topped with HOLLANDAISE.Not cheese. The only thing that was a miss was dessert. All desserts are outsourced. Get a baker. The chocolate mousse had no chocolate taste."}
{"text":"Visited Donovan's last night for the first time it was our anniversary was not crowded I guess because the Cardinals had a home game last night had reservations but no need the place was not crowded at all. The place was very clean our waitress had a new waiter shadowing her but they were both very professional and outstanding my wife and I both had the T-bone steak hers was well done mine was medium well and both was cooked to perfection. The rest of the meal was outstanding as well. When we made our reservations we let them know that it was our anniversary and when we arrived we had a table reserved and we had a nice little happy anniversary place card surrounded by roses made into the shape of a heart and we both were very very pleased with that, this will definitely not be our last visit to Donovan's. Just my opinion but other than being a little pricey we enjoyed ourselves, but I have been to places that were a lot more expensive. We were both very pleased that we chose Donovan's to have our anniversary dinner and we will return again Donovan's to you and your staff thanks very much enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week because we're cheap and don't like to pay full price and very glad we did.  I must be getting old because there was soft music in the background and even though the restaurant was busy it was relatively quiet and I liked it that way.  My wife and I were probably the youngest patrons in the restaurant by at least 20 years.  The food was awesome.  I ordered the filet rare and it actually came out rare.  It's the easiest way to cook steak but you'd be surprised how many other places mess that up.  I like this place better than City Hall but less than Shula's.  I'd come here again if I were trying to impress some out-of-towners visiting me... if my out-of-towners were over 50 years old."}
{"text":"Service was great! Had the 4oz steak with scampi, mashed potatoes, green beans, carrot, and clam chowder.  Steak was cooked perfect but, like the mashed potatoes the temperature was only warm.  Green beans and scampi had a great flavor.  Guest had Halibut, spinach and sun dried tomatoes. They loved it and said seared to profection.  Desert was cheesecake which was good."}
{"text":"Donovan's was an amazing dinner experience. We had excellent service and all the food and drinks were amazing. It was my first time so I went with a NY Strip, potatoes, and veggies. Next I will probably do some surf n turf. It is definitely a fancy spot and little more on the pricey end but if you have the means I highly recommend everything Donovan's. Wear your stretchy pants."}
{"text":"This place wasn't great, it wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to its cost. I have eaten here multiple times. It's a very traditional steak house. My wife and I went recently on date night. We started with cocktails and salads, they were good, as expected. I for the entree I had the ribeye and brussel sprouts. The ribeye was cooked perfectly but the flavor was noting to get excited over. Seemed like a thin cut too. The brussel sprouts were frankly bad. The bacon pieces on them were very chewy (can bacon go stale?) my wife had a shrimp cocktail which she liked.   Overall it was a decent meal but if I'm gonna spend that kind of money for a steak house I'm much happier at Mastro's or Eddie V's."}
{"text":"I went for resturuant week. I got the filet mijon with blue cheese.... although very tasty, I'd rather have my steak with not too much on it. The quality of the food was very good. Their margaritas are soo delicious, not too sweet and with real lime juice. The creme brulee was also very good.  The atmosphere was very fance, prob not a good place for kids. And the staff was over the top... so helpful and friendly.  I was cold and they offered me a soft, cashmere sweater to wear during my dinner. I felt like royalty. great place!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Steakhouses we've been to: Houstons, Durant's, the Capitol Grill and now Donovan's. Donovan's has the best overall package.   Durant's has a kind of interesting old school atmosphere and decent service but the food is poor. Capitol Grill has a real high end feel to it, great service and the prices to go with it. But their food is mediocre. Especially for the price. Houston's is a steakhouse but not white table cloth and has a different thing going on. But it's always a good meal.   Donovan's is solid white table cloth fine dining steak house all around. Excellent service. Truly excellent. Great wine list (with half bottles!), and the food.... was worth the price! Amazing.   We started with the seafood appetizer. OMG. Lobster, shrimp and oysters with three different sauces to choose from. The steaks were perfect. One of our party had the tuna steak and it also was perfect.   If you're looking for the whole package and wanting the food and experience to be worth the price... Donovans is it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day for our anniversary dinner. Right away we felt very welcomed, our table was decorated with rose petals. The service was amazing they were very quick and the food was amazing. I had the filet mignon and my god no words! Also we got a complimentary desert for our anniversary which was really sweet. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Made our yearly visit to Donovan's and thoroughly enjoyed it as usual.  Split the bone in Kansas City strip steak and it was excellent, charred on the outside and med. rare on the inside , just the way we ordered it. It was so flavorful and easily fed 2 people. It came with choice of potato, we love the skillet fried potatoes the best, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside with yummy peppercorn gravy on the side. It also comes with perfectly cooked fresh assorted vegetables. For dessert we had the brownie and ice cream really enjoyed it. Excellent service always and we will be back next year!"}
{"text":"I really like the dark, comfortable setting.  Can't beat a $7 martini for happy hour, plus complimentary fillet sandwich.  Now mind you the sandwich is french dip style, but never the less still very good.  Have to try dinner next time I'm there!   Cheers"}
{"text":"5 stars on food and Captain Jay!!! Love!!  We celebrated our anniversary dinner tonight and were greeted with Rose petals on the table and a free crème brûlée.  The dinner would not have been complete without  impeccable service from Captain Jay!!!! (Gilles)"}
{"text":"This was one of our many, but unfortunately last, visit to Donovan's. We arrived around 7:00 for 7:45 reservations with many, many empty tables in the restaurant, we were invited to sit at the bar which we did. We ordered our drinks and by the time we got them a nice lady told us our table was ready. We then went to our table and were seated with menus and a wine list, we all had very full drinks so did not have to order. While reading off the specials two people in our party had questions on the lobster tail (market price, different sizes) and our server had to leave the table twice to find out information. We ordered dinner a little while later and I ordered a glass of wine. My wine never came, I finally flagged down our sever to remind him and he stated neither of the \"team servers\" placed the order and he went and got it for me immediately, it was the wrong wine, but I'm not picky so I drank it. After that we had not seen our waiter for a very long time. While waiting for food at one point all 4 of us in our party had empty drinks. At this point my dad finally went and found the manager, Jeffrey, who the two stars in this review are actually for (that & the garlic smashed potatoes) He went and spoke to our server and then came and took our drink orders and brought them out immediately. When our food was finally brought out (by a completely different person that we hadn't seen yet) none of our steaks were cooked to what we had ordered them as, and the skillet fried potatoes were not fully cooked at all, at this point we were so over it and ready to go, we were even celebrating 3 birthdays. At this point Jeffrey was the only one who was tending to us and came back to check on us and examined our steaks and was stunned to see the rawness of them compared to the medium steaks we had ordered. He could not apologize enough and was genuinely sorry for the errors of the night. If you're willing to pay big buck for a nice meal, there's many, many other steakhouses in the valley that I believe to be better, with excellent service. Again, Jeffrey was the only positive part of this experience and was very understanding."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good the service is really incredible, seriously i ate some bread and some crumbs fell on the table and then this guy walks by with some sort of scraper and scraped the crumbs right off the table, i thought that was really cool, but yeah the filet mignon was excellent.. I do recommend this place but you better have a fat wallet :)"}
{"text":"Horrible new happy hour....never again. Where are the steak sandwiches? Lousy deals and poor service.  Babye.Only go to this crappy steakhouse if you have a two for one coupon."}
{"text":"The service was very poor. We waited at our table for over 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Me and my wife both ordered filets and even though the texture and the coking time was good, the steak lacked any flavor. If your looking for an expensive steak house, stick with Fleming's or Ruth Chris's. We won't be back"}
{"text":"AVOID this place like the PLAGUE!! We made reservations for New Years Eve, at 8:15pm, to have a lovely dinner with 9 friends and to celebrate a birthday. All of us wanted to try this place and it was very close to our NYE party. We arrived at 8:10pm and our party was seated at 8:35pm. We sat down and started to look through the LED menus. All of us were in awww on how cool these menus were. LED! Our server didn't come until 15 minutes later to take our drink orders. We ordered drinks and received their bread. The bread was fresh from the oven, warm, crusty outer crust and it was all right. Looking through the menu all their PRIME steaks, no CHOICE cuts here, start off at the $50.00 range, they do have some seafood entrees, and a prixe fix menu. All entrees come with a side of veggies and a potato ordered your way. They were sold out of the potato au gratin. The server took our food order about 20 minutes later. We sat, ate, laughed and then the drama unfolded. A lady gets up from another table and we can here her say we have been waiting an hour and a 1/2 for our food to the server. Oh no! Because we made expensive plans after this and we couldn't be late. We received our salad entrees in about 15 minutes after ordering. Most of us received chopped salad and it was good, nothing special. We ordered more drinks. We waited. We waited. We asked about our meals and was told it was arriving \"in minutes\". And we waited. Our friend who was having her birthday was starting to get upset. She was getting HANGRY. We started to notice people getting up and complaining. Our dinner didn't arrive on our table until 10:20pm, approximately an hour and 10 minutes from ordering. And when the food came the steaks were COLD and the fish was RUBBERY, not flakey, rubbery. Everything was COLD. We saw other tables started to get up and leave. We complained about our meals to the manager and everything was \"comped\" except our drink orders and side salads. This night was AWFUL. It was ruined. None of us ate and we were all \"hangry\". We received our desserts to go and our tickets paid and that took about 20 minutes. The manager came back and said \"I'm sorry!\". We couldn't stop to eat because we almost missed our NYE event. Our service is not up to par at all for $$$$. The food was disgustingly cold. I am not going to pay $52.00 for an 8 ounce filet and it is cold, sorry doesn't cut it! We learned that we are NOT coming back and we hope this gets back to the company."}
{"text":"This location is great, but it has nothing on the La Jolla location where their service and food have been a bit more consistent over the years.  For a good steak, we tend to head to Mastros while in AZ and Donovan's when we're in San Diego."}
{"text":"I attended a fantastic medical conference here and the staff at Donovan's EXCELLENT.  I also enjoyed the rich dark woods of this restaurant.  However, I don't understand how this place is extremely overhyped! I chose the prefix menu of the 8oz filet minion with sides of mashed potatoes and other veggie sides.  Unfortunately, the food overall was Extremely BLAND. My filet was cooked as requested but it had NO flavor, it wasn't seasoned and the mashed potatoes didn't at all seem fresh. The \"chopped salad\" was made with iceberg lettuce, it isn't even a mix green salad. It only consisted of the iceberg and onion with a couple of croutons, NO other vegetables.  I'm completely underwhelmed over this \"steakhouse\"??  The good news is this was a sponsored dinner, but I could not imagine paying for what was served and unsure if I would try it out again.  I hear this place is very popular due to it being on \"Camelback\" and the celebrities dine here, but excuse me...why are they returning if the food just isn't tasty? That's not something that would draw me in anyways with it being celebrity or celebrity-like status.  I had wonderful dinners at a much lower priced steakhouse at the local casino with upscale ambiance and delicious meals at a fraction of the price. Although, I would possibly not think of Donovan's for dinner, I am sure I will return for another medical conference and hopefully a turn around experience to update my below average review.  Unsure what to do with the Donovan gift cards unless they have a sistering restaurant to try out."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Donovan's after hearing good things for quite awhile about it . We had a 530 dinner reservation, complimentary valet parking was nice. The atmosphere inside is very versatile; it's relaxed enough for a business dinner or casual meal but can also be romantic seated in one of the cozy booths. The service really was wonderful. They were friendly, attentive, informative without being pushy. What I really liked was that they included sides in the price of the entree and a lot of higher end steakhouses do not. Food was delicious and it was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Donovan's is a sponsor of the Suns, so after hearing about it for a couple years, decided to give it a try for our anniversary about a month ago.  We were very happy with our experience.  Got there about a half hour early, valeted the car and had a drink at the bar.  When it was time for the reservation, we went up to the hostess stand and they took us to a back booth with our name on nameplate (nice touch!).  I had the bone in NY Strip, wife had the Filet and both pieces of meat were cooked excellent (med-rare) and very tasty.  When we finished, the manager, Jennifer, came over and told us happy anniversary and made sure we were having a great experience. The bill was pricey, but we expected that in going to a nice steakhouse.  All in all, a first class joint!"}
{"text":"Go here every month & their steaks never disappoints esp the filet, bone in if they have it. Bacon wrapped scallops & crab cakes much better than other places. Good wine list too & service up to par with the quality to food. Worth the price"}
{"text":"Service is excellent; ambiance is of an upscale back east steakhouse; definitely somewhere to take clients if you want to impress them.  Nice spirit/wine list - amazing crème brulee, key lime pie and bread .... steaks are wet aged, I prefer dry aged.  Might give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, now this is what I'm talking about!! Great upscale, old school, romantic atmosphere.. attentive friendly service and simple steak house fare prepared very very well. With so many steakhouses in the Phoenix Metro this place truly stands out.   We had this seafood tower that was off the chart delish! Lobster, jumbo shrimp, snow crab claws, crab legs.. oh I was just floating.. haven't had high quality seafood like this in the valley in ages. Also had the Kansas City.. a bone in New York strip weighing in at 20 oz... oh it doesn't get much better then this.. tender, flavorful and beefy! Seasoned only with salt and pepper the flavor just pops right out.  Now this place is pricey but worth every penny in service and quality!"}
{"text":"This place is just alright. The service was good. I just feel like the food could be so much better."}
{"text":"Writing this review after 1 month from my last visit. The ambiance is phenomenal. It is so comfortable and the dark wood just sets the mood. My fiancé and I took my mom for her 65th dinner and Donovan's did not disappoint. I always order fish, even at steak restaurants! Special Chilean sea bass and was exquisite. They both got NY strips and were in heaven. Wine pairing is thoughtful. Loved this place. Very relaxing too. We dined and were not rushed at all and enjoyed each other's company for at least 2 hours. And, of course, they brought my mom whatever birthday dessert she desired. New York cheesecake. All in all, I give this place YUMMM stars!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wasn't expecting this place to be as fancy as it was. The service was amazing and very timely. Definitely on the pricey side but so worth it!! We had their chicken dish, I cant remember what it was called but it had some kind of butter sauce that was to die for!! The dessert was delicious as well! Definitely recommend for any celebratory occasion."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour free steak sandwiches and delicious steaks!"}
{"text":"One extra star for the Bulleit Manhattan. Now, THAT'S what I'm talking about..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Every time we come here we thoroughly enjoy ourselves. The wait staff doesn't put on an act and they are genuinely good servers. The ambiance is calm and quiet, but the restaurant could use a little more of a modern look.  The style in in each room is a little outdated. Typically, we have the filet with sides of mash and a veggie.  They serve these sides to share and are not individual dishes.  The steak is always cooked true to temperature.  Donovan's food is comparable to Flemings for those of you who have eaten there.  Plan on spending a bit of money if you go here, especially if you have a drink or two with your meal.  The creme brûlée is also delicious and very satisfying! Look out for the yearly groupons they have as well because if you have never tried Donovan's it is a great time to go."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our experience at Donovan's. Everyone from the doorman/valet to our waiters/servers (Tina, Tony and Brett) pay special attention to detail and made our Anniversary dinner a special memory.  Although we ordered entirely too much food, my only complaint is that I couldn't finish it all! SERVICE is top notch without being N.PHX/Scottsdale snotty.  Bartender knows how to make a Manhattan and an Old Fashion (huge pluses in my book). FOOD is excellent.  Caesar Salad: Yum!  Shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection (not sure why this is lost on many other restaurants). Do yourself a favor and save room for their creme brûlée. I was so bummed that I had eaten so much, I could honestly only get thru half of it...trust me, I tried to finish!  I'm *still* stuffed (the morning after).  I want to go back and have something small like a salad just so I can dive into that dessert again!  Husband had the cheesecake and cleared his plate. Espresso: excellent, served traditionally - also a huge plus for us. I hope all the people who took advantage of the Groupon type deal (last week), allow themselves to come back and enjoy Donovan's when it's not such a mad-house.  Slow down, take a load off and let this place do what they do.  Great for special occasions. We'll be back.  Thanks, Donovan's!"}
{"text":"This place gets three stars due to the pricing vs quality. The service was excellent but just like all chop houses with these type prices, it should be. I don't feel my steak was of quality that it was priced and the seasoning was off. I'd say if the plates were in the $35 to $45 range, we're looking at 4/4.5. I went in with high expectations and left quit disappointed. It's not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"Great seafood tower and creme brulee.  Oh yeah the steaks are good too.  What I like about this place is that they take the time to learn your name and are attentive without being overly intrusive.  If you have to impress a small business group you can reserve the wine room.  They will work with you to create a special menu and you will leave feeling like a VIP."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary (literally every year we have been married). The service is exceptional and the food quality is top-notch. Furthermore, the happy hour is one of the best in the Valley. In addition to excellent drinks, they offer free prime filet steak sandwiches. I highly recommend this place for celebrations or a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Had dinner with five friends here. Four of us arrived and had a cocktail at the bar. We were seated after a 10 minute wait. Someone came by the table to greet us as soon as we were seated but we weren't sure if he was the waiter or not. He said bread was on the way (but we didn't see it till 20 minutes later) and gave us some menus.  We sat for nearly 10 minutes waiting for our waiter and no one showed up. I also want to note that the restaurant wasn't too busy on a Friday night (perhaps this review will explain why). One of my buddies asked another waiter for our server. The same guy who greeted us came back and said he was our waiter. I am not going to say his name as I don't want our country's unemployment rate to go up. The waiter made excuses on why he didn't come back. Whatever...  One of my buddies who's a wine connoisseur ordered a 2007 Syrah and the waiter brought out a 2008 instead. We politely sent it back. My buddy followed with another 2007 Cabernet and we again received the 2008 instead. How hard is it to update the wine menu? There's a huge difference in wine when it comes to the year. How can a \"famous\" steakhouse have such an oversight on the menus.  All of our appetizers came before we could order the wine. Luckily we were still drinking our house wine and cocktails we ordered from the bar. Just about when we finished our appetizers, we got our bread. Really? What's the point?  We settled on the 2008 Cabernet and had to ask for a decanter. The waiter didn't know what it was and later came back with one.   I ordered the dinner special which was $50 for a soup or salad, follow by a main course and dessert. The soup was a bit salty but acceptable. I got the filet as a main. The meat was ok. Not great. I didn't like the fact that they put sour cream and raspberry sauce on the filet. If it was a good meat, no sauces are necessary. The best part of my meal was the dessert which was a warm bread pudding.   My other three buddies' all ordered steaks a la carte. Of the three steaks, only one was good -- ribeye. For the other steaks which were $40+, I don't think it met our expectations. You can certainly head down the road to Ruth's Chris or Delfrisco for a similar steak. I personally would head back to Tarbell's which is also down the road.  Overall, the meal was so so at best. Not worth the price. The service here was horrendous."}
{"text":"Food: I came here for a sponsored dinner which provided salad, calamari, your choice of entree, lobster tail, and your choice of dessert.   - Standard salad: chopped mixed greens and tomatoes. Nothing fancy. 3/5  - Calamari: the outside was crunchy, the inside was tender. I liked the sauce it came with, too. 4/5   - Pork chop with a cherry glaze with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Okay, so this piece of pork chop was HUGE! It must have been a little more than 2 inches thick and 6 inches wide. AKA too meaty for me, but some of you may like that. It was slightly undercooked as I got closer to the middle. The glaze was lacking in flavor and quantity.  I had a little over a third of it. The mashed potatoes was okay. The asparagus was a little too raw for me. 2/5  - Lobster tail: pre-cut in perfect bite-size pieces. Delicious dipped in melted butter. 4/5  - New York Cheesecake: your standard cheesecake garnished with mint and raspberry. The cheesecake could have been more moist. Every piece I scooped crumbled. 3/5  Service: Fast, friendly, professional. 4/5  Final thoughts: If I ever come back here it would be for another salad and entree. The only things I really enjoyed were the calamari and lobster tail. I was not impressed with them at all."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you want to feel New York Posh.....full-on dark mahogany fancy decor inside. You won't feel like you're in Phoenix. It's reputation as one of the country's best steak houses is well deserved with outstanding cuts of beef and succulent seafood. The prime rib sandwiches during happy hour are a plus as is the complimentary valey parking. But be sure to dress appropriately and bring as much pretense and Biltmore snobbery as you can. After all, you have to play the part....so enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile so we finally decided to give it a try. So let's start out with the positives. The staff was great. We were met with friendly smiles and greetings by everyone we encountered. We were seated right away and our server was right at our table without delay. The atmosphere is beautiful!! The background music is not invasive and the lighting is perfect. This is a great place if you simply want to stare into each other's eyes and have a lovely conversation. We however wanted to eat, lol! Here in lies the problem. First, the bread was not that fresh. It was in that transitional stage where it isn't quite stale but, it's not fresh either. Next, we had the Mac and Cheese appetizer. That is the only thing I can say I enjoyed. My husband ordered the porterhouse, it was tuff and not well seasoned. I ordered the ribeye. This is typically a very flavorful tender cut. Somehow at this establishment it was neither of those things. The manager did offer to remake everything. Again, amazing service! They did remake our meal but, I think it actually came back worse. This round my steak was still not tender, not flavorful and it was not the medium rare that I had ordered. Also, the creamed spinach tasted like they had poured heavy cream on it without cooking it. So, while everything was aesthetically pleasing (our food even looked pretty), I wanted great taste."}
{"text":"You takin' 'em out to impress?  This'll do it.  Really good food, service, atmosphere, ambiance -- and it costs like that too.  But, what do you care?  You're making an impression!  Eric R. wrote, \"This is where you go when you want to feel New York Posh.....full-on dark mahogany fancy decor inside\".  Eric is right!  I see votes that they don't do take- out:  I'll cover that bet, because I believe they'll sell it to yuh, and let you carry it out the door.  Any takers?"}
{"text":"Cranky bar staff and antiquated menu make this a place to skip.    Went to the bar to meet friends for dinner.  Our friends like to use the competing check-in app.  Seems it was offering free drink for first timers.  Ordered my free drink and got a diatribe from the waiter how they would never honor it again.  So much for first impressions.  No wonder they hand out free food for happy hour.     My steak was cooked nicely but the options were minimal.  Mac and cheese in a martini glass - so lame and not very good.  Mashed potatoes that I can get at the neighborhood pub.  My salad was just as uninspiring.  Donovan's calls it classic.  I call it outdated, boring, and bland.  So many better steak houses in town."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!"}
{"text":"LIVING PARASITE IN OUR FOOD - Manager did not care! - PICS INCLUDED  I signed up to yelp just so I could write this single review about Donovan's chop house in Phoenix AZ.  My fiancée and I went out for a night of celebrating.  A $250 meal is not uncommon for us, but usually with that type of price tag comes a certain level of service. Not at Donovan's Chop house in Phoenix.  It started when my fiancée finished her oysters and noticed that something was in the oyster shell that she just ate from. \"Is that moving?\" she said? \"yes, yes it is\" I replied.  Not only was it moving, but it was alive.  Turns out that a 'pea crab' was living inside of the oyster that my fiancée just ate. We looked it up right then and there. According to google pea crabs are parasites that feed off of the oysters food supply. When I showed the server, she was stunned. She told me she would shot h chef. I asked her to show the manager too, and she said \"No, the chef will know what to do\", as if I wanted the thing steamed and served with a side of butter.  Our meal came, and when I asked about the pea crab, neither the expediter nor the bus boy, knew about our situation. It was only after I asked the server about what the chef said that the situation was acknowledged at all.  It was actually a full hour after finding the crab before the manager came over to drop off our check.  She never apologized and never once said that they would make changes and actually look for crabs in their oysters. She approached the entire situation with as much care as a short order cook that put mayonnaise on a burger by mistake.   When I showed her the pics of the creature on my phone, she laughed and said these exact words \"Well, at least you have a fun story to tell\". And she is absolutely correct. I tell everyone the story and it goes something like this:  We went to Donovan's Chop House in Phoenix and found a living parasite inside one of the oysters we just ate.  The manager waited a full hour before coming to our table and laughed off our experience as a \"fun story\".  After being freaked out by finding a living creature in our food, the most she did for us was to knock $12 off of our $250 bill and did the bare minimum to make the situation right.  Great story huh Donovan's?  Here are the pics:  http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201321.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201207.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201303.jpg    The rest of the food was good, but not amazing. The special of the day was a $68 pasta which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Just celebrated my 6 year anniversary with my wife, and decided to celebrate it at Donovan's. The decor was a little dated, but charming. When we arrived, the staff decorated our table with rose petals. Very Nice ( Borat voice )!!! My wife ordered their signature banana rum drink, and was everything as described. Our waiters, Brett and Nick, we're very attentive and gave great advice on menu items. We started out with the calamari. Portion size was more than we bargained for ( not complaining ). I stuffed every last one down. Shortly after my squid struggle, our food came out. I went with the Ribeye and garlic mash. Wife went with filet mignon tip, au gratin potatoes ( Brett recommended ), and bacon wrapped scallops. We ordered a side of bacon mac and cheese. I was beyond full, but gave it thee ole college try. My ribeye was cooked to perfection. The mash was good, but expected a bit more. Wife enjoyed her food. Tore the taters up! Mac and cheese wasn't spectacular :-( Meal came with complimentary Creme Brulee! We had overall great experience! Only downfall would be the prices ( yes, I used their Groupon, struggle is still real ). Saw the reviews citing bad service, but I could only speak good. If you're celebrating a special occasion, or if you got it like that, Donovan's is a place to look into!"}
{"text":"Our family was impressed with their service and food. It has better atmosphere than the pictures we saw."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 20th anniversary dinner at Donovan's . Our server Sarah Backer was amazing! She's was friendly and made us feel very comfortable. Also, very knowledgable in wine and food selections. From the moment we step inside, we were greeted with happy anniversary salutations by all the staff. Our food was phenomenal! They took at picture of us and gave it to us in a little frame. We were served a happy anniversary dessert of crème brûlée with the happy anniversary written in chocolate. All the staff made it a special dinner for my us. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I only went to Donovan's for a manufacturer dinner.  The food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Everything was meat-heavy, which is to be expected of a steak house, but it left something to be desired for someone who eats vegan the majority of the time.  Good meeting space, nice house wine, and an averagely cooked piece of salmon -- no true vegetarian options were presented!  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful and lovely place to go, especially to escape from the summer heat, wind down, relish in the best steaks and sides while being treated like royalty. The wait staff and manager are equally attentive to each costumer to ensure a five star experience! Do not skip out on dessert, the Creme Brûlée, Tiramisu and Double Chocolate brownie are equal contenders for first choice. Ask the manager to recommend a good tawny port to pair with the brownie, the combination is like getting a hug from a teddy bear."}
{"text":"Way over priced and not even close to being worth it.  The servers were way over the top. We were looking for privacy, yet they kept butting in.  I hate it when a waiter, says, \"we\". What are \"we\" celebrating tonight? First off, a server isn't included in my dinner, they are supposed to be friendly and courteous, BUT WE?! If I say we aren't celebrating anything, don't keep asking me the same question, over and over again."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we decided to give Donovan's a try. Yes, you do have to valet your car. (Free valet, but we all know free does not exclude a tip.) I personally like dimly lit restaurants, so the interior was appealing. I prefer booths, but we had made our reservation that same day, so we ended up being seated at a table in the middle of the room. (We were told that all of the booths were reserved.) You probably have to ask for a booth specifically in your reservation when you call ahead.  The service is terrific: a team of several people makes sure you have everything you need at all times. My husband and I both thought our steaks were delicious. He went nuts over the skillet fried potatoes side, and I loved my au gratin potatoes. My husband also ordered the spinach salad, which we both agreed was fresh and tasty. The crème brulée we split was one of the better ones we'd had in awhile. Our only (small) disappointment was that the complimentary bread was very tasteless and bland.   While Donovan's is an expensive night out, I appreciated the fact that the entrees come with a veggie and potato side. So many high-end steakhouses charge extra for that. They also offer a three course prix fixe menu that looks intriguing. I would love to come back, especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Last night was amazing at this delicious steak house. I strongly advise anyone that wants good steak to come here for the prime rib. Definitely once a year type place because of how expensive it is. Which is why i reduced the star level. Service was definitely good enough. The first lady that approached us at our table wasn't a stellar server but the bus boy or whatever he was was amazing. Letting us know about the steaks wines and potatoes and such. calamari was pretty good too.  The bread and butter were amazing as well. I was very surprised that my prime rib was a lot better then  my Bf's filet Mignon(which tasted a little too salty for my  taste and I had been drinking a little bit since it was my birthday and my BF bought me a bottle of champagne, so that takes a lot for me to say that). I did not necessarily care for my bf's scalloped potatoes that are kind of deep fried with caramelized onions and peppercorn gravy.  The garlic mashed were a million times better with the steaks.  My BF's twin brother ordered the chicken for $25 and said it was no where near as good as the steaks we had all ordered except him so which is why when you go to a steak house you must order a steak. BE PREPARED, They are no where near cheap. The cheapest thing you can order is a glass of beer on tap.  Next to that are the appetizers then chicken then assuming the seared ahi but I had come for the steak! might as well since it was my birthday when we went.  The creme brulee was good but I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it because it definitely was not as amazing as some other I've tasted. I am extremely glad our service wasn't terrible or didn't get any living parasites in  my foods because I cannot tell you how upset I would be not to have a manager that cared about that kind of stuff.  I find it so hard to believe that a manager could possibly act that way as if they didn't care about quality service at what people pay there. That kind of worries me for the next time I would like to dine there again.  I guess its a chance of luck or risk but if their steak was as amazing as it was last night I would not mind taking that chance again."}
{"text":"Okay I have to say that I loved this meal. It was one of the better meals that I have had in a long time. We started off with the bacon wrapped scallops. They were on a bed of asparagus with a ginger orange sauce. Very delicious! I had the Fillet Oscar which were two fillet mignon medallions with crabmeat and a hollandaise sauce on top. They were cooked perfectly. It was accompanied by asparagus and potatoes au gratin. I also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts with bacon. They were very good. Don had the 12 ounce New York with the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas. It was cooked perfectly and he ate every last bite. I couldn't pass up dessert of bread pudding and a coffee with Frangelica and Bailey's. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A classic. Celebrated my dad's 70th birthday here in grand style. A perfect selection for the traditional premiere steakhouses. Great lobster and wine too."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant- bright and helpful waitstaff - nice menu. Valet parking. Excellent wine list and a varied menu. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the best service at this place. Boyfriend had the 16 oz ribeye oscar style and me being the vegetarian, had this awesome asparagus salad. Steak was cooked perfectly.  They were very accommodating to what I requested, and they made a veggie like me feel welcome in a steakhouse! If there is one takeaway that you must get out of this review, you must get the Oreo pie for dessert. Thick layers of Oreo crust between vanilla and chocolate ice cream soaking in a sea of chocolate Carmel sauce....OMG to die for! Best dessert I've had in phoenix."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been wanting to try Donovan's for a very long time.  It's taken us 2 yrs to finally give it a try.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Prime Peppercorn Filet 10 oz, $53 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A#Did6OCytPePzwEjhjLBz6A  North Atlantic Salmon, $32 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ#Eq4wjwTn5jyNpL_bFoq_bQ  Skillet Fried Potatoes w/Sautéed Onions & Peppercorn Gravy (comes with the entree) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ#aYlGbe8XrtjZ_iN9QD8BgQ  The joint is upscale and the ambience is pleasurable.  Definitely not a place where you want to take small kids who are loud.  We were very impressed by the traditional, dark wood decor and bronze western themed statues.  It took a while to get our food...much longer than expected.  But it's a fine Steakhouse, these types of things takes a while.  We enjoyed each other's company while we waited, no big deal.  We knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manager came up to apologize for the length of the wait...that made us pay attention.  We also noticed that we hadn't seen our server for a while.  We then noticed that a different server was coming to our table to pour Wine from our bottle...I jokingly said \"hey you must be our new server\"...he had a slight grin and then went away.  Our food finally arrived and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I had the Peppercorn Filet and after the first bite knew it wasn't for me.  There was way too much Peppercorn on it for me.  Normally, I like it but this was a bit much...my bad for ordering it instead of a regular Filet.  See the pic I posted and you'll see how much Pepper was on there.  I was hungry and it was my fault for ordering it, so I ate it.  The Fried Potatoes I ordered for the side dish was ok.  The Wife enjoyed her Salmon a lot.  After we ate dinner, the bus person cleared our table and we sat for a while...where the heck was our server?  I think he might've went AWOL....who knows, but after a while the other server who came by earlier stopped by to check on us.  Normally, if a server goes home sick or takes a long break another server will let you know that they'll be taking care of you...but that never happened here.  Since it was my Wife's birthday, she received a complimentary Creme Brulee...nice touch and she enjoyed it, saved the place from getting rated 2 Stars.  Next time I will try something different.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"My husband said it was the BEST steak he's ever had and he's a world traveler!  It was extraordinary!  The perfect sear, flavor of the meat is wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday last week and this was both of our first time dinning at Donovan's. They have complimentary valet right when you drive in, not sure if it's just on the weekends; we went on a Friday. He made a reservation through Yelp earlier and we were seated right away. Our waiter greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink order. He said there were 3 people that would assist him throughout the night for various things. Then the bread came shortly after and he took our order after telling us about the specials. The hubby ordered a ribeye (medium rare) and I got the filet minion (medium well) and a side order of Mac & Cheese. The hubby loved the ribeye and the scalloped potato he ordered which also came with mixed veggies. I also loved the filet minion with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The Mac & Cheese came shortly after they brought our meal and I forgot all about it while I was devouring my main meal until the hubby pointed it out. Everything was delicious however the price was way too high for the quality. We have been to other steak houses and the steaks were better tasting and a lot cheaper. It was delicious and I guess for a birthday it's okay to spend a little more but I'm fine with just dining at white chocolate grill and paying less than $30.00 for the parmesan crusted filet (my all time favorite). Service was great,  and the dining room was beautifully decorated. Would probably only come back for another special event however not a place to dine at if your not willing to spend over 40+ a steak."}
{"text":"We enjoyed happy hour very much! Yo y was awesome bartender and server. Food was very tasty. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had a business dinner here tonight. We were in a private room that shared an entrance with the wine room. Not particularly \"private\" but not obnoxious either.   I had the Chef's 3 course dinner. Started with a very tasty Caesar. The filet medallions with blue cheese was excellent!!  The disappointment came with dessert. A cheesecake with a sprinkling of strawberry sauce. I had 2 bites & didn't finish it. Not worth the calories.   The waitstaff was excellent. The restaurant was actually quite nice. My colleagues had the salmon (\"excellent\"), filet mignon (\"delicious\"), halibut (\"one of the best\"), and the bread pudding (\"a solid 8!\")."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic! My mom was visiting from out of town and based upon the not so nice review I left on Mother's Day about the Donovan's in La Jolla that manger reached out and offered to make things right at the location in Arizona. We were treated like royalty, this place definitely set the bar as to how customers should be treated when dining out! The manager at the La Jolla location and the manager at the Phoenix location were in communication on how to make this experience for my mom and I a great one and it was evident in the service. From the valet (which was complimentary) to the wait staff, to the busser, everything was top notch. AND I finally got the chop salad I had been thinking about for the past several years. I will definitely be back during happy hour. Thank You Adrian and John for taking the time to make this a great personal experience for my mom and I."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing from the service to the food. Best experience I've ever had. We were celebrating my boyfriends birthday so everyone who greeted us wished him a happy birthday. We received complimentary creme brûlée it was amazing."}
{"text":"Thirteen years ago I visited the Donovan's in La Jolla and I walked away saying that it was the best meal I've ever had.   Since that time I've visited several different high end steak houses across the country and overseas.   And then I revisited Donovan's in Scottsdale again a few days ago and it wasn't as good as I remember. It was better!!  The service was above average. The staff absolutely went out of their way to ensure we had the best possible experience (Sarah, Nick, and Raul were top notch). Bar was a little noisy but it was happy hour so understandable (also it was our choice to sit there).   I had the 10 oz filet with au gratin potatoes, vegetables and we added a side of mac and cheese with bacon (just to check it out). The filet was like butter. There was no fat on it and it was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were great - and it was a large portion, too. Vegetables were so good and crisp that I actually ate the snap peas (and peas are disgusting). Finished with the creme brûlée and a large sigh.   So amazing. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn't change in any way?    Everything about Donovan's was outstanding - from the time we arrived to the time we left, it was nonstop wonderful food, ambiance and service.    We enjoyed:  Crab cake appetizer:  It was more like a crab continent - this thing was big!   Big and full of crab meat goodness, without any filler.  Crab, crab  and more crab.    Spinach salad:  Light blend of spinach, mushrooms, bacon and a tangy dressing - a great transition into the main course  Filet with shrimp scampi:  My filet was prepared a perfect medium rare, and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through.  Entrees come with vegetables (snap peas and carrots - crunchy and flavorful) as well as a choice of potato.  We both chose baked potatoes, which were garnished with all the fixin's tableside.  Yum!  Wine and water glasses never went empty - every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask.  The team made us feel both appreciated and pampered.  I wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detail.  My only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert.  Guess a return visit has to happen soon!"}
{"text":"Really good food, old school professional well-trained service, good drinks, but for gods sake, Donovan's, if you're going to serve such wonderful steaks, maybe you could spring for some decent steak knives?"}
{"text":"Went here for a company party and was very impressed with the food and the service. My absolute favorite thing I ate was the lamb chops. They were amazing, they had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly. The filet is up there with the best I have ever had.   We were treated like royalty by the staff, but they were down to earth as well. I had a fabulous time here and would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great experience, service was excellent!! Table was setup with beautiful birthday and anniversary cards and rose petals. Food was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding Our waiters Brett & Tony were phenomenal  I had the  halibut came with a   lemon and caper beurre blanc  my husband had the 15oz NY Strip  we had the tiramisu for dessert  made in house and had just been added to the menu"}
{"text":"Donovan's steakhouse is one of my favorite places to go to now! As you turn into the lot, you are forced to valet park. It's complimentary. When you walk in, there are dark wood tables and such. All the waiters and bus boys are in suits. My advice for anyone that wants to go here is dress up! Wear a suit or something nice! No tee shirts, flip flops, or shorts! It is highly frowned upon to walk into a restaurant like Donovan's with inappropriate clothing. I had the New York strip 12 oz, seafood chowder (this is to die for), and a fruit bowl. The New York was not something to do die for but it does hit all your taste buds. The chowder was SO good. Get that! The fruit bowl is healthy dessert if you want to start eating better. The service was excellent and I wouldn't ask for better. Dominick's steakhouse and Donovan's are equal in pricing and ambience. Donovan's is quieter while Dominick's is loud. I would definitely come back to this place any day!"}
{"text":"Wish this place was closer to my house the prime rib was the best I have had in a long time and the staff, environment was great. I will be back any time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Decided to treat ourselves and go for dinner on Father's Day.  While my husband and daughters meal came out fine, i had asked for medium and it came out mooing!  My shocked face probably gave my disappointment away and they said they would cook it longer.  That led to being served a filet mignon that was burnt to the max.  It was so bad, i got sick in the restaurant!  I've been to mastros several times and Dominick's.  First experience at Donovan's and from my experience, worst steakhouse in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"At best I give this place 3 stars. Donovan's markets itself as a high end steakhouse. We ordered the surf and turf. I am a frequent filet mignon diner and know a superb filet. My filet was tough and cooked more to medium. There was nothing tasty about the lobster and my food was cold. The meal would be \"okay\" for a 2-3 star restaurant but not for high end. Sorry Donovan's I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance are on point. Everything from the bathroom to the menu's are a great experience and that's what got the 2 stars. However the food is no where near worth it. My steak was mostly fat and gristle I chewed on my first bite for a few minutes (literal) before disposing of it into a napkin (cajun ribeye). I can cut around and search for a few choice morsels if I'm spending $20 on a cheap applebees steak...but for $68 I expect...demand better. My other table mates felt it was ok at best and not worth the $$ we spent. We also had the asparagus (good but not really what we were here for), the rib eye (similar problems to the cajun rib eye although was less severe so possibly I got a bad cut), Salmon (tiny portion but she said it was good and to be expected at upscale places) Salt rubbed baked potato was the best thing we had.  If you read this review and trust it you wont be here, however if for whatever reason you do choose to go bring cash for the mandatory valet. I don't like places that do that, but the guy that was working that night did a great job, sprinted like an Olympic athlete to the lot to bring the car like I was timing him, and opened the doors for me and my date etc."}
{"text":"what a dining experience!!! we had a wonderful dinner with dear friends and right out of the gate the champagne (Henriot) got me ready for a great dinner. I had their signature Filet Mignon and it was cooked to perfection - our friends had seafood and enjoyed it as well very much- if you need recommendations on the wine: their sommelier ROCKS! Great, relaxing ambiente, friendly staff - Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ah! Arizona Restaurant Week! A chance to try restaurants we never have before and get a taste of what they have to offer! My husband and I were excited about going to Donovans; a restaurant we had heard a lot about....great word of mouth!  My husband made the comment that restaurants were going to use this opportunity in one of two ways: Either to look at it as a chance to showcase their best or a chance to make money and serve low cost, sub-par food. Sadly, Donovan's chose the latter.  Our reservation was for 7:15. Upon arrival the place was packed..standing room only at the hostess station! We were told they were 'running behind a bit' and so we elbowed our way to the bar and ordered drinks. In about 15 minutes, the hostess came and found us (OK, that's fine, I don't mind a 15 minute wait for a reservation) She showed us to a small table near the back close to the wait station. OK, fine, not the best seat in the house, but still OK. When we asked for the 'special menu' as we were told to do so by the website, she placed it on the table and handed us the regular menu and wine list. OK, I get it, they would rather have us order off the other menu. Undaunted, we shared the special menu and made our decisions. We both decided to start with the house chop salad: in a word, horrible. Store bagged lettuce, carrots and red cabbage with bland Italian dressing that was in the same league as Wishbone. My entree fared better: the fillet medallions were tasty, but the side of mashed potatoes was bland and just OK....and the 2 baby carrots for veggies was pretty much just plate 'dressing.' However, my husband got a rib eye steak that was a flat as a pancake and just about as juicy. Terrible. For dessert the only real choice was creme brulee (as the other choices were a scoop of ice cream or a scoop of sherbet...come on!) We did see pieces of strawberry cheesecake and some kind of fudge cake on other tables. Why couldn't they just give us a smaller piece of  that?  But even worse than the food was the service. As soon as our waiter discovered we were not going to order an $80 bottle of wine or a $60 seafood appetizer, he disappeared into thin air. At one point we actually had to flag down a busboy to order another round of drinks!  At the end of this debacle, I stopped in the ladies room before heading home....and low and behold...no toilet tissue in ANY of the stalls! Did I discretely whisper this to the hostess upon leaving? Heck no!  She probably wouldn't have cared!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic! We started with the bacon mac & cheese and it was drool worthy! We then got a filet and bone in ribeye, both Oscar style, and was pleasantly surprised to hear they used king crab for their Oscar. The bearnaise sauce was a bit too lemony for me. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"From the moment my friends and I drove up to the restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat.  I feel so welcomed at the restaurant. I was very impressed with the food and the service.  I ordered a ribeye steak and that was the best steak I have had in a very long time.  While the prices are a little steep, you do get what you pay for and I will be back!! I love Donovan's."}
{"text":"I booked our reservation with Donovan's in celebration of our third anniversary together using the Open Table app that is built into their website where I included a brief note that it is our anniversary. When we arrived at the restaurant, we grabbed a drink at the bar (it was happy hour pricing) and then we were shown to our table which was adorned with red rose petals.    Everyone who visited our table that evening congratulated us on our anniversary.    We enjoyed their bacon mac n cheese, their house chop salad, and their rib eye steak.     We were all set to order dessert when our service staff delivered a complimentary Creme Brulee that was simply divine.    All in all the food and the service was excellent. Definitely worth the trip.   Today I received an email thanking us for our visit and again wishing us happy anniversary.  It does not get much better than the total experience that is Donovan's Steak and Chop House."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp when visiting the Phoenix area. It was old school dark woods. Very classy. Excellent staff and food. Free Valet. Wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate with a client. Was not worried about price as long as we got great service/food. Service was good but not over the top. My client ordered the bone in rib-eye and he was not happy with the way it was cooked. Sent it back and he was only slightly more happy. I wanted to do the wow factor here and unfortunately, it did not happen. Food and service were good, but not over the top that at this price level I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Oh Donovan how you woo me with your happy hour!   Try the cucumber cooler it is oh so refreshing. Yummy gin and cucumber muddle then served up with a stick of cucumber love it!  Also the steak sandwiches are oh so delicious dripping with cheese. The stuffed mushrooms make me melt.   I will be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I need to start a date night blog.  I've decided to put myself back out there, I actually enjoy the courtship process and I'm open to all sorts, so I've been enjoying going out.  Boys, don't get the wrong idea.  LOL.   My recent visit to Donovan's was delightful, I found the ambiance to be spectacular, it just felt like a nice place.  The wine was good, they gave us great recommendations based on what we were eating, they even asked if we wanted a recommendation  based on price point, which felt odd but was thoughtful.     The service was on point, they were very attentive to our needs, nary a dirty plate or empty glass without someone addressing it.   Unfortunately, the steaks didn't deliver like I hoped.  I felt there was little difference between these steaks and what you can get elsewhere. I was expecting the flavor to really pop, but it was a bit bland. Maybe needed a little more salt, black pepper, or marbling.  My date said his steak was the same, and we had two different cuts so this negative aspect was consistent.    The average steaks lead to the average score - it is a steak restaurant for heaven's sake.  Not that I paid, but, the price did not seem to correspond with the food experience which we expected, but the date was still successful."}
{"text":"A couple years ago I received a gift card to Donovan's Steak & Chop House. I had never been before and set it aside to save for a special occasion. Well, special occasions came and went and I kind of forgot about the card. Then my wife and I were looking for some place to go for our 20th wedding anniversary last night and we remembered the card and decided to check it out.  It was fantastic! Great atmosphere, great staff, great food. The perfect place for our special dinner. When I made the reservation I mentioned that it was our anniversary and upon arrival they had made a heart out of rose petals on our table and gave us an amazing crème brûlée on the house for dessert. My filet was perfect. I love \"meat\" but get grossed out by a bloody steak and this was the very perfect amount of pink, somehow stayed the perfect temperature thought the meal, and was seasoned or something so that it was as delicious on the outside as it was on the inside if that makes any sense.   We had a gift card but still felt the prices were fair for the quality of food, setting, and service.  The room felt old/traditional but not at all stuffy or too fancy. Most guests were dressed pretty casually but we still felt comfortable and not at all out of place dressed up in a suit and in a dress with heels.   I'm so glad we were introduced to a wonderful place where I'm sure we'll enjoy future special occasions!"}
{"text":"I've waited some time to review. I want so badly to love this joint and I just don't.   When given the option of going to any steakhouse, the best steakhouse in Phoenix, it took us more time to choose than it ever did to eat.   We talked Maestro's, Ocean Club (which, I know, is a Maestro's), Dominic's, Steak 44 (which is Dominic's, which is Maestro's), Durant's {I say again, the very best part of the Durant's is entering through the back door.  It's never the food.  Their food is very ordinary.  What you pay for is the red-flocked wall-papered atmosphere.  And the crabbiest male bartender ever.  Hey, don't work the Super Bowl if you don't want to be there!}  So, push comes to shove, time to eat, we chose Donovan's.  Kind of a mom-and-pop, high-end steak house.  This was on someone else's dime, so we went nuts:  shrimp cocktails, bacon wrapped scallops, chopped salad, 14 oz. Filet Mignon.  It was good.  It was damn good.  But...  I thought there were telltale signs of...I don't know what...the bacon-wrapped scallops were amateurish {see photo}.  Service was not - NOT - top tier.  The word \"tip\" really isn't an acronym for \"to insure promptness\", but it could be and I thought there wasn't a hint of promptness in the service we got.  The bill was $209.60.  For two hundred nine dollars, we can go anywhere.  Much as I hate to say it, feels like a band-wagoner, next time Ocean Club."}
{"text":"The food is good but not earth-shattering for the price. There's better quality food in Phoenix for the same price range. I really enjoyed the ambiance. The service was excellent at the beginning but then sadly fizzled out."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of the high end steak houses in town, I had to try Donovans. For some reason as I frequent City Hall, Ocean Club & Capital Grill, Donovans has always seemed to slip my memory. Now I know why, my experience at Donovans was absolutely TERRIBLE. Seriously 3 out of the four people who ate there said they have had better steaks at Outback and I agree.   Let me start with the reasons why Donovans got 2 stars instead of 1. First, the wait staff captian John delivered impeccable service and should be commended with the way he handled a table who had 3 terrible, flovorless steaks. Second, the 2 bottles of 2005 Silveroak were fantastic, but at 160 a bottle it should be good. Third and the last reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the filet medallions topped blue cheese were absolutely fantastic.  I would never go back to Donovans unless they offered my a free dinner with wine to redeem themselves. I know some of the Yelpers out there might think I'm angeling but we spents oveer $600 on dinner for 4 with 2 bottles of wine. BTW that $600 was after John took off one full Ribeye and half off another entree. I can personally say that my filet was charred, sent it back, came back flavorless and the bacon wrapped scallops were dry and tastless as well.  If you are looking for a excellent high end steak house stick to City Hall, OC, Capital Grill. I would really be impressed if someone from Donovans saw this review and offered to redeem themselves. Reviews can be ammended."}
{"text":"Classic steakhouse, the yelp reviews led me here, and did not disappoint! Got the prix fixe, perfect filling portions. The chef's cut was so rich and juicy! Looked small but packs a big taste."}
{"text":"Great food incredible service what more can I say this place is wonderful a bit pricey but you really get what you pay for I would definitely try this great ambiance too!"}
{"text":"Do you like Mortons or Sullivans? If yes, you are gonna love Donovans. I first ate at their La Jolla CA location. Fell in love with the food, ambience, and exceptional bar scene. I can cook a steak... just not as well as Donovans!"}
{"text":"I've been to Donovan's three times now and each time the food has been good, but nothing spectacular. I like the location and the inside is nicely decorated. The wait staff has been friendly every time I've been as well.   The first time I came with a friend in celebration of his recent promotion. We started with a Caesar Salad and I ordered the mixed grill - a petit filet with shrimp scampi. My friend ordered a filet as well. When my filet came out, it wasn't as well done as I used to like it, so I had to send it back. However, they brought out a delicious orange sorbet for me to enjoy while they cooked my steak. (Very nice!) For dessert, we enjoyed two shots of espresso.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and it was a fun experience.  The second time I brought my husband for his birthday dinner. I started the night with a mojito in the bar while we waited for our table. Arriving at our table, my husband ordered the Giant Shrimp Cocktail. I'm not much for cold shrimp, but my husband liked it. For dinner, my husband the peppercorn filet and I had a small filet. Our meat was good and came out perfectly medium rare. Since it was my husband's birthday, the staff brought out a complimentary crème brulee. This was standard brulee - nothing exotic. I enjoyed my meal, but my husband wasn't too impressed.  The third time I came for work as part of our party planning. Donovan's hosts private parties and once a year has a complimentary tasting for party planners. My company at the time was looking into hosting their party at Donovan's, so I went to try the selection and report back. I enjoyed their Caesar salad, mini steak sandwiches, and cheese/vegetable selections.   Overall, Donovan's is a nice experience and can set a good impression. The food is pretty good, but I've had better steaks at the same or lower price. If you can go during Happy Hour or when they are having a special, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Went with bf on a week night for a nice steak dinner Server said very slow night Ambiance is kind of too stuffy, good ole boys club for me The servers felt fakely attentive, even a bit snotty They have a 3 server system so each one has a particular role I forgot what I asked for, but was told to tell the other server! Very put off by this, not the great service I was expecting An younger server was nicer and chatted with us  We ordered a bottle of wine and both ordered the Steak and Shrimp Food was delicious  Will give it another try when an occasion arises"}
{"text":"The meat was excellent! The sides were horrible. The potatoes au gratin were over cooked as well as the Cream brûlée. They returned the dessert and told us the whole tray was over cooked and took the it off the bill. I was not impressed by the service or the food. Will not return."}
{"text":"Visited during restaurant week and the menu offerings were good. Excellent filet cooked as ordered and very tender. Great atmosphere and very quiet, easy to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat at this restaurant. The seafood tower is outstanding and the rib-eye was to die for! Outstanding service from Sarah. I will keep coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to get a late night salad and everything didn't go quite as expected. A very minor mix up on my order. The bartender Ken, who has been there 13 years has always made sure We are perfectly satisfied did it again. AFTER I paid and was home the manager called me  to apologize and offered to pay for our dinner. They really know how to treat customers. Keep in mind they were in no danger of losing our future business and they know that is the case. We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on a couple of occasions and I was underwhelmed.  The first time I had the chicken, which I found to be a little dry and lacking in flavor and the sides were also a bit bland.  I decided .... Well it is a steakhouse so the next time I had the petite filet and the recommended sides.  The steak was good but not great and the sides really weren't interesting or comforting.  Considering the prices, the fact that there is nothing special about the meat, and the attitude I have a higher expectation that they simply couldn't meet. They really should do a better job with the food and the wine knowledge."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on the last night of a Groupon.  Anyone who uses a Groupon or Living Social on the day it expires knows how horrific that can be: overcrowded restaurants who usually aren't aware of the fact tons of people will be trying to use their things.  Donovan's was prepared I'm happy to say.  We did wait about 15 minutes after our reservation time, but being as how my friend was late it really didn't matter much.  The restaurant was really crowded but our server was attentive and pleasant.  We both ordered filets and they were perfectly cooked and couldve been cut with just a fork.  The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.    The interior is somewhat typical for a steakhouse. Wood interiors and dark atmosphere."}
{"text":"Superb!  Hosted a business dinner for 18.  Sarah Backer-Thank you for making it so easy to plan!  Guests were blown away by ambience, food was stellar, and service impeccable!  Highly recommend for any event!  Steak, chicken, pork chops, seafood, oh my!  You can't go wrong here!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Upscale ambiance, big-band tracks, excellent bar, but this is a steakhouse and mine was dry, flavorless and looked like a cow pie.  --kudos for stocking Dubonnet Rouge, my favorite; though shaken to oblivion, Manhattan was pretty damn good! --absolutely _EXCELLENT_ Ceasar salad. i haven't had it that good in YEARS! was that a hint of a hint of anchovy in the dressing? marvelous! --why the hot-as-cattle-iron main dish plates? you bastards BRANDED my tongue on my first bite into those potatoes! my food KEEPS COOKING on the plate when it's that hot! that's why... --the shrimp scampi was overcooked to \"bullet-hard\", first AND second try; second try they were salt-licks too salty. I AM NOT A COW! --first attempt 6 oz \"100 percent prime beef 100 percent of the time\" (really?, come on) was dry, flavorless and looked like a cow pie on my plate; --second attempt 6 oz filet was juicier, but had horrible overtones of liver. did you think i wouldn't notice, YOU BASTARDS?!  Despite my being a phoenix native, this was my first ever visit to D's. Servers go through the motions, but lack the sense of pride and _genuine_ hospitality befitting a place of this stature. Instead they bumble about, not communicating with each other; their whole rehearsed routine crashing down if you don't \"moo\" exactly when you're prodded.  I am terribly disappointed by the kitchen. \"Second-try\" kitchen retribution is grounds for blacklist. Fire someone!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice for Valentine's day.  I got the strip steak and it was very good, my date got the prime rib which was exactly as she wanted. They were great at cooking the meat to the requested level. They accommodated and even switched out a side for me.  The service overall was pretty good and the waiter was very good with questions. However, it took a while to get water refills and their valet seemed swamped and there was a fairly long line. You would think they would have planned for this on Valentine's day."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times was left expecting more for the price. First time I went was for restaurant week earlier this year. Both ordered the filet mignon and it was amazing. We had both asked when we originally placed our orders for dessert wanted the creme Brule. Right at desert time excited for the creme Brule we are told that they ran out and nite have the choice between the chocolate mousse our cheesecake. I got the cheesecake, don't it as not good. The chocolate desert yummy. They do have good service but o feel it's s waste to have 3 people working a table. Second tube I came here was not impressed and did not leave happy. I brought my mom here for her birthday. She ordered the pork chop and it was absolutely awful, dry and super tough. She sent it back and originally told them she was fine and didn't want anything else. The manager came out and kept asking her are you don't want anything are you sure pushing other items on the menu. Not good service. So finally my mom was like ok I'll take the filet mignon. She thought it was ok, and took the woke steak home minus the one bite she had. She did get a free desert, creme Brule, for her birthday. The bill came and they removed the pork chop $35 but charged for the steak $50. Now I know why they desperately were pushing for her to order a different item so they could charge for something. Then harassed her till she ordered something that she didn't really want.  I took my mom out for a nice birthday dinner and they tried to ruin it. I'll never go back. For the price and small portions their food quality should be excellent. The way the staff handled this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Phone voice:  \"Are we celebrating any special occasion this evening?\"  Me: \"Uh, yeah. We're both still alive and haven't killed one another after all these years.\"  Phone voice:  [cute giggle]  Ok, we'll see you both at seven, byeee.\"  Service, ambiance and food, the entirety of this event was perfection. But the best part, the coup de gras was our server delivering a dessert neither of us had ordered.  Atop this lovely bowl of creme brulee were beautiful, bright red sliced strawberries and a lone candle, shimmering with light against the darkened enclave where we sat.  Puzzled, and before we could indicate we hadn't ordered dessert....  Server: \"We here at Donovan's are totally glad you two are still alive\"   Fun night. Right up to the point where I had to explain why Donovan's staff brought us a free dessert. Thanks Donovan's, I think?"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and looking for a top rated Yelp restaurant for a relaxing and enjoyable dinner.  We had made an early-ish reservation (recommended) and took a Lyft on over. We were greeted warmly at the door and guided to our private \"booth\" which is the owners fav - literally a semi private table with chest high wood paneling on three sides. Very intimate and can see why it's the owner's spot.  The space is somewhat typical of an old world steak house - warm woods, soft lighting - but was decorated tastefully and the dining room arranged for maximum privacy, unlike some NYC spots where you rub elbows with fellow diners.   The menu is also divided into appetizers of land and sea origin, salads including the traditional iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon, and a list of steaks and chops - all 100% prime only - mixed grill and seafood that is flown in fresh daily.  By the end of the meal we had shared some wine and some time talking with the wait staff, the manager and noticed we'd been there more than three hours (and through two bottles of some Italian wine with a-bit of age on it).   We had asked for some time between our appetizer course and our meal - something that is rarely executed and usually begrudgingly - and were told to take our time and give them a 10 minute heads up when we were ready. Truly and genuinely  accommodating.   We had a terrific evening, thoroughly enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the service.   We shared a crab cake (all crab and delicious) with some small and deliciously fresh west coast oysters for starters. My wife had the lamb chop appetizer (see pic) for her main along with a baked potato - it was a full meal! My prime ribeye was perfectly done as was the broccoli side. Dessert was not possible.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Spent Friday night at Donovan's.  We'd been given a gift card and decided to splurge.    The. best. filet. i've. EVER. had.  Tender.  Juicy.  Amazingly flavorful.  Just perfect. The potatoes au gratin was phenomenal.  The mac and cheese with bacon appetizer was delicious (although was better when adding a touch of salt.)  The man had the Kansas City strip and it was moist and yummy. I wish the lady next to us would have had the chance to experience the joy of eating such a quality piece of beef, but she ordered it as a butterflied medium well.  I cringed.  THEN she asked for A-1.  Ew.  Granted, if it's really a GREAT piece of meat, you can order it medium well or well done and it won't taste like shoe leather, but still.  If it's a GREAT piece of meat, then you won't need to.  *stepping down off of soap box* The reason I gave four stars as opposed to five is because of the pace of the meal.  Turns out the server forgot to fire our entrees after our appetizer.  It happens.  I was a server for many years.  We didn't mind; we were there to enjoy the atmosphere and each other's company. It was a bit disheartening seeing the others around us enjoying their dinners even though we'd arrived before they did as a first impression."}
{"text":"Tried the happy hour and was happily surprised! The menu is varied and very generous. We had the poke martini, which was yummy. The hamburger was superb and larger than expected. The cocktails are imaginative and wonderfully satisfying. Robin our waitress couldn't have been better! Great experience! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but I was disappointed with the food, I took my dad and husband here for Father's Day, I have always wanted to try it and the food was mediocre at best, which is sad since our bill for food only was $260 for just dinner, no appetizers or alcoholic beverages. I think this restaurant is more of a status symbol. I gave 3 stars because service was the only thing that was good here  Update: the manager called me today to discuss the review I left and wanted to know what they can do to make it a better experience, I was very impressed with the responsiveness. She offered a gift card to offset the cost of our next meal there so my husband and I will be giving it another shot to see if it was a isolated incident"}
{"text":"We have been here before and the food has been better. We came on valnetines day, which is known for being the worst time to go out to eat. The steaks were not cooked to our liking and had to be sent back. We also wanted to try the mac n cheese on the menue and our server told us not too. Said it was awful and needed to be taken off the menue!"}
{"text":"The best steak I have ever eaten. Service is also very good. This restaurant is very expensive, so don't let that surprise you. All parking is valet. The restaurant is upscale so dress accordingly."}
{"text":"We had a nice romantic dinner while traveling at Donovan's.  We had a beautiful seafood \"tower\" first course, 8 oz. filet entree, Cajun Ribeye, creamed spinach side, corn casserole side, one \"chocolate decadence\" dessert and 2 glasses of pinot noir.  Total bill, including 20% tip was $265.  Service was very attentive, the atmosphere was cozy, and the food was verrry flavorful.  We really enjoyed our evening.    Only downfall was that our 3 servers seemed to step on each other's toes a bit."}
{"text":"Food was good, not so much on the service. 3 servers waiting on us and couldn't get their attention most of the time. For the price, I would much rather go to Ruth's Chris. $100 per person with wine, not really worth it"}
{"text":"Quintessential old time steak house  served classic menu for restaurant week. Always delicious! Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Beautiful place , elegant environment and much more quiet than most of new trendy restaurants in town, you can actually enjoy each other's company and have a conversation. We had huge shrimp for appetizer , steaks were cooked to order and we enjoyed cream brûlée for a dessert. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday and everything was amazing.  Tina and Raul  did a great job from start to finish, the filets were cooked to perfection and just melt in your mouth. The manager stopped by to see if everything was good which was a nice touch. I can't wait to come here again!! Best steak in town!!"}
{"text":"This excellent restaurant was a compromise between the wife and I.  I wanted a traditional wedding, and she would rather just get married in front of a judge.  Considering this was where we went on our first date, I am glad that we were married here.  It has an air of symmetry.    Either way, John Simich, the Sales & Marketing Manager at Donovan's, treated us right.  For the price of food, we used two of their adjoining meeting rooms.  He threw together a special menu with our pre-selected choices on drinks and food.  The ceremony was conducted in the left meeting room.  It was set up with chairs on either side, and there was a nice aisle down the middle for Aggie to walk down.  I was waiting for my (soon-to-be) wife down at the end.  It was as traditional as I wanted it, and it felt great, but it was not lock-stepped with older conventions.    The parents walked down the aisle, our daughter put down the petals, and everyone took their place (except the bride).  Instead of Aggie being walked down the aisle in the traditional fashion,she spoke up to get people's attention by saying \"Can I say something crazy?\" followed by my \"I love crazy!   We then performed  \"Love is an Open Door\" from Disney's Frozen, but it is kind of hard to have an excellent performance when the person that can sing breaks down.  But, it was great.    After the ceremony, we went to the adjoining conference room for dinner.  The cake was on our left.  Aggie and I had our own table at the head of the conference room, and we both had nice giant chairs at our own personal table.  Every one of the tables had a Donovan's Signature Seafood Tower as the center piece, and we had our own personal half-tower as well.    Our choice of salad: Caesar Salad Diced Chop House Salad with Italian Vinaigrette  ---both were great, and there were no complaints.  The other appetizer besides the Seafood tower was Cajun Seared Lamb Chops.  Everyone loved it.  The entree choices (served with garlic smashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day):  8 oz. Prime Filet Mignon  16 oz. Prime Ribeye  Cherry Glazed Pork Chops  North Atlantic Salmon with Maître d' Butter.  Herb Crusted Shelton Chick with Tomato & Caper Sauce  Dessert:  Our wedding cake from Honeymoon Sweets, and Donovan's served it with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream.    It was a great experience, and I am glad that we held it at such a nice area.  Considering the guest took their leftovers, it instantly makes it better than any other wedding I have attended.  Never mind the food being flat out better than anything you can get from caterers.    If you want to get married and you want the first class experience, but you do not want to pay first class prices, I would recommend giving Donovan's a call..."}
{"text":"unbelievably horrid-don't believe the hype-i even threw out my leftovers (in fact,i don't know why i had my leftovers boxed in the first place?) i'm beyond disappointed garbage food from salad to desert"}
{"text":"The ambiance is relaxing, yet refined.   The service is always good. The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum!"}
{"text":"Even though Donovan's has been around for over a decade now I finally made it there last night. My wife and I went to celebrate our anniversary. The entire evening was a great dining experience. Drinks from bartender Ken were great. You can tell he's a pro and enjoys what he does.  For dining, Augustino and Raul were perfect in their service and timing. The food was exceptional. Steak was done exactly as ordered and the flavor plus tenderness were what you'd expect. Sides were amazing as well. My wife had salmon and it to was prepared perfectly. The ambiance is very refined yet comfortable and not stuffy. Jon, the manager was friendly in making sure we were enjoying the evening and wishing us a happy anniversary. For a quality, well served evening out at a fantastic steak & chop house definitely make it to Donovan's!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours around. Steak sandwiches are complimentary. The steak is prepared with grilled onions and mushrooms and cheese. The bread that it is served on is really nice a crispy on the outside. The meat is juicy and tender. Also a tortilla and beef roll up is served.  Perfect with a glass of red wine. I love to go to HH as it gives me an introduction to their food. If it is good then this is the place I want to got for a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Steak is so good....good quality seafood here as well. Its an old school steak house so don't go looking for super modern, you wont find it....old fashioned, great service, quality steakhouse...  Probably a little over priced. If you have tried this place and liked it, check out Durants in Phoenix. Love that place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our wedding anniversary/Valentines Day. It was amazing. Service was outstanding. Food was so good! Was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The staff always made sure we were taken care of. Best dinner I have ever had! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tell you what. I love steakhouses and my family does too. My son got a new suit and my daughter got some really nice dresses for Christmas and this was a great excuse to try Donovan's. Dress up and eat good.   All the parking here is free valet. As we walked in it was fairly dark with dark wood finish. Very nice ambience.   Before I could sit down the waiter took the bottle of water at our table and pour a glass for me (as you can tell I was a little late for dinner). We started off with their hot loaf of bread and it was so good. Nice and warm. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Add the butter and boy was that good.   Anyhow, we started off our meal with the fried calamari. Lightly battered with a tarter sauce. I really enjoyed the calamari. It was so good. Everyone at our table agreed that it was really good. We always order calamari so figuring out the good from the bad is easy for us. Next everyone at our table ordered the seafood chowder but me. My entree that I ordered was so big that I didn't think I could handle it but once everyone ate their chowder they were raving about it. So it got a few bites and man was that good. Lots of seafood at the bottoms of the cup. Got a nice piece of fish. Outstanding.   I ordered the 16oz ribeye with Au Gratin potatoes and it came with sweet peas, carrot, and squash. Ribeye was so good perfectly cooked. So juicy. So tender. Melt in your mouth goodness. One of the best ribeye's I've had. The Au Gratin potatoes was so good too. Not too much cheese. Potatoes were cooked perfectly. Not under cooked at all. Man was that good. Of course the veggies were so good. I would say this was a great meal. This meal was so good I even ate to flower on top of my potatoes. No taste but now I can say I've eaten a flower. Hahaha  My wife had the Sea Bass with bok choy. She gave me a bite and it was so flaky. So moist. Cooked perfectly. Very nice.   My mom and daughter got some special for two people where they get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. So they got the seafood chowder, some type of steak with shrimp scampi, and they got a creme brûlée and New York style cheesecake. They loved it all. I got a taste of their creme brûlée and it was so big. Crispy on the top but nice and creamy inside. I thought it was really good.   Service was outstanding. We had a bottle of water at our table always but if our cups were half way filled then they would make sure our cups were filled. A few of us had iced teas and every time it was empty and new cup of ice was at our table right away. They even kept track of my wife's hot tea and made sure her hot water pot was ok. Cleaned off our dirty dishes and every time someone went to the bathroom they rolled up their napkin on the table.   Speaking about the bathrooms. Nice and clean. Instead of paper towels. They had rolled up white towels to dry your hands. They also had mouth wash with tiny cups for your breath. Wow. Really nice.   So we had a really great meal. Great food. Exceptional service. Nice ambience.  This is a really good steakhouse and really expensive. One of the top steakhouses in my books. Outstanding and of course we'll be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed Valentine's Day dinner here Friday night.  Everything was great from the service to the food.  I also iike that Donovan's doesn't seem to be as loud as other steakhouses.  I have to say that one of the great things about this restaurant is that it is consistent, even on holidays."}
{"text":"Every time I go here it's better then the last. The service is the best in the valley for the moment you drive up to leaving.   Steaks have little to no fat, chicken is cooked to perfection and the desserts are always sweet.   Every trip to here is perfect to the last detail."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years and it's been really good, but over the last couple of years, we've started to see some changes.  We came here for our traditional Christmas Eve dinner and the experience is something I never thought to expect from a high dollar steak house.   I ordered the special \"Surf & Turf\" with an 8 oz filet and a lobster tail. The food came out and it was barely hot, the baked potato came out on its own with the \"baked potato bar toppings\" coming out minutes later as my food got colder.   The last 15 minutes of my meal, we were left alone without and wine or water refills, and we sat at the table for a good 5-10 minutes waiting for our waiter to clean the table.   When I received the bill, I saw the Surf and Turf coming to $95. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but $95 for an 8 oz filet and a single lobster tail, so overpriced.   This will be the last time we will be coming to Donovan's.   If you are looking for a great steakhouse with a memorable experience, go to Steak 44, Durant's, or any of the Mastro's restaurants."}
{"text":"Ambiance was high end steak house. Not as stuffy as Capital Grille, but you knew you were in a nice place.  The wine was good, they gave us great recommendations based on our price point.  The service was good, they were helpful and very attentive.  The steaks dropped the ball though. Absolutely no difference between these steaks and what you can get at a lower end steak house. I was expecting the meat flavor to really pop, but it was a bit bland. Maybe needed a little more salt or black pepper.   My friends steak suffered from lack of flavoring as well.   The average steaks lead to the average score. Nothing else to say about this place because if the amount we paid doesn't correspond to the experience we received. If they drop all steak prices by $10, we may come back. I have better experiences with Hillstone as far as steaks go."}
{"text":"How have I never heard of how amazing Donavan's Steakhouse is?!?!  My husband took me there for a date night and it was perfect.  The food was perfection.  I had the Filet and Lobster.  Best steak I have had in a long time.  My husband had the Ribeye.  Sara, our waitress was very helpful, personable and attentive!  We mentioned that we were celebrating my husbands promotion to VP.  She brought us a celebration dessert on the house.  This is our new special place."}
{"text":"Simply incredible.   Service is top notch as is the menu.   The night I went in it was busy, even early, but the food still came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My steak was slightly undercooked,  but not enough to send back.  Ambiance is upscale even though you can dress fairly casual.  They say biz casual but honestly,  I saw a few people in shorts & Hawaiian shirts   Go figure in a resort town :)"}
{"text":"This upscale steak and chop house invokes a very relaxed, dark wood masculine feel. An ultimate boys club. I have dined at Donovan's in the Gaslamp district, San Diego. Both houses are strictly for the purist who love prime grade and dry-aged cuts.  $7 luxury martini hours include complimentary prime steak sandwiches and sparkling water. The steak sandwiches are tiptop, martini's tasty. Your water glass is filled without a word. My waiter while walking his post never disappeared.  Hot soup d' jour, today carrot crab and a loaf of tangy, Wildflower hard crust bread. 7. First-rate. Sticking with my script, I order the center cut veal chop. 14 ounces of juicy texture with light flavor and nearly two inches tall, skirted with fat.  47. I have au gratin hand layered with gruyere cheese potato's. Seasonal veggies. This meal provides as much pleasure as you could want.  I have been celebrating the end of a great year with exceptional dining experiences and so a toast to friendships and best wishes for everyone."}
{"text":"Overpriced with average food.  $93 market price for a 12oz Australian lobster tail?  I buy these tails from a wholesaler and Donovan's is smoking crack to think it's ok to more than double market price on their menu...or maybe the customers paying that much are the crack smokers?  $23 for the shrimp cocktail (4 shrimp)?    The steaks were tasty and, based on some unseared coloration on a portion of my steak, apparently cooked and held sous vide.  The sides were awful.  The garlic smashed potatoes were absolute garlic bombs (and I love garlic).  The plain and boring au gratin potatoes were just not good.  The asparagus was undercooked and, scarily enough, inconsistent from piece to piece (cooked at different times?).    The ambience is very nice and service seemed great.  That said, this is a restaurant for expense account holders and that's about it.  If you have a sous vide cooker at home and any skill in the kitchen, you'd have a pretty tough time to cook a worse meal for 1/4 the price.  Would not return and cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Donovan's prix fixe menu during AZ Restaurant Week. Sadly, the overall experience was lacking in almost every respect.  * We arrived about five minutes early for our reservation and were told we would \"be sat nearer our reservation time\" - we were eventually sat more than 20 minutes after our reservation time. Whatever happened to \"Sorry, we're running behind\"? 'Sorry' being the keyword here.  * Once seated, our waiter was pointed out to us, but we were never greeted. The gentleman who brought water to our table returned several times to ask if the waiter had been to our table. After about ten minutes, the same gentleman (aka busboy) said he would be taking our orders.  * We were told there would be a choice of four potato preparations, but were not asked to specify. What arrived were some enormous mounds of very sad 'mashed' potatoes- there was at least a quarter of a whole potato on my plate that seemed to escape the masher!  * We both ordered med-rare beef medallions, but the butchering was terrible: my medallions were plump and lovely, my husband's duplicate order looked more like thin cutlets.  * Our actual waiter stopped by the table and introduced himself midway through our entrees, which, by the way, looked like they were plated for a cafeteria.  Complaints aside (and there are a lot, I know!), the beef was delicious, the bartender was friendly and efficient despite the standing room only conditions, and the valet was literally running to make parking smooth and hassle-free.  I left feedback on Opentable.com and, to Donovan's credit, received a polite and prompt response with an offer to make amends."}
{"text":"Oh my. We had the $90 Groupon and still wasn't worth the cost. Absolutely terrible. Creamed spinach was horrible, steak very very salty, Caesar salad was wilted and the waiter knew nothing about the wine. Our attempt to make a nice Father's Day outing and it was good practice for the kids to behave at a \"nice\" restaurant. No children's menu at all. The bread was hard, butter is cold. Pricing is same as Mastros or Steal 44 but everything was closer to an Outback or Longhorn -so do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time for my Birthday.  The service was outstanding!! We started with the bacon wrapped scallops.  Awesome! My husband and I each had the Beef Tenderloin Filet.  Cooked to perfection!   We ended with a Birthday surprise,  Creme Brûlée .  Oh my!!   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We thought for a higher end experience this was barely a mediocre place. Our crab legs and shrimp were very rubbery. My husband had a prefixed menu and his meal was cold. We came to celebrate a friend's birthday and didn't want to make a comment as it was her day. Also a little odd were the very large menus with lights. The light was harsh when reading the meal. I think they must have had an off day as my husband was spilled on twice by the bus boy. I will say the desserts were excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a special occasion, or just any occasion. Tonight in particular we were celebrating my father's retirement.   The staff gives the utmost and superb service and really goes above and beyond to make you feel special.   We started off by ordering the seafood tower, a must have/tradition amongst my family. A large bowl with delicately arranged oysters, lobster, crab legs and topped off with a shrimp cocktail. Served with drawn butter and dipping sauces. Hello, sea-heaven.   For my main entree, I decided on the 6oz filet mignon, Oscar style, and the bacon wrapped scallops. My filet was cooked to perfection, and the \"Oscar style\" added an even more rich, succulent taste. And as for the scallops, bless thee.   The cherry on top? Our server, Shane, gave us a complimentary creme brûlée to congratulate my father on his retirement."}
{"text":"A poor value. Way overpriced for what you get.  There are several steakhouses in the valley equally as good but better priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant is far and away the best steakhouse in Arizona. I frequent Morton's, City Hall, Ruth's Chris, and Capital Grille, and Donovan's beats them all hands down. They actually include the vegetable and starch with the meat, rather than charging $15 each. They even have a complimentary service that picks you up and takes you to the restaurant, which is very useful if you want to enjoy the wine list. The service can be over-bearing at times, but always helpful, and they have 3 servers per table. I like the rib chop, which is basically a ribeye... extremely flavorful. Last time I was in, the 3 of us ran up a $950 ticket, so it can be very expensive, but if you can afford it I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"As a fine dining fellow I was excited that with the wife and kids outta town I could pamper myself. Wonderful service and the food was spot on! Perfectly cooked and flavorful petite filet with lobster tail also cooked to perfection. Immediately aware that your teeth have met a piece of Prime. Many lobster can be over-cooked any chewy, not this one. I had them de-shell it for me as it should be in a nice place and ate it and the steak with au gratin potatoes over the course of an hour.  The only downer was the groupon/living social grazers coming in without any etiquette and not even knowing to turn their phone to silent/vibrate. I had to look at them and say aloud \"Honestly?\" and they seemed to get the hint. Enjoyed the rest of my $106 meal!   Worth the money and great dining, just ensure the coupon cutters aren't there that night!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area. It will cost you, but well worth every penny.  I attended a company function here awhile back. All I can remember is that I was very impressed with everything - the location, the decor, the menu, the service and of course the amazing food.  I suggest saving this for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Donovan's for her birthday and was really looking forward to one of the better steakhouses in Phoenix. The restaurant has that dark old school steakhouse ambiance that I love. We had a reservation, which I would recommend, and were seated right away.   We ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer (bacon wrapped scallops). True to form for a good steakhouse my martini was perfect with blue cheese olives. The scallops were huge with the crispy bacon and I believe fried spinach. Delicious! The start of our night was awesome. The wait staff gave us all the time we wanted to order our entrees.   We ordered our entrees and by this time my martini was gone. I was kinda surprised they didn't ask if I wanted another one. Needless to say I would have if they asked, but I didn't order one. I ordered the peppercorn filet and my girlfriend ordered the petite filet. Mine was perfect, but I was a little shocked by my girlfriends. The cut of filet was somewhat hacked and the temp medium rare was definitely medium+. We had to send it back because it was way too chewy. The staff had no problem getting her another one. The second filet was night and day to the first. I understand that mistakes happen, but this one was way too obvious. Should have been caught at the pass.   We were really let down by Donovan's. I guess when you go to a nice place you expect perfection. She only had a couple bites of her new filet (which was really good), but she had filled up on my filet and bread. The filet issue and attention to detail with our drinks was just not what we were expecting with a high end restaurant like Donovan's. Still searching for our Gibson's steakhouse in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Started with HH .  They serve french dip sandwiches gratis for HH patrons which is awesome !  Steaks were cooked to perfection . We had a peppercorn sauce which I didn't use much of cause the meat quality was top notch."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I have ever had and amazing service! Definitely a great place to go for a anniversary or special occasion"}
{"text":"I have to agree with my wife's assessment that the food and service at this place are top notch. It is the quintessential old-school steakhouse, with all of the details like dim lights, white table cloths, and a team of people ready to help you select your meal.   I really like the team approach that some restaurants have adopted -- it means that you're not stuck waiting to get some more water, or your food isn't sitting in the kitchen while that group of 10 next to you tries to decide what appetizers to order.  Our team included Sarah and Todd, and they took great care of us.  I have been to many steakhouses, and have paid way too much for slabs of meat, only to walk away with that, \"well, it was good, but, WOW, that cost a lot for what it was,\" feeling. Make no mistake, you WILL pay a lot here. Even without drinks. But, my experience was that the food was absolutely worth the money. I had a \"small\" peppercorn filet, which came with a light pepper crust and a fantastic peppercorn sauce on the side. Neither the sauce nor the crust took away from the flavor of the meat. The sauce on the side is a good idea because you don't want to be hiding the flavor of that prime cut of beef! The steak had a beautiful crusty brown exterior and a nice warm pink center. Mine was cooked perfectly.  The meat came with a side of vegetables and a potato selection. I had the potato side with the same peppercorn sauce that came with my meat. It was a good choice. I don't think the steak cost any more than the other fancy steak places in the area, and may be a little less since it includes the sides.   The spinach salad we split as an appetizer was good and the crème brûlée we split for dessert was excellent. The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the bread. It was fine, but nothing spectacular. I wasn't there for the bread, though, so it wasn't that much of a problem.   For us, this is a new special occasion place for sure."}

{"text":"I dined at Donovan's-Phoenix on Camelback on the evening of Wednesday, September 30th. The food was adequate, the service was fine, but I must make a note of your management.   I am unsure if you are aware, but when a vehicle arrives at Donovan's, you are essentially forced to valet. As such, I did valet my vehicle assuming it would be safe. Unfortunately, while I was dining, my vehicle was hit by another vehicle while parked in your valet. Per the valet attendant, a second vehicle backed into my vehicle. While I understand that accidents happen, it is the subsequent events which I find incredulous.  First, for some reason, no member of your staff or management felt it necessary to notify me of the accident when it occurred. I find this especially odd given that the individual driving the vehicle that hit my car may have been drinking. I had heard various rationales behind this. One explanation the valet told me was that he spoke to the management, and they said not to interrupt my dinner. He told me it was Donovan's policy to simply take the assailant's information for reference. If this is indeed your policy, I strongly suggest you change it. If it is not your policy, I would strongly recommend education of your staff.  The second explanation offered by your management was that they were under the impression that all parties had left the premises. Clearly, this means your management has no idea or concern for your patrons as they did not realize I was sitting in the building for at least an hour. In addition, I would hope that a member of the management would step outside to ensure everyone's safety and well-being following an accident on your property. As you can imagine, neither of these explanations make any sense and illustrate a complete lack of logic in your staff and an embarrassment to the Donovan's brand.  Second, in addition to being incompetent, the management staff was extremely rude. Per the valet, the entire incident was supposed to be recorded on your video cameras outside. I asked for a copy of the incident and for some reason the management could not load it. Instead, they said they needed IT to look into it. When I asked them to call IT immediately, they acted as though they were doing me a favor. One manager, Hank Rios, was fairly respectful and seemed to be somewhat understanding. But your general manager, Kaity Alverson, actually raised her voice with me and was extremely unprofessional. And instead of coming in the next morning to ensure this was taken care of, she said she would be in at 1 PM to look into it. She even had the audacity to say that this was not Donovan's responsibility, and that I did not have to use the valet if I did not want to. After I did explain that did not make any sense, she said that Donovan's had insurance for this and they would possibly take care of it. I do not know if she is new or if she has never dealt with such a situation, but I hope this is not the level of courtesy that you expect from your management. I am not in the restaurant business, but if a member of my staff acted in such a manner, he or she would be fired or at least demoted until he or she received additional training.  Regardless, she did say she would call me the next morning once she had heard from IT. Not surprisingly, she did not call. I called the restaurant around 2 PM and a woman named Patty answered. When I asked to speak to Ms. Alverson, she said that Ms. Alverson would call me back. I will say that Patty was fairly pleasant on the phone, but again, why your general manager would not answer the phone call of a patron who had an accident in your parking lot continues to baffle me. I never received a call back and subsequently called the restaurant back at 6 PM. Ms. Alverson did answer but was terse, had a uncooperative attitude, and offered no apology for her actions yesterday nor sympathy for the events that occurred on your property. Since the event five days ago, I have received no additional information from Donovan's or their staff.  Again, I do not work in the restaurant industry, but I assume it can be very strenuous to be the general manager of a steakhouse. That being said, there is a level of responsibility and courtesy that must be maintained regardless of whether you work at a fast food restaurant or a Michelin star restaurant that was nowhere close to being achieved here. I obviously will not be returning to Donovan's except for any necessary insurance or legal matters, but I hope that some change will come to your business to prevent situations like mine from recurring."}
{"text":"I took my gf for valentine day and the whole experience was bad. We started with appetizer and then we order I make sure to tell the server that I can't see any pink in my steak so he order well done my gf order hers mediam well and when they brought our food I notice my steak right away it was way to soft so I call the waiter and they said they were sorry so they took it back . My gf kept eating hers and I told her to stop eating cause her was like rare an it can be her plate was cover in blood . I mean if I'm paying for a 70 dollar steak no matter if it's well done the cook have to know the difference . There is a huge difference between rare and well done like you see in the picture . So they took her piece of steak back . They brough mine back and like 10 min later they brought her Steak back in a little plate . They they notice the took her big plate and didn't have a plate to put her steak so I told them to just put it in my plate . They said no that they were going to put veg and mash to make it look better . I mean if you paying 70 dollars for a steak it has to be right and I'm pretty sure they make money on it to remake a new steak cause I been sick with the flu and I mean for my understanding it's a health thing not to take back foot once already eaten by someone sick so I don't know how they recook it with out contaminating the kitchen I work on a restaurant and we can take back food once eaten. So my valentine day nice dinner was a fail. I got a complementary dessert that was 11 dollars so I guess I pay 70 dollars for a steak and 11 dollars free lol. My bill was 175 dollars I tip 40 and tip 20 to valet to 235 was my terrible valentine day experience ."}
{"text":"Everything about our evening was wonderful.  Let me start by saying that I've been to a number of steakhouses in my lifetime. I've been to the chains (Morton's, Ruth's Chris, El Gaucho) and I've been to the local spots. What separates this place from the others is the service. Many of the chain restaurants (or any establishment that calls themselves \"fine dining\" typically train the servers to drool all over you. In other words, they fawn and fuss and hover and dote. Not at Donovan's. The servers were attentive, there when you needed them, and appropriately helpful. They stayed in the background most of the time but were quite probably reading body language from across the room, so that the moment you were perceived to need something, they appeared.  I had a glass of cabernet from Paso Robles that paired beautifully with my 10 oz. filet mignon. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking. My server made sure I had the same expectation of \"medium\" as the restaurant did. It came out just right. my only complaint about my entree was that the potatoes au gratin was too tiny. I wanted more! Heck, I coulda eaten a whole tray of it! It was the best I've ever had. Creamy, soft potatoes inside, and a nice crispy, salty/cheesy layer on top.  My dining companion ordered the crab cake appetizer for her entree. It was good. There were huge chunks of crab and it was pan fried, not deep fried. Thank goodness.  The Brussels Sprouts side dish was good -- the perfect amount of crunch to softness ratio. I could even taste the natural flavor of the vegetable -- it was oiled and seasoned with bacon bits, but the Brussels Sprouts still maintained their flavor. They were fresh.  The coffee was STRONG. I'd give 5 stars for that! :)  And finally, for desert we ordered their house-made oreo ice cream cake. It was good but way too much oreo. Next time I'd go for the chocolate mousse or creme brulee.  Overall, this was a really lovely meal. Great service, top notch steak, and a relaxing vibe. They do have valet. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm making a reservation."}
{"text":"Had a work function here last night, it was a great venue for a meeting of  about 30 people. Set menu was awesome, the filet was seriously one of the best I've had since moving to Scottsdale! Service was awesome, seems like everybody had a good time, I'll be back on date night!"}
{"text":"Have tried many steak houses around the country. Nothing compares to this place . From time you walk in and get greeted to seating at your table . Everyone is treated to royalty .  This is not place to be seen at the hip hot steak house , this is old school take your time and get treated like you should . Please order the Kansas City! it's not on the menu , but they got that for you ! 20 oz Bone-In New York will make you fall in love again ."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant.  Very consistent and an ambiance and decor that makes you feel you are somewhere special.  Lots of good steak houses in the valley, but the combination of the food, service and atmosphere just can't be beat."}
{"text":"I wish I had more space to comment so in brief; I called the Restaurant 3 different days to discuss my upcoming anniversary. Each time the phone just rings until you must leave a message. On my 3rd attempt, I did leave a message requesting the Mgr to call me back. The next day I did hear from an associate who told me the Mgr would call me later that same day when he arrives. That return call never came. The food service was very slow, had to wait approx 15 min between courses, which is probably why we were seated 25 min late for a 7pm RSVP. The food was merely average, employees were polite and formal but had zero personality like working with robots. For a $282 dinner for 2, I don't see Donovan's as an establishment that I could recommend.  All areas of opportunity seem to revolve around the Restaurant's people/employees and there performance and execution or lack there of. This change in culture and performance must of course begin from the top with the Restaurant Manager who himself, fails to display a commitment to customer service and a fine dining experience. Your Restaurant is a good example that just because the meal is expensive, doesn't guarantee that the food and service will match. I no longer consider Donovan's as a premiere dining destination."}
{"text":"If you're going to splurge on a nice meal I recommend not spending your hard earned dollars on this place. The best part about this restaurant is the ambiance and the service. My wife and I ordered the filet mignon. We both ordered medium rare (of course  because that's how steak should be ordered with that fine cut of moo). I received my steak medium and my wife's steak was still mooing and not even close to medium  rare to where she couldn't even cut through it with her dull steak knife. We also had lobster tail which was served cold and overcooked to the point to where you can roll the flesh into a ball and bounce it off the walls. To end this fine dining experience my wife had the cheesecake and I had the chocolate mousse cake. Both of which were flavorless and suffering from freezer burn from the night before. My wife mentioned that a Sara Lee Frozen cheesecake has better taste than what was served. On a positive note the service was great and my wine and wster glass were consistently filled. In addition the valet service was kind, prompt, and respectful. We are going back to Eddie V's tomorrow night where we can enjoy a top-notch meal when we are opening our pocketbooks to a top dollar restaurant. I do not recommend this restaurant if you plan on spending big bucks on a meal."}
{"text":"I have a mixed reaction.  Donovan's has been around the Valley for more than a decade now. When you step inside the first set of doors, you're in an alcove that makes me think of really old-timey restaurants from the 1960s or maybe even older than that. Go through the next set of double doors and you're at the host stand.  The place oozes of pretense.  We went on a Monday night on a Groupon deal with reservations for 6:45 p.m. We arrived early and a \"complimentary\" valet took the vehicle away for us - I'm OK with valet, especially when it's billed as complimentary, but I'd also really like the ability to just park my own vehicle even if it means I'm walking from the back 40. Complimentary valet really is never actually free - those people have to sit outside in the brutal heat in the hope of being tipped. Makes me feel awkward.  Back inside: we were greeted immediately. We confirmed our reservation, were told that we were quite early so our table would be ready closer to the time promised. We declined the opportunity to go spend money in their bar. Having read other reviews, I think this might be their MO. The dining room was visibly nowhere near full. As had been promised, we were shown to a table pretty close to our reserved time. This disappointed me - I didn't understand why we were made to wait. I'd go for 2 stars for this part of the experience.  The table service was very much up to the expectation created by the pretense that is Donovan's. Five stars here. Very attentive despite them being fully aware we were there on a Groupon deal. Bravo.  The menu had many yummy sounding choices. We ordered their \"Prix Fixe\" but were then told that the Groupon offer couldn't be combined with other offers. Odd. This could have been communicated better. Or, better yet, not really worried about at all. I believe the reason for the Groupon deal is to get people to come in and give the place a try - shine as brightly as possible and, hopefully, a percentage of the deal-seekers will be back and pay full boat.  On to the food: the Caesar salad - no anchovies - was not fully traditional but was very well prepared. Seafood chowder soup was excellent. 6 oz. filet was a very good cut and prepared perfectly to order. But, as has been pointed out in other reviews, they season this to death. Bummer. I didn't order a pepper crusted steak. But, that's what I got. Too bad. The skillet fried potatoes, recommended by the captain, were not good! Crusted in salt. Deserts: creme brulee - just OK - and triple chocolate brownie - righteous! - ended the night.  For menu pricing, no way I'm coming back. For the Groupon deal, yup, I'd come back. The ambience of this place is not really my style - it's a bygone era. There are other high-end steakhouses around that don't feel so ancient and that deliver a more modern take on super expensive steak dinners."}
{"text":"The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood, which is good, which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious.  Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix.  Bacon wrapped scallops were very good, and I sacrificied a full steak (opting for the filet medallion) to try the scallops.  I asked for medium rare steak, but maybe shouldve asked for rare...my cousin had the ribeye and could not have been any happier than he was :)    yum for fancy steak houses.   Its an ultra romantic place to, fyi. the wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Great place for a dinner date or to woo a client or a propective hire. Great steak!! Went there for my anniversary and the valet puts a nice touch on the evening. Be prepared to walk out full."}
{"text":"It was just ok as far as food goes the service I give A+, I went during rest week and got a great price and good value, But as for going and paying full price.I would say I would not go back . You can find much better steakhouses in the valley for similar price"}
{"text":"I soooo wanted to make this place a regular tradition, but I'm so torn now! First and foremost, the service in this establishment is truly spectacular. You will get taken care of from the get-go. I think the first time I was in though, I got a little extra care and was a little disappointed when I didn't have the same experience the second time around.   On my very first visit to Donovan's, a pleasant gentleman walked right up to the car, opened the door for me and held my hand to help me get out. He then walked my guy and I over to the restaurant's entrance and opened the door for us. Great experience right from the beginning. This time, I went in a couple days ahead of time to make the reservation. No one out front. No one to greet me. No worries. I can park my own car and open my own doors. Then when we actually went in for our reservation, we didn't get that special attention we got on our very first visit. Kind of a let down, but not a huge deal. Our server was indeed spectacular, as they always are here!  I've learned that the food is a hit or miss. Twice I've had the same dinners: wedge salad and the chicken entree (there's only one). Both times were completely different. On this most recent visit, there were very few blue cheese crumbles on the wedge -- the first time around I was in blue cheese heaven! Not a huge crisis, but the further and further I cut into the wedge, the grosser it got. It was yellow, not green. Probably shouldn't have been sent out of the kitchen in the first place. Not good lettuce. Tasted dirty. The wedge salad is one of my favorite things on earth, but for the first time ever, I couldn't finish it.  The chicken is free-range and organic. Great! But this piece I got wasn't trimmed at all. It was covered in a layer of fat. Maybe this is the new normal? Chewy chicken? Plus it was served with some weird sauce that I'm pretty sure was supposed to be blended together. Instead it was a dish full of cooked veggies with a layer of fat floating on top. Wasn't like that the last time I had it. I was too grossed out to finish my entree. Thankfully, my guy let me have a few bites of his steak, so I was happy.   I'm not sure if we'll return here. So many similar places in the neighborhood. For entrees that average $50 to $75, I held them up to the same standards as I had on the very first visit. They could've had an off night, but it was a very special day for me and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"We just left. Amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked salmon and delicious shrimp. Waiters were absolutely awesome and attentive. Atmosphere was very relaxed and decorated beautifully for Christmas. I think it will be my annual holiday treat!"}
{"text":"Came here a little while ago and just wasn't impressed.  Felt the steak was cheap and something I could make better at home. Got a filet and was cooked to the temp I requested, just didnt knock my socks off like a $50+ steak should."}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner and really enjoyed it.  Drinks were strong!  And delicious.  We had some appetizers.  Nothing really stood out except the mushrooms.  Everything else was fine but the stuffed mushrooms were very good.  Now the steak...I had the rib eye and it was phenomenal.  I didn't think I could eat it all but I did.  Subsequent to that, one of my dining companions said she couldn't finish her filet.  It looked like she had only taken a couple of bites.  She suggested I try it and I did.   And by try it, I meant that I finished the whole thing.  Service was friendly and professional.   Very good place."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from Donovan's and had been looking forward to trying it for a while. My husband and I decided to treat some friends to a nice steak dinner. They wanted to go to Flemmings, but we convinced them to go to Donovan's, not a good decision in retrospect.  Yes, the food is terrific, our steak/seafood selections were delicious, but the service and the ambiance was really lacking.  I think if you are going to charge that much money for a steak or a piece of fish everything needs to be on point.    They sat us in a strange, claustrophobic room in the middle of the restaurant with extremely bright lights.  We were sort of segregated from the rest of restaurant.  We had two waiters, both of which ignored us for most of the night.  We kept having to ask our busser to locate one of our waiters so we could order cocktails/dinner/etc.  At one point, we had so many dirty dishes and empty glasses that we had to pile them on the corner of the table.  Then the kicker, after we paid our bill and left, the restaurant called me in the car on my way home and told me they didn't charge us enough money.  Unbelievable, yes, but sadly true.  My husband and I eat out a lot, and I cannot recall a time EVER that a restaurant called me and to tell me they wanted to charge us more money after the fact.  The caller said to make up for their mistake, they will buy us a bottle of wine next time we visit.  Fortunately for us, there will be no \"next time.\"  There are plenty of other, much better options to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steaks.  Went there a few weeks ago while in AZ for spring training.  We wanted to go to Mastros but couldn't get in at a decent hour with a last minute reservation.  Donovan's got us in no problem and I'm very happy about it. The restaurant was well appointed and classy but not too stuffy.   We were seated upon arrival by extremely friendly hostesses.  The waiter immediately took our drink order and struck up a conversation about baseball and our favorite team owner who often frequents the restaurant.  He was very nice to my 8 and 11 year old kids and wasn't put off by them.  The waiter and his assistants took great care of us, made sure our water was always full but did not overwhelm us.  My son and I shared the largest filet which was perfectly cooked to order and simply delicious as were the scalloped potatoes.  My wife had an incredibly delicious salmon and my daughter had  Mac n cheese side with bacon that was to die for. My martini was icy cold and the wine pours were generous.  Although a bit pricey Donovan's was definitely with it."}
{"text":"Hadn't been there in several years and after this visit I remember why, I don't like onions or shallots in my macaroni and cheese. The food is good but not worth the price just a very disappointing experience and I probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I knew I was in trouble when I was told I needed to dress up for our anniversary dinner. Hubby set up a wonderful surprise, which turned out excellent for both of us since neither of us had been to Donovan's before. It was obvious to me we have been married for 18 years, we both ordered the exact same meal- the filet mignon with shrimp scampi. Wow. Steak that melts in your mouth. Fresh veggies, and delish au gratin potatoes. I wanted to lick my plate clean, but figured in this upscale setting it probably wouldn't have been appropriate. Service was also excellent, we weren't kept waiting for anything. Great way to celebrate!"}
{"text":"From the moment my guest and I arrived the customer service was impeccable. Both myself and my guest both had the special which was approximately $72 ea. The steak was cooked to perfection but had absolutely no flavor. It was the most boring meal I've ever eaten. The garlic mashed potatoes were the most flavor item on my plate. The King crab I had was pretty small and extremely difficult to pull from the shell. I personally feel that when I am dressed in a nice suite and I specifically tell the waiter the reason I didn't want the special was because crab is messy, and he tells me it comes right out of the shell w/a fork then I expect exactly that. I just don't think this is the steakhouse for me and my friend agreed. If you're on a date and neither party cares for a flavorful steak but prefers to be wine and dined by staff then this is the place for you. If you want quality food w/savory taste then this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before and since it was my nieces last night in town, we decided on Donovans tonight for our yearly splurge night. Sooooo glad we did! 1st and foremost, the 5 stars are mostly because of our service! We had Sarah and Nick (back waiter) and they were so fantastic. Sarah was helpful with the menu, personable and had a great sense of humor. We just adored her. Now for the food....we had calamari and mac n cheese as starters. The calamari was incredibly tender and the mac was delicious. For dinner, the neice had a filet and bacon wrapped scallops, I had a NY but with a peppercorn crust and the skillet potatoes and peppercorn sauce. Even the snap peas for the vegetable were awesome! My brother had a filet as well and he tried a ceaser salad, too. So good! For dessert, we had creme brulee and my niece had a choclate mousse cake. All were very good. If I had any sort of complaint, it would be the amount of times we were asked if everything was ok. 2 managers, of course Sarah, Nick, the hostess (who was a super sweet little red head girl) and the valet (who called us by name so that was cool) It wasn't super annoying or anything but our conversation was interrupted a few times. It was just a little excessive. But...thank you Donovans crew for ....well...everything. spot on!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years; it's still one of Phoenix's best, imho!  Service is ultra-professional (three waiters to take care of us-- wow! Drinks always filled, plates and crumbs promptly cleared).  The food last night was even better than our last visit; just sublime!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned halibut w/a shoestring potato \"nest\" for hubby, and filet w/scampi for me.  The blue cheese/port reduction sauce add-on was so delicious, as was the creamy butter sauce on the jumbo shrimp.  And don't get me started on their signature au gratin potatoes-- divine!  The chopped salad is good (has hearts of palm in it), but a bit heavy on the onions.  Only minor complaint; the wait between courses was a bit excessive.  I understand that the meal is an experience, but 20-25 minutes between courses left me hangry.  The prices are a bit of a shock, but for special occasions you get real value for the $$$.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here last night for restaurant week. Had the filet... Which was amazing and cooked perfectly with their yummy mashed potatoes and veggies. The bottle of red wine they offered for an additional $20 paired perfectly with the dinner. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love Donovan's....by far, the best steak in the valley.  And the one time they gave us bad service, I called and spoke to the manager.  They sent me a $150 gift card!  Better yet, I got a call from them the other day, wishing me a happy wedding anniversary.  So thoughtful.   We will always go to donovan's for special occasions!"}
{"text":"We hosted a birthday dinner here.   Service was top notch.  We had a primary waiter and his assistant.  They were brilliant.    What I loved about them most of all is once they found out we were US Army Veterans who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq, they gave us a $50 credit.  How wonderful is that?  They thanked us for our service.  Remarkable.  Always will go back, forever."}
{"text":"I just went to Donovan's on a date, and we had an amazing experience there! The food was delicious (although very expensive); I had the salmon and oysters, and he had a 10 oz. steak and wedge salad. The service was fantastic, and the ambiance was refined and elegant. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile because I've heard great things about this place, I've seen them on the food network channel, and because they had pretty good reviews on Yelp. This experience was just not great from the moment we pulled into the parking lot. I didn't want to valet my car because the parking lot was right there, but I had to wait for someone to tell me where to park and they made me park way in the back, which I thought was pretty inconvenient. So you either have to valet even though it's unnecessary or park at the back of the lot. ok whatever. We get in and check in with the host, she tells my boyfriend happy birthday and asks us to go wait for a bit. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I figured they were just setting the table up real quick. 10 min goes by and we get seated by the entrance, which wasn't the best place since everyone passes by there. There is a \"team\" that serves you rather than just one person so we had 4 people filling up our waters as soon after we would take a drink and everyone kept asking how things were going. it got pretty annoying. We ordered the fried calamari and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. the calamari wasn't anything fancy, it wasn't seasoned with anything and the sauce is regular tarter sauce, so we were pretty disappointed. (if you want crazy good calamari, you need to go try capital grill). The scallops were a good size and it was really good, but we've definitely had better. the scallops were on the dry side but tasted pretty good. for the entrees, I ordered their special surf and turf with a 6oz filet and lobster and my bf ordered their 14oz prime rib oscar style. 40 min passes and the food finally comes out, I cut into my steak and it's perfect medium rare and everything was very tasty. my boyfriend did not get his steak Oscar style as ordered so we had to have them take it back while we waited. Ribeye steaks are suppose to be really juicy and tender but his steak was tough and chewy and definitely not what we expected from a nice steakhouse. We really don't like to complain so he just ate it. They forgot my boyfriend's bday and never brought out his dessert so I had to ask and that's when one of the servers remembered. The server Colette was really the savior of the night and the only one that really made any sense there. the manager came by and asked how everything was going and apologized for all the hiccups throughout the night and said dessert was on him. they brought out an Oreo chocolate ice cream cake slice for the oops remedy and a creme brûlée with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday treat. there were a lot of other weird interactions throughout the night that I don't want to take the time to type out but I've had way better service and food at other places and probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there."}
{"text":"Donovan's has some of the best lamb chops I've ever had. Plus their cocktails are nothing to scoff at. You pay for what you get, and what you get is a great meal in a swanky restaurant with service that really is unparalleled. I lucked out the first time I came here, because my boss was treating the staff to a complete meal.   On a budget/paying your own way? Go during their happy hour. Drinks are discounted and their steak sandwich is stellar."}

{"text":"This past weekend we were celebrating my birthday with a little staycation up the road at Royal Palms and since I had read this place had the best steaks in Phoenix, I decided to give it a try since I love a good steak on my birthday. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a filet snob since I grew up in the midwest and we have some of the best steaks I've had anywhere in the world. I drive by this place all the time and its outside apparence looks like a typical, run of the mill steakhouse so I never considered it but when a Living Social deal was offered, it prompted us to give it a try and I thought maybe the inside had something great to offer.   We called several times the day before to try and change our reservation time but only got their answering machine on a Sunday. I doubt they were closed so I'm not sure what was going on with that. We decided the original time worked for us anyway so we made our way there.   Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly and welcoming valet. When we stepped inside it was a tiny bit of a let down. It was the standard, dark wood, white table cloth steakhouse that looks just about every other one I've been to. The reception staff was very friendly and one woman happily agreed to take our picture while the other hostest went to check on our booth. She returned shortly and took us to a booth without any waiting. While I'm not fond of the U shaped booth that's always awkward to sit in, no matter how many are in your party, it was pretty comfy and we settled in.  Our team of servers were nice and prompt with water, bread and telling us about the specials. No one ever asked if we were celebrating anything special so it never came up that it was my birthday. It was nice to see that the potato and vegetables were included in the price of the steaks rather than al a cart. Other sides were average priced for a steakhouse at about $11-15 I think. I opted for the 8oz filet, medium, with a baked potato and requested that I substitue my vegetables for a side of creamed spinach. Unfortunately they couldn't accomodate a direct substitution so we ended up paying for a full side of the spinach and also of the Mac N Cheese with bacon. My fiance ordered the cajun ribeye.   The bread and butter were good, but nothing different or extraordinary. When our dinner arrived, it looked really good. Instead of loading the potato in the kitchen, the waiter had a server with all the potato toppings and offered as much butter and sour cream as I wanted, nice touch. The sides of spinach and mac n cheese were big portions and looked delicious. My first cut into the steak was perfect and it was perfect throughout. While the tenderness was superb, you could cut it with a fork, and the flavor was good, there was nothing that set this apart from the rest of the other steaks you can get elsewhere like a Ruth's Chris or Capital Grill. Zero seasoning so all you got was meat. Luckily I went all out on the sour cream for my potato because otherwise, it was very dry. The creamed spinach was really good but I didn't care for the mac n cheese. It seemed a bit dry to me and the bacon bits on it almost tasted like Bacon bits from a jar. I would have preferred Velvetta shells and cheese to this. My fiances ribeye was also cooked perfectly and the taste I had, it was really good. The staff continued to check on us through out the meal and we opted not to order dessert because we were so full.  There was no issue using the Living Social deal and the meal ended up costing about $100 once we used the deal pricing. Overall, good service, mediocre steak and average sides. The ambiance was standard steakhouse with little to differentiate itself from anywhere else. Our meal was good but I don't think I'd ever come back."}
