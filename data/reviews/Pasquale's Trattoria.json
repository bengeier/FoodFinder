{"text":"We have become regulars at Pasquale's over the years. Our recent visit proved that the impeccable service, wonderful food and overall excellent experience is consistent every time. From the time the owner welcomes you at the door (as he does with every guest) until the time he thanks you for coming you know you are appreciated as a customer. Our server was Tony and he was charming and amazing as usual. The menu has recently been tweaked so if you haven't been in lately it's worth a visit. Classic recipes done to perfection, including home made pasta offerings. This place is always packed so highly recommend that you make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Pasquale's and again it was excellent! From beginning to end every dish was just perfect.  My girls were the ones who wanted to return as I think they love the fuss the owner makes over them ! Visit Pasquale's for a great night out."}
{"text":"Went once and never again. Waiter was arrogant took forever to get our food. When it came it was mediocre at best. Owner was clearly more interested in talking to regulars than ensuring we were being looked after. Horrible"}
{"text":"Flawless dinner.  Showed up for the reservation and the table was ready on time.   Busy restaurant, great atmosphere, alive with conversations and laughter. I really like that when dining out. If I wanted silence I would eat at home.    Wine recommendation was spot on and they aced my Osso Bucco dish. Perfect. Big portions too. Menu was robust. Lots of choices and everything was fresh.   The service was timely and professional and the owner took the time to personally thank us for visiting. Nice touch.   Left full and happy like one should after a dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place! As soon as my girlfriend and I walked in we were greeted like family and promptly seen to. The service here is exemplary, the staff pulled out our chair and straightened out our coats on the chairs. Our orders were promptly taken and delivered in good time, considering that the place was very busy. We both had calamari and gnocchi that night, not only were both items delicious and impeccably prepared but the portions were generous and the prices very reasonable. Will most certainly return here many times!  Ps. For any of the gents here that want a date idea to really impress a girl, you cannot fail with this place!"}
{"text":"Best veal chop I've ever had. Service is one of a kind! Expensive but totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Charming little spot. The owner is the definition of class and adds to the overall experience. Tiny bar, only a handful of tables.  The food is excellent. Linguine and mussels were good and the spinach/ricotta/pesto rose ravioli was amazing. I wanted to bathe in that rose sauce. The beer/wine/liquor selections could use an upgrade with more to choose from, but for what's there, it's petty decent.  The crowd definitely can be a little long in the tooth, so if you're looking for a high energy atmosphere, this isn't the spot. However, for some great Italian"}
{"text":"Hard to believe this restaurant is so highly rated. The acoustics are appalling and the noise level from diners trying to be heard is painful. Lots of waiters to keep filling your wine glass but obviously not enough cooks to prepare your food! I felt that the waiter must have been on a bonus system to see who could sell the most alcohol. Took an hour to get appetizers, by which time we had been there for ninety minutes and could drink no more! Food was good but not great, my veal was overcooked."}
{"text":"Had an amazing risotto and pasta here. The staff were so incredibly kind, friendly and endearing that the food (which was amazing) was elevated to another level. I loved the food, the people and can't wait to bring my family and friends here :) an outstanding restaurant I can't wait to recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!   Pasquale's is a busy spot - we went on a Wednesday night and wouldn't have got a table if we hadn't made reservations. We arrived about 20 minutes early, and there was not another table to be found - someone was sitting in ours, but they told us that those guests \"were told they had to be out by 7:15\" (I guess they didn't have a reservation?). So we waited at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartender who helped us select a wine.   When our table became free, we got a chance to look at their semi overwhelming menu - it's not too big, but there are so many main course options, that it's REALLY hard to decide! Everything sounded amazing, and all the tables around us had really good looking (and smelling!) food!   Based on a yelp review (how else would I decide?) I had the gnocci with tiger shrimp - (which I heard were going to be the size of my palm, they weren't!) and also a minestrone to start. Both were really good, but the service was semi-slow which meant we finished our wine way before our main was served - kind of annoying.   The service overall was what lowered this from a 4 star review. I guess it just wasn't my preferred service style - I found it semi slow. Also when we moved from the bar to the table, they insisted on taking our drinks over and then mixed up the order... bleh.   Maybe I'm being a little harsh. This food was good and the atmosphere (and my company!) was great, but it just wasn't quite a home run. However if I end up in Oakville again, I will give it another shot!"}
