{"text":"Came here on a Sunday right after they opened at 1:30 in the afternoon.  I had my doubts, but was told not to turn my nose up because I would not leave hungry or unhappy. anddddddd they were right.  Told myself I wouldn't regret a single carb, gram of fat, or calorie that went in my mouth during this meal so it made it that much better.  fresh bread dripping in butter, spicy crab dip with pita bread fried to perfection, macaroni and cheese, fried perch, fries, coleslaw....all heavenly.  I couldn't stop. I loved every bite of it. I need more lancers in my life like..every day.

Our server was nice.  Not too invasive but took good care of us and made sure our drinks were full and empty plates were off the table.  Cant wait to go back to Cleveland and especially Lancers/mardi gras/whatever it is now"}
{"text":"went here on  a Friday and they had a very nice band playing  , which was the real reason why I came here, and another reason is I was told that they had join partners with the    respectable Lancer's seafood and steak house that used to be  located  on Carnegie. It was three of us at a table , we had a very slow attitudy  server that had no personality. food was okay but not very hot, she told me if I changed my side dishes for my meal it will only be a few extra dollars , end up being $10 extra dollars ....she had no clue on how to separate checks or how to run a credit card , took her an hour to come back with anything you asked her for. Management was no better, didn't really care about what was going on said he would take care of it and never did, other tables were complaining also nobody really cared. The server finally got upset and said;'I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT NONE OF THIS S*** I ONLY BEEN WORKING HERE FOUR DAYS ANYWAY F*** THIS s*** \" ,we were really shocked and I will never go back for the food at least maybe the band because they were nice."}
{"text":"Don't be scared...the food is good! 

I ventured into this downtown joint based on the recommendation of a friend in town. I was visiting Cleveland for business and wanted something different. This place did not disappoint. There was NO ONE eating there, which freaked me out just a little, but I got a chance to talk with the chef. I asked for his recommendations and he told me what he had just finished. He brought out a cup of seafood gumbo and some red-beans and rice. Both were STELLAR. He also made a butter/habenaro sauce for dipping which was beautifully done. 

They seemed really happy to have a midday business-traveller for their first customer of the day, and they were just very nice people. I would definitely eat here again.

They do lose one star for not having their A/C turned on, even though it was HOT outside"}
