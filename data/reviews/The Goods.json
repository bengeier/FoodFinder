{"text":"These guys are the absolute best! The Tricky Tahini bowl is always my go to and it never disappoints. All of their stuff is super fresh and filling and the staff are always super friendly. Portion sizes are great (especially since the food is so filling) and I always feel super satisfied and energized. Would recommend to goods to anyone looking to expand their healthy eating lifestyle or to anyone looking for a fresh, filling, and delicious lunch on Dundas west."}
{"text":"Great quality food.   A big problem with me when I'm out is finding somewhere I can eat without feeling too heavy or salt logged after.  Places like this are a gem because you get quality food and can still be on the go.  My go to when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon The Goods today while visiting Toronto and I can't say enough positive things about my experience. I  was with my husband who is a bit skeptical on raw and vegan cuisine and we both loved it. The shop itself is warm, inviting and has a cozy feel. When ordering I had to ask for an allergy accommodation and the staff was more than happy to help!  I ate the Kings Noodle Salad, Sweet Heat soup and the Insteda shake.  The zucchini \"noodles\" in the salad are so good and the dressing was fresh and HOMEMADE, which is a refreshing surprise. My soup was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy and served  to me in a handy to go cup making it easy to enjoy in the car. My shake was really surprising too!  I hadn't had my morning coffee yet and found that once my shake was done I didn't need one.  We couldn't get over now great we felt and how much energy we had after our meal.  This definitely beats your typical fast food!  The Goods is a great new Toronto must!"}
{"text":"Their name says it best.... The Goods is good ( well, I would say fantastic) The gals at the shop are cool and the salad & soup make my mouth water.  Really they are just that good. Do it."}
{"text":"I guess if you're really into raw vegan stuff this place is the cat's pyjamas. But if you're not, well, it will just be a box of fancy cut up veg that is made palatable by the sauce they give you."}
{"text":"I picked up a Chuck Norris bowl from The Goods looking for a healthy dinner and it was absolutely delicious. I'm not strictly vegetarian or vegan, so I have fairly high standards for veggie meals. This did not disappoint. All the ingredients were fresh and it was ready on the spot. The decor inside was cute as well - I took my meal home to eat but there is a small bar seating area available if you'd like to stay."}
{"text":"Wow! Not often I can get a delicious, healthy meal and a smoothie in a minute. I wandered in to The Goods looking for a snack and maybe a coffee. No coffee here but who cares!!! Best decision I made this month. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite addiction! I FINALLY tried The Goods via delivery after many months of biking by on the way to work or after work which was either too late or too early due to my wacky work schedule. I'm quite partial to bike delivery services so that was an awesome touch. I had ordered a week of food and drinks, only to have prompt service both calling and e-mailing me asking options whether I actually wanted that weeks worth of food on a Thursday, or if I wanted to save the credit for the next weeks order (I actually thought I was ordering for the following week by accident). My whole delivery came the next day and I rationed it myself instead of getting a daily delivery. I highly recommend the Naked Burrito salad (I think it was called), or the Kings Salad - both came with an amazing dressing, and just unique salads that were so delicious."}
{"text":"The goods is awesome! We tried all the salads and the soup! Everything was amazing.... This place will cure your hangover and it might even change your life!"}
{"text":"Delicious shakes (that's all we had) but will definitely be back again!  And bonus is that they are super friendly too :)"}
{"text":"THIS IS A TAKE OUT PLACE. Do not go in here thinking you're going to have a nice sit-down meal, because all you have to choose from with regard to seating is four little metal stools. Good salad, however the sesame dressing on the Chuck salad was extremely salty and one-dimensional (and I do consume salt regularly). The portion to price ratio is extremely imbalanced. Very expensive ($44 for 3 appetizer-size salads) in my opinion. I will only eat here again if I am in the immediate area and need a quick bite. Not worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Toronto to grab an organic and nutritious meal to go. Love their salads and soups, and the owner/staff are so friendly! It's hard to find a place where you can order anything off the menu without asking any questions about ingredients or quality. This place is almost too good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh wholesome food.  For any day you feel like treating your body right this is the place.  They have wonderful bowls, soups and delicious veggie chili. I am not a vegetarian but going to a place like the food makes it seem possible. Also the place is nut free which is great for allergy sufferers"}
{"text":"This is the place that made me love salads. I'm dead serious. If salads were this good every time.. I'm pretty sure I would be vegetarian. No doubt!  My favourite is the Chuck Bowl. (Previously known as The Chuck Norris Bowl ) Vibrant and delicious it had the right kind of crunch with a that ohhh yeeess savoury dressing that balances the flavours SO well!  I've ordered online 4 times from this establishment and have never actually set foot there. I love that their deliveries are always within the time frame they say it would be. They also use GoodFoot which hires workers with disabilities to deliver your food via bikes or public transportation. (Always amazing people and fantastic to be able to support this!).  I've only ever ordered delivery for my workplace so the only hang up is that they don't deliver in the area that I actually live. :( They also seem to have a very small selection of salads per weekeday.. but no need to fix what isn't broken - each salad is worth it!  Surprisingly filling, these large portions pack some GOOD stuff!"}
{"text":"I can't possibly say enough positive things about this place. First of all their veggie/noodle bowls are absolutely phenomenal. The flavors come together perfectly and they taste healthy and refreshing. They put an interesting spin on mango lassi where they add turmeric which is unbelievably delicious, one of the best mango lassi drinks I've ever had. Finally the staff is so kind and enthusiastic about serving their customers that it makes the meal even more enjoyable. I was in Toronto for two days and I'm so glad I found this place, if your looking for something healthy and delicious make sure you try this place out, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Here's the goods on the goods- it's great. Whenever I'm near Bellwoods this is always my go to spot for a snack. I'll grab something from there and then bring it back to the park and bam! I have a little picnic.   It's been far too long since I've been here but favourite item was and probably still will be the King Noodle. This place inspired me to grab myself one of those veggie noodler things. Just the best idea!   Also might I add the staff is so nice! It's really great when you walk into a place and you can tell the people working there really care about their products and about the community. Yas!"}
{"text":"When your husband bikes to The Goods to get you a take-out salad after a canoe trip, Priceless! Such good, mindful low glycemic food with a lovely crew of ladies serving it up. After a vegan gourmet camping trip, The Goods is a perfect way to keep my feet up while eating mindfully and ethically!"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. Small portions, super expensive for what you get. Tried the chuck Norris salad and nachos and was hungry immediately after. Don't waste your time and money by going there. No washrooms either."}
{"text":"It's all packaged well, so no problem to eat immediately or save for lunch.  Great place well thought out."}
{"text":"Their hot cereal started my morning off just right. And of course, the lady there was super friendly and smiling all the time."}
{"text":"This place just opened up. They've been doing delivery to a few local businesses for the last year or so and the food is amazing. Easiest way to eat healthy if you're lazy like I am. Most of the food is mostly raw mostly vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian and I love the salads. Soups are pretty solid too. Definitely a great addition to the Dundas strip. Looking forward to seeing what else they start serving."}
{"text":"UberEats review:  I've never actually stepped foot in this place but I can vouch that the food is consistently great when I order delivery. Salads are always fresh and carefully made. The mushroom soup is incredible."}
{"text":"I'm beside myself with glee. This food is LIFE AFFIRMING! You may think it's just a salad, until you get one, devour it, and realize that there is an art in the preparation and the pairing. The dressings are delicious, the ingredients are incredibly fresh and you can taste the love and care that goes into it. So good. I'm a little worried I may blow the bank at this place."}
{"text":"The vibe: tiny little takeout/delivery place on Dundas. Right now there's no seating but they'll be adding a bench to seat a couple of people.  The food: fresh, healthy and delicious. I had a bowl with some curly cucumbers that was delicious!  My go to meal: Any of their tasty bowls.   Secret: They used to be cash only but have just started taking cards!"}
{"text":"Can I just say this place makes me SO happy? The food is so delicious - everything on the menu is a hit. The staff is wickedly awesome, so friendly and always in the best mood. Thank you for being the best The Goods!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kings Noodle salad through Uber Eats delivery. Excellent - great crunch factor. A huge portion enough for two to share. Great way to get all of your nutrients and feel very righteous after your meal."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best owners ever. Delicious (!!!!) salads. I order The Goods every day during the Toronto One of a Kind Show (twice a year) where I'm an artisan, and I can't tell you how much The Goods improves my life, and sustains me through my long days selling. Highly recommended to everyone!"}
{"text":"First just let me say that I'm so thankful that this place exists.  On a sunny day I'll walk over from Sorauren Ave and eat in.  Green Golds is my go to salad but I love their specials, especially the Naked Burrito and Buleh Bowl.  All of their soups are amazing, I love them all equally.  Amazing desserts, great smoothies (especially the Insteada for me) and yesterday I was feeling sick, took two ginger shots there and feel 100% fine today!  Staff are amazing and really nice people.  We need more of this all over the city, I honestly feel these people truly care."}
{"text":"It's amazing there are 2 really good vegetarian places within a 100 m of each on Dundas (Veghed).  I came here hoping to get a nice salad and this place did not disappoint.  It's not an obvious spot on Dundas but look for the subtle white signage on a window that looks like a house and you found your spot!  Inside is a bright clean store with a few windowed bar seats to eat.  It's mostly a take out counter.    I arrived with only 20 minutes before close and there were no issues as all their salads were neatly packaged up already and ready for anyone to come along to scoop one up.  There have a variety of salad types and it sounds like they're continually to add new ones (Nori bowl) for a different flavour take.  I ordered their most popular Chuck Norris Salad (which I think was renamed to just simply Chuck).  Obligatory Chuck Norris food joke ...Chuck Norris makes onions cry.  Now that is out of my system... onto the rest of the review.  Chuck (Norris) Salad - Creeping up to $16 it is definitely one of the more expensive take out salads I've had in Toronto.  Seeing how Veghed is nearly 25% cheaper with just as plentiful ingredients and huge flavour punch, I was a bit worried it wouldnt live up to the ratings.  This salad had a lot of different textures and ingredients.  Zucchini and beet noodles, sprouted beans, corn, cucumber, chickpeas, wild brown rice, quinoa, and different types of leaves.  With that, it had a thai influenced vinaigrette.  All together and mixed up... its a good salad that deserve some love.  I enjoyed eating it and it was pretty filling.  I have to admit that I love Veghed more for it's more nuanced and bold flavours but the Chuck is definitely up there as one of the better salads in Toronto.  4/5"}
{"text":"It was good. If you're looking to grab a fifteen dollar salad and go, go for it.   The location doesn't have restrooms. And only a wee bench with four seats.   Salad to sauce ratio was good. But portion:price seemed off."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, that I didn't enjoy the salad I have ordered. I expected much more since I heard good things about this place. The dressing was not good and the veggies were just raw veggies sliced and shredded. I probably won't return."}
