{"text":"I really really love this place.  BUT that being said, they need to decide if it's going to be a full service establishment or not.  If it is - they need to hire more staff because having 1 server during lunch on a weekend is not going to cut it.  If not - then they need to work out some kinks as to how to order/pay/etc.

The second time I went I got the special burrito - again barbacoa.  I also ordered chips & guac, which they forgot to bring out to us.  The burrito was really good & was an excellent price.  It was pretty filling, too.  This time we went the service was not nearly as attentive, and because of this we spent less money since we didn't feel like waiting for dessert (especially after our appetizer was forgotten.)  

My sister & brother-in-law went not long ago & had a bad experience due to only 1 server being on staff at their peak lunch time.  The server realized the service was not up to standard & comped their entire meal, which was very nice of him.  They enjoyed the food, but since they waited so long & also their order of chips & guac was once again forgotten, they will likely not be returning.  Which is a huge shame to me because this place has excellent food & can be an awesome little eatery if they just hire a couple more people.

In short - If you live in/near Lakewood, get take out.  If not, try it out once, as the food and juices are wonderfully crafted & tastes amazing.  Don't expect the service to be outstanding & make sure you have some extra time in case your visit takes longer than expected."}
{"text":"Such a neat spot. Awesome food and we loved the art all over the building. Really great menu with fresh ingredients. We will defiantly be back. PS love the Byob."}
{"text":"This place has great food and juices and Dali wall paintings and great service. Byob friendly too. Definitely our new go to spot in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this unique restaurant!  Our table had the tacos, one of the salads and smoothies.  I had the carnitas and barbacoa tacos and the yaya smoothie.  They were some of the best tacos I have tasted!! 

The decor and atmosphere is laid-back and unique.  The staff was very friendly and nice.  Pretty cool that it is BYOB - I am going to try that on my next visit.  Lakewood needs more casual unique restaurants like this."}
{"text":"If you go to Helvetica Juice Bar & Cafe expect to be there for awhile. Also expect slow service. We've gone twice and ended up leaving because it took so long to even get a glass of water. Everyone says the food is great...I wish I would of had the opportunity to actually eat the food."}
{"text":"Cozy and mindfully decorated, this juice bar is a gem of Lakewood. The service was perfectly suited for the atmosphere. I walked in with a six pack of Christmas ale and was immediately greeted with a genuine smile and an offer to put my beers in the fridge. I'll save you the trouble of having to read about my whole experience and give you the cliff notes...

- knowledgeable/friendly staff that gave great suggestions on menu items
- tasty fresh food (tried their barbacoa and carnitas tacos)
- byob
- fun atmosphere 

Bottom line check this place out and bring in your favorite wine/beer/friends.. And preferably a friend who can draw to lively up your table as crayons and a white table sheet are provided and no one appreciates stick figures... Except me apparently"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for this place. The 1st time we tried going to this place they were close. So we tried calling the # that was listed on the groupon & it was the wrong #. Found a different # on yelp called it but no answer. We actually thought this place just closed down & that we got screwed by groupon or that they had the deal & forgot to delete it. Finally took another chance today & luckily they were open.  Cute little place, very cozy, some cute arts. Good costumer service. The place was not busy at all.  We order 2 vegetarian burger (b/c of lent) & peanut butter, banana, spinach smoothies. Food took a while & more so for our smoothies. They were good especially for the burrito being vegetarian, we really liked the smoothie.  Can't really give this higher than a 3 stars right now due to what happened. But will definitely come back to try a meat burrito."}
{"text":"Pros: the veggie burrito was okay, the inside of the place was warm, good art on the walls, prices are reasonable

Cons: food took too long, burrito was small and not at all filling, natchos dont come with guac or salsa (??), I ordered to go and was given the wrong food"}
{"text":"Amazing smoothies!  This was the fourth attempt at trying them out though. I would love to see an improvement in the reliability of the posted hours. Also, the wait was long, but worth it."}
{"text":"I visited this new juice bar and cafe last Monday for lunch. I was blown away by the exceptional customer service. The team let me try out some homemade salsa with some random weird bean chips of some sort which tasted commercial; additionally I tried the advertised homemade fire roasted avocado spread. I tried a juice and seemed to be pretty good for what it was I can not remember the name because a lot of the menu items are in Spanish I believe. I decided to go ahead and try the Barbacoa taco which surprisingly was pretty darn tasty and the salsa a top complimented the meat very well. My overall visit was to my surprise a pretty darn good one so I decided to take a big foodie friend of mine (who is from out of town and has heard rumors of Cleveland area being a food destination) there again on the following  Saturday  and this is where my rating comes from. Upon our arrival we were just greeted and had to have a seat and wait for a menu.  Seemed as if the place was relaxed but yet not focusing on customer service. My Friend and I ordered the Barbacoa tacos and the same chips and salsa and avocado spread. Upon the arrival of our food it did not seem to be at the same standard as my first visit, the avocado was not as tasty as my first visit nor was the salsa due to an excessive amount of larger over powering onions, it also seemed as if it were missing something. Well to make a long story short my friend (the foodie) and I ended up going to some dessert and coffee at the local well known coffee shop The Root Cafe. I hope this little gem hole in the wall can get their feet off the ground and get things right. Customer service is 70% of the satisfaction. The interior design completely fits the area and is just down right cool. Loved the look and feel. I will return again Helvetica one day......"}
{"text":"Wow what a great local business.

Upon entrance one can tell feel the resonance of this relatively new Lakewood spot. Fresh individually dripped coffee for each customer was an immediate selling point for me. Having just returned from Peru I was missing the fresh exotic juice availability but was genuinely impressed with Helvetica's offerings. 

I was already a regular, but then I tried their food! Not only was service prompt and friendly but I realized that I could eat every item on their menu everyday. The food is delicious and aesthetically pleasing.

I recommend this place to any and everyone for their great coffee, juice, food and inviting atmosphere. Great for reading, school work, art or just hanging out"}
{"text":"I don't know if all the five star reviews are coming from friends of owners or employees or what but this place is not great. Just moving to Lakewood from Brooklyn, NY I admit I can be a bit spoiled at times when it comes to good food and unique atmosphere- this place tries but misses the bar. The coffee tasted like Maxwell House on both occasions I was there. My salad was just mushy spinach with watery corn and tomatoes with a side of thick sugary goopy dressing. Their \"Special Burrito\" of the day was filled with rice, beans, lettuce and salsa. Thats it. You can add meat for an extra 2 dollars but at that point, go to Chipotle and get one that will actually taste good.
The \"juices\" are actually smoothies. The branding makes no sense. Why did the owners go to Flower Child and buy up all their good records to use just for decoration? 
I think when someone opens a restaurant they should have legitimately good food, not just a haphazard wanna be hipster concept. I even LOVE photography and drawing with crayons on white paper but this place is a mess and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I was only there for a group meeting so I didn't get to experience all that is Helvetica.  I did have some amazing AMAZING juice.  I think both of the owners were there- all of the employees were incredibly friendly and helpful and just genuinely warm, kind and oh so welcoming!  When I heard about the place opening I have to admit that I thought, \"Oh, no that sounds so terribly hipster!\" and never imagined myself going there.  I'm dragging everyone I know back ASAP!

UPDATE! I've since had a chance to go back a few times and continue to LOVE LOVE LOVE Helvetica! SO YUMMY! SO GOOD! If Helvetica wants to just hang out in my kitchen anytime it's fine with me! And maybe I'll consider sharing... MAYBE!

Everything is super fresh, by the way. And I cannot say how much I appreciate the friendly staff. I've been in several times and had some great conversations with the folks working there. Also, I'm hoping that this coming summer they'll be adding some authentic Andalucian gazpacho to the menu! I have a feeling they'd do it up right!"}
{"text":"Helvetica ...you need to kick it up a notch.   Your big brother Barocco Grill has it pretty much dialled in, but Im here to give you some free advice.

1.  Your bevvies are tasty and, pretty much, in line with my experiences in several South American countries.   However, it would be nice to have 2-3 fresh squeezed juices available.   How about one of those old school OJ juicers?

2.  The lone  sandwich on the menu is tasty.  Really tasty.   Aside from a couple of  tacos, there arent too many other food options.   How about more snack-y type things?   Empanadas?  

3.  Invest in air conditioning.

4.  Buy some funky vintage fabric and cover all the tatty, thrift store pillows on the window seats.   They look messy and dirty.  Crisping them up with 1-2 coordinating fabrics will bring some visual peace to the chaos that currently exists.   

5.  Opening at 11am seems strange?   Breakfast smoothies?   Coffee for students before class?   Yummy South American breakfast treats/sweets?  Even a breakfast burrito or two?   Seems like these would fill a niche.

There is potential but something seems unfinished here in both food and experience.   It would take just a bit of effort to make this place pop.

All said with love.   See you at Barocco."}
{"text":"Helvetica looks nice on the inside. 
The server wasn't very nice.
We ordered two iced toddys.
The server wet behind the counter and started pulling espresso shots. 
Toddy is the name for 24 hour brewed cold coffee. there is a specific way f extracting it. It should have taken her 1 minute to get our drinks. 
We ended up getting two espresso and waters with ice. 
That was $3 each. Helvetica is putting up a front. I wouldn't suggest getting coffee here.
They do hav bendy straws"}
{"text":"When you walk in the place it gives you a really cozy homey feeling right away. They have a small menu but everything I ate so far is excellent. The staff is nice and the food amazing. Never had better smoothies in my life. (Especially for $4,50)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cool ambiance, and affordable pricing! (Discounted tacos on Tuesdays too) I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ack. Ugh. I don't know how many stars to give Helvetica. 4 seems high, but 3 would be too low. I tend to think it's a place that has a lot of potential, but maybe isn't quite achieving as much as it could -- and hopefully will. 

The food is tasty (though sometimes a bit lukewarm, when I would expect it to be hotter), the coffee is good, the juices are refreshing. So... what's the problem? It's just not really run very well. 

I don't think I've ever seen a manager or authority figure when I've been there and it shows. I've seen a table of two have dishes come out at very different times, without telling diners that the rest of the meal is coming up (which just reassures diners that nothing has been forgotten). I've been served milk with my coffee instead of cream (I know that sounds petty, but when I'm asked if I want cream with my coffee and am served milk instead, it's worth noting). The space is pretty cool, with good decor and plenty of seating -- mostly because there are very rarely more than a couple of people in the cafe. The tables, however, are clearly VERY cheap and none of the are sturdy. Again, it may sound petty, but when half of their business is coffee and juice (ie, beverages), it's fairly noticeable when the tables wobble to and fro. 

I hate giving a sort of negative review, because I really do like it there and I've happily gone back repeatedly, which is why I'm leaving the star-rating fairly high. Generally speaking, I think they just need some management with stronger experience running a cafe. 

p.s., I completely agree with the other reviewer(s) who mentioned the late open time for Helvetica. Maybe I'm overestimating the importance of coffee to their business plan, but 11am is unheard of for a coffee shop. I wish they would give morning service a try for a least a few weeks and see if it takes off."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I have to say Groupon intrigued me to check it out since I hadn't heard of it yet, but glad it did!  

The food is so fresh and has the right amount of spice and taste.  The atmosphere is very chill and artsy.  Our waitress was very friendly and talked about how the new restaurant came to be. 

The only thing I was kinda upset about was their crepe machine was broken and I was looking forward to one since they look delicious!

I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Super cozy. BYOB. Great music. Crepe for desert is fantastic. Glad this place is in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise.  Although I have to admit I was a little nervous walking in because Helvetica is situated on a weird, dead block of Detroit Ave.  Cute little interior that feels more like a coffee place than a juice bar.  Our server Nate was very kind and let me sample a few of the smoothies.  The pineapple, spinach, cranberry and lime one was very good as was the Guavanana.  I ordered chips and salsa and a side of Barbacoa.  The Barbacoa was really good.  They also offer two house made sauces and both are yummy.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"While the food was good, portions were small and the pace of the service was abysmal.  The lone server talked and waited on friends while we waited over 25 minutes for the check.  Next time we are in the neighborhood, we'll go to Barroco."}
{"text":"About as unique as you'll get without visiting Chi or NYC.  Cool in a raw way."}
{"text":"Best good close to home! I love this place! Cool atmosphere inside and good food! Great smoothies! Laid back atmosphere. Good for families or huge groups of friends."}
{"text":"Just went to this great little place on a Groupon and loved it!!!  Vegan platter, barbacoa tacos, and a citrusy lime beverage called a Lulo, all excellent!  Good portions, very personable server, food came out promptly...  Great all around.  This restaurant is related to Barroco also in Lakewood over on Madison, some cross-over menu items, great value!"}
{"text":"A Groupon introduced me to this great restaurant. The food was very tasty I would highly recommend checking it out. My only gripe be that it was pretty cold inside the restaurant. No one likes to eat with a jacket on."}
{"text":"Great food, byob, and healthy! I went here on a weekday evening. We brought our own beers and they supplied a bottle opener and glasses. The service was great, very attentive. We drew with the crayons on the tablecloths. They have a unique seating area where some of the seating is along these long benches with some pillows. Hard to explain. It would have been nice to have some dimmers on the lights since we were there around 7 and it was dark outside. But I don't think they are quite finished decorating yet. 

We got the chips and salsa and the salsa was very fresh and a kinda pico. Then I had the ropa vieja. It is kind of like a naked burrito. It was very good. It came with plantains too but I wasn't a fan of those so the bf ate them. The bf got a zucchini salad that he said was really good but also small. I looked at the facebook page - http://www.facebook.com/Helveticajuicebar - and wow I am going to have to try one of those crepes and juice!"}
{"text":"I was expecting something special based on the reviews; I actually was not that impressed. I would rate it as average.

Cons:
I walked in to see the server set a plate down to the wrong table to only to hear the group of kids say it wasn't theres; It was the table next to them.
Salsa was bland and my salad was average. My husband said his tacos were alright, nothing special, and not enough food there to keep him satisfied. I could tell he wasn't impressed. His comment on the experience was that if he was there years back before he was married, he would only go there if it got him laid...lol 
Had to pass around the \"sauces\" from table to table bc they didn't have enough for three tables.
My server forgot about my dressing, but I'm guessing he was just busy. 
Over heard the server tell other guests the groupon deal has caused them to lose money, therefore they were short of certain ingredients. That has to suck for them!

Pros:
Best part BYOB!
Ambiance was nice
Although server could have been better at serving he was very polite
I think with some more time and experience this place could be better...
Would I go back? Its something healthy and quick which isnt always easy to find so there's a possibility!"}
{"text":"Food was great. We had burritos, quesadillas, taco, and smoothie. Everything had a ton of flavor. It was inexpensive but everything was fresh. Staff was very nice. Seems like they are still trying to figure out a system . Once they do it will be 5 stars. Small neighborhood feel. Very welcoming and comfortable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for some time now and i thought i would try it out after seeing it on groupon.  i dont like typing out long detailed reviews so ill just say this.  The food was less then mediocre, i had to drain my taco from what seemed like a never ending water supply as my other taco took a bath in the poorly presented dish.  The waiter/kid i think may have never served a table before,  not surprised cause he looked 13.  Usually tables get napkins, silverware, and WATERS, not here.  Probably wont go back, if you want tacos goto taco tantos or barrio both in lakewood.  Or backstage and public house in west park."}
{"text":"What a let down. Came in with a groupon. The atmosphere is awesome, the music was lively. I ordered every type of soft taco to try each one. None of them had any flavor. Bland. I did love my smoothie. It was a pineapple with spinach etc. But the food was horrible and the service. Well he was trying but he just really sucked. I came in and sat with my daughter. Waited for him to approach us with our drinks so we can order. Two gentlemen come in and he takes care of their take out order (they had to order it with a menu) while we sit and wait. Seriously? Take our order then deal with them."}
{"text":"The pros: a good Cuban sandwich, artsy feel to the place, reading material and lots of eye candy on the walls and tables

Cons: Sandwich took a really long time to prepare and we were the only ones there.  The drink (guyabana batido) was not properly prepared and lacked sugar.  Server said he was distracted and forgot to put it in.  And most annoying for me than anything else was the awful dubstep/electronic music that played the whole time.  I wanted to shoot myself or better yet, the sound system, before high-tailing it out of there.  We should have gone to Barocco grill or Mi Pueblo...."}
{"text":"In a word - awesome. 

I have only been to this place once, but I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I found them on Groupon a few months ago, and have wanted to go since then. I had high expectations, and they definitely lived up to them. Take a look at their menu! The crepes (which I still haven't tried look absolutely delicious). I will have to try them next time I go.

The ambience is kind of cool. Everyone there seemed super friendly. It reminded me kind of of college - hippie, laid back, and comfortable. The area is kind of small, but it fits the description. And they seem to make an avid effort to use fair trade and organic products.

I was hoping to try a smoothie, but they were ouot of one of the ingredients to make it, so the waitress recommended one of their juices - something called the Curuba Juice. It was pretty decent. I think I will enjoy their juices a lot, but that one may have been a little bit too rich for me. I actually thought the portions were pretty decent - I couldn't finish my sandwich (it was called a Maruda sandwich, and it had plantain on it), but I also may just have been full.  I think they may have recently changed that particular item too, because it looks a little different than the picture they had of it on their website - definitely a lot bigger.

All in all it was a great experience, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Lakewood, albeit the place seems to have an image issue. We couldn't figure out what the helvetica font had to do with South American cuisine?  After all Helvetica is the latin demonyn for Swiss. Perhaps this place is trying to be hipster ironic? The walls also had scrap wood nailed all over them, it wasn't tasteful nor decorative. The lights on the ceiling still had their plastic wrap on them!

Now to the food. The South American fruit juices are amazing. You get to choose from at least 6 different fruit juices that you wouldn't see on any other menu in Northeast Ohio. The cuisine itself was inventive and flavorful. I had the barbacoa sandwich, which had delicious fried plantains on it, however it was served on a pre packaged bun. The broccoli slaw tacos with black beans were a good balance of savory and spicy but the corn taco shells were disappointingly dry. The chips were flavorful but could have used some salsa."}
{"text":"We attempted to go for lunch today, but despite a large \"lunch and dinner\" sign in the window, they do not open until 5pm on weekdays. They have no website, and the Yelp information is no longer relevant. They are also closed on Sundays. I hope to try them soon, as I have heard good things from a few friends."}
{"text":"The Tacos were pretty good, but everything else was just bad. Thank goodness I was using a groupon and not paying full price or I would have been more pissed.

We ordered a dish I cannot remember the name of with pulled pork on top with corn and black beans with plantains on the side. It was a very pricey menu item at $14 and definitely did not deliver at that price. It had very little flavor and had very little meat. A naked burrito from Chipotle would have more flavor and is probably just as filling at half the price. Yes, they didn't even meet my expectation of \"better than a Chipotle burrito\" which is sad. The fried plantains were the only decent thing, the pulled pork was dry and the rice was rice and minimally seasoned.

Next, we got the tacos. I'd give the tacos 4/5 stars. We had two different types and both had very good flavor and tasted fresh. If I had known how mediocre the main dish was going to be I would have ordered more tacos instead.

At this point, I was slowly started to feel the smoke in my eyes. I was sitting in the furthest corner away from the kitchen and my eyes were irritated for HOURS after. I also had to take a shower because my hair smelled like their oil.

Any, the grand finale was the nutella crepe. If I could give this negative stars, I would. It was HORRIBLE. It was folded in half with no ice cream like in the picture from their Facebook and it was HARD. I couldn't cut it with their knives, I just had to pick it up from the plate and bite it off. It was extremely cold in the middle and it was obviously not prepared fresh. I have never paid for a worse desert in my life and I couldn't believe it was supposedly $6.

It was a ride. From the main course, it was at 2/5. After the tacos, I would have raised the average to 3/5. From smelling like their kitchen and me and my wife's eyes watering from the smoke I would lower the average to 1.5 or2. And from the desert, which I felt was like a smack in my face, puts it right at 0, but since Yelp doesn't allow zero stars, I'll leave one."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's cute, albeit a bit unfinished inside (chipped paint, shoddy upholstery). The staff was nice, but also lacked polish. My juice was way too sweet for me, but cold and fresh. Sweetness can be a matter of taste. I got a carnitas burrito, the special, and found it good quality but without much personality or flavor. I plan on trying again in a few months to see if Helvetica has worked out the kinks."}
{"text":"Tried this place after hearing about it from a few people.  They may have hyped it up for me?

Overall I thought the place was pretty good.  I tried the tacos, which were decent.  I didn't think they were anything special.  Their sauces were nice.  Their selection of juices was definitely unique and the one I got (I can't remember which one it was...) tasted good.  I think what probably brings people back is the ambiance, it's definitely a cool hip vibe--reminds me of places you'd find in California. Oh and BYOB is always a plus."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend to have some lunch with some friends. People have raved about this place, so I thought I'd check it out. 

The cafe is definitely cute and hippy. There's plenty of art hanging on the wall to  make the place look more lively and entertain you. Reminds me of eateries around Venice Beach, maybe because they also had reggae/Latin/surfer music playing in the background. 

The food was ok. My friends and I all got different tacos. They didn't have any chicken items that day, and I had to get tacos instead of the burrito I originally wanted because they ran out of the larger tortillas. Probably would've been nice to be told this before receiving our dishes, but oh well. The tortillas were regular store bought tortillas...and I don't think they warmed them up even. The meat was very tender and good though, so I was happy about that. They also give you 3 sauces to add a bit more flavor to your food. 

The smoothies and juices were good. My friends got the guava and banana smoothie, and I got the lulo juice. It was a refreshing lime juice drink, but not too sour and with a touch of sweetness. I would definitely order it again if I came back.

Overall it's a cute place to relax with friends and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"First time here and I already love the place. Lakewood has a ton of restaurants, but I am always disappointed by the options -- there's a whole lot of really boring bar food.. Luckily, Helvetica is not more bar food. Comfortable place with very friendly service.I took a quick glance at the menu and settled for Maduro sandwich with caramelized plantain slices and shredded beef topped with churrasco sauce which only set me back $6. I am sure I'll be trying everything on the menu in the next couple weeks, probably starting with the crepes. The portions are a bit on the small side as you'd sort of expect, but given the price/quality, the food is a fantastic deal. Since the prices are reasonable, next time I am just going to order an extra item or two. They also serve Rising Star coffee and fresh juices along with pastries and a bunch of other stuff."}
{"text":"Walked in on a rainy day to grab some lunch. My bearded bandito and I had stopped here for smoothies a few weeks back and found ourselves drooling over the food being served throughout the restaurant.  Upon walking out the door, refreshing smoothies in hand, we vowed to return.

Upon return, let me tell you, we were not disappointed.  We were ushered in with a warm welcome and immediately provided water and menus. We ordered a plate of guac to share.  It was divine. So fresh! Man, do I love fresh avocado on a nice salty chip.

We decided, after much deliberation to try the Ropa Vieja sans meat plus beans. OH SWEET MOTHER MARY. The flavor! The texture! The rice! The plantains! The beauty of this meal is that you could taste each piece of it.  Unlike some dishes I have had in the recent past the focus here is more on tasting the wonderful harmony of all the different veggies and spices in your dish than the mixed up end product.  I love this food. I think you will too. In all seriousness, this place is owned by one of the owner's of Barocco (on Madison) so what could really go wrong here?

Bonus, while trying to scoop our brains back into our heads post-lunch. We were offered a sample of some vegetarian chili one of the employees had mixed up (on a whim) the previous night.  I hope the chili makes it to the menu.  It was glorious.

So, real talk, this place is cheap and totally worth a skip down Detroit. Get an iced coffee and bask in the glory that is Helvetica Juice Bar."}
{"text":"Yum! 

Not just juice! I was not expecting tacos! Stopped here for a bite while biking home from Gordon Square today and was pleasantly surprised with both the food and juice. 

I had two tacos - barbacoa and carnitas. Two-taco plates come with lime wedges and some tortilla chips. Very tender and flavorful meat, ample, fresh toppings and 4 sauces at your table to try. I also tried the Lulo juice at the recommendation of the server. Looks super gross - brownish green with a thick brown foam at the top - but is very yummy and refreshing! I don't really know how to describe the flavor. It was semi-sweet and had a subtle, not strong flavor. You'll have to try it for yourself. 

Atmosphere is kind of coffee shop-ish and is comfy to just hang out for a bit and work on something or read. There are no tables in the middle of the room, just around the edges so it feels really open. Plenty of outlets for charging your stuff and free Wifi. 

Definitely recommend giving them a try when you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for Yelp. But when I tell you I've just had the best burrito I've ever had in my entire life, know that mean it. The menu, atmosphere, and staff are all 5 stars. PLUS, it's BYOB!!! Do yourself a favor and come here to eat"}
{"text":"love love LOVE this new place in lakewood.

the tacos are mouth-watering good and i love the sauces they provide. it seems that they have a couple everyday sauces as well some they experiment with. they were all really, really good.

i liked trying the different juices and the smoothie i had was superb! great new restaurant. i want to eat here every day! i just wish they were open later."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Helvetica for the first time for dinner and very much enjoyed our smoothies and food.  I got the peanut butter/spinach smoothie, which was brought out before the food, and was pleased with it.  We both ordered the veggie burrito and really enjoyed them.  The food was fresh and the burritos were packed with guacamole, beans, rice, and veggies.

Our experience was good enough the first time that we bought Groupons for our second visit.  Clearly when we visited the second time, a drastically different chef prepared our food from the last time.  We both ordered smoothies and the veggies burritos again.  The smoothies were fine.  The veggie burritos really lacked in flavor, though, and had completely different ingredients than the first time.  The ingredients for the burritos aren't listed on the menu, so what you get seems to really depend on what night you go.  Both times we went, the staff consisted of one young and very quiet waitress but we never had to wait long for our service."}
{"text":"I've been trying to write more reviews, but my writing is feeling very meh lately. That said, this place deserves a gushing, albeit poorly written review. Yikes, godspeed, etc.

Because I'm lame, I'm also going to casually mention that I was in Colombia about a month ago (this is totally relevant) and the guanabana  and lulo juices at Helvetica are essentially slightly watered down versions of their glorious South American cousins. Which is a good thing, because where the heck else are you going to find guanabana and lulo juices in Cleveland (and really, America? Besides Miami. By the way, I went to the Cavs vs. Miami game last night and OMG I hate LeBron and I am now a diehard Cavs fan. That's all, had to share). 

In any case, we were so pleased with the restaurant and the excellent service that we ordered coffee, and as much as I dislike coffees that are also proper nouns, Rising Star is so much better than Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle, Four Barrel and all their poncy and slightly rancid tasting ilk. Go Cavs!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! This place was great.

After trying two times to go to this place (and each time it was closed-watch their hours and the days they are open!), we finally got to go to Helvetica tonight.... and loved it.

The inside is simple yet super designed. A small cafe, the walls are lined with records, and modern art-including a large face drawn onto the wall, and some wood fixtures. There's comfy bench seating all around the cafe as well. To top it off, each of the tables has a white paper and crayons...so you can draw on it! I found it amusing that every couple in the cafe was drawing on the tables with crayons. 

Helvetica has an amazing selection for juices.  We got the Curuba (an exotic banana passion drink with soy milk.... it was REALLY good!) and the aguapanela. We ordered two tacos- the barbacoa (good) and the broccoli slaw- my fave, but man, it was SPICY! 

For dessert, we ordered the Maduro crepe- it came out in a coffee cup (so cool!), with the cinnamon plantains in yogurt, with a wafer on top. Man, that was GOOOD!!

This place is definitely cool and hip. I absolutely love the juices too. I'll be back to you, Helvetica! A must go!"}
{"text":"My dad told me a new juice bar opened up on Detroit. I would rather eat whole fruits most of the time. Juices taste good but I rather get all of the nutrition and fiber though. Plus if you just eat a bite of each fruit, chew on it for a while and eat another one at the same damn time, your mouth turns into a juicer! It is really cool and I sugest trying it! I saw a couple people reviewed Helvetica and said it was good. I decided to stop in. I found out that it is the same owner as Barocco right up the street on Madison. It is great to see someone investing on this side of Lakewood. The food was excellent. I had a passion fruit drink that I chugged before my food was done. I had the beef, rice and beans dish which was great. I only ate half then had part two after a few beers late night in my apartment. I added an avocado which really set things off. The Cuban sandwich is also really good. They carry Rising Star coffee which is also a plus. I had a good conversation with a guy who worked there about sneakers and what our all-time favorites are. Mine would be the Jordan 5, original Bo Jackson's and the 1995 Jason Kidd Zoom Flights. He only wears sneakers but I tried to explain the merits of a pair of Wallabee Clarks or Timberland work boot. I refuse to wear sneaks with jeans!"}
{"text":"The place:
A fascinating place. You walk in and are immediately immersed in a tropical? environment. There was loud world music playing, bright green and orange paint on the walls and a whole wall of exposed brick. Bright and colorful art adorned the walls. An iPad running Square sat opposite the door on a low table covered in old burlap coffee sacks. The kitchen would have been visible to the dining room had a too narrow window blind not attempted to cover the opening in the wall. Seating consisted of tables with one side booth and one side chairs. Very easy to rearrange for large groups, of which there were none, however the pillows serving as cushion to the brick-backed \"booth\" were definitely not plentiful enough to accommodate as many people as the bench could. 

The food:
I ordered a banana peanut butter and spinach smoothie ($4.5). Taste was good, but consistency was too liquidy. I'm not sure what milk it was made with (2% or soy) as the waiter didn't ask. As an entree (since I had to order one in order to use my Groupon) I got a pulled pork dish. It was served with a big scoop of white rice centered on the plate and a too small portion of pulled pork on top. Surrounding that were four Toston sliders with corn, pico and guac on top. 

Service:
A couple of friendly guys were running the place; one cook, one waiter. They were friendly. 

Other:
Free WiFi-see the chalk board on the wall for the long numerical password. Metered street parking. I had a $22 for $11 Groupon for my visit.

All in all the flavour was there but the portion sizes were too small and the music too low. Despite the friendly service, the free WiFi and the signs inviting you to chill I'd opt to head to Starbucks down the road after I ate."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, K, and I decided to utilize our Helvetica groupon for a lunch date. We had been talking about going for awhile, but the groupon made it possible for us to sample as many of the goodies at once for a small investment. 

The Food
We both got smoothies to start. Mine was the Yaya (banana, strawberry, and mango) and his was the Neue Paradise (banana, strawberry and pineapple). Mine was thicker and his was more juice like, but both were delicious. 

For lunch I got two tacos. I probably could've gotten just one since they really do stuff them full. You get to pick a meat (I chose pulled pork) and three additional toppings (I chose corn salsa, white rice and mozzarella cheese). They did put sour cream under the meat as well (which I wasn't expecting and thankfully I do not hate sour cream like K does) and I assume it is used to kind of hold the whole thing together. 

K got a Barbacoa burrito. It typically comes with rice, black beans, cheese, a choice of salsa (tomato or corn) and madoras (fried plantains). He did not get salsa or the madoras, but it was still a good sized portion. He says it was \"better, but not as big as chipotle\". There was some weird greenish hot sauce he used that at first tasted odd, but had a lot of fire to it so he slathered it on the burrito.

For dessert we split the nutella crepe. It was definitely plenty for two people and delicious. I would recommend that the cafe try using fresh berries instead of frozen ones. In the winter I understand that can be difficult to do, but right now there are plenty in the grocery and would certainly enhance the taste a lot. My only disappointment with the dessert is that I don't remember \"peanuts\" being listed as an ingredients on the menu. There was a light sprinkling of crushed peanuts on the top of the crepe and I was glad that neither of us has a peanut allergy, but I don't really like them. It would've taken far too long to have them make a whole new one so I just dealt with it, but that is something I think should be listed on a menu. 

The Atmosphere/Facility/Staff/Etc.
Fun and interesting. The music was a mix of different Latin American styles and really fit the scene. The place is lined with loungy bench seats along the walls and pillows. Everything is very eclectic. I could seriously see myself curling up in a corner and writing a college paper in there. The bathroom was very clean and smelled really good. The waitress was friendly and attentive, but didn't bother us constantly like some do. While we were in there we saw a family with two young children enjoying lunch, some interesting punk rock looking people getting food to go, a couple of hipsters picking up coffees, and a young woman looking for a place to work quietly with wifi access. Unfortunately their wifi was down for the day, but she ordered some coffee and food and stuck around anyway. 

We were there quite awhile and had a pleasant afternoon. We were also very stuffed in the end. We will definitely go back some time for lunch, but I couldn't see this as a place I'd go for dinner. I like other reviewers wonder why a cafe doesn't open earlier than 11, but they seem to have a good thing going. Perhaps the neighborhood just isn't the type to support indie coffee house business at 6am."}
{"text":"I had the tacos. Awesome. Good selection of toppings. 3$ good size tacos. Very friendly and attendant staff. I like places where people show you they care and really want their business to prosper, not just function. 
Ill definitely be back, they have awesome smoothie mixes. Wanna try all of em!"}
