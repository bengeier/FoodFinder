{"text":"This is the only deli in the neighborhood and thankfully it is amazing! You can get great lunch or dinner sandwiches. The deli meat is great - very high quality and very fresh. And I love that you can get it by the pound. The pre-made sides are also a great option. It's so refreshing to have a little deli near by."}
{"text":"Great location!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy, the service was ok, but the food was on point! I got the Crispy Chicken Bagel and my wife got the Meatloaf Sandwich.  Both were cooked perfectly and had amazing flavor. They were both served with sides of the Best Homemade Chips I've Ever Had.  They were so light and crisp and were reason alone to come back!  We really enjoyed our meals. Perfect comfort food! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've stopped in for lunch a couple of times now and I loved my orders. Their seafood salad is perfect and my favorite that I've had from anywhere. It's not overly dressed, or over seasoned. It's prepared just right and very fresh. I really enjoyed their salmon and prosciutto sandwich too. Looking forward to trying out their restaurant next door for dinner with our two sons. They even have kid friendly options."}
{"text":"not open!! this place has excellent soups and a good variety of sandwich options. just make sure you have a backup plan if you want to stop in because theyre often randomly closed. hours on the website say open till 6 in one place and open till 8 in another but today when i got there at 4:30 they were closed. this is the third time in a month this has happened. yesterday i called to confirm they would be open till 8 but at 7:35 the door was already locked. panera definitely isnt better but at least they are open when they are supposed to be.  unfortunately i am done trying to patronize a shop that keeps disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was a staple before it moved and now that it's moved, it's even better!  They used to do mostly just deli-style sandwiches, but upon expanding they've added some more complex options, such as wings and hotter foods.  Consistently tasty food with friendly and fast service. Plus, now a place to sit and enjoy the food right away instead of taking it back to the office.  I'm happy that the Iovino restaurants are doing well."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place still exists.  Staff seem annoyed every time a customer comes in to place an order."}
{"text":"IO Deli is a pocket dimension of gourmet delicacies located a couple of doors down from Cafe IO, its parent restaurant. On two occasions last week, Kay and I found ourselves exploring it, Challengers of the Unknown that we are. 

Located within a narrow corridor of a storefront, the proprietors own a panini press and a meat slicer and are not above using both to full effect. 

Take for instance the masterful Corned Beef panino. A Reuben in sheep's clothing, the meat was ample as was Swiss cheese, the tart sauerkraut, the creamy Thousand Island dressing,  all of contained expertly within toasted rye bread and halved bisected. Salty, creamy, sweet strings were plucked, making for beautiful gastronomic music. Complimented by a large, halved dill pickle, Kay and I longed for a patch of green grass and a blanket. 

Mama Rea's \"Famous\" Potato Salad came next, quite frankly sending Grandma's to the nursing home for the rest of her days. I couldn't detect much else in the potato salad other than a sugary mayonnaise dressing and some mild herbs (perhaps parsley). There were no eggs, crunchy veggies, or paprika involved. No, this potato salad, featuring thinly sliced discs of spud excelled with an elegance of economy that I'd never encountered before. 

Dessert was a successfully chewy bake-sale level M&M chocolate chip cookie that put my candy canines to bed happily. 

My second visit centered around the Pizza Dog and the Squid Salad. Grilled in the panin press like the corned beef sandwich, the Smith's weiner was topped with mozzarella, tomato sauce, pepperoni, peppers, and a relish of tomato and red onion, taking it to Chi-Town in a deep pan pleasantly. 

The Squid Salad included chilled, al dente calamari (tentacles and all) and parsley in a simple olive oil/vinegar dressing. Gourmet as all get-out, this could have been served on a fancy plate in more opulent environs for much more than I was charged. It was as if it had been swiped from a table at Il Pizzaiolo via teleportation. Some fafcat musta got my tuna melt instead. 

IO Silverrrrr! Get on your horses and do some takeout here, pronto!"}
{"text":"Time to update my review since they have moved next door to a bigger space and u can now eat in.  Nice space with a board the has the specials and soup choices and even a taco choice.  Other items are on the menu.  Just order at the counter and they will bring it to you or help yourself to the soup.  They appear to get a good amount of take out business.  
Had a cup of the Tomato Bisque soup on this cold snowy day, one of favorites.  To go with the soup I ordered the Hot Pastrami with Swiss that had a large amount of tasty pastrami with some sautéed onions and mustard aioli on marble rye.
Then stop by next door to Kara Kakes for a delicious cupcake."}
{"text":"Average at best. Agree with prior review that staff seemed annoyed I was there. Order a buffalo chicken panini, but no buffalo favor. Bread was soggy and blue cheese that came with it was in a packet with it was not homemade.

Very disappointed compare to café I/O"}
