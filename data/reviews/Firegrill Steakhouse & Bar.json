{"text":"Decent find downtown Montreal. Food was well prepared and moderately priced for the city. Very courteous and swift service. Good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm a little ashamed we ate here... Not terrible, not great. Like a chain steakhouse restaurant. Uninspired menu. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"After eating a ton of carbs, i was craving for meat.  Walking down st. Catherine we found this steak house just off to the side and decided to give it a try.

Atmosphere looked pretty good. Sat down and quickly ordered a NY steak and prime rib.  Our food came out pretty fast.  Cooked just the way i like it.  I selected veggies as my side.  Yes,  i actually ordered veggies over fries.  I just had a lot of carbs and decided to take a little break from it. 

Price wise, almost equivalent to the  prices at the Keg.  With that being said, i would rather go Keg over here.  You get more value for your money at the Keg.

Will i come back... if you are looking for a non franchise steak place in dt Montreal, i guess this is your best bet.  I would personally look for another place next time."}
{"text":"Typical steak chain restaurant that is overpriced.  Save your time and money and eat at one of the many fine independent French restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Service was awesome , although I got the steak salAd and really didn't enjoy it . Perhaps I didn't read the menu clearly . The rest of my family got steaks and said they were to die for !! Along with the house salads and burger . Bit pricey but nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Avoid. 

Ordered the Manhattan steak. Not a great cut but I was looking forward to the Brandy Peppercorn sauce. 
The sauce unfortunately was bland. The steak was cooked as ordered, but was surprisingly full of grissle - probably 30%. 

Service was weak. Prompt upon seating and then disappeared. Had to flag down another server to refresh our drinks when the plates hit the table. 

Focus seems to be on turning tables rather than putting quality on the plates."}
{"text":"Pour cette première critique, je vous amène en plein cur du centre-ville, sur la rue Stanley, au Firegrill Restaurant et Bar. 

BOUFFE : De la même catégorie que Bâton Rouge et Keg, Firegrill tente justement, avec succès, de jouer dans la cour des grands steakhouses de la ville. Avec un menu des plus classiques, on y retrouve le même genre d'assiettes de côtes levées, filets (''tendres'') de poulet, burgers trop gros, coupes New York 12oz etc. Pour les plus petits appétits ou budgets, vous serez assurément satisfaits avec une salade au steak et fromage bleu (~15$), leur sandwhich au thon (15$) ou encore les linguini aux fruits de mer (~20$). 

Pour les Gourmands comme moi,  c'est les énormes poitrines de poulet, burgers et l'excellent steak coupe NY 12 oz avec fromage de chèvre (~34$) qui vous attendent. Pour y être allé quelques fois en groupe, le choix le plus populaire semble être le duo de Filets de poulet et Côtes levées (~22$). J'ai personnellement préféré les côtes levées du Madison's, celles du Firegrill étant un peu fades, mais pas autant que les horribles côtes du Keg... Bref.

Amateurs de l'océan, quelques choix de poissons et fruits de mer s'offrent à vous. L'assiette de Filet de saumon propose une généreuse portion de saumon bien grillé (~20$), avec un choix de sauce Tériyaki ou  beurre citronné à l'aneth. À ma dernière visite au Firegrill, j'ai essayé le Bar de mer Chilien (~27$) qui s'est avéré pas mal caoutchouteux et huileux, malgré sa bonne consistance et la salsa d'ananas qui matchait parfaitement. 

Les desserts consistent aux gâteaux habituels qu'on retrouve dans la plupart des restos (~7-10$, gâteau chocolat, fromage, carotte, crème glacée, etc). Rien d'impressionnant, mais ça complète bien le souper. Tant qu'à être au centre-ville, je vous conseille d'allez faire un tour au Cacao70 pour vous sucrer la dent.

SERVICE/AMBIANCE: Sur la dizaine de fois où j'ai mangé au Firegrill, j'ai eu droit à un service typique ''centre-ville'', soit rapide, relativement efficace, où ils vous portent l'attention au début pour prendre vos commandes, mais peuvent disparaître par la suite... jusqu'à ce que vient le moment de régler la facture. Rien de trop grave, par contre. Grand resto avec une dose de chic, moins sombre que le Keg, mais une petite coche plus moderne que Bâton Rouge et ses banquettes bourgognes de 1992.

COOL : Place idéale pour les groupes, beaucoup de places, parking intérieur gratuit avec achats de 40$ et +, après 5pm, bonne alternative aux autres steakhouses.

BOF : Présentation simpliste des plats et  service à améliorer légèrement, mais encore une fois, rien de terrible."}
{"text":"Great service nice restaurant . Good portions of food."}
{"text":"I love this place, the staff was super friendly the food was amazing..the bbq pulled pork steamed buns OMG!! I wasn't happy I had to share, the ribs were an excellent choice so delish!!  I am back in Orlando and still thinking about those steamed buns! 

Thanks to the supervisor who was super nice, the salad guy and sous chef that was just slaying it in the kitchen! They definitely help create lasting memories on our trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Avoid this dump. Firegrill represents everything that's wrong with chain restaurants - cavernous spaces, Holiday Inn low-rent decor, sauces and soups that come out of industrial-sized drums, and robotic waitstaff trained by some wage slave loser with a \"MANAGER\" pin on his polyester shirt. It just flat out sucks, and if you waste your time and money here you're wasting the opportunity to experience a cool bistro or cafe somewhere else in Montreal. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Been here many times and enjoyed it each time. The roast beef is amazing. I will usually order that with the garlic mashed potatoes. Sometimes I will order the Chilean sea bass, but since the species is going extinct, I do try to refrain from having it although it is another one of my  favorites. The place is spacious and comfortable. Great for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"This is a place I have frequented about every 2 weeks for the last 1-2 years.
It's a relatively calm place, mid downtown and it seems to me that it's always 30-50% full. It's quite spacious with comfortable benches and chairs, no outside seating area.
The food is great, and the portions are quite large. The ribs and chicken meal ($26) has so far been my favourite. The ribs are among my favs of any place.
Servers are nice.
Moderate food presentation and the recent hike in prices have definitely damaged the place, other than all it's all great."}
{"text":"Just visiting from Toronto this place was amazing great food and service. Fall off the bone melt in your mouth ribs, fresh salad, and a side of bread and wild rice. Highly recommend ;)"}
{"text":"If you're a steakhouse, the one thing you have to do is cook the steaks how they are ordered.  I ordered medium-rare manhattan.  I was served something completely black and well done.  Everyone at my table had their steaks overdone with no pink or red at all.  Very embarrassing for the chef."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of selection of various items from steak to seafood and chicken etc. good wine selection and premium liquors. good prices but don't go expecting free cake for your birthday because they aren't on a low end style of restaurants. The service was quick friendly spoke great English and French."}
{"text":"This place was not very good, so I would recommend you not go there. If, however, you must, do not order a regular adult burger; order the kids burger, because it is the exact same thing on a smaller plate, even the same amount of fries, and it costs half as much. Definitely share your plate with someone or plan on taking some home, because the portions are extreme. No one asked how we wanted our burger cooked, and it came out a shade under charcoal. We ordered a side salad and never got it, and my husband's drink came neat when he asked for on the rocks. The fries were good, but that is no reason to go there, since plenty of places have good fries."}
{"text":"It was my boyfriends' birthday so I made a reservation using Open Table at Fire Grill on Stanley in Montreal on March 20th. 2015 at nine o'clock. 
We arrived at 9:05 and we're greeted by a brunette hostess, I gave her  my name and we were sat immediately at a corner booth near the bar. We noticed it wasn't particularly busy, despite it being a Friday. We looked through our menus eager to try their cocktails and ready to order their famous prime rib, but no one came to see us or even acknowledge our presence. We both work in the service industry, so we have a certain level of understanding when a server is busy. So to help give the servers a sign that we hadn't been greeted, we placed our menus at the edge of the table in hopes of being noticed by any of the staff members. Albeit much to our disappointment no one came. 
The closest we got to being served was when a woman with brown hair in a ponytail went to the table next to us and took their credit card payments, but then she just walked away without even looking at us. We waited for another couple minutes, but it was 9:35 and we were so disappointed that we decided to leave. As we left, we helped a woman who was having difficulty getting her baby carriage up the stairs and into the restaurant while the hostess (and someone who looked like a manager) just chatted with each other only a few feet away from us. 
Finally I am only complaining on yelp because I told my friend who works at fire grill about what happened to us on Friday, March 20th 2015.  He told us that management assured him that  it was IMPOSSIBLE that this incident occurred. So now I am faced with being called A LIAR. Which I would like to assure that I am not. The only communication I have received from the Fire Grill was a cancellation of our reservation at 9:45 pm that night. I am disappointed in their lack of accountability and oversight into believing that as an establishment they are infallible."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was great. They were easily able to handle a group of 14 of us in town for a bachelor party. I would deffinetly recommend to anyone in town for dinner"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner a few nights ago, and the service to the food was amazing.  Several of us had the filet mignon and it was the best cut of meat and it was cooked perfectly.  I am new to Montreal and this is a fabulous place to go to relax and enjoy a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Chipotle sandwich with caramelized onions and bacon.  It was fantastic. Laurie was awesome. I love this place."}
{"text":"Very good place. Steak was good and this was the first place in Montreal with good customer service which seems very rare for this city."}
{"text":"My coworker and i came to this place while on business trip to Montreal and I'm SOOOOO GLAD she found this place cuz i REALLY LOVED IT!!!!
  
I thought price for the quality of the steak were very reasonable (~$25-35). i ordered peppered ribeye steak, came with a salad (house or caesar) and a side.  the steak was really good. They prepared the steak as exactly as i wanted (med rare).  mmmmm... 

ambiance was nice... we sat next to the window... watching the snow falling. service was meh.  it was ok. but steak, YUM!"}
{"text":"Toujours les meilleurs \"RIBS\" avec une grande qualité de service et propreté !
The top"}
{"text":"I ate here last time I was in Montreal. I tend to agree with some of the other reviews. It's a typical chain and frankly I regret not visiting other \"local\" restaurants that probably would have been much better. That being said, you can get a good steak here if that is all you are interested in."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this steakhouse..like ever.

For starters, the food is good. There's a wide selection of food and there's always something to suit your mood. 

The prices are also very reasonable for what you get - comparable or cheaper than the Keg.

Service has always been great for me both at this location and the one near Place Vertu.

The reason for the 3 stars is because although it's a nice place to go, it's nothing out of this world. Simply a nice dinner place. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Fire Grill is a large,classically styled steak house. We ended you here because my child was tired and hungry & it was there. We were greeted promptly, in a friendly manner. Our waitress approached us quickly and was friendly as well. There is plenty of attractive sounding foods on the menu but we went on the lighter side.  Let me say, I liked this place quite a bit, up until the time the food arrived. The dishes all looked wonderful. They arrived quickly and hot. Unfortunately the best dish was the kids mini burgers (which were nice).  The chicken club was OK but the \"Famous\" Chicken Tenders\" were a tremendous let down, freshly made but not seasoned at all, totally bland.  They were absolutely nothing special.  The chicken club was good as were the kids sliders, but nothing was great nor worth returning.  Montreal foodie town and there are MUCH better places to dine, skip this one."}
{"text":"My husband had a pasta dish which was good but on the bland side. I had the large Greek salad. This was good and very large. Our waitress was very nice and the overall service was fast. Nice atmosphere and bar area."}
{"text":"Les salades, les cocktails, les calmars et le macaroni au fromage sont delicieux. Bien pour les annif, mais ils ne coupent pas le gâteau. La deco est assez sombre. Sinon, le restau est situé directement à la sortie de la station Peel (pratique en hiver). Il y a du parking dans le stationnement en face au sous-sol. Le service est ok."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Food was excellent, I had a medium steak cooked perfectly, juicy. Prices were reasonable compared what I have been paying at other restaurants in Montreal. Good for lunch or dinner meetings and conversations with friends. And service was also great. The hostess was trilingual, French, Spanish and English."}
{"text":"We only came in here because we saw wings on the menu.  We simply went in for the wings on my #salaciouscanada tour.

Boy, it *was* exciting!  I've never tasted any wings like it before!  It was sweet, but then at the end had the flavor of buffalo... hrm!  Interesting!

And the coconut shrimp were HUGE.  HUGE. The hugest I've ever seen!  Buuuuut... we didn't stay for \"dinner\".  This is a steakhouse... and it's just too \"normal\" for a foodie trip.

want more of me?  you can find me at http://www.tastytwosome.com with videos and more! and on twitter @ladyleet. :)"}
{"text":"Ok food - terrible service. I would not go back. When the food is expensive you expect to at least have a good wait-staff. We waited 15 min to be greeted, 15 more min for waters that were never filled up again throughout our meal, and the waitress brought me Tabasco for crushed red pepper. We were not tended to once during our meal and had to walk the check up."}
{"text":"They make a pretty delicious filet mignon cooked medium! This place isn't cheap but if you order the right thing you'll be happy. Service is a bit bland, but not terrible. The restaurant is fairly large and parking is usually easy to find on the street. If you're looking to watch a game while grabbing a bite then, fear not, they have TV screens for your enjoyment as well!"}
{"text":"Came in for late night snack.

BAO buns were different and very tasty but the wings were burnt and scrawny. Had them here a year ago and they were very good so it was disappointing.

Waitress was very friendly but was no where to be found when we needed multiple drink refills. 

Would not recommend for a return visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the prime rib! Cooked perfectly ! My son had the ribs which he loved ! The loaded baked potato was delicious! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Our first trip to Montreal and we stopped in by chance while walking around to find a place for dinner near the Sheraton Le Centre. Service was very friendly, and the low light made for a nice atmosphere. The appetizer bread was whole wheat and tasty. The broad menu included several daily specials with soup/salad and two sides. We had the bone-in ribeye with garlic mash and a Cobb salad, and both entrees were fantastic. The steak was well-cooked at medium and flavorful, and the Cobb salad with chicken was very good as well, although it did need a bit of extra dressing. Overall a very positive, serendipitous experience that would bring us back again."}
{"text":"Our waiter George was very polite and attentive to start with even though he seemed rushed. I order the 10 oz bone in filet mignon and my friend the 8 oz regular filet, along with a salad and a bottle of wine.
The wine came quickly, the overly dressed and disappointingly bland Caesar salad next - it was so greasy we couldn't finish one between the two of us.
After a long wait, the steaks came. I almost spit out my first bite it was so overcooked.
My medium rare was grey and sawdust dry - George apologized and told me that a replacement would be right there in just a couple of minutes. My friend's steak was also overcooked, but his wasn't all grey and he was too hungry to wait. And I waited, and waited, and waited, and our waiter was nowhere to be found. More than half an hour later George came out of hiding with a steak for me and no apologies for the wait. This steak was cooked on uneven heat - half the steak is medium, the other half was well done. I was so hungry by now that I ate the medium half, but couldn't stomach the other part. When George eventually returned with my friend's dessert, I showed him the grey half steak on my plate, and he actually said to me: \"Well, it was a big steak\" and left the bill on the table. No apologies for the fact that it took more than an hour for me to get food, or that the food was so bad that we didn't eat almost half of the food brought to us.
Moral of the story, if you want terribly cooked, flavourless food with uncaring and inattentive service, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First meal here in Montreal and it didn't disappoint. The service was excellent. She was very friendly and prompt with everything. I'm the drinks, meal and desert we're all really good. I'd go here again!"}
{"text":"Just a couple of blocks off Ste. Catherine and a large dining space. I've tried lunch and dinner here. Both were great dishes and fit the bill. Service isn't always consistent but overall friendly and welcoming here. Also pretty good for appetizers and drinks. I recommend the small cheesecakes for dessert!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of appetizers to share. I found it strange that the apps came to the table 10 mins apart. The calamari was mediocre. The batter was too soft and would fall apart when you pick it up. However, the spinach and kale dip was delicious. It was nice and cheesy but not too heavy or lumpy like other places. 

I had the filet mignon rare and added mushroom sauce on the side for $4, since the steak was not bacon wrapped for flavor. I found $4 a bit steep for a small ramekin of sauce, but I love mushrooms so I thought I'd give it a try. The steak was well cooked but I thought it was a bit bland even with the mushroom sauce. 

The server was nice but she didn't come around much, so we ended up waiting around for quite a while between courses and picking up the bill. Overall, I would give the place a 2.5 but I rounded it up to 3. It's not bad, but there are better places for a steak."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The steak was not a great cut of meat. Roast beef sandwich was horrible and insanely salty and chewy. The actual roast beef seems to be the thing to order. If ever I have to go again, I'll try that."}
{"text":"Euh.... On est chez Madison ou chez Bâton Rouge? Ah non chez Firegrill! 
Même chose que les autres .... Les portions sont grosses et la viande abondante! 
Malheureusement du déjà vu et rien d'exceptionnel."}
{"text":"Belle soirée en famille à ce restaurant classique steakhouse. Notre serveuse Jennifer était adorable et a donné un très bon service. Les steaks de surlonge de boeuf étaient excellents, très gouteux, tendres, viande de très bonne qualitée. Nous avons tous aimé notre repas. Menu varié, intéressant pour ceux qui n'aiment pas la viande, fruits de mer & pâtes & salades. Je vous encourage à y aller!"}
{"text":"Great service awesome atmosphere and excellent food. Had the nap buns with BBQ pulled pork AMAZING! Calamari was very good too"}
{"text":"It is way too overpriced. the food and the drinks are just OK. The service is decent. Nice place with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This was not a planned visit - we wanted to go to another restaurant on the street that was closed - so we picked what was closest.  

The Firegrill was nothing to write home about.  The service for a Saturday lunch was okay - but it seemed under-staffed.  The food was alright, but pretty much like any other chain steak house-type restaurant I've been to.

Overall, an okay place to stop if you're in the area, but not worth going out of your way to visit."}
{"text":"Service was acceptable because the waitress was nice and polite, even though we received the ustensils 15-20mins after we got our appetizers. The food there was just mediocre, nothing special. The only plus for this restaurant is its location."}
{"text":"First time here though my friend had been here plenty - said he only gets the \"chicken thai salad\" and so I ordered it too (wondering if a non-steak item at a steak house is going to be worth it) ABSOLUTELY  - one of the best salads Ive ever had - truly, try it! 

Great service, atmosphere, competitive prices, great portions - a plus all around. 

Even have dental floss in the bathrooms - nice touch!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday at 10:45 PM. 15 minutes before they were closing and the service and food was decent. I got the steak sandwich. Their portions are huge and filling and for a an avg price for fine dining restaurants."}
{"text":"This was a decent place to have a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is cool, a nice upscale steakhouse with leather bar stools and comfy booths The rose sangria was good, as was the filet mignon and key lime pie. Nice hot baguettes with good butter, too."}
{"text":"If you need a break from French, this spot makes you feel like you're in English speaking Canada again....(which is not usually why you travel to Montreal!)  Food and atmosphere is pretty good...nothing unique though.  Feels like a Milestones or Earls.  

While you are downtown Montreal, there is so much more culture and many unique restaurants.  I would not recommend this one, unless as I said, you need a break from the culture."}
{"text":"I took my wife, her sister, husband and dad here for our last night in Montreal and what a great way to enjoy our last night. Food was Awesome, Service made you feel like you were the only table in the restaurant. Thank you for a great evening"}
{"text":"Ambiance is good. Service was phenomenal. The food was a little less than we expected. We got their wings as appetizer, and then steak, ribs, lobster salad and tuna sandwich as main meals. The wings were alright but good to get the taste buds ready for the main meals. The steak is great, ribs were too sweet, lobster salad is pretty good, and the tuna sandwich was one big generous piece of grilled tuna. Note, it's not tuna salad sandwich lol!!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar today, and ordered a small Greek salad and chicken tenders with fries.  The chicken tenders were yummy, but the fries were mediocre- maybe they had been sitting for awhile in the kitchen.  

The salad was very strange.  The chef decided not to finish chopping the tomatoes, and there was massive block of feta sitting on top of the entire salad.  We're talking enough cheese for at least 10 small Greek salads.  I was thinking that maybe they just make their salads in a weird way, but then shortly after getting my food, I noticed that the man who sat near me ordered a large Greek salad.  His salad looked typical of the Greek salads I'm used to seeing in pretty much every restaurant where I've ordered them.  There was lettuce in his, the tomatoes were actually chopped, and a typical portion of feta was *crumbled* into the salad.  I've never seen a menu in which a small version of a salad is completely different from the large version.  So the moral of this story is, don't bother with the small Greek salad. It's ridiculous!

At least the bartender gave phenomenal service.  She was a doll. Every bar should have one of her!  If it weren't for her, my experience would have only been 2 stars."}
{"text":"3 times in 3 years.

we seem to end up here every time we visit Montreal and the food is always excellent!

We ordered two steaks, I ordered the rib steak and my wife ordered the filet. Mine was cooked perfectly, hers was a bit undercooked - she ordered it medium and it was closer to mid-rare, but for a thick cut it was a quick fix. The steaks tasted delicious and the starter salad was equally great. it felt fresh and prepared for the meal, not pre-prepped like other restaurants we have been to.

The service was a bit on the slow side, and there was a wait to sit, even though we had a reservation, but we were not in a rush so it didn't impact the evening for our group."}
{"text":"A little more upscale chain restaurant.  Food was decent, service very average, and atmosphere ok.  If you're in Montreal, you can do so much better, but this place isn't a complete loss."}
{"text":"For the ambiance, service, food and price I give this place 5 stars!!!!! Had the best dinner with husband last night, we couldn't have picked a better place for what we wanted which was a nice romantic affordable dinner. I got surf and turf and my husband got the ribs and everything we ate was incredible. My filet was cooked perfectly and the ribs literally fell off the bone. The bread was also very good. The service was great. I really recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal, the menu had lots of great options. If we lived here we would be going here frequently!!!"}
{"text":"While my ribs/chicken combo was very tasty, my spouse's tuna sandwich was average.....but what really took a hit in our rating was service. The hostess seated us quickly but then walked steps ahead of us, plopped down the menus where we were supposed to sit then left us without a word. Our server was lacking as well.....took his time with our beverages, our order, and failed to show up without prodding from another server nut once and upon requesting more water, he later said he \"forgot\". Finally when after we had finished for 10-15 minutes with no sight of our waiter, I had to ask another for our check. Good food can be had at many places......good service....lacking here!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with three other friends. 
Had the farmers plate and seafood platter for appetizer to share. Most of the items were deep fried and greasy. The flavour only came from the sauces. 
The French onion soup was greasy and salty, I tried one spoon full and that was more than enough for me. 
I got the ahi tuna for main course, medium rare. The first few bites were ok, but it got more and more salty as I kept on eating. 
The ribs that my bf ordered was too sweet. However the baked potato was good with bacon, sour cream and green onion. 
The bill came out to be $50-70/person. Won't be back again. 
The service wasn't good either, had to remind the waiter to bring more utensils to us after we got seated."}
{"text":"A traditional steak house in Montreal. I passed by this restaurent a few times but never tried eating there . Everything was surprisingly tasty and good. Their meat dishes are magnificent. It is my favour steak house in downtown now. Life is just so simply... you can find happiness just by discover new things."}
{"text":"It was good, not sure if it is a chain restaurant - sort of felt like one, but it works.  Service was outstanding - mainly because there were about 18 of us and our young female waitress never dropped the ball once, we never went thirsty and our food was very well timed.
The food itself was very good, of course we did just finish the Tough Mudder and nothing goes better after that than some meat and beer, ok and wine - this place has all 3 in droves.
I would recommend this, if you are in the area and looking for a good steak dinner head on over, don't bother taking a cab anywhere else."}
{"text":"Aw Firegrill... I had good memories of this place. 

My boyfriend and I went there instead of Soubois and we did not regret. The breads were delicious and warm, the waitresses were attentive and the food was amazing! 

When we arrived at the entrance, the hostess direct us to a booth. It was incredibly crowded on a Saturday night but there were plenty of seats available and the staffs were quick and efficient. Our first order was fried calamari with mayo sauce. Then, I ordered a barley soup and New York steak with mashed potatoes. I finished my meals with a green tea. 

Overall, the experience at Firegrill totally compensate from the bad service we got at Soubois. Great food, great ambiance and great service."}
{"text":"First restaurant I visited in Montréal. Great ambiance and good variety of drinks. Bartender was friendly-she even wrote a list of sites I might be interested in visiting in the city. I visited a few and was not disappointed.

Food- mediocre"}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf for dinner here. the steak was great but the lobster tail was a little over cooked."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with Fire Grill, but there's nothing outstanding about it (as far as I can tell).  I had the salmon on linguine with rose sauce.  It was pretty tasty, though the salmon was a bit over done.  The side cesar salad was typical, over dressed but that was fine with me.

The service was great though."}
{"text":"The service is really good, prices are reasonable my friends and I go there when we don't know where to go! The chicken is really good also really like the spinach dip! My friend once tried the tuna sandwich did not like it at all, that was the only bad experience we had at firegrill!"}
{"text":"Tonight, The Keg was packed with over 1.5 hours of wait time. The Dominion Tavern was so packed they were not accepting walk-ins or reservations. The old go-to Reuben's had a line-up waiting all the way outside. So were in a bit of a spot for dining out after the movie and I was in no mood for fast food or anything deep fried. We were walking around looking when we spotted Firegrill. Never been, so I figured it couldn't hurt to try... that was the beginning of the end...

T H E   G O O D 
The restaurant looks impeccably clean and has a nice woody, loungy feel to it. And who doesn't enjoy leathery banquettes? As a steakhouse fanatic, it's the environment I enjoy. The manager's hiring practice of female staff indicates a strong interest in, how do I put it... the bouncy factor, not that there's anything wrong with that. Our server was polite and very friendly despite what follows. The Good ends here.

T H E   B A D 
The management cannot control his patrons. When young patrons go hog-wild like it's spring break, management has to step in before losing customers. It's better to have a few unhappy kids, than a bad reputation - more on this later.

If your wait-staff is all dressed to a tee, the manager should be dressed like he owns the place, not like a retail clerk at a Reno-Depot. If you're the boss, look the part. 

T H E   U G L Y
OK this is the part where you should get comfortable before going further. I'm about to go off on a rant, a diatribe, a disputation about basic rules of restoration and \"foodology\".

First of all... this, where I live, my island, is MONTREAL, not Val D'or. There's a steak spice mix named after my town. I think one can expect delicious steaks in Montreal; it's one of our culinary call-to-fame. Right up there with smoked meat, bagels & poutine. So if you dare call yourself a steakhouse and serve crap, maybe you should leave my island. 

First my favourite quote from Bourdain that pretty much explains my views on restaurants and gastronomy.

\"It says something about a person when you put chicken Caesar on the menu. You've crossed a line and you know it. It's the chef version of sucking Ron Jeremy's cock. If you do it late in your career, any notions of future stardom are usually pretty much out the window.\" -Anthony Bourdain, Medium raw.

Firegrill makes the atrocious, grotesque and egregious error in seating itself downtown and serving food I wouldn't make for myself on a boring night after work. I would sooner eat at McDonald's everyday and get more contentment from it. Hell I can do better with supermarket grub. People go to restaurants to eat what they can't have at home - mostly to get crispy crunchy food, or better food than they can't prepare.

I ordered the T-Bone... for connoisseurs the menu said. Connoisseurs call it a Porterhouse bitch, but I digress. It comes with soup or salad. Salads were the ubiquitous Caesar (see above) and of course the \"chef's salad\" whatever the fuck that means. I went for the soup, cream of broccoli. They forgot to mention it probably comes out of a can marked with the word Campbell's on it. It had the salt content of a canned soup and tasted like the 2 dollar soup I sometimes get at Tim Horton's (hey my expectations at Timmy's are different than when I dish out a lot of cash for a good meal.)

But I should have seen this coming when the bread came with butter in packets you have to unseal. Because whipping butter and serving it into a little ramequin is soooooooo much work right?

But it gets better... I mean worse...

I get my T-Bone steak and it's about I dunno, barely a centimetre thick, the kind of cheap-ass steak you get at your local IGA. This steak was un-aged. How can you tell you may ask? Well first, the purpose of aging meat is to release it of its water and of course secondly, make the meat tender which results in a steak that cuts easy and is flavour packed. This T-Bone had nothing flavourful and was boiled by all the water that was steamed out during the cooking process. I couldn't see any spices or seasoning. The steak was pale and looked like the kind of steak hospital cafeterias push out on those special occasion meals. Even after pouring enough salt to clog an artery on it, I still couldn't get any flavour out of it. That's of course WHEN I was able to cut a piece of meat out of it without hacking at it because of all the non-tenderness of the meat and all the \"nerving\". I stopped after 2 \"bites\". 

Any steak connoisseur likes their steak, thick... really thick and will pay the big bucks to get it and get it right. The steak was barely grilled on one side, ungrilled on the other, conveniently faced down and looked and tasted boiled. And to make matters worse, there were metallic black spots on the steak indicating a dirty grille or tools. Unpleasant to say the least. And it was just served on a plate with nothing else. No herbs, no mushrooms, or grilled tomatoes, the regular, omnipresent go-tos. Just a plain unseasoned steak."}
{"text":"Overall it was good, service was fast and friendly, food was good, red snapper special and a surf and turf. Steak was really good, didn't need the pepper sauce, steak was good enough on it's own, only issue was the lobster tail was slightly over done. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I came in here on. st patricks day. I loved their food. My steak was cooked perfectly and our waitress was really proffessional. The ambiance is cozy/kinda sportsy. They had tv playing with the habs game on. However they did have another side in the restaurant so maybe thats where you can have more of a sit down experience. Anyway I enjoyed their food and wine collection. Until next time :)"}
{"text":"The steak is great, atmosphere is decent, service good... but there's one reason you should visit Firegrill: the house salad dressing. I can't put into words what my dining mates and I experienced when we tasted our first bite of the house salad. True bliss."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the location.  Very much a typical American bar/steakhouse joint but it does some dishes better.

The prime rib was about average, which is to say pretty good but nothing special.

The salad had good helping of goat cheese and a wine vinaigrette on the sweet side that my wife really liked although I thought the combination was a little overwhelming.

The shrimp cocktail was deveined well (for a bar place) and was appropriately cooked. The shrimps were pretty big too.

The highlight for me was the tiramisu. It was very fluffy and not overly sweet. I suspect they served it in a glass jar because it's so fluffy it would struggle to hold its shape without a container."}
{"text":"It had been years since my last visit to Firegrill and it was just as good as I remember! We ordered the filet mignon with baked potato and the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes. The prime rib was perfectly cooked and the jus was savory and flavorful. The service was attentive and efficient. The booths on the bar side were very spacious for the two of us. The only downside was that we would rather have the sides on the same plate as the steak instead of on a side plate. ... That probably comes down to personal preference though!"}
{"text":"I don't mind this place and the food here seems good. I like the steaks here and it's close to where I live. So the food is good and the location is convenient. It's the nearest steakhouse to my crib.

The service here seems pretty average, nothing special. The atmosphere seems pretty average as well.

Overall, a pretty average steakhouse restaurant.

FINAL GRADE: C+"}
{"text":"Un service aux petits oignons !!! Une cuisine \"sûre\". À conseiller assurément !
Les prix se tiennent et ne sont pas exhorbitant."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse with lots of selection, nice decor and attentive service.

The location is ideal, for being downtown, very accessible (facing Peel metro) yet it's not busy and there's plenty of seating. People aren't swarming here after work for meetings or cocktails. 

I've been twice so far and was always pleased with the food. Between my partner and I, we've tried the steak, bbq grilled chicken breast, chicken tenders, californian chicken sandwich, shrimp cocktail and desserts like key lime pie (delicious!!) or choco-banana cakes.

Compared to other steakhouses, this place has many chicken and seafood dishes, pasta or sandwiches and a lunch menu.

Everything is delicious although I find some options quite pricey. If you order a sandwich, it comes by default with fries, replacing that with a salad costs 5.50$
Their fries are shoestring cut and seasoned, which I found a little too salty.

Recommended if you want good food, good service in a classy yet relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant. Modern steakhouse feel. Greeters and wait staff are very friendly. No complaints about the food but a little on the pricey side (including wine by the glass). Went with a couple of the guys and all we wanted was some food at a reasonable price. Enjoyed the food and experience regardless of price.
On par with the Keg."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic , tuna app was light and perfectly seasoned . The forge ills shrimp was succulent and the prime rib was tender and tasty . The service was exceptional ! Have to come here !"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. I'll keep this short. 
Food = 3
Waitress attitude =1

Afterwards we agreed we should have tried Carlos and Pepe's instead.

Definitely a place that lives off of guaranteed food traffic based on location instead of quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Great ahi tuna! Great portions and great desert menu. Would definitely come back here again when I'm in Canada!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We had the ahi tuna steak and the New York steak, food was good! Prices were a little bit too much, but experience was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that had, bacon, honey mustard onions , etc. it was so good and sweet! My dad ordered a prime rib cooked medium. 

Got my food at a reasonable waiting time, when it arrived my dads prime rib was not medium it was a bit tough to chew and cut. Mine was delicious! My dad told the waiter about the problem ad the waiter insisted to change it to his liking, he literally came back a minute or two later with a new prime rib and really impressed my dad! It was as if every time he cut the meat it melted off so smoothly, my dad was so happy after that. 

Only problem I had was when I asked for a doggy bag they forgot but so did I and I only remembered later on that night. Not a big problem but still. 

Anyways I loved the atmosphere it felt warm and cozy and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"I loveddd it!  We had the macaroni cheese balls as an app, and the chicken wings.  When it came down tho the order i had the filet mignon..  It was done just how i had ordered it medium-rare.  The food came out fast as well i will see these folks again great food and ambiance."}
