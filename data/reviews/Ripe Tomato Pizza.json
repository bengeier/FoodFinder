{"text":"I wound up here shortly after arriving in Calgary, so still didn't have a good idea of local restaurants/chains.  I'm Celiac so normally plan my meals, but was at the mall and quite hungry.  The gentleman working was a great help, and even knew the difference between gluten intolerant and Celiac.  Not the place I'd expect to get gluten free from, but had a salad and some soup which were both delicious (and had no reaction either).  Many thanks!"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza we've had in a very long time.  We were at market mall food court and decided to try this chain for pizza.  

The two people working their didn't appear to know what they were doing from when we first ordered to when they boxed up finished product.  We waited quite a while for each vety thin crust pizza. I asked if they normally come out with many black burnt spots as ours were and he said the oven hadn't been working right and he looked confused about how to change the problem or I'm sure the owner doesn't know and he had it down to 310 on the dial.  The ad says they cook at 900 degrees for this neopolitan style?? He didn't say anyone would be fixing the oven yet they were continuing business as usual and charging full prices.  There were flies everywhere and all the prep ingredients were fully open to the flies at all times.  A lot of specific ingredients were thrown on after it was pulled from the oven.  Even though it wasn't busy and we ordered two pizzas together they cooked one at a time.  The large circular oven was rotating all the time with only one pizza cooking.. there was lots of room for more? The two workers seemed very flustered and totally unorganized.  They are sure not cheap for what you get in the end and they only flavor that came through of chicken basil pesto tomato onion and cheese was the tomato and cheese which was only thing cooked on the bottom in the oven.  Mine was so wet its immediately within minutes of sitting in the food court to eat it soaked through the cardboard as I tried to cut it with a tiny plastic knife.  To hold a piece up to fold it like the box suggested it was way too soggy.   

We will never go back or try any other of this chain.  I can't see repeat customers or how they'll stay in business long.  No stars if I could"}
{"text":"Went during a busy friday downtown lunchtime, service was fast and they happily accommodated for allergies. Pizza is fresh and delicious.  Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Coming back here a couple of years after my first (generous) review, I'm surprised at how far this place has fallen while their prices have risen. 

I ordered the 4-cheese pizza and it was mediocre at best. Topping was put on in a miserly fashion and for some reason the pizza had a sour taste around the edges. I don't know what went wrong with this restaurant but I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service but bad food. Pizza here is cooked at an extremely hot temperature so the bottom is burnt but the top is raw and doughy. Too much sauce, not enough cheese, and everything has a bland, undercooked taste."}
{"text":"High quality, inexpensive food in a food court... inconceivable!"}
{"text":"The cheaper version of Famoso pizza.....and I'm saying cheaper all cheap ingredients viva the one and only real authentic neapolitan pizza Called Pulcinella wood fire oven ,Caputo flour ,imported cheese and tomatoes right from Italy."}
{"text":"If you want to wait for the inexperienced prep people to mangle three pizzas before you get an edible one, feel free to go here. Yes it's inexpensive, but certainly not a must have. I ordered a simple pizza, ham and pineapple. Took the girl making it three tries to not botch the dough, and the first pizza I got looked like it had been run over. After saying I didn't want that one, the manager (most disagreeable gentleman) told me he'd make it himself, which he did, and when it was done, I got handed my pizza, my cash back from the purchase, and the manager asked me never to come back. Way to run a business."}
{"text":"Since I was at the mall (this is located in Market Mall) doing some shopping I thought I would grab some dinner. Been to this food court many times but thought I would finally have Ripe Tomato since they are fairly new to this location and they had the shortest line-up, which was no line-up. Both employees working looked a bit bored. This should have been a sign not to go here, but I ignored it.

 I saw that they had a pizza oven and everything was made to order. I liked that and fresh is best. After cruising the menu, I settled on the \"Classic beef\" pizza. I asked the cashier worker what the ripe bites size was since I didn't want too many, just enough to try. He advised me they \"weren't that good\". Well that settled that. I noticed they had two desserts in packages and asked what they were since it was hard to tell by the containers they were in. He stated \"one was Tiramisu and the other was something else, but they were both desserts\". Which clearly I knew they were both desserts, I was asking what they were? Since the cashier wasn't helpful, I went with the Classic Beef pizza only. It was obvious they weren't selling me on anything else nor did they want too?

I watched as they made my pizza - beef, red peppers, canned mushrooms and cheese. I was hoping the mushrooms were fresh ones and was a bit disappointed to see they use canned ones. Off it went in the oven. I waited as the two employees chatted to each other about that they were doing later. I waited and just killed sometime reading some emails on my phone. When it was \"ready\", they boxed it up and I was on my way. When I opened the box to eat it, I noticed there was some black burnt marks on the top of the pizza. I looked at the back of the slice and noticed it was really burnt on the bottom. Looked at the rest of the pizza and it was all burnt on the bottom. The toppings were all very cool, especially the mushrooms. Yuck. Very disappointing. Not sure if it's because they put it in for too long, were too busy chatting and forgot or the oven was just really hot. No idea? Picture of the top of the pizza. I took one of the bottom as well however it's so dark you can't tell its pizza. That's how dark and burnt it was.

I went back to the counter and opened the pizza box and explained the problem which was the burnt pizza and the toppings were not warm/hot, they were actually quiet cool/cold. I had one bite and no way could I stomach a piece. I was advised the manager isn't in, in the evenings but I could call and speak to someone tomorrow to let them know and to discuss a refund. Not sure how this solution helped me right now? I stated not to worry since I am looking for a solution now, but there was no way I could eat this pizza. I left the whole pizza with them and went off next door and grabbed Thai food instead. Defiantly a waste of time and money.

 I didn't bother contacting Ripe Tomato the next day on the issue or refund. I felt this could have been rectified right then and there however the two employees were not interested in making things right. Or maybe they just didn't care? No idea? Disappointing on the whole Experience.

Ripe Tomato = Major Fail!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Switzerland - not too far away from the Italian border, so I know what a real pizza tastes like! Even though this is a fast food place, there's no better place for pizza in Calgary than Ripe Tomato Pizza. My favourite: simply Margharita"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, delicious. Nothing like watching your pizza bubble up in the oven right in front of you, and also not have to pay $20 bucks for an artisanal personal pizza and a drink. I haven't had that kind of luck in Canada before. And did I mention quick? Couple revolutions in the pizza oven you go from transaction to eating wishing 5 minutes. 

Also, their kid's pizza is ADORABLE pretend you have a kid and just get one it's just ugh so cute which is surely the bottom of the list priority-wise when picking food, but that's before you've seen how cute the pizza is in its itty box, ok."}
{"text":"I love this place. So much that I really go out of my way to go here. The tomato soup is to die for, the little dough balls are so good (especially dipped in the soup) and their pizza is amazing and fresh.
Definitely a must have if you work near the core or if you're out shopping! You won't find anything else this good or fresh in any food court."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. The guy at the front till took a bog crap and didnt wash his hands and went right back to work. This was at market mall location. He should be fired!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the super thin wood fired pizza. My first question was whether or not they offered lactose free cheese- nope. So, pizza with no cheese and extra veggies it is! 

I ordered a 9 inch. The crust is lightly charred and the pizza is thin as a crepe. I had mushrooms, fresh basil leaves, artichokes, roasted red peppers and black olives. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty. For a food court item, I enjoyed this pizza a lot and finished it in 10 minutes flat, haha!!! I needed a fork as there was no cheese to glue the toppings to the bread. 

If you like Neapolitan pizza with a chewy edge and crepe thin crust, try this out. For $9. This was good value to fill my tummy. I'll try a meat pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Meh. That's basically my feelings about this place. I've tried the Thai chicken and a pepperoni mushroom pizza and both were just okay. The chicken wasn't the best quality and they're pretty chintzy on the cheese. The pepperoni and mushroom was better but I asked for extra cheese and feel like that was just almost enough cheese for a regular pizza. There was a good portion of mushrooms and enough pepperoni. 

The pizza was kinda soggy in the middle and really nothing special. I'd probably eat here again in a pinch as the price is good but don't expect to be blown away. Its really just basic fast food pizza."}
{"text":"I should have known better, Pizza to me is a deep dish, stacked with meat and gooey cheese, all over your face kind of treat! Thin crust nouveau frou frou is not my thing. Against my better judgement I ordered a couple of pizzas... They were decent and good value but not my thing. For what they are I think they will have raving fans but I won't be back. The counter staff were very friendly & professional A+ for service."}
{"text":"A rather underwhelming pizza place in the +15.  It's on the 4th floor in the Holt Renfrew building.  The concept is good, but execution is poor.  I came in excited, left feeling a little bit sad (especially since my friend was telling me about delicious Texas BBQ at the same time).

I got the ham and arugula pizza, which sounded so good to me.  I've had the same combination in several other places, so I had a clear picture of what I wanted.  What I got clearly fell short.

The pizza looked anemic with a sparse coating of yellowing arugula over too-little cheese.  The cheese was spread so thin - such a disappointment.  The sliced cherry tomatoes on top actually detracted more from it, since the juices turned the pizza watery and a bit soggy on top of the cheese.  

Really, the only thing that I enjoyed was the crust.  Let down.  

There are much better places for fast-casual pizza - do yourself a favor and skip Ripe Tomato."}
{"text":"Was disappointed. Paper thin , less toppings than what's in a half sub, and cooked unevenly. Half a pizza and I was still hungry. Definitely not calorie-dollar in your favor. Went home and made 3 pizzas ten times better for less than $10 ..."}
