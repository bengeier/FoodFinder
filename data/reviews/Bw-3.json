{"text":"Tuesday night a group of 15 of us decide to meet for a co-workers birthday.
So we all meet and walk in and are instantly greeted by an over bleached-blonde idiot who looks at us and says.. not hi welcome to BW's but instead ...um...if you guys are all together ya you're not allowed to move any tables together so maybe you guys can just find tables kinda around each other... Are u fucking kidding me!!!??? we all just stood there for a minute and looked at each other a little speechless.
So we say we're all here its around 9:30 PM or so and the place isnt too busy so we'll just figure out the whole seating thing. So we proceed to the dining area and took up about 4 tables pretty close to each other and we start deciding what we're all gonna order.
So I ask for a cup of coffee and after about 15 minutes (not joking they actually said they had to make some because they didnt have any...i was under the impression that any restaurant that served any sort of dessert had coffee....i guessed wrong) my airplane cup of coffee arrives. With packets of creamer (packets not any type of real liquid cream) Now by this point I'm completely annoyed with the whole thing. so we order,the food comes and its just what you'd expect...the food is hot and fresh, the wings are fantastic its just the service is sooooo bad that no one could believe that a restaurant with a large group of people that have money to spend (not like the table of 10 kids at a denny's that order 2 cups of coffee and 1 plate of fries for the table to share that will sit there all night cuz they have nowhere else to go) we cant believe the horrific service.
Luckily we are amongst friends and we made the best of a bad situation. Nothing that a couple of jokes and beers can't fix."}

{"text":"Lots of flat screen TV's, vide games, spicy buffalo wings and lots of beers on tap! What more can you want. This is a great place to catch a football game or sporting event. The menu is resonably priced so almost anyone can afford to have a good meal and a beer here!"}
