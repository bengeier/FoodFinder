{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 for the very slooow service. 
Food is great! Healthy options abound and it's all delicious. 
Yogurt shakes are amazing! I get them to go sometimes. Coffee is my fave flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place!  One of the few things I really miss about Cleveland. Come back whenever I visit. 

The food is super. Everything is fresh and/or made here, even the dressings. My favorite is the toss salad with blue cheese, a zippy, (a grilled cheese pita with sesame), and a vanilla shake with peanut butter, (made here), and banana, but everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"So... I won't deny that Coventry neighborhood is a great collection of food and shopping.  I stopped in at Tommy's for lunch after a nice visit at the CMA.  They definitely have a great selection on the menu filled with fresh and tasty ingredients, but I thought the prices were a little steep.  I will probably venture to try another place when I head back up that way. There isn't anything \"calling\" me back to Tommy's"}
{"text":"I began going to Tommy's in the mid-eighties. It was the only restaurant that not only served but specialized in vegetarian food. Tommy's carries it's own rich history and has changed very little in concept, culture, and menu since the days when Coventry was Coventry. I haven't lived in Cleveland for many years but each time I return, Tommy's is a non-negotiable stop. I don't care what time of the day it is, I (at least) order the Lynne and the Rebel with a huge mocha shake. It's some of the best vegetarian food I've ever had and at this point, it's like the comfort food my mom never fixed. An absolute must for vegetarians and non alike."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but service and wait times suck.  The last three times we have been to Tommys the food has taken over an hour to get to our table from the time we placed the order.  On our last visit we waited an hour and a half for our two hot sandwiches and when they arrived they were cold. Service is usually mediocre at best."}
{"text":"BEST vegetarian/vegan place in Cleveland!!!

My favorite things to order there: soy milkshakes, fresh cut fries, vegan greek salad, vegan taco salad,  MR spinach pie

The service is quick and friendly.

The only thing I would recommend against (despite friend's suggestions) is the spiked hummus."}
{"text":"What Tommy Fello recently did for a woman dying of pancreatic cancer in D.C. merits 50 stars. I don't live in Cleveland, but I hope those of you who do keep Tommy in business forever.

{"text":"This is the best place to eat in the outskirts of Vaughan mills. Service is always friendly and courteous, and the food is phenomenal with prices that can't be beat! The jerk chicken special is amazing! You'll always end up full especially if you order it with an extra leg and the corn soup is to die for! My friends and I are regulars and after stumbling upon it once, you will be too!"}
{"text":"Usually service is lackluster, however today we received decent service! Food is always good and the iced tea is awesome......if you are a shake lover try the Peanut Butter......."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of state, and a friend recommended I get to Tommy's (she didn't even know that I'm dairy-free and gluten-free). Since I was alone, I sat at the counter, and the wait staff couldn't have been nicer. When I explained that it was my first time, they highlighted the best that they had to offer, and helped me navigate my dairy and gluten issues with ease. I've *never* been to a restaurant that had SO many options for someone with my dietary issues before! I had a wonderful sandwich and an awesome peanut butter rice milk shake. I only wish I lived in Ohio so that I could go back!"}
{"text":"God I love Tommy's.  

I spent years scouring Chicago for a comparable veg restaurant and came up with nothing.  Tommy's is THAT good.

Favorites:
Ceebee
MR4
Quinn
Elsie Combo
Extra thick mint chocolate chip milkshakes

Tommy's is one of the foremost reasons that I don't mind trekking it to Cleveland Heights four times a week for work."}
{"text":"What can I say.  I've been coming here for 25 years.   Staff and servers are always fantastic.  Food is just the best.  Especially the pitas, fries and the milkshakes.  I wanna give it 10 stars.  They deserve it"}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped here on our cross country trip from NY to CA ..
We didn't stop and stay to eat but we grabbed a TLT and a cookies and cream milkshake and I can't describe how delicious our lunch was!  
The atmosphere inside his so cute. They have a cute little bookstore inside and really clean bathrooms. 
Recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"I don't understand the fanatic love for Tommy's.  It's good but not amazing.  I also feel like it's expensive.  $8-12 salads should be made with romaine/fancy lettuce, not iceberg.

Their saving graces are fries and milkshakes...which I spilled.  :("}
{"text":"I love Tommy's! Its a classic vegetarian diner you can only find in Cleveland. The menu is huge and although I've been to Tommy's over ten times, I only get the veggie burger, falafel, or hummus. The veggie burger is Tommy's signature dish for a reason. As a vegetarian I've had a lot of veggie burgers and Tommy's is the best. I do wish the meals came with sides rather than just a burger and pickles on a plate, but the fries or hummus as a side are also excellent. The falafel is okay, I mostly order it because I love falafel even thought it is definitely not the best I've had. Tommy's is also known for its milkshakes, which do not disappoint. However,  I recommend ordering them in a to-go cup if you want a smaller serving. Tommy's is a great neighborhood joint and I will always go back for a delicious burger and the fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tommy's pretty regularly for more than 15 years.  

The spiked hummus is so good it is ridiculous.  I don't know why the combination of warm (?!) hummus with melted cheese, Tommy's weird/wonderful bbq sauce, olives green peppers, onion, tomato and sour cream is so delicious, but it is.  Order extra pita.  

The tossed salad with italian dressing is so simple, crunchy, and fresh.  The broccoli rizzo is cheesy comfort food.

I love their sandwiches, especially the veggie burger, the bill max, the quigley, the delaney, and the mr4 (which sounds weird, but is so good).  These all go great with their fries, too!  Split a platter with someone so you have room to split a cookies-and-cream milkshake, too.

I'd give Tommy's five stars, especially for consistency and creativity, except it is just too pricey to enjoy as often as I would like.  And the service is famously slow."}
{"text":"This is an awful restaurant. I have never eaten here and not gotten ill afterward. The service is abominable -- bored, rude kids who cannot deign to look customers in the eye or even speak in more than grunts. If you are craving a milkshake, it is worth the terrible service to get one, but steer clear of the food. Whatever they spray on the grill to prepare the endless succession of messy, greasy, flavorless sandwiches will wreak havoc on your system."}
{"text":"What a college-y joint. The service was hella casual (the guy who seated us was wearing gym shorts) and our waitress definitely rushed us. Two seconds after our food arrived, she asked if we wanted our bill. The food was okay. Our sandwiches were good, but our fries were terrible (burnt but soggy? gross). Additionally, do they have to spell hummus like that? I hope there are better vegetarian-friendly establishments in Cleveland than Tommy's."}
{"text":"Tommy's has the best milkshakes around, and such a great variety of sandwiches! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Tommy's is a Cleveland staple. Great variety, all tasty, with awesome awesome French fries!"}
{"text":"Overall, food is pretty good, but the service is unbearably slow. Each time I've been here, I've been in for at least an hour and a half while I wait for my check with no server to be found. Plus, the food is a little pricey for the quality of diner food you typically get."}
{"text":"Tommy's does two things:  1. Delivers okay food and 2. always fails to live up to the hype.

I mean the food is just okay here.  All these people writing reviews and giving Tommy's 4 and 5 stars,  all I can say is,  you've never been to an excellent diner that gives real grade A high-quality American style diner food.  Yes, the malts are delicious. But how hard is it to screw up a malt?  The ice cream, fruit, malt mix, etc. do all the work.  And a restaurant can't have a reputation built on malts.

Whenever I go to Tommy's,  like I said,  the food is okay-- but just okay-- and there's always something a little off about the visit.  The latest time I went I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions.  The bacon looked anemic,  as if it had been hidden under a shoe for weeks,  but it tasted okay.  It wasn't real, quality bacon.  And the onions were dry.  It was as if the onions had been hanging out with the bacon that had been hiding under a shoe for weeks.  The onions were dry.

My girlfriend had a grilled cheese and a bowl of blackbean chill.  Here's the thing about that:  if someone ordered those foods together,  would you as a server bring them out separately,  or would you wait until the grilled cheese was done and bring out the sandwich with the chili? Someone who orders a grilled cheese with ANY kind of soup-- including chili-- is looking to eat that sandwich with the soup/chili.  Our waitress brought out my girlfriend's chili well before anything else.  really dumb.

Second,  the funny thing about the chili:  the bowl it was in was INCREDIBLY HOT.....but the chili itself was just lukewarm.  It was weird.  It's almost as if the waitress or the cook expected the hot bowl to warm the chili for them.

Here's the other thing about the whole experience:  after our waitress served the food,  she never checked up on us once.  Really annoying.  

If you go to Tommy's enough,  you will experience these kinds of little things going wrong with the meals,  but you'll keep going back to Tommy's because there's really no seriously good diner food American style competitor to take Tommy's place.  It's just okay.  It's not 4 stars nor is it 5 stars.  It's bland and just okay."}
{"text":"The only restaurant in town my son comes to when visiting Cleveland!  Family and personal favorite. Louie dressing the best, milkshakes, just about everything  is amazing.  The French onion soup the best I have ever had. Have gone since it started as a counter in a drugstore in early 70's."}
{"text":"I think a lot of vegetarians love this place because of the number of options, but the number of good options is lacking. Everything comes across a little too granola for my liking. The staff are always nice and helpful I just think most of the food is very bland and typical. The exception to the bland rule are their fries and shakes. Every vegan forego their \"variety\" of dishes and just order fries with a side of veganaise and blueberry tofutti shake. I no longer to go there for food but instead just a snack!"}
{"text":"Main reason to visit this place ? The milk shakes .... amazing. .... Once you taste it you will never forget it.  
Advice : stick to the American breakfast. ... pancakes, omlettes are very good.   But I would advice against the Mediterranean food items,  they leave much to be desired. ( atleast the ones I tried )"}
{"text":"Delicious! Insanely large menu options, especially if you're vegetarian or vegan. They also have meat options for those of us who aren't veggie only. =] Tommy's connects to the bookstore next door, which is an added bonus. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Tommy's enthusiastic availability of gluten-free options, their friendly waitstaff(who are very dilligent about eliminating cross contamination for those with allergies), and their tasty fresh fruit smooties! The service is a tiny bit slow, but not terrible on the few occasions I've eaten there. 

Their gluten free hamburger buns are white bread style, and very sweet. I assume they are Udi's. They do have gluten free multigrian bread though, which goes AMAZING with their delicious corned beef! I would be a regular for those corned beef sandwiches if I lived in the area. Its not overly salty, perfectly seasoned. I got it with muenster and onions, my favorite. 

They have gluten free fryers, and the french fries are super crispy and delicious. I also recommend the cheese fries, which can be made with cheddar upon request. 

I will definitely eat here again when I am back in town. A delightful dining experience, bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Save the heavenly fries and shakes, the food is average. However, the atmosphere is terrific and the whole place has an energetic vibe. Falafel is usually a good bet and I am a fan of the Dagwood salad. My husband can't get enough toasted cheese sandwiches on pita. Definitely a good place to check out at least once! Parking is a headache, though, so make sure to overfeed your meter to avoid the overzealous police officers."}
{"text":"Walked in to the tune of very little wait time, and a pleasantly arranged restaurant! My regular cheeseburger was pretty run-of-the-mill, but service was friendly and helpful, and my food arrived fairly quickly. It's no joke when people talk about their milkshakes-- I ordered a cookie dough shake. It was enough for us three college students, but we all finished wanting more! The fries were good as well. There's a large menu with something on it for everyone, and I really wish I'd explored a bit more than just a burger and fries. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. I used to live in the neighborhood and took it for granted. Now that I'm a solid 30 minutes away, I look for reasons to pass through Coventry. Great options for vegetarians, but also plenty of choices for others. The milkshakes are everyone's favorite. I like to get mine to go and step into the bookstore right next door."}
{"text":"Yep total hipsters with anti-meat attitudes, and slow service. 

But the shakes in sturdy take home cups with plastic sealed-on lids (just like Quickly!) are worth it if you are passing through this neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants anywhere. The CeeBee is one of my faves and the chocolate malt is fabulous. Warning: the portions are large. My husband and I often split a lunch of a sandwich, fries and a shake. The coffee is excellent as well."}
{"text":"I have always liked how bustling and casual and easy this place is. It's loud and family friendly and has a wide range of menu items.  But over many years and visits, I've found the service to be inconsistent and unpredictable.  I've actually gotten the feeling we were putting staff out with any extra requests or needs. (On more than one occasion, unfortunately.)

You can usually depend on good hummus, baba ghanoush, and french fries. I've had some good, some iffy sandwiches, spinach pies and toasted cheese pitas.  The rice dream milkshakes used to be a major draw for me, but they dropped those ... and now it's $7 tofutti shake (or $8 if you want peanut butter). Yikes."}
{"text":"This place is great for so many reasons.

1. The breakfast I've had is good, large, and decently priced. Their coffee is okay - nothing fancy but not gross by any means.

2. Their vegetarian and vegan options are very cool, unique, and plentiful. I did have one appetizer that was somewhat bland, but it seems a rarity. If you have a good understanding of what you enjoy and how your palate reacts to certain foods, you will be more than happy with Tommys. Unlike one review, I would never say Tommy's is anti-meat; they have an entire page devoted to meaty entrees. I haven't tried any of these, but with the veggie options you really should resist your carnivorous urges (Americans eat roughly 40% more meat in their diets than is suggested anyway).

3. They do have great milkshakes, and I've never been a huge milkshake fan. You should dine in with your milkshake - I'm fairly certain you get more  b/c of the way they serve it if you drink it in house (or drink half and take the rest home).

4. Contradictory to what I've also read, I think the staff does a great job. They get really busy in there and it seems to me like it could be somewhat stressful."}
{"text":"This was extremely disappointing. The last time I came here I had French onion soup and it was delicious. However, this time I ordered food to go with my friend and it was so gross I didn't finish it. We ordered veggie burgers because the menu description sounded great. But the patty was all mushy and deep fried. Who wants a healthy veggie burger deep fried? It was all greasy and when you bite into it was like brown rice not fully cooked, all mushy and tasted gross, it exploded out of the back of the burger. On top of that, the veggie pizza was $7 a slice and was the most disgusting thing my friend ate. The only difference between the veggie pizza and regular pizza was a couple pieces of dried gross over cooked falafel that tasted like freezer dried burnt dog shit. And they charge five extra dollars for that shit?!! And not to mention they smothered it with gross greasy ass cheese. It also doesn't help that everyone behind the counter looked like they rolled out of bed and didn't wash themselves and were still in their pajamas. Definitely not coming back for this freezer food!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  My teenage son and I are vegetarians and we looked on yelp for a veggie friendly place, and we loved the fact that there were so many vegetarian options on the menu.  In fact, we had a hard time deciding what to order.  

I got the vegetarian BBQ sandwich, and he got the veggie burger.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the fries as I prefer them a bit more crispy instead of soft, but that was the only thing that stood out as a negative to me.  

Very nice experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the most overrated places I've ever been to.  After being told this was the best thing since sliced bread, I went there and got a veggie dog with a milk shake.  I'm not much of a milk shake person but I didn't love it and it certainly wasn't the best milk shake I've ever had (and I've had maybe 10 ever).  The veggie dog was disgusting.  I've had loads of veggie dogs and for the carnivores out there, it doesn't have to be disgusting. Many are quite good."}
{"text":"MMMMM TOMMY'S.
It's a Cleveland Heights staple. It has a lot of vegg/vegan options (which makes you think it's healthy), but also has stuff for meat eaters too.  
 
Milkshakes, fries, veggie burgers, any of the MRs...

Yummy:)"}
{"text":"I love how people refer to this as a \"health food\" restaurant. It's just a good restaurant that doesn't serve lots of garbage fried everything greasy suburban American crap. Lot's of veggie and vegan options and very consistent. Yes, it is a bit over-rated but come on this is Cleveland and we're lucky to even have this. If this is too much of a hippy joint for you I'm sure you can punch \"Applebee's\" into to your GPS and be on your way."}
{"text":"I had the worst corn beef sandwich ever. The sandwich was tough, chewy, tasteless and hard. I have not been to Tommy's in a while, but the poor quality was not what I was expecting. It is so hard to get great food anymore. I guess it is quantity over quality.
Bring back the old Tommy's!
#selfappointedambassadorofCleveland"}
{"text":"Don't go hungry. You'll be waiting so long you'll finally be hungry when the food arrives. 
1 hour from the time order was placed to served."}
{"text":"I think part of my problem with Tommy's was going in with inflated expectations (my wife and her friends love the place). However, after getting a couple visits under my belt, I must say that I am fairly underwhelmed. The service was, in fact, kinda' poor and the food was just a'ight."}
{"text":"I still haven't had the opportunity to eat in at Tommy's but have had their milkshakes brought to me via carryout from a family member.  They have the best milkshakes I've ever had!  I will be dining in ASAP to try their fries as I hear you get very large servings."}
{"text":"Simply nothing like Tommy's!  Had my usual MR3. Been going here for 15 years and they are consistently awesome. Thank you Tommy for keeping your recipes the same. So GOOD. We love the shakes and we love the street."}
{"text":"I hadn't eat here in years but it's a very popular spot. The food seems not to be the reason however. I had Jennys Wrap and my wife had a falafel salad. Both were very large and both very bland. Maybe these were not their best offerings but if they are representative of other items on the menu, they leave a lot of room for improvement. Even a Chipotle wrap is far more tasty and fresh like. This wrap seemed tasteless with no zest. I ate half and left the rest and that's  a rare step for me not to bring remnants home. 

I tried my wife's salad. The salads at California Pizza Kitchen are far more creative and tasty than this was. The falafel, (she loves falafel) that topped hers was, she claims rather mediocre. 

So, it will probably be another decade before we come back."}
{"text":"I really LOVE this place for so many reasons.  The milkshakes are awesome- made with hard ice cream and not soft serve BS.  They also serve the best french fries I have ever eaten.  And make sure to order some of their sides for dipping, bc they're made in house and are amazing (best blue cheese I've ever tasted).  I always order the Zippy, it's one of the grilled cheese sandwiches (on a pita).  I've also had the spiked hummus(awesome but make sure they serve it with the dark bbq sauce), the spinach pies (not so great), various salads (all very good), and the falafel (pretty good).  

The service here is also great.  When I lived down the street and came here once a week, one server even had my order memorized.  They do get bombarded on the weekends for brunch, so plan accordingly.  Another tip- make sure that as soon as you burst through the door you sign your name up (and the number of people in your party) on the clipboard that should be lying somewhere on the counter.  This dictates in what order you'll get seated.  I've seen some first timers get passed over for tables bc they didn't figure it out fast enough."}
{"text":"I took my out of town friend to Tommy's and she had the soy-peanut butter milk shake. It's great, even if you're not lactose intolerant.

The next time she was back in town, we had her over for a dinner party. We had forgotten some ingredient, and she quickly offered to run out and get it. An hour later, she returned, with some rambling explanation about how she got lost, and the first place didn't have it. Only a year later did she fess up that she actually went to Tommy's to get that milkshake! 

Of course, there's lots of other great things about Tommy's. The Meat Pies and Spinach Pies are not really 'pies' in the traditional sense. They take the ingredients and wrap them in dough, then cook them - but it's not like a stromboli. It's super tasty."}
{"text":"Been here a total of 5 times. Service here has gone from goo to horrible. Today. We sat on our table at 1:10pm. We didn't get the service for our drink at 1:30pm, knowing that the service is slow. We ordered our basic sandwitches (tlc and tlt). We got out drinks 5 mins, right now it's 2pm. Food is not here. This will e the last time we will done here. If you like this place. Be  prepare to wait."}
{"text":"One word . AMAZING
I mean who doesn't love good food?
First and foremost, I'm NOT a vegetarian, I came up in this place and got me the best corned beef sandwich of my life. Oh. My. God. I believe it was called the Big Lion or something like that. 

On a side note, I also tried their Meat Pie (Almost threw up but that's because it had lamb in it. Had to drink LOTS of water after that).

Excellent service, excellent food! 
:)"}
{"text":"Tommy's is a great health-food restaurant in Cleveland Heights' Coventry neighborhood. I've only been there for breakfast so that's all I'm reviewing. When you walk in, there is a small selection of seating for those waiting. Very informally, your name is taken on a clipboard if there's a wait. We made the mistake of coming right in the middle of the Sunday morning rush, which caused us to wait for about 40 minutes before we got out food! Normally, that would cause me to lower the rating a star. However, our very friendly waitress apologized several times and said that this happens at every time every Sunday morning. So take note: don't go here between 10:30 and noon unless you're willing to wait a while for your food. In addition, she gave us a small plate of fruit, which was a nice gesture, but there was only so much fruit on the plate. The fruit was good though. When our food came, though, we realized the wait was definitely worth it. I had the beetle omelet with wheat toast with a side of kashi. The omelet was great! It had ham, cheese, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers. The toast was good, but it's just your standard piece of toast. The kashi was excellent. What kashi is for those that don't know is a bowl of oats, wheat, rice, barley, and sesame seed. The kashi came with sliced banana already in the hot cereal and a side of apple butter to mix into the cereal. I highly recommend getting the kashi as a side to whatever you're getting for breakfast. Overall, if you're looking for a unique place for breakfast on the East Side, head over to Coventry and get yourself a table at Tommy's."}
{"text":"Tommy's has something for everyone, from your (fellow) foodies to your pesky friend's children. The vegetarian and meat pies were delicious and come in hearty but reasonable portions.

I had the lamb and beef meat pie with falafel and grilled vegetables. The meat was flavorful and tender; the bread was crusty and held the toppings well without getting soggy. It had a sesame sauce on the meat pie, which looks something like a sandwich, but I wish it was a little spicier. Other than that, no complaints from me. The service was good and the staff turn the tables over quickly."}
{"text":"I lived in Cleveland for 13 years. I have been in Washington, DC for 8. I still can't find anything that remotely approaches the quality of food and the atmosphere at Tommy's. Awesome for breakfast. Great for lunch dates. 

I HIGHLY recommend ordering the Fitz (omelet) and the Lisa(stack of pancakes with strawberries). Nothing compares to Tommy's breakfast menu and I have eaten at a lot of places. Culinary swoon!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to warm up to Tommy's. Now, I'm happy to go there any day. There are a few items I always stick to on the menu: the Aunt Rose, the W.Zedd, fries, and milkshakes.
It took me a long time to work up the courage to order the Aunt Rose (falafel with American Cheese, mushrooms, onion, and mayo? really?) but despite flying in the face of logic, it's really a delicious sandwich. My first chocolate peanut butter milkshake at Tommy's was almost a religious experience. I also like the raspberry yogurt shake.
Tommy's is nice."}
{"text":"I went to Tommy's for lunch today and the service was Terrible! It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to acknowledge our table and 30 minutes to get our food. Even after we told the waitress that we had a meeting to attend, she still took her sweet time. I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried Tommy's Restaurant today for the first time and we loved it. Great service, great location, delicious food, large portion sizes and low prices. Becky was very friendly and attentive. 

We hope they stick around for awhile because there are a number of Asian restaurants in the immediate vicinity that can cause very stiff competition.

We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great. Food great. Different, but creative. It's not your everyday run of the mill spot to eat but when u do it good."}
{"text":"First of all, they had fresh water that didn't taste like chlorine, that's always a good sign. The menu was extensive, maybe a bit too big, which is usually NOT a good sign, luckily not in this case. The vegetarian were really happy with the menu. Three of us were compelled by the falafel/bacon combination, which was a total hit. Their famous milkshakes were pretty good, plus for leaving the rest of the shake in the mixer container thing on the table. Waitresses were hot."}
{"text":"If you're in Coventry Village stopping by Tommy's Restaurant is a must!  Menu is amazing, really creative, vegan friendly and fresh!  While I was eating I was doing the happy food dance... Always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Yep it is my spot. This place advertise itself as a vegetarian restaurant but serves food for all tastbuds.
I think back in day that would have been accurate..nevertheless ..I enjoy this place bc of my limited breakfast choices considering my pescatarian with no eggs dietary needs. Here is where I order The Maureen ! which is fresh potatoes brocolli peppers onion and cheese ! What a combo and impressive -so much so that I make it at home(very good btw).  I also love the fries and any combo of the pita sandwich .
Overall this place rarely dissappoints my tastebuds(even if I have to put a little salt and pepper on my dish.) 
Always fresh. Busy on Sat. Never dissapointed."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have gone to Tommy's nearly every time I have visited Cleveland over the last 14 years, and it is always as good as I remember. The huge milkshakes are what keep me coming back for more, but my friend hits Tommy's weekly thanks to the extensive list of vegetarian offerings on the menu. 

On our latest visit, our group of four devoured nearly everything set before us, but with such huge portions, it is almost impossible to be a clean plater. My AJ Wrap (wheat wrap filled with black bean chili, pickles, brown rice, veggies & lettuce) was honestly the size of TWO burritos. It was seriously huge and really delicious. As a pickle lover, I savored the big chunks of dill pickle scattered throughout. My husband and I split a side order of fries and still could not eat it all, but we finished our pumpkin pie milkshakes like true champs. 

By the way, if you go to Tommy's, be extra careful when pouring the second half of the milkshake out of the metal mixing cup and into your waiting glass. Years ago I spilled my chocolate milkshake all over the table after the huge, delicious, creamy ball of ice cream in the middle plunked into the cup. It was a tragic event and a story that my friend and I retell each time we visit."}
{"text":"My wife and sister have a gluten allergy so we always go to Tommy's cause they make sure everything is cooked right. I like it cause they have a huge menu so whatever mood you're in they got you covered. The spinach pies are sex."}
{"text":"Our group always goes to a different breakfast place every week but this our second time here because we loved it so much the first time.  The service, as always, was great.  The waitress was very quick to refill our water and coffee.  Everyone at the table got exactly what they wanted. I am definitely going back.

Here are a few reviews of what people had:

3 Pancake Stack with Peanut Butter and 4 Pieces of Bacon:
The pancakes were fluffy and very filling. Three pancakes is definitely enough food for one person. The homemade peanut butter is excellent!! I would go back just for that. I highly suggest the pancake, peanut butter, and syrup combo. The coffee is your typical diner coffee...nothing special.  

The Belgian waffle was great! I chose the option to add strawberries and also asked for a side of of the homemade peanut butter. The peanut butter was a good add, because it probably would have been too sweet with just the strawberries.

 Beetle omelet:
 Portion size was more than adequate as I had trouble finishing it. The combination of ham, cheese, green peppers, onions and mushrooms were well blended as they complimented each other into an orgy of wonderful flavors. On top of that, four pieces of toast and a side of fruit to satisfy the palate. 

Elsie combo:
The sandwich was phenomenal.  I was a little skeptical at first, having both the peanut butter and mayo on it.  Sounded like an odd combination.  But it was amazing....loved it.  I got the pita break which was perfect because I think it is so easy to overwhelm a good sandwich with too much bread.  It was very filling.  The coffee was good too, nothing special but definitely a good cup of coffee in the mornings."}
{"text":"Malts are the best in the world, worth going back for. However the other dinner food is just OK, nothing out of the ordinary as far as taste (too much onion in the meat pies, falafel is standard), though the options are certainly plentiful and diverse.  The service was friendly but very slow."}
{"text":"Tommy's has been a staple on Coventry for decades, and is probably one of the oldest dining establishments in that area. It is defintely something worth trying - we go a couple times a year, and certainly would not consider ourselves 'regulars.\"

The things I like about Tommy's is that it is local (and they use local ingredients as much as possible), and I always enjoy the food. 

The things I dislike about Tommy's is that much of the menu is really the same thing with just different funky names for it, when it has one less ingredient than the next. And then there's the price point. While the food is good, often very good, I think it is overpriced, so not really a good value.

I worked in the food service industry in the 80's and 90's, and I understand all of the costs associated with running a restaurant, but I just think Tommy's goes a bit overboard with their prices. 

Although on the other hand, I can't blame them, they're in business to make a profit, and people flock to the restaurtant and continue to spend their money there, so...

Having said all of that, last time we went to Tommy's was on a Saturday for our \"without-the-kids\" lunch. I had the tuna salad sandwich, which had a decent serving of tuna salad, and came with lettuce, tomatoes, and green peppers served cold in a pita bread pocket, actually 2 of them. We also had ordered a side of fries to split with my wife. If I remember correctly, she had the Falafel that day, and I do remember both of us being satisfied with our lunch, but not raving about it like some other places.

Would definitely recommend, so people can make their own mind up."}
{"text":"Busy place, it was hard to hear a conversation. However, the food is unique and tasty. If I came back, it just would be for dessert. My TCH sandwich was mushy."}
{"text":"I love the principle of Tommy's - organic, ethical food, with plenty of vegetarian options...

Thing is, when you come right down to it, the food is a little bland. The hummus is average, the falafel are meh, the pancakes are unexceptional. I tried the meat pie once, and couldn't finish it - the onion flavor was so overwhelming that I was still tasting it three hours later.

Sure, the milkshake was good, but because they didn't give me a spoon to serve it out with, as soon as I tried to pour it into the glass the thing came out in one solid lump all over the table. Despite there being a waitress at the next table, no-one came to help me mop it up, so I had to make do.

It's one of those places I always hope will be good, and I always walk out disappointed. Meh."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great prices and really tasty food. My personal favorites are the spring roll (4 for less than $2), chicken fried rice, beef with broccoli and I never leave without an order of Singapore noodles. Ask for some hot sauce. It's homemade and packs a punch.

Darn, now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Worst service I've seen in a while. The food was delicious but we never got some items we ordered and I got the wrong order. If you can spare 90 min for a sandwich, this is it."}
{"text":"Best french onion soup in town ; vegetarian soup base ;Must give it a try if you are a non beef eater.
Best milkshakes"}
{"text":"I work in the area so this restaurant was very convenient to drop by. The prices are amazing since they give such large portions. Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"The food is bland and overpriced. Their barbecue seitan sandwich is somewhere around 7$, for nothing more than a soggy roll, seitan, and barbecue sauce.

The fact that they have so much vegetarian food is wonderful, until you actually dig into it. Then you realize leftovers might have been a better way to spend your lunch-hour.

I do, I admit, love their vegetarian French Onion Soup. It's gosh-darned perfect. and, as stated, their fries and milkshakes are pretty tasty too. But i've found deviating from that course always leaves me disappointed.

And the service is pretty atrocious. All in all, I generally don't find myself here often, even though they are the most veggie friendly place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I always eat here at least once when I'm in town.  They have a truly incredible selection.  They have very many choices of food that is both delicious and really good for your health.  Plus, the choices aren't boring."}
{"text":"A true neighborhood staple, here since the 1970s. Stating the obvious: try the milkshakes. I'm vegetarian and there are so many options I don't know what to do with myself. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place has the best milkshakes! I like to mix up different flavors. The atmosphere is Wonderfull, its a good place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"We visited Tommy's today for the first time in a long time. As always, the food was amazing but the service was lacking. Our waitress Jennifer took our order, barely smiled and we didn't see her again until she brought us our checks. We were both out of drinks halfway through our meal."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. I sat at a booth, it cut down on the noise in the restaurant. I had a meat pie (I believe it was called Keith). It was decently priced and delicious. I will defineltly go back."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrendous. The food is mediocre at best.  Be prepared to meet the worst waitresses imaginable."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cleveland, and fell in love with Tommy's after my first visit there, back in the late '80's. I worked there for a while in the early '90's, and that experience only further convinced me of the quality and cleanliness of the food, and the good intentions and kindness of the owner and management. Since then, I moved to the west coast, but Tommy's has been a real panacea for my brother and I while we've been in town, dealing with the difficult ongoing situation of our father's recent passing and our mother's ill health. Thanks to everyone at Tommy's for keeping this wonderful place alive all these years."}
{"text":"Me and my vegan friend decided to come here yesterday. It was the greatest vegan experience I've had. Me personally, I love meat! I had no idea the veggie burger was going to taste that great. I'm glad I could share that first experience at Tommys. Also their desserts are out of this world !"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out-of-town and stopped here to meet relatives.  As vegetarians, we were excited to see a wide selection of food options.  We don't begrudge other restaurants that might only have a couple selections for us, as it is our choice to not eat meat; however, it is great when a restaurant offers dozens (?) of options.

For the first time in a very long time, I was able to enjoy a \"steak\" sub (made with Seitan), overfilled with toppings.  We can also give a thumbs-up to the spinach pie and baba ganoush.

This place may be easy to drive by.  It is almost across the street from a Marc's.  It is directly across the street from a metered parking garage and blends in with a bookstore, toystore, and other establishments.

It was crowded for the Sunday lunch and our party of 7 was sat after about 45 minutes - not their fault that they are so popular.  While one of us waited to hear our name, the others shopped at the attached bookstore.  Our service was good."}
{"text":"I'm on vacation in Ohio and my family and I had lunch and breakfast at Tommy's on 2 different days and the food was delicious, the service was wonderful! There isn't anything I didn't like. It's had a retro vibe and there is a cute little book store next door that you can explore for yourself or fun little to do with the kids."}
{"text":"I used to love Tommys, but recently I've experienced a decline in my satisfaction.
The food is just okay. A bit bland, and too expensive for the taste. I've had better. 

However, I do still enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, service and milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I love Tommy's. It's amazing comfort food and vegetarian too! Most of the stuff is *pretty* healthy, but not so healthy that you feel like you're eating rabbit food.

Their fries are amazing. I would sell a kidney for one of their milkshakes (which I suggest splitting, because they're huge). Actually, in general, portions are pretty big.

My usual is the Jane (escarole and potato pie with cheese and broccoli) but I have also tried their falafel (the JJ and EZ) which was yummy. Love their veggie burger as well. For breakfast, I love their omelets.

I gave 4 stars just because sometimes you have to wait forever for a table, despite the place being pretty big."}
{"text":"Tommy's is generally a good choice. I pretty much enjoyed everything I ordered. Hummus could have used more pita but that's the norm pretty much everywhere. Two people for 37 bucks works for me"}
{"text":"Oh Tommy's, I miss you and there's no place like you in Chicago.  Food is okay, Shakes are great.  I was very happy to see that the entire restraunt is non-smoking.  I was surprised to see all the suits in there durning lunch.  Must have something to do with all the condo's going up."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a hidden gem.
Prices are amazing and I'm assuming the owners son was serving us. 
Place is well kept, food was amazing but damn was the jerk chicken spicy, I had to ask for a pitcher of water for myself! OVERALL the jerk chicken was bomb as hell but spicy like hell too"}
{"text":"The vegan milkshakes!! I'm usually all about chocolate, but the vanilla vegan shake is to die for. I love how Tommy's has breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for whatever kind of mood you're in. I had the vegan Reuben sandwich (I forget the exact name of it), and it was SO GOOD. I had never had tempeh before and obviously learned how amazing it is. Add the sauerkraut, dressing, and rye bread - you just need to try this. With a milkshake. Definitely. Another plus about Tommy's is the friendly workers who are more than happy to explain any bit of the menu to you, make recommendations, etc. The servers love the food, and their excitement is contagious. Can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Everyone who works there is polite and helpful, even before non-allergy dietery restrictions weren't well known this place had Gluten free, vegan, dairy free, etc. options for everyone to choose from. A great place for families and groups of friends. There are multiple places for large parties and seating is easy and quick, sign in on a clipboard at the front and wait for your name to come up.
Get a Milkshake (even just to-go), you wont regret it!
Do note - they do accept credit cards, but do not accept all (Don't take your Discover Card)."}
{"text":"Customer service was decent. The inside was crowded which doesn't really allow for waiting for takeout so that wasn't smooth. I ordered the AJ Wrap which included rice, chili and veggies. It was a nice size but pricey to me. It was pretty bland with no seasoning whatsoever so I'm gonna have to give it an overall 3 stars. Also there seemed to be more bland rice than chili which was extremely disappointing for $11. Boooo to this item. I ordered a vegan chocolate chip cookie with walnuts and it was just ok. I won't be going out of my way to visit this joint next time I'm in the east side."}
{"text":"Tommy's is the very first restaurant I visited when I moved to Cleveland 11 years ago.  It is still one of my most favorite.  The one thing I can't figure out is why no one else makes food like Tommy's.  My go to favorite is the BW (falafel with cheese, veggies, mushrooms, and tahini).  Their fries are perfect, and the milkshakes are delicious and big enough to split with a friend or two.  The few times I've tried other things from the menu (it's so hard not to get that BW!), like salads, spinach pies, soups, I have not been disappointed.  

The only bad thing about Tommy's is that they don't take reservations, which can mean long waits at times, and there really isn't much space for waiting.  Still totally worth it.  Some people get scared off by the huge selection of creative and vegetarian dishes, but they shouldn't.  Just keep looking.  There really is something for everyone to love."}
{"text":"This place just opened up in my area in the plazas right out of Vaughan Mills. 
GREAT VALUE. The prices are amazing. Most every dish is under $10. And the portions are HUGE.
This is actually a rare find in the Vaughan area. A place that actually gives you value for your money.
The style of food is very Caribbean influenced. According to my dad it's like traditional Cantonese style cooking with the a twist from the islands. Tasty food all round.
We will be back over and over again for sure."}
{"text":"Tommy's is about my favorite breakfast stop around Cleveland Heights.  Both healthy and traditional breakfast options are available.  Much like breakfast, their lunch and dinner menu is pretty big.  Generally when anybody comes to visit from out of town, I take them here.  It's hard to not to find something on the menu regardless of what your tastes are.

I would definitely recommend the breakfast sandwich with peanutbutter as well as their milkshakes (one goes a long way)."}
{"text":"Great place! Can't believe it took me this long to go there.

I loved my sandwich - the ceebee. The three other girls I was there with said it was their go-to sandwich of choice and that they order it most of the time. I have never paired falafel with cheese, but it was oh so good. (Also featured on this toasted pita sandwich was the creamiest, most delicious hummus ever, sunflower seeds, veggies, and sprouts.)

It's true what they say about the shakes...don't leave without one!

My table did not have any problems with the service, as some other yelpers did. It was prompt, accommodating, and competent. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's probably what you'd expect from a typical diner, except more vegan/veggie options. The men's bathroom was really gross with piss on the floor and water and god knows what all over the sink. And there was one long reusable hand towel dangling on the floor. The place could use a deep cleaning and maybe a fresh paint job (not white walls). Alcoholic options to drink even just a mimosa or Bloody Mary would be nice too. Had the 10 buck Curt Burger which was cooked perfectly, although not the greatest burger I've ever had in my life. Ok place to eat for the prices~"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my sandwich and my shake. The menu was VAST. I spent more than 20 minutes perusing and deciding on an order. I couldn't even read all of the options. However, I was happy with my selection. I was also perplexed and intrigued by postcard advertisements for the 'Flower Clown'. Flower Clown was not present during my visit. But I look forward to dining while Flower Clown performs some day. I liked the overall atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night and I was a happy camper.  If you like spicy foods, you will definitely not be disappointed. Ordered jerk chicken, chilly fish dry not saucy ( we requested)
(OMG super spicy but to die for) and chow mein with fried chicken leg.

I will go back again, but the sad thing is that, no one really knows that this place is around because of its location.  It may be a lot busier during lunch, but I think people should go check it out for dinner as well. Keep this place open.  We need more of these places in Vaughan.

Affordable, delicious and clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian selection!  My favorite is the Lynne.  Can't leave without getting a milkshake, too.  There are so many flavors to choose from!"}
{"text":"Tommy's: delicious, bustling, colorful

*Cookies & Cream milkshake
*E.Z.: (vegetarian) Falafel, veggies, cheese and sesame sauce"}
{"text":"Legendary hangout and funky sandwich stop.  My first hummus, but not my best.  The Coventry strip is old school funky, but has probably gone all yuppie.  The largest head shop I have ever seen was just a few doors down--it was like the Ikea of head shops, but it may be an actual Ikea now, for all I know."}
{"text":"Still five stars, but I wanted to share my first Tommy's burger experience with everyone. Soooo good! I got a cheeseburger with \"The Works\" and it was absolutely perfect. And those pickles!! Sliced, but not all the way, so they keep the shape of the whole pickle! Their fries are also wonderful and we asked to have them before our burgers, so we could get some food in our hurting (hungover) bodies ASAP. They came quickly and long enough before our burgers--perfect timing, really. 

Love."}
{"text":"Tommy's is an awesome restaurant for both the food, and the soy milkshakes.  The spinach pies are great, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Tommy because it is highly reviewed on Yelp. I think most of the reviews on Yelp about this place are correct. I will rate this place high too. There are plenty of options for vegetarians like me. Location is quite nice and across a big parking lot. The place is always busy and they tend to promote people with bigger groups ahead of single people in the queue (this is my personal feeling and that might not be true all the time). 
The food here is very good. I ended up ordering the same food twice because I wanted to enjoy it again. There are plenty of middle eastern options. I am not a big fan of their Falafel but the way they put it together in a sandwich is nice. 
The place has plenty of space and some bar stools for sitting. I found the waiter staff a bit overwhelmed on both occasions I visited this place."}
{"text":"Tommy's granted a dying woman's last wish for one of their mocha shakes. So beautiful and truly Bittersweet! 

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40809032"}
{"text":"Very good selection of vegetarian and vegan food.  Tasty food and friendly staff.  Very crowded with lots of families and extremely noisy.   I'll only return during a lull period (if I can find one)."}
{"text":"I grew up with tommy's. Had my going away dinner here. Good eats, I've never tried the milk shake though."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have lots of veggie options but also have options for meat lover."}
{"text":"Any true Clevelander knows Tommy's: Yes, there's a line, but it only proves how good it is! This little place not only has great food, but a cool history that makes you happy to know where all the \"cool cats\" hang out. Do not pass up the monster sundae or the sweet potato fries; they are an absolute must!"}
{"text":"Always a good regular spot.

Crazy huge menu thats very consistent.

Most of the menu caters towards vegetarian and middle eastern dishes, but theres definitely enough for a carnivore, with subs worth two meals.

Fairly friendly staff (though it does vary) and once you sit down its speedy service, generally, but getting a seat may take a while. Its veeeery popular.

Oh, and they basically have some of the best milkshakes, malts, phosphates, etc. etc. around. PHOSPHATES! Who sells those anymore?"}
{"text":"I like this place! If you are vegan or vegetarian or just looking for a healthier option, this is the place to go in the area in my book! 

If I'm being critical, the pricing is only slightly high (better than little Italy prices from my experience though) but the portions are larger than I expected as well. 

The wrap I had with beans, rice, and assorted vegetables was tasty. Not overdone. Filling but still lightish.

The french fries are cooked PERFECTLY and taste great although they don't seem to be seasoned. Best of both worlds there if you want fries but want the healthiest possible version of them. 

Will go again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a great local Cleveland Heights institution. They have a really good selection of gluten free items, which takes off my worry about not being able to eat anything. I really like the gluten free waffles, and have had some great sandwiches there. This is a no frills place. Even better, for a GF breakfast, you can be satisfied for under $10. I highly recommend this place to anyone stopping through Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"I'm still recommending this place to people, and I haven't been there in close to five years.  Friendly and helpful staff, and amazing food.  To date, the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant I have been to.    I dream about their MR4 and milkshakes."}
{"text":"Living close to Coventry, this is my wife's first choice for going out to breakfast or lunch on a weekend. Getting seated never takes too long, the service is a friendly and efficient, and the ambiance is fun and energetic. They are also connected to a great bookstore, which my inner bibliophile adores! 

They have an extensive menu with something for everyone, and have a long history of being friendly to those with alternative diets (which is good to know if you are someone who struggles to find accommodating places). They also have fun names for all the dishes!

I sometimes find their offerings to be overwhelming, making it hard to decide what to get, but when you live so close coming back to try something else is easy. Out of everything, I think they do breakfast best. Their pancakes are a generous size, their eggs are fantastic, and the bacon is crispy. My wife likes to switch it up when we go, but I tend to stick to the Lisa for breakfast, substituting bananas for strawberries. It's excellent every time I go, which says wonders about their consistency.

The milkshakes are, of course, amazing - but I think the malts are even better!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options lead to my best meal while in the Case Western district. Great menu with servers willing to explain options. Went with mixed group and all loved choices from meat pies, burgers and great vegan cheese dishes that melted well! Hats off! Also loved the diversity of eaters illustrating their appeal to all types of people."}
{"text":"Sorry, but Tommy's has slipped from their glory years of the 1970's.  I'd love to write a glowing review about a long-time favorite hangout from my youth in the Heights - but I can't.  Given the paucity of area restaurants, I'm giving three stars, though I feel Tommy's probably deserves 2.5.

If you were new to Tommy's you'd probably wonder what the fuss is about.  What they've got going from them is longevity.  That and they make good-tasting shakes.  The coffee is thin-bodied, what you'd expect from a diner.  But the biggest letdown are their signature sandwiches - while sounding good on paper, the ones I've recently had were underwhelming in both taste and execution.  Ingredients were neither piping hot nor were the portions generous.  I experienced tasteless cardboard tomato slices, lettuce comprised mostly of the stem, etc.

Given the many veggie options on the menu, I was surprised that there's no info on whether the ingredients are pesticide-free, GMO-free, etc.  I know this may be more of a west coast thing, but I think people who seek out veggie options are becoming increasingly aware of the how their food is sourced.

I'd recommend management turn off the autopilot and really take a look (and taste) at what's being served."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Aside from the huge menu, I was instantly transported back to being in Berkeley, CA based on the decor and the menu.  I ordered the AD which was tuna on pita with falafel, cheese, and tomatoes.  So yummy.  The pita was thin and delicious.  There is a good selection of vegan/vegetarian options, and the milkshakes seem to be a popular item among patrons.  This place gets busy for lunch so if you don't want to wait for a table, opt to sit at the counter.  Fast service.  Cool, independently-run vibe."}
{"text":"Tommy's is the perfect stand by dinner/lunch place. If you are in a crunch and need a place to go- go here. You can take anyone here and they will be happy.  The food is incredibly delicious and they cater to both vegetarians and meat-eaters. Unlike other places the veggie options here are wonderful. Tommy's is also famous for their milkshakes and these can easily be split between two people.   The food is great, the staff is great, the prices are great and the location is great.  On weekends be prepared to wait, but the smaller your group the quicker you will be seated and there is a cute book store attached that you can roam while waiting. 

Suggestions:

any spinach pies, fries, and any grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Tommys is an amazing place to eat on Coventry. The food is declious and they have a variety of different food choices on their menus. Most importantly they have the best milkshakes!!!!! I remember going here when I was little and loving their milkshakes and now when I go it brings back so many good memories."}
{"text":"Wow, TONS of plant-based options to choose from! 

I was with a party of seven and everyone enjoyed their food. Five of us were plant eaters and the other two went along with us because we gave such convincing arguments. They loved their vegan selections, too. 

The homemade soups were terrific and the hummus was absolutely delicious. I've never had hummus like it, but it was oh so divine. 

I had the French onion soup, no bread, no cheese. The broth was so good! I also ordered the tamales with chili and a side of brown rice. The portions were huge and the flavors were off the hook. 

If you're trying to eat healthier and you want a quick, cheap variety, check out what they have going at Tommy's.

They're right near the Huron Hospital where people are being treated for diabetes and other chronic illnesses. If you're there with a loved one and your doctor suggests eating healthier, stop by Tommy's, order plant-based, and see how delicious healthy living can be!"}
{"text":"Might as well pile my own review onto the local institution. I've been coming here for 20 years. Hands down, best shakes and french fries in Cleveland, with a varied menu covering many options. 

I've had the occasional slow service or long wait to get seated, but you'll have the occasional challenge if you go often enough. It's a small place in a hip spot and the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean Chinese food. I had the General Tso's Chicken lunch special and it was very filling and flavorful. Service was friendly and the restaurant is clean. Prices are very reasonable. I definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"props (yeah right--HELLO!!!) to whoever typed out the menus and spelled humus 'homos' ....SERIOUSLY! i asked the waitress what a homo was besides a gay man, she was not amused. i could tell when she rolled her eyes and said \"yeah yeah we KNOW\". not that she answered my question. i figured out it was humus by going back into the menu and reading what was IN a homo. and since chickpeas and sesame and spices were there and not a hankering to get down with other men, i thought it sounded a lot like humus ingredients and low and behold....

maybe i should have ordered the homos since my salad was putting me to sleep with its lack of anything worth typing about....isn't this a veggie restaurant? why am i eating a bad salad here?....why was there a line out the door? is cleveland that desperate for restaurants? 

tommy's gets 1 star for having nice lighting and the rest of the staff (besides our waitress) being nice and cute. and 1 honorary star for the people of cleveland who see and taste something i don't."}
{"text":"I came here for a cookies and cream milkshake to go, so that's the only thing I can comment on about this place. I have heard they have amazing milkshakes, but honestly they were pretty basic. I mean, I saw them make the milkshake in front of us, and it was a few scoops of ice cream and some milk. For almost $6 for only 20 oz, I would expect something more creative than that. Maybe like toppings, chocolate sauce, more than two ingredients? Idk. Of course, the milkshake was good, but you can't go wrong with ice cream and milk."}
{"text":"Tommy's has a huge menu of vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose-free foods. They also have meat. It seems that most of the menu is variations on a few things: salads, falafel, burgers, breakfast. 

My lunch was ok. I was so excited by the menu, but the food was a little bland, a little lukewarm. I also ordered a lemon cookie, which turned out to be a \"throw everything in the cupboard into it\" cookie--oatmeal, raisins, nuts, rice blah blah blah. It didn't taste like lemon. I was disappointed. 

I think I'd probably have to go here a few times to figure out what I like on the menu."}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, I actually was entirely unaware that Tommy's was a long standing vegetarian institution in the area, because after a 6:00am flight out of Boston, all I wanted was a really stellar burger, and Tommy's is where we ended up. 

We knew there would be a wait for a table by the amount of people standing around, but the \"host\" is actually a pad of paper for you to write your name on the list which is pretty inconvenient if you have a movie to catch or something. We were ravenous so it was fortunate we only ended up waiting 20 minutes or so for a table. I briefly scoped out the vegetarian options on the menu but was sticking with my original craving for a juicy burger, as did everyone else at the table except my sister. Our food came relatively quickly and we split some fries and milkshakes to wash it all down.  

My Curtburger was well seasoned and topped with tons of mushrooms and onions, but the mayo was slopped a little thick and the bun was nearly soaked all the way through from the meat juices. The fries were fine after a solid dousing of salt (yes, they are marked as unsalted) and the milkshake was quite delicious.  My sister however was rather displeased with the veggie platter she got and I couldn't blame her. The hummus had a really poor texture, the spinach pie was super vinegary, and a \"dip\" that seemed to be just straight tahini. For a known vegetarian restaurant, I certainly never expected a beef burger to be executed much better than the non-meat offerings but overall the experience is worth another try should I be in the area again."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone- it has to because I think there are over 100 choices on the menu.  It's great whether you are a vegetarian or carnivore.  And the milkshakes are out of this world.

We are partial to the pita sandwiches, loaded with cheese and goodness.  The breakfasts are great as well, with some unusual choices such as the Mr. Stress which is a BLT with peanut butter and mayo on it.  Today I tried the Quinn.  It is a pita with six kinds of melted cheese, some veggies and peanut butter.  It was surprisingly good.

Typically I order the Zippy and my wife orders that Quigly.  Both are excellent.  Today we ordered a kids pancake for our son which was just okay.  The batter was a little thick and made the cake somewhat heavy.  

If you are in the area, or not in the area, be sure to swing into Tommy's for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there last night with friends (a couple) who moved to Cleveland right after our last visit.  The food was again very tasty, the service was pleasant and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  We discovered that Tommy's has been in existence for *41 years*, which is rather amazing.  Also; first we (again) visited Mac's Backs Books, which is adjacent to Tommy's (see my separate review)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good food, fun atmosphere, and great prices. Tommy's is known for producing some of the tastiest vegetarian dishes that are uniquely named and their delicious shakes! I'm not a vegetarian, but their meat dishes really surprised me as they were full of flavor and tasty. The meat pies are a little greasy, but definitely tasty. It is also connected to a bookstore and you're welcome to browse the store while you are waiting for a table. A meal here would cost you about 7-8 bucks per person."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble upon this place while looking for a florist and saw meat pies on the menu, so I had to stop and get some grub. The welcoming decor also helped. My mom was not convinced that this would be a good culinary destination, so she opted for a slice of pizza. LAME, MOM. YOU MISSED OUT. NO PIE FOR YOU.  

Sadly my stomach can only fit so much into it, so I just got the TG Meat pie, which has the base lamb/beef/onion with the addition of mushrooms and cheese. This is definitely not a handheld pie like I'm used to a la The UK/Australia; it's a fork-and-knife kind of deal, which is legit because it's oozing with filling and delicious, savory meats. A very good pie. And a very reasonable price. 

Service was impeccable and very friendly; I was in town for a funeral and not in the best mood, but the ladies working made me feel tons better (and kept that coffee mug FULL). I would definitely return if I was in the area and get ALL THE PIES!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Cleveland to go. It's gluten free friendly and has amazing service. The food is reasonably priced and the milkshakes are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a fun place to dine at for people of all ages, and I think it's more about the experience than the food. Comfy wooden booths, an overflowing-with-options menu, a happy bustling vibe, friendly servers, and Mac's books right next door. The food is good but nothing outstanding. Tommy's is really the place to go for a sweet treat -- the shakes are perfection!"}
{"text":"Tried Tommy's today. Ordered take out  Cantonese chow  mein, chilly chicken and pepper shrimp. Food was very good, if you like spicy food (like authentic Caribbean spice) then you would love this place.  Prices are reasonable and quantities are plentiful.
I'm sure they can adjust the spice on request.
I would recommend the food."}
{"text":"I crave food from Tommy's. I have never been disappointed by anything that I have ordered here! A must for vegetarians. Try a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Back in the day we'd get some pretty good veg-friendly (though Im not veg) food, but the milkshakes were the thing.  On a recent trip back, the milkshakes were still great."}
{"text":"I do not know what all the four star ratings are about for this place. 

I ordered a salad and I got something out of the 1970s -- iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and chopped olives out of can. The lettuce was fresh but who wants to eat stuff like this??

I ordered falafel. I ordered one with baba and mushrooms. The whole pita was drowning in baba. There was no balance to this dish. It was not enjoyable. 

I would not go back and I would not recommend you go there either."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian - at all.  I love meat and get upset if I don't have meat in my meal.  (In fact, I probably haven't ordered a salad on it's own in two years.) However, I have to say I love this place. I get the spinach pie all the time and am pretty happy with it. Even if I don't come for lunch/dinner, I find a convenient excuse to drop by to grab a black cherry malt to go. I always recommend this place to my vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"Walked in and waited to be seated for 15 minutes. Asked to be seated and was told no you have to wait. Finally got seated and no server for 10 minutes. Place was dead. absolutely unacceptable.

Kathleen was out server, she was wonderful and took good care of us. Every single other person in this place walked around with a smug look on their faces. No body greeted us aside from our server who was running around taking care of everybody."}
{"text":"I must whisper this review to you.  For were the Greater Cleveland area about to hear the three words I shall utter into the shell-like curves of your ear, I would be lynched - strung from the rafters, torn to shreds, my bones burnt to embers.  And those words are this: 

Tommy's is overrated.  

For some reason, Tommy's has acquired a cult of personality in the Land of Cleve that baffles me.  Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly *good* restaurant.  If you're looking for milkshakes, it has the best in town.  

But the food?  Is merely okay.  It's heavy on vegan-friendly food, and the whole place looks like a hippie with a cleaning fetish opened up a diner  ... So if you're looking for your macrobiotic sprout pita, you're probably so grateful to find a place that doesn't spit meat juice in your eye that you'll happily proclaim it the second coming of a vegetarian Christ.  

The rest of us, though?  The menu is awkwardly repetitive - you know the way Taco Bell takes lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, chicken, and beef, and tries to convince us that they have A THOUSAND OPTIONS?  Yeah, it's like that.  The menu is gigantic, until you realize that about ten of the choices all boil down to \"this is a pita-hummus thing with sprouts, this is without, this has peppers added.\" 

And the food is... Well, bland.  Given what you pay for the privilege, it's oddly heavy on grain tastes, and the hummus isn't even as good as the dearly-departed SAJ.  

Also, you have precisely three chances to talk to your waitress: When she takes your order, when she brings the food - and, twenty years later, when she brings the bill.  If you want, say, a refill on your water, you'd better bring a flare gun, because Tommy's is busy and does not break stride for mere customers.  

Still, their milkshakes are to die for.  They probably ask the cows really nicely for the milk, and get cream.  Silly hippies."}
{"text":"Not being a vegetarian, I was skeptical of Tommy's at first. The menu can be a little shocking for someone not used to seitan, tofu, or sunflower seeds on everything. But after trying the Ceebee (falafel pita with hummus and other fixings) I was completely won over. It was delicious, if a bit awkward to eat. Looking around at the surrounding tables, everyone else's food looked good as well and I'll definitely be going back to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Tommy's is soo deliciouss!! They have a good selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  They also have a nice selection of burgers and sandwiches with meat for the carnivores.  I don't come as often as I like, but usually when I do come they have a bit of a line to wait in :(

Their French Onion soup is really savory, but a little to sweet for my taste buds.  

The Falafel is really good, much more flavorable than any Falafel from Aladdin's 

The french fries are to DIE FOR with malt vinegar and ketchup already on the table- its hard to resist getting them.  I justify eating them because I convince myself that Tommy's is \"healthy\" hahahaha.  It gets four stars because of the greasy goodness of the french fries

Their burgers and sandwiches are good but nothing phenomenal- I usually get their turkey burger loaded with grilled mushrooms, onions, etc.
Their falafel pocket is pretty good as well with a little hot sauce :)

The milkshakes are pretty good (I don't really like milkshakes too!) When I do feel indulgent enough to get a milkshake its usually cookies n cream or cookie dough.  I've had a quick sip of their tofu milkshake, it's pretty good for tofu- no substitute for regular ice cream though.

It's a kid friendly place with a menu and things to occupy them while you're trying eat- ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A CLOWN THAT COMES IN ON THURSDAYS THAT CREEPS ME OUT A LITTLE"}
{"text":"Right on Case's campus you can find the best milkshakes in the world.  

And everything else on the menu is healthy and delicious.  They have a great selection of salads and other entrees for vegetarians and vegans.  

I miss this place!"}
{"text":"Tommy's has been serving up vegan and non-vegan breakfasts, lunches and dinners for decades in Cleveland Heights' Coventry district. Myriad potted plants and bright, light colors add a cheery ambiance, while courteous, efficient servers make for a pleasant, memorable dining experience.  Their signature milkshakes alone are worth a visit.  Parking can be tricky, especially on weekends; take advantage of the local municipal garage just a short walk away."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch after exploring the art museum. I was excited about the many, many vegetarian options on the menu and the promises of all the savory pies (we'd seen a picture of a \"Pie Wagon\" from the 1930s and I was left craving pie).

We accidentally decided to explore Coventry on Star Wars Appreciation Day, but the wait to be seated wasn't bad. Wait staff were friendly and the ambiance was cheerful and low-key.

First, let me say that the baba ganouj was incredible. Not too smokey and with a great amount of garlic, good texture. I would eat this stuff with a spoon (and I did, with what I took home).

For main food, I got the endive and potato wheat pie with muenster cheese. It came looking a bit like a folded savory crepe with a very thick crust. I'm not sure if it was the whole wheat flour they used, but the crust was a bit tough and tasted just okay. I enjoyed the insides, but the flavors weren't anything too remarkable. I'd probably choose a more interesting type of pie next time (they have a number with the baba in them so. . . you can't really go wrong, I expect). 

For the milkshakes--I didn't get one, but my date grabbed one of the specialty Star Wars ones (something about the double chocolate dark side?) and said it was delicious. He had so much that he got a to-go cup to take the second half of it home. I saw some vegan, Tofutti milkshakes in the menu, but I wasn't brave (or hungry) enough to grab one this time. 

Overall--some good options, some blander ones. Probably takes some exploration to find your own favorites, but that's definitely possible with all the options."}
{"text":"Seriously Tommy's, you should consider opening a location on High St in Columbus. But since that won't happen, I guess I'll have to deal with visiting every time I head back to Cleveland. Simply put, Tommy's is amazing. When you arrive, be prepared to wait a LONG time. And stay inside the restaurant, since every other person seems to be MIA when their name is called. First, this restaurant has a great atmosphere. You can find everyone from hipsters to families eating out here. This is probably because of the great menu. The Spinach Pies are fantastic (try the MR2!). Also recommended are the fries, which must be tried. For my money, they are the best fries in Cleveland. If you are a vegetarian/vegan, this is also your place. The menu is clearly marked with a plethora of vegan options. Finally, make sure you try the milkshakes! I cannot recommend Tommy's enough. If you've got a hankering for unique food in an eclectic neighborhood, stop at Tommy's!"}
{"text":"Tommy's has been a staple in the veg-community for many, many years. They specialize in a variety of Middle Eastern foods, and have the best vegan milkshakes! However, my favorite dish at Tommy's is the McKenna (A seitan/ fajita type wrap) with a side of their delicious homemade fries.

Tommy's is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland!

{"text":"the spinach pies are seriously amazing.  Most recently I went for lunch on a weekday, and the place was almost empty --no surprise, wasn't even eleven yet!  Attentive, but not hovering service and seriously amazing food. it's beter to avoid the lines if you can, though.

I do agree with the concerns that the menu is a bit long and unweildy--it has kind of a treasure hunt feel.  I don't know that spinach pie needs a completely different name from spinach pie with cheese, which has a different name from spinach pie with cheese and mushrooms, which is one ingredient different from something else with a completely different name  . . . 

East side's got its melt-now west side needs its Tommy's!"}
{"text":"I love the DC falafel with a chocolate raspberry milkshake. My favorite vegan restaurant by far! Very tasty"}
{"text":"A disappointment, unimaginative salad and protein shake full of ice and over priced. Ho hum."}
{"text":"Tommy's is good place to eat. I have to agree that they are some other reviewers they are expensive. I don't go there as much so I don't mind paying a little more when I do.

If I could offer one suggestion I would say larger portions!"}
{"text":"I like the salad selection and it's fun to treat myself to a shake or a malt every once in a while. Also, they are really good about making all sorts of eaters (vegetarian, carnivore, vegan, gluten-sensitive) feel welcome! They have options for everyone."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. Good \"basic\" food made with fresh ingredients. And the milkshakes are out of this world (including the dairy-free ones)."}
{"text":"Oh my lord, get a milkshake here. Just do it. The yogurt black cherry milkshake specifically is to die for!"}
{"text":"I live on the West side, but am contemplating moving East almost entirely based on my love of Tommy's.  I'm there nearly every weekend and I've tried a good variety of their FIVE PAGES (or more?) of offerings.  Their menu is a book.   

They've got the basics covered -- the best fries, the best shakes.  Actually, to say \"best shakes\" is an understatement, as I don't think I understood happiness before getting a chocolate malt from Tommy's.  Recently, I sat near a table of two old ladies, who were clearly Tommy's newcomers. One of them ordered a shake and I made a point of watching her reaction to the first sip: It was like watching the face of a newborn baby, no joke.  Her eyes got all wide and she couldn't stop sipping. 

But they also have some weirdly delicious sandwich combinations, if you're a more adventurous eater.  Some of my favorites: the Quinn -- peanut butter and cheese with veggies on pita, the Delaney -- tempeh, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and spinach on rye, and the M.R.3 -- baba ghanoush, hummus, falafel, mushrooms, and cheese.  Once, just once, I had a bad experience, when I CLEARLY ordered the wrong thing -- I ordered a pumpkin curry thing they had as a special.  Anywhere else, it would have been acceptable, but I was eating it while sitting across from my date happily stuffing his face with a delicious Quinn.  It was too much. I was so jealous.  Never get their dumb specials."}
{"text":"Well, today's lunch was a disappointment. Our bill was over $26, and we ordered two soups and hummus. Soup was tasty (black bean chili) but hummus came with seven smaller pieces of pita, so we asked for more, and they charged us .60 cents. Come on now.

The service was the worst part. We were given waters once our whole meal came. We reminded our server twice before but nothing happened. Of course, when we got our check, she was all about being attentive to check us out so that she could turn over her table. I'm not saying that all the servers are like this, but ours was just terrible and inconsiderate. Didn't even say thank you at the end. 

We won't be back. There are better options out there. Come to the west side!"}
{"text":"Do what I did: order a banana milkshake and a Ceebee and your tummy will be very happy. I definitely want to bring my vegetarian best friend here someday if we road trip together.

The only reason why it's 4 stars is because it looked like it was constantly slammed. The only reason I got a place to sit was because I was by myself and sat at the bar. Seemed like a constant long wait if you were in parties of 2 or more."}
{"text":"They have excellent food, and have something for everyone if your vegan, vegetarian or just want a wonderful burger (which I highly recommend). Try the fries and chocolate milkshakes, yum."}
{"text":"Tommy's is great for its vegan friendly policies without affecting who is not. It's a very nice hybrid. It's a very casual and friendly place. The top star of the menu its the milkshakes or Malts. They are creamy and rich. Get one! There Meat Pie is great !many unique combinations!"}
{"text":"Tommy's has a huge menu selection!! Always a different dish to try. Prices are very reasonable, and service is usually fast. Sometimes it is difficult to get a table, but the max wait I've had in six years was only 15 minutes. I can't say that Tommy's has the most delicious food I've ever had, but still nice to try. Also, if you buy ice cream (not milkshakes), it is super cheap!!! Two huge scoops for $2."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. 
I have been going to Tommy's for 30 years. I can remember Tommy's before the fire. The menu is extensive and great for vegetarians as well as meatatarians.  I always get a spinach pie. Today was no exception. The Mary-Lynne is the best of both worlds! Spinach pie with hummus and veggies baked it. Divine!  The food quality is pretty consistent, though it does matter who is cooking. When Tommy cooks, watch out for amazing! My only two issues are: the prices have risen quite a bit in the last few years; and the waitstaff, could definitely stand to up their game in terms of both service efficiency and appropriate dress."}
{"text":"Uncle Gay - fresh orange juice - I have been going here since I was a kid and I love this place...
Tuna, cheddar, onions, sesame seeds...all in a pita! 
Great food - and I love Coventry...so...
My blast from the past!"}
{"text":"Love love love Tommy's. Enough options to make the meat eaters and veggies happy. Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great selection. Great service. Outstanding milkshakes. This place has something for everyone. They have many vegan and  gluten free options on their menu. Have a bowl of Broccolli Rizzo and a P.R. meat pie with fresh cut fries. Staff is super-friendly!"}
{"text":"The Grilled cheese was Awesome And the Fries OMG I have to go there again.  My parents loved the tofu salad and BBQ seitan. Next time I'm getting s milkshake too!  The prices were fair. Cool bookstore next door also."}
{"text":"I can really only rate Tommy's based on milkshakes and milkshake service...

Which were both good. Young kids making milkshakes with very little enthusiasm or knowledge on why anyone would want to try their milkshakes. For a place staking claims on being the \"best milkshake\" this side of the mississippi you'd think the people making em could have a favorite or at least know what to recommend. 

Alas, they don't. You pick from their list of ice creams, they blend it up with a smile and hand it over with a boba sized straw - perfect for the thick ice cream shake. 

I had three shakes during my two week stay in Cleveland. I love milkshakes. Here they aren't creative or made with homemade ice cream - a la Crown Candy - but the ice cream they use is tasty and you can mix em up however you want. 

- magical milkshake: chocolate, peanut butter (this they make in house), and toffee crunch (special flavor - not sure they carry regularly)

- solidly good: black cherry chip and toffee crunch

- yummy but sweet: black raspberry chip"}
{"text":"The displays, art and fliers on the wall speak clearly -- it's a bit of an art space with lots of spunk.  Eclectic menu choices show imagination, and its simple and efficient layout and decor tell you that it's a no-nonsense venue.

Prices are reasonable, and the organic fare is plentiful.  

Lines can be brutal, but as long as you come at a decently off hour, you should be okay.

I like particularly the fact that they have home made peanut butter.  Much more buttery than sweet, it will be a  meal that you remember.

There is no rule that they won't break, so don't be shocked at the hodgpodge of dining elections.  Be adventurous -- you might be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Tommy's is awesome!! Great food and a great vibe there. I would always stop in before a show at the grog shop. Their fries are yummy and I love the chicken salad. Stop in and try something! I bet you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The first day that I stepped foot into Cleveland, my friend and former supervisor took me to this Cleveland \"staple.\" What my friends raved about was the Tommy's milkshake. It is sooo delicious. (Once I was craving it so bad - or was I just hungry? - that I ran into Tommy's, got a strawberry banana milkshake to go, and finished it in about 8 min. Sick.) Strawberry banana is my fav!

What I like about Tommy's is that it sometimes attracts the Coventry oddballs, the interesting and sometimes-loud urban hipster youth, and the funky ones. The atmosphere is a little loud and active, so I wouldn't come here if you want to have a really important conversation.

The menu is MASSIVE! So many items, and I appreciate their vegetarian and vegan options. The pies are generally good (M.R.s, Aunt Gay, Potato and Escarole pie!). If you're looking for something hearty, get the cigar. I've recently gotten the tofu salad sandwich & shared one of their massive fries with a friend. It's a little on the salty side but it's very crave-worthy in my opinion. I went once with fellow yelper Rachael N. and downed that one.

It's definitely one of those Coventry must-tries if you're new to Cleveland, so go check it out, but it's definitely just a launching pad into the many wonders of the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I love the food and shakes.  I always visit Tommy's when I'm in Cleveland since the 1980s."}
{"text":"Cleveland original, what else can i say? First restaurant i have been to where you have to sign in yourself . Chili was good, my daughter's grilled cheese with Veggies was excellent, son's burger was very good. I would stay away prom pizza, that's average. This is old school vibe - true diner and no dive!"}
{"text":"So I have no qualms about admitting that I am equally happy eating roasted brussels sprouts with tempeh or filling a plate with every fried monstrosity ever to clog the arteries of the gods. 

That said, Tommy's is my kind of place.  One restaurant, where I can have a macrobiotic salad and chase it with a milkshake, maybe have a little seitan BBQ on the side.  Oh hells yeah. 

And although I'm a vegan, I'm the sort of vegan who likes to hang out with... well, people other than myself. So I really appreciated that I was able to go here with friends who ranged widely on that noble spectrum between omnivore and carnivore, and everyone could have exactly what they craved."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I have been going here for years and they just keep on being great!  The milkshakes are amazing, and they are HUGE!  The fries are awesome and the sandwiches are just wonderful.  
I love the hippy vibe here too.  My only minor complaint is that the service is not great.  It never has been though so I don't really think that will ever change.  I just go there with that expectation and it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"i have been a big fan and  of the owner and this restaurant for decades.  i just read the food inspection report from the cuyahoga county board of health.  this restaurant is dirty with 4-5 critical violations which are serious.  i will not eat there again until they get back to super clean (0-1 critical violations!!!  COME ON TOMMY- CLEAN UP!  always check out the food inspection report on any! restaurant or grocery ur thinking about patronizing.  you will learn alot!  i got food poisoning from a different restaurant a few years back and i never want to go this again! i was sick for 4 days! nor should you!"}
{"text":"Shakes.  Rock.  The Casbah.  

Really, that's all you need to know.  I'd never heard of \"Moose Tracks\" before I found this place, but apparently it is a known thing in Cleveland.  
The eclectic menu is fantastic and this place more than any other I can think of will please everyone in your party.

Plus, it's so hard to find decent places on Coventry, this place deserves it just for being a great place on that street."}
{"text":"Simply put: the best restaurant!

My wife and I love it so much, we used Tommy's so cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. 

Their milkshakes are legendary! Their food, amazing!"}

{"text":"Tommy's has fallen from it's former glory. Part of the experience today: napkin-thin bacon, coffee that tastes more like coffee-flavored water, orange juice that tastes like it came from a can, and a pancake served with strawberries that were still partially frozen. Although the pancakes were good, the blatant frugality of Tommy's owners leaves only the taste of \"cheap\" on the tongue. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Tommy's seems to always be referred to as, \"an institution.\"  Guess that means it must be good?

THE UP-SIDE:
Hip, semi-healthy, and lively.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:
The service is always pretty rushed and crummy here.  I've eaten here countless times and cannot think of one occasion where the server seemed happy in any way to be talking with me.  Maybe they're just under a huge rush with little help; I don't really know.  I do know that they seem to spend as little time as is humanly possible waiting on you.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Don't expect great service.  Just go and enjoy the good food and lively atmosphere.  When you're done, head over to \"Big Fun\" for a downright silly and odd collection of vintage-type toys."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I I've had in a while. Menu was not very different from other breakfast places but the quality of ingredients, vegan/vegetarian options, and quality of service sets it apart from other restaurants. I'm used to getting frozen vegetables in my omelette but the one I ordered here was stuffed with fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms and real cheddar cheese. The peanut butter on my toast was made at the restaurant and my steel cut oatmeal had fresh bananas and walnuts in it. The owner didn't even charge me for the oatmeal because they ran out of the vegan granola I was interested in. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great breakfast in a comfortable, homey atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. But the food was meh. Based on others' suggestions here I played it safe with burger and fries, and while the fries were good they weren't really anything to get excited about, and the burger was poor quality. My cousin got the pizza, and I was horrified to see the return of the \"cardboard\" pizza the lunch ladies used to serve us in grade school. Was so rubbery you couldn't even cut it with the knife. She did have a chocolate shake which was good, but my cookie dough shake was a huge disappointment. All the pieces floated to the bottom and couldn't get through the straw, so it was essentially a vanilla shake. We also waited a long time for service, took us 2.5 hours total from start to finish. Not what you expect from a diner."}
{"text":"What a sweet and generous gift to provide the ill woman so far away her wish of a milkshake.  Impressive!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Tommy's. Recommend going before 10 am on the weekends as it can get crowded. Wonderful milkshakes. The food is always well cooked and hearty. They have a free bear-shaped pancake for young kids. The servers sometimes seem a bit rushed--perhaps they are understaffed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink very nice and clean and the people are friendly. A lot of food for your buck. Good tasty food and free tea with your meals you can't ask for more"}
{"text":"Tommy's, you have saved me time and time again from the morning after headache, and now is my chance to thank you. 

The omelettes are amazing. Try the one made with falafel! Actually, try anything with falafel.  

Would highly recommend this place for families or picky eaters. I feel like they have something for everyone. 

The ambiance is casual and inviting. Old school diner meets vegetarian-friendly Mediterranean hipster.

Ah and always ALWAYS get the chocolate shake (even at breakfast)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place given the four stars and the menu looked amazing. Alas, it was a big let down. Where to start?

The staff is really nice, the prices are on the lower side and the place has a quaint and intimate feel to it-- but the food is way too awful. There were seven of us and we were seated after a wait time of about 15 minutes. We got the famed milkshakes. Those were decent and I appreciated the fruits chopped and blended in--but still, it was nothing to write home about. And things only went down hill from there. 

The veggie burger was simply AWFUL. It was super bland and essentially was a rice cake that had been fried up.

The less said about the baba ghanouj, the better. The eggplant had obviously been barely roasted or seasoned. The baba ghanouj had a mix of waxy and grainy tasting eggplant puree, with hardly any salt. Oh and absolutely no olive oil. The pitas were old, tough and pretty bad in general.

My \"Ruth\" spinach pie was a mush of some cheese, a few slices of tomatoes and some spinach. This was the least bland of all the things we got, but that hardly means much. 
The kuchen (with strawberries) was almost to the point of being frozen hard. Yuck! The brownie was also old and hard. Needless to say, most of us hardly ate any of our meals. 

It seems that the reason why this place is still in business is because not only does this have an old institution status, but Cleveland seems to hardly have a place as vegan/vegetarian friendly as this one."}
{"text":"Tommy's will forever hold such a special place in my heart... I would even go as far to say it is in my top 5 favorite Cleveland restaurants. This is my go-to for when I have visiting family members, when I want a quick bite to eat after work, or even for celebrations with friends! There is truly something for everyone! 

This past time I was there, I got the falafel pita (pictured) which did not disappoint! My mom (who is typically a very picky eater) got the most magnificent Greek salad we may have ever seen! The number of kalamata olives on the salad was almost comical but a more than welcome blessing to olive lovers like the two of us! We devoured that salad and left the restaurant as two very happy customers ! 

Two things that in my opinion are a Tommy's right of passage- 
1) Their pickles! Absolutely incredible! 
2) Their milkshakes! I'm not typically a milkshake person but even I cannot resist a Tommy's milkshake!"}
{"text":"I went to Tommy's with high hopes. I have friends and coworkers that have raved about Tommy's forever, about the great food, friendly waitstaff, etc. Showed up with a party of five on a busy Sunday morning. Four parties (larger and smaller) were seated before us. We are finally seated, order breakfast and it takes forever to arrive and it's beyond bland. Overpriced and pompous. The waitstaff were neglectful and rude.  No drink refills, had to ask twice for our bill. If you want a fantastic breakfast and good service, visit Big Al's in Larchmere."}
{"text":"A group of us had breakfast here on a Sunday morning and it was just what I needed. Nothing beats a plate of Belgian Waffles with strawberries and whipped cream before an important midterm! The coffee kept coming with our chatting and it was a great wake-up before studying that day. The staff were friendly and everyone keeps telling me I need to go back and have one of their milkshakes or malts, so looks like I'll be doing that! 

It would be nice if parking wasn't always an ordeal or expensive in this area though."}
{"text":"Tommy's makes the best yummy vegetarian munchies for some sweet tummy lovin' good times."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place because we were so hungry! Thought it would be cool to check out a Chinese Carribbean restaurant. The pictures on the window looked appealing so we we walked in wanting to try their fried rice with fried chicken on too. We also ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup which tasted ok a bit too tangy and lacking a bit of flavour. The fried rice chicken dish however was delicious! Loved the rice! It had a unique twist compared to your typical fried rice. The fried chicken was also lightly battered and nice and crispy. The portions were pretty massive for the price you pay. 

Service was decent, poor kids didn't know what they were doing but fortunately the restaurant wasn't busy so they were able to handle our order efficiently. The restaurant was super clean and had an abundance amount of tables.

I definitely want to come back to try their sweet and sour chicken or their jerk chicken that everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"Meh. I was so excited to come to a well known veggie place. Sadly the only good thing I had was the milkshake. My veggie burger was mush. My husband-the meat eater- said the burger was dry and the best thing about his burger was the mustard my burger came with. I guess I'm still in search of a good vegetarian place."}
{"text":"Growing up in Cleveland this was one of my favorite restaurants and I still always come here when I visit. By far the best milkshakes I have ever had and great homefries. The menu has so much variety, it is easy to please everyone. Really unique place in a very unique part of town."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast, awesome milkshakes, good booths to hide out in and enjoy your company.  Everything I've tried so far have been delicious. 
I've had decent service every time, never had an issue."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Tommy's for years now but I haven't been in a while. I went yesterday with my mom for breakfast.
We were a little annoyed since there weren't any people waiting and there were plenty of tables available and we still waited for over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were there and take us to a table. We were seated in one of the booths and it took a little while for things to get going but once we ordered out food came out relatively quickly. 
My mom got the Kraig omelette and I got the breakfast special with a side of hash browns.

She liked the omelette which was cooked well and had large helpings of mushroom and spinach with just the right amount of cheese. 

MY eggs were scrambled a little harder than I would have liked, but they weren't over cooked so I was fine. The bacon wasn't crispy but you get 4 pieces which is more than a lot of places. The toast is delicious because they use real bread and not the regular run of the mill sliced bread. The hash browns, much like the fries, were delicious as usual.

Also note that they have a great selection of tea, caffeinated and herbal. 

Tommy's is definitely a good standby the selections are not particularly exciting but if you're looking for a great place to grab good ol' fashioned breakfast with a healthy twist (or if you are vegitarian or vegan) this is a great place to go. I hope to come back soon for lunch though because heir burgers and fries are delicious and OMG the milkshakes."}
{"text":"I finally visited Tommy's with my wife after 'knowing' about it for a few years.  Both of us are vegetarians that also eat some dairy products like cheese and milk.  We try to find vegan/vegetarian options at local restaurants, and with Tommy's large selection of such meals on the menu, we had to visit.

Appearance-wise, the establishment was clean and well kept.  We sat in one of the booths near the grill/kitchen and appreciated the somewhat 'private' nature of seats.  The tables were clean and the benches were comfortable.

We were promptly asked for drinks and had to order milkshakes, after reading other reviews.  They arrived within just a few minutes.  I ordered a chocolate malt, my daughter a coffee shake, and my wife a strawberry shake.  All of our were delightfully pleased with the flavor, quality and texture of our shakes.  Really good, very smooth, and blended well.  I'd order one again.

The menu is huge.  The entire first half (about 3-4 pages) is mostly vegan/vegetarian.  There are selections containing falafels, tofu, tempeh, seitan, and even a Boca Burger.  If I have any complaint, it's that there's almost too much.  The second half has more traditional meat-focused choices, but I honestly didn't read over them.  There's also a good selection of grilled cheese sandwiches.

I ordered a \"B. W. Falafel\" because I am a sucker for mushrooms and swiss cheese.  It came with green peppers, tomatoes, bean sprouts, two falafel patties, swiss cheese, and mushrooms.  There was some type of sauce but I couldn't tell if it was tahini or not.  The falafel patty was moist and tasteful, and it wasn't like any of the store-bought varieties we've had at home, so I assume they are hand made.  The pita was slightly grilled and the cheese was pleasantly melted on the inside.  It was very flavorful and all the components tasted fresh.  There may have been a little too much in the bean sprout department, but I noticed my wife's tofu salad sandwich had a large amount as well.  I simply removed a small portion and set it aside.  The pita was just barely crispy and not soggy.  I could stop eating it once I started.

All in all, I would order the falafel again, as well as the shake.  Service was fast; I believe we were served our sandwiches within ten minutes.  Our total stay was about an hour, judging from the time left on the parking meter!

It's great to find such a huge selection of veggie/vegan menu options, but there's plenty for meat eaters as well.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their milkshakes are the BEST. Also the Donovan sandwich is my personal favorite, falafel, sprouts, tahini, baba ghanoush, mushrooms, cheese and lettuce on a grilled pita. YUM! 

Be forewarned that there portions are very large, I seem to over order every time I go......"}
{"text":"I visited this place last year but didn't give it a try cuz it was a hot summer day and I wanted a cold beer with my meal. Went back tonight and guess what? No liquor license!

I decided to stay as the reviews sounded okay and the pics led me to believe I was in for a treat. I'm usually a regular at Island Mix but thought I would try Tommy's as they advertise Caribbean cuisine. The menu is indeed interesting as they list many Asian dishes and include choices of curry, jerk chicken, as well as some hakka style items. I opted for the jerk chicken, chicken fried rice, and something not in their menu but suggested by a Yelper, the pepper chicken. The portions were large, and while the rice and jerk chicken were pretty good, I found the pepper chicken (which resembled a sort of chicken pakora) dish was a little too greasy. The service was good, its a mom and pop style restaurant but nonetheless service was good! 

Prices are fair and they also offer a $8.95 lunch menu. 

My only complaint was I noticed that build up you get on condiment bottles, the dryness, you know what I'm talking about on the sirracha bottle?! Then I noticed each table including ours had large ketchup bottles?!? Why have that on the tables anyway?!? I also noticed the hardened ketchup on the cap as well, then that the date of expiry had passed (chk my pic). Shouldn't ketchup be stored in the fridge? 

So having armed all you with this, you decide on how much they place an importance on quality! 

Sorry but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"An Cleveland Heights classic. Coventry village has so much to offer and Tommy's is the center of it. The D.C. Falafel is my favorite and you have to get the fries. You will likely see Tommy himself there working in the open kitchen. Great people."}
{"text":"Had take out about 3-4 times now, first time was good, got the chili chicken. Every time after the food was bland and soggy. Never came with gravy. Not consistent!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best \"no frills\" burger & fries I have had in Cleveland  and no doubt about it the best milkshake EVER! I am not even a huge milkshake fan but this was heaven in a glass. One is big enough to split with some one else without being left wanting more. I ordered the cookies and cream and can't wait to try other flavors. Tommy's is charming and simple but by no means boring. The menu is huge and has whatever you may be in the mood for at the time, with many different genres of cuisine. When strolling down Conventry next, I will be sure to make a return."}
{"text":"man, tommy's is good.  i have to admit, i don't normally dig the tree-hugging, all natural, all organic, granola-crunchiness of places like this, but once i conquered my distrust of all things hippie, i was a regular here.

depending on what you get, some of the sandwiches can get a little greasy, but i kinda like that.  my faves were the andre, curley, jenny wrap, tlt, thc, & the steph.  went back in recently and treated myself to some nostalgia with the thc.  just like i remembered. amazing that, in 10 years, i don't think their menu has changed.  and why should it?  there is literally something for everyone, though i couldn't help but think they resented me for ordering meat.

the milk shakes are really good but, truth be told, 99% of the time i'd get the lemonade.  best. damn. lemonade. period.

so, if you're up in the heights, and strolling along coventry - and, if you're in the heights, where else would you be strolling? - stop into tommy's.  tell them james sent you.  they won't know what that means, but tell them anyway."}
{"text":"I love this place and will continue to go back.  I always try something veganly new of there menu go suffering it is to huge !!!!!! I brought a friend and my daughter who has never been here before and both people loved it.  My only Reston for giving it four stars is because the server took 15 minutes to order our drinks and when I ordered a diet  root beer it came served with am expiration date from two months ago b"}
{"text":"Great food.  The best ever milk shakes.  Support your local legend.  The DC falafel is my favorite and perhaps best French fries in town!"}
{"text":"The food here is impeccable every time I come. Service runs between awesome and good but slow depending on how busy the kitchen is. I have literally never had something not scrumptious here. Lots of unique and delicious options for the vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore alike."}
{"text":"Yep, the service DOES suck...

...but the food is so yummy, I will deal.

Went in there on a Thursday at 2p. We were literally the ONLY table in the front dining room. I was expecting undivided attention, but was sadly (and expectantly) disappointed. We got our food in a somewhat reasonable amount of time, but only one check-in by the waitress after we were pretty much finished. I would have liked more water. She was also no where in site when it came time to ask for the check. We sat and waited...and waited. 

I think I get it though. Tommy's seems to employ a certain type of individual... the trendy hipster who looks like they don't shower (or shave) on purpose. Too cool for school and WAY to cool to wait on you...bah

Ah well, you can't have eveything. I still love the food and will keep coming back. The yogurt shakes are worth the wait (they dump a whole cup of real yogurt in the shake) and the fries are excellent. For a vegetarian joint, the burgers are pretty damn good too. I love the Ripp grilled cheese though...5 kinds of cheese, sunflower seeds, green pepper and tomato on a pita. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tommy's because of my girlfriend who is vegan. While I find it frustrating at times because of her dietary restrictions, I have found myself pleasantly suprised with all the vegan and non-vegan options - and even liking some vegan options more...

I personally recommend the M.R. 3, which is a spinach pie with falafel, baba, curry, and other goodies. 

Also, for starters get the chocolate Tofutti shake (soy based, and delicious) - large enough to split for two people.

Since I've been introduced here, I've been back at least twice a month. The service is friendly, and the wait is never too long - even on Sunday brunch time, when we usually go. Thank you Tommy's!"}
{"text":"Simply the best.  My wife and I make pilgrimage back to Cleveland as often as possible just to eat at Tommy's.  The Delaney and MR4 are our favorites.  The spiked hummus is an interesting take, but not a must try.  Tamales are nothing special.  Everything else is AMAZING.  Eat here and eat often.  Reviews criticize Tommy's for price.  It is a bit expensive for the college crowd, but the serving sizes are generous.

TIP: Save room for the milkshakes.  You're going to want one."}
{"text":"I came here after 8pm on a Sunday so it was empty, with my bf and I being the only diners at the moment. I've been here a couple times before for lunch takeout and never dinner but have always liked their food. 

We ordered mixed fried rice, peppered beef steak and mixed veggies in garlic sauce. Everything was made to order so it came out piping hot. From where I was sitting I could see the chef prepare the order too lol. 

Everything tasted delicious and as others said, portions were generous. One thing that caught us by surprised was the peppered beef steak. We were both expecting sliced beef stir fried but it was actually two steaks that were flattened with a meat tenderizer and stir fried. It tasted good but it was a bit tough and chewy. Other then that everything was good! 

Overall, good experience, good food, good prices. I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I always liked this spot!
Freshen ingredients, healthy options and the very best milkshakes (both ice cream or frozen yogurt )! Recently featured on the Today Show...BTW!

I enjoyed a light omelet stuffed with falafel cakes. Onions, tomatoes ham and cheesy goodness.  Fresh kiwi, melon and orange garnish and the very best whole grain bread!

Youthful staff that all attend to your needs, family friendly and a local hangout!

Been here forever and will likely stay forever!"}
{"text":"REALLY good milkshakes. great salads! the sandwiches and savory pies can be a little unhealthy though. love everything else!"}
{"text":"i wish i could love this place. i should, since they have so many vegetarian options for me. i mean i really appreciate them for that, i really do! but the food, it's just not that great. i've had a lot of things on their menu including their spinach pies with all sorts of add ons, french onion soup, sandwiches, veggie burger... the only thing that i really liked was the bbq seitan burger. everything else was kinda meh. i come back once in a while but it's not a place that i really get too excited about. oh well."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch hour. Myself and one other ordered the Pita RLT and BLT (roast beef/bacon, lettuce and tomato) in pita bread. Great tasting and under $10 per each. 

Also, ordered the vanilla milkshake.. it's great and be careful you might want to stir it before you pour more. Lol

Great tasting, swift service and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Tommys. I really did! All in all it wasn't bad, just not what I imagined it would be. I didn't give it less stars cause it wasn't anything in particular that was bad, just maybe not my place. Went for breakfast-wasn't busy and we sat right down. 

Appears to be a large menu but it's really limited once you read it (and kinda strange in my opinion). The eggs, toast, and bacon were great!! Very good and came out quickly. The pancakes made me sad-huge but flavorless which made it like eating dense bread. Womp, womp-I was hoping to cheat meal on those suckers. 

Loved all the wood inside and the windows that let in natural light. The photos of other local business owners on the wall caught my eye and I appreciated that support! Our waitress was a doll, and checked back on us often. I'll be back for a milkshake & another meal besides breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"Tommy's has one of the most eclectic menus in Cleveland.  The lunch and dinner menus aren't to be missed. Vegetarians swear by Tommy's but they also have great burgers and sandwiches to go along with their salads and entrees.

They say nobody can screw up breakfast, but there aren't many restaurants that make breakfast as good as Tommy's.  And if you are feeling a little crazy, you can get a world class milkshake with your pancakes and eggs."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, but the service has steadily been declining. I am not sure why, but the waitstaff is not attentive at all anymore. Serious lack of refills on water and soda. The last few times I was in my table and I resorted to getting up and refilling our own drinks. Disappointing. I pretty much only get take out from here now on very rare or as eating in is more frustrating than anything now."}
{"text":"I only dined here once and as a tourist from Chicago that is accustomed to big portions and good taste, I was very impressed with Tommy's. I don't remember what I ate, but the food was good and the milkshakes were decadent!  Yes, we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table but once seated the service was good and the food was tasty. If i\"m in the area ever again, I'll definitely give this place another try!"}
{"text":"Tommy's is funky, delicious and not too expensive. Although I guess they claim to be vegetarian-oriented or whatever, I've never thought of them that way. Just good, hearty, relatively healthy comfort food. It's good stuff. Usually crowded, seems like I always have to wait in line. Great shakes. I'm really surprised at the two star review here. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Unsalted fries. Sound unappealing? Try Tommy's

Tommy's fries are in my top 3 favorite Cleveland fries. They have this incredible copper crust on the outside while the inside is as smooth as mashed potato. The potato really shines through, no salt, no pepper, no crazy mix of herbs. Just potato, fried. Simple, delicious.

This place has been my go to when I can't decide what to eat. A HUGE menu of different pies, which turns out to be rather large and very filling. They are all decent, nothing that really wows, but they are very consistent. I haven't had any real bad experiences here, but.. im not a fan of their overly-creamy/heavy baba ganouch at all. 

For some reason, I always feel healthy eating here, maybe it's the mostly vegetarian menu, or the fact that you can order menu options gluten free, but I never get that heavy-food-coma feel afterwards despite eating so much.

I always say to try something new whenever you can, but I find myself ordering the  same black cherry milkshake every single time i'm there. Dang... been ordering that shake since 2008

I also love that they have real plants all over the restaurant, and that they incorporate so much wood into the decor. The bustling vibe, coupled with consistently satisfying food, creates this infectious cheery atmosphere. I will definitely be back, probably with the same black cherry milkshake and a plate of unsalted fries. Mm... that sounds really good right now :)

Food: B+
Atmosphere: A
Decor: A-"}
{"text":"The diverse menu always seems to serve my apetite for whatever mood I'm in. The service is always friendly. My only complaint is that there never seems to be enough servers for the large crowds they attract, creating a slower turnaround on orders. Other than that, I will always recommend Tommy's to anyone, especially for the milkshakes."}
{"text":"With the constantly expanding food scene and continuing neighborhood rationalizations across Cleveland, it's hard to find a restaurant that still embodies a neighborhood's legacy.  But, just one town over in Cleveland Heights, Tommy's oozes with the true spirit of all my past memories in Coventry and Cleveland Heights.  It's been a very long time since I've been here, but this place  is still a special spot for the region.  Just be strategic in your visit because they don't take reservations and the entrance gets crowded in peak hours. 

I love that they have a gluten free menu and kitchen practices that protect against a contaminated meal.  That's important for us with celiac disease.  But what about the vegetarians, vegans, dairy free, and the carnivores?  They got those crews covered too.  And everything is packaged up in meals that feel like a cross between a diner and a healthfood store.  It's the right mix of crunchy hippy food and greasy spoon that I just can't find anywhere.  I especially love this aspect because it means the food is just slightly different from the norm.  Natural peanut butter on an egg sandwhich is something you can order, for example.

That's kind of why Coventry was so special in the past -- it had the right mix of laid-back hippy and commercialism that didn't exist anywhere else in the greater Cleveland area.  The food and the service both reflect this kind of attitude.  That means you should expect a laid-back-hippy-greasy-spoon service experience.  That's not a bad thing in my view because the servers and the food runners aren't messing anything up, they are just relaxed.

Lastly, if you leave here without a milkshake you did something wrong.  Mocha peanut butter is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"even though tommy's serves extremely healthy foods, my friends and i always manage to eat unhealthy there (cheese fries, milkshakes etc)

regardless, this was a favorite hung-over lunch spot. the hummus sandwiches are great, and the plate of huge pickles even better.

4 stars to a place that makes your body hate you just a little less for what you did to it the night before."}
{"text":"An institution.  Lots of good stuff on the menu. May have to wait a bit. Great with kids. Would return."}
{"text":"I have not been back here for a couple of years now. I must say that I still remember the cute decor - art work with the price tags displayed on the walls, which reminds you how poor you really are as a student, but the great food that you are offered at Tommy's is a consolation for all the great things that you can still afford in life... Amazing menu - a real treat for a real foodie, super cool people, and a super, super cool neighborhood. A must try restaurant in Coventry and in Cleveland in general! I am so going back here the next time I am am in town ;-)"}
{"text":"I love this place I found it a few weeks ago and have be twice so happy to find good vegan food"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing, but since I know the menu may be overwhelming, allow me to help you out:  ez falafel, fries, and a mocha milkshake."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool cafe, with an eclectic mix of vegan to carnivore options. I've been here twice, and each time I'm more impressed by the mix of options on the menu. When it comes to vegan choices, tommy's is more representative than anything I've seen in Cleveland. 

The food is around 7-16 bucks a head, making it a solid lunch option for the college crowd. I enjoyed this place, I do wish they had a liqueur license though, and more \"unhealthy\" choices. Who doesn't just want junk food sometimes after all."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a place I usually tend to eat at every time I'm in Cleveland.  Wide variety of food helps make this place great.  And everything I've had there is wonderful, vegetarian or not.  My wife is vegetarian and has lived on Californian cuisine most of her life and she absolutely loves this restaurant for it's healthy, flavorful food.  Their pita wraps are outstanding (always add sprouts) and their real milkshakes are to die for.  The service there is always top notch and the environment is very bright, spacious, clean and friendly.  A real great place to eat, right in the heart of Coventry."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to go for a healthy, satisfying, and delicious meal.  I've never gotten anything I didn't like."}

{"text":"Tommy's is a great place to eat. It's affordable and you get a lot for your money. I like that you can customize your breakfasts. They have unique names for thier dishes like Crudlee. The wait staff is very attentive and the wait to get a table is never long. The time it takes to get your order from the time you enter until the time you are served is generally 20-38 minutes. Your coffee cup will always be full. They serve their own homemade peanut butter so make sure to ask for some. There's plenty of breathing room inside so you can stretch out and relax. Very window-y too. Lots of sunshine- like eating at your own kitchen table next to the window. Clean and tasteful decor. Adjacent to the bookstore so you can pop in and browse after breakfast or whenever. Their cookies are dynamite! Chocolate chip and peanut butter chocolate chip. Open on Sundays. Park in the street. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Tommy's since I was old enough to hold a fork. I came here with my parents all the time. I came here as a young Coventry kid. Now, I returned to Cleveland after 6 years, and the first thought that came into my head: I need a motherbleeping Tommy's shake. 

I was extremely pleased to see that nothing has changed about my beloved Tommy's (except that it did seem to be a lot cleaner!). The menu was the same, and it was great seeing Tommy still behind the line cooking. 

I ordered my favourite sammich (The Silver), the spiked hummus, and a tried and true chocolate shake. My order came hot and fast, along with a healthy dose of nostalgia. The food is as good as it ever was. 

Thank you for not changing, Tommy."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my girlfriend here since it's a Heights institution from its hippie days- plus it offers lots of vegetarian options. She ended up getting a turkey burger, but I was the one who got a veggie option: the tempeh burger. Delicious. However, I had to make my meal unhealthy with the addition of a milkshake and fries.

The menu is pretty large and is not all veggie (I think there's more meat on it than I remember). However, sticking with a veggie option was the best choice for me since that's what they're known for."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great milkshakes.

I am fond of their brunch menu.

People complain about it taking too long to wait for. Both to get a table and between the time you order and actually get your food. But I find that it is just perfect for going there with a group of people you want to have plenty of time to talk to.

So if you do not need to get anywhere anytime soon, is great for getting a meal with some friends."}
{"text":"I have never made a trip back to Cleveland without at least one visit to Tommy's. Here's how to do it:
- Sign up and wait. Figure some wait-time into your meal, especially on weekends. It's worth it, though.
- Order fries. Apply malt vinegar liberally.
- Order a milkshake. You are forbidden to leave without enjoying one! I get root beer. Watch carefully as the waiter pours it into your glass so as to emulate their tapping technique when you pour the remainder out of the metal canister. If not, your seconds will glop out onto the table all at once! We've all seen this happen.
- Order your entree: falafel, toasted cheese, spinach pie, met pie, etc. I get the T.G. meat pie. You can't go wrong... well, maybe the MR4. That's the one you order and claim to love when you want to appear cooler than you actually are.
- Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Went first thing in morning when they open around 11:30 and placed order of jerk chicken lunch special. The person she told me to wait 10 mins. I waited 30 mins, did not came. People ordered after me and their food was ready. So first disappointment.
Second the food not so great. Was expecting good jerk chicken as reviews had it but the taste was not good. I think i am so fond of portland jerk in brampton that to beat its taste it would require something special.
Food was average so 2 stars for me."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a great place to go for a vegetarian like myself who identifies as a foodie that has non-vegetarian friends and family who are into food too. There's really something for everyone here, and the food is really good. The milkshakes are really something, too. With such a huge menu, it would take a lot of visits before you had to pick the same thing twice.

But I do always get the same thing because it's so good! It's their homemade veggie burger with fries and a moose tracks milkshake. Really, really good. The black bean chili and cornbread is also good. I recommend!"}

In case you hadn't noticed: This review is for the Milkshakes. I'm not talking about Dairy Industry CEOs in Dubai (Milk Sheikhs), but that probably applies to you too. Salaam, brother.

What to get: Banana shake, Chocolate mocha shake
What not to get: Laid off from your job on the docks

Since milkshakes are one of my favourite inventions in our galaxy, I can say with great authority that Tommy's makes some of the best tasting shakes you will try anywhere. I highly recommend you give them a try.

They're not huge, and they're not cheap, but they're very worth it. Made in a sealed hardened plastic cup which is honestly unique and bizarre but cool, these shakes are so creamy and flavourful, you will probably be addicted. My favourite is the banana, but the chocolate-mocha is also spectacular.

If you're skeptical due to the extremely hipster neighbourhood, well don't worry, I was too. And yes, this vegan-friendly menu is extremely Brooklancisco. But the milkshakes are what the robust and irksome Monsieur Fieri would describe as \"The Real Deal.\"

Speaking as someone who has had way too many milkshakes in his day, I can say that you won't find many that taste better than the ones here at Tommy's, and Gina agrees with me. Besides, any place that Bon Jovi sings about must be good.

{"text":"Tommy's on Coventry has been a family favorite for decades -   in my 6 year term in Cleveland, I used to cut school and go down here to eat lunch (hey - I had like 3 hours of study hall assigned by a spiteful guidance counselor).

After that - I always get in a visit to Tommy's on my rare visits to Cleveland.  My August 2011 lunch with my mom did not disappoint - they are solid with the hippie homestyle foods - mostly nutritious and all delicious with piles and piles of options for vegetarians and vegans.

One of my favorites is the BBQ seitan sandwich - but the tempeh reuben is pretty good, too!  

This is a super clean restaurant with friendly approachable kitchen staff who work on the other side of a 3/4 high wall in the center - so if you are sitting in a dark wood booth, you can watch them and strike up short chit chat once in a while.  The back dining area is much larger with tons of light - it's bright and airy without being cold.  The whole place has a warm, homey feeling without being hippy-dippy (ie - no weird art or furnishings that might alienate the 80 year old ladies who lunch from Beachwood).

Great prices and excellent service - you can't go wrong with Tommy's, whether you're a vegetarian, vegan or omni!"}
{"text":"The menu here is incredibly extensive but from what I hear, everything is great. I have only been here once and I got a spinach pie with tuna. It was huge! And very good. Unfortunately, I could hardly eat it because I had a peanut butter, chocolate, and banana milkshake prior to it. As I'm sure you have already heard the milkshakes here are amazing. It was definitely the best shake I've ever had and I tried my co-workers other flavors as well... all good. The environment was nice but the service was a bit slow. We had a party of 12 and it looked like our server was handling lots of tables so, I understood. If you're in the Cleveland area at least stop by to get a shake!"}
{"text":"Went to tommy's treating my beautiful wife to a casual meal out. We had heard about tommy's from a magazine review and were really happy about the choice. I had a spinach pie and my wife had a corned beef sandwich. And we decided to share an order of fries to leave room for the brownie dessert. The ingredients were the finest. My wife said that the beef was the leanest and best she had ever had. We could enjoy our meal in a very private booth in a very comfortable atmosphere. We definately will go again."}
{"text":"For me, Tommy's answers the life-long debate between:

\"I'm really hungover, therefore I want something good n' greasy to eat.\"

AND

\"I'm really hungover and I want something good n' greasy to eat...but I know I should eat something healthy.\"

Normally I'd sway more towards the artery clogging goodness of miscellaneous fried bar food after a boozey night out. But Tommy's gives me a happy medium via it's diner-esque goodies with a vegetarian/vegan twist. There is something to please every dietary restriction here, trust me! 

Tommy's is certainly known for it's phenom milkshakes, and for good reason too! They are a creamy, cool, sweet dream waiting to to tantalize your taste buds and make you feel insanely guilty later.  They'll make any mixture you want too. My sister lives by the peanut butter, banana and chocolate one. But you won't be disappointed in the rest of the menu either. From falafel, hummus and vegan grilled cheese, to burgers, and other deli sandwiches - it's good all around. 

My favorite item of the menu is the brown rice and veggies served with toasted sunflower seeds, tamari and hot sauce. OK, so I added the hot sauce on my own, but it's just the cherry-on-top of this simply tasty dish! The best part? Well, I usually go to Tommy's for brunch after a long night out. That means instead of getting a plate full of greezy pub grub, I'm getting a heaping-helping of whole grains and steamed veggies that satisfies without the guilt. If I could only make good decisions like this all the time...

Service can be touch-and-go occasionally, but it's all dependent on how busy they are. Yes, this concept seems pretty common sense, but you'd be surprised how many people crab. Oh, and parking on Coventry Road is the most impossible, frustrating experience of your life. Clearly, this isn't the fault of Tommy's, but Cleveland Heights cops tend to have a way of ruining almost any dinning experience you have in that neighborhood. Damn them and their crazy parking ticket writing ways.

So, yeah. Tommy's is a go. Whether you're a carnivore or a herbivore, this needs to be on your \"to try\" list. Oh, and pick me up a shake while you're there, would ya?"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Cleveland, I heard a lot about Tommy's.  My first few experiences were great.  Food was yummy and slathered with cheese. And the milkshakes are AMAZING.  As my foodie tastes have grown, I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of Tommy's food anymore.  I went there recently with my family.  The vegetarian chili was a hit. The hummus was ok.  I can't even remember what I ordered.  It wasn't bad, but it's not standing out anymore.  I will still go back for a Tommy's milkshake over the summer, but I probably won't bother ordering anything else."}
{"text":"I'm sure that Tommy's has this classic Cleveland charm that the locals really enjoy. But Tommy's has never been a destination lunch spot that I seek out or crave.  

I find their menu extremely overwhelming. They can make everything, we get it. Even if it's not on the menu - I promise and guarantee you, if you were to ask for it - they're gonna be able to make it. 

This is great if you're the type of person who also loves to walk into a book store just to look at all the pretty books. But, I'm the type of person who doesn't have time to waste. If I want to buy a book, I go to the bookstore. I go to the bookstore because I want to read. My hope is to leave the bookstore with a book I can't put down. 

I go into Tommy's knowing I want falafel. That's all I know. But to proceed in placing my order I have to create a flow chart before the waitress returns. Do I want my falafel on my tuna sandwich? Do I want it with mushrooms? Do I want it served cold or warm? Wait. Hold up. Maybe I want it on my salad instead? Le sigh. It creates a real problem. Just give me falafel, damn't. 

What about the portions? WAY TOO MUCH. I've never seen a salad bowl so big. And, I'm a salad girl. But, I can't even finish it. And the toppings - you could easily ask for chocolate sauce on your salad if that's your thing. 

They pile all the toppings on top of the greenery. So, then you have to scrounge around and mix your own salad without messing your lap. I wish they'd serve it in a bucket with a lid. The bucket would fit all the salad they serve you and then you have a tool to shake it up in as well.

Does Tommy's pride themselves in all the vegan options they provide to their patrons? Perhaps, but Crop and Whole Foods do a better job at presenting and creating interesting and enticing menus that make vegans yearn to repeat their experience time and again. 

The moral: Too much of a good thing can be a very bad thing. Less is more."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a solid, vegetarian-friendly Cleveland Heights staple that I'm lucky to have so close to home. The menu is diverse and extensive - one could eat here ten times and have ten vastly different dining experiences. I will say that I could do with larger portions, and some items aren't as good as others, but on the whole, Tommy's puts forth a quality product at a decent price. MR and a shake and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Tommy's twice since moving to the Coventry area.  Both times left something to be desired.

Our first trip was atrocious.  The waitress literally threw our silverware at us.   She brought us one glass of water and that was the end of it.  And after our food was served, she never returned to ask how we were doing until she brought the check.  She was completely unprofessional and lacking in social graces. In addition, we felt openly judged for wearing secular clothes in a clearly hipster environment.  Izod is not a crime people.  Our experience was so negative that I don't even remember what I ate.

The second time was better. We did have an awkward interaction upon entering the restaurant when we stood there unsure of what to do while 3 servers just stood behind the counter finishing whatever conversation they were having.  Additionally, we were seated as far away from other customers as possible and it took forever for the waitress to come by with water to introduce herself.  She, however, was very pleasant and friendly.  Our food was decent -- I did enjoy the milkshake quite a bit.  

It's not really the food to blame here -- its the poor service."}
{"text":"I just became vegan and Tommy's offers amazing options! Tommy's offers delicious vegan milkshakes, vegan cookies, and a plethora of other vegan entrees including (but certainly not limited to) felafel's and veggie burgers! I highly recommend Tommy's to vegans and non vegans alike!"}
{"text":"I go here for the peanut butter milkshakes. SO yummy. I've eaten there a few times and the food hasn't been very memorable (just A-OK) but the milkshake get its own star. Stop by the next time you're in the area and try it out!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of a vegetarian restaurant, and the prices are reasonable. But every time I eat here I just don't feel right afterward. Although the food was delicious, afterward I just feel sick."}
{"text":"Two stars for having vegan food.  

My husband (not vegan) had salad (iceberg and carrots, bland homemade dressing...homemade!) and pizza (I swear it looked frozen and tasted it too). I had AJ's wrap, sounded wonderful!  Drool worthy, somehow they made it boring?  Not sure how they managed it, but  it was so dull I actually resorted to salting it!  Vegan but why bother!  My son got a veggie burger, it looked and tasted good, but come on veggie burgers are not hard to find anymore.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely good portions at a good price. I had the Schezuan Shrimp lunch special with fried rice and Hoy & Sour Soup. 

For the price, there was a healthy portion of large shrimp, cooked perfectly. The heat level was also just about right. 

Flavours are a bit weak, especially the soup which had almost no flavour to the broth. Still, for under $10 Tommy's is certainly \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. I'm not a vegetarian and traditionally I'm not a fan of such restaurants as the vibe can be a bit off. But Tommy's defies all with their fantastic atmosphere and even more extensive menu options from the uber healthy to the tantalizingly wicked desserts. I'm so so happy that they have continued to expand over the years and I hope for decades of dining here."}
{"text":"Food is as good as it has ever been. This is my go to spot in the Cleveland Heights area. Pretty sure the menu has never changed (except the prices).

Falafel balls were hot, crisp, and the noms! The Benjamin Lee was a bit messy, but so worth it as it was delicious. The house made lemonade is excellent.

Service was phenomenal, as it always is."}
{"text":"I crave this food - but specifically the Dale Salad (falafel) with extra carrots.  I'm not sure what they do to make these carrots so sweet, but they are the BEST.  

Oh, can I go now? And of course, get a milkshake for dessert ... or appetizer ... or entree ... or snack ... or just cause!"}
{"text":"Tommy's has some of the best food--vegetarian or non--in the Cleveland area! It's a great place to go with a mixed crowd of meat eaters and herbivores.

My favorite is the BBQ Seitan Sandwich! It's enough to make me scoff at the last food I missed as a vegetarian (pulled pork). The bun is perfectly crispy, and the sandwich oozes with veg protein and barbecue sauce.

The fries are amazing--get some to share, because the plate is huge! You'll hardly notice that they're unsalted, but that's easily enough changed with a shaker.  All the salads are huge, amazing, and customizable! Everyone can find one they like with THAT menu.

Don't forget to try a shake! The moosetracks is full of amazing little treats, and I love to dip my fries in it.

The service is almost always great, and the atmosphere is different, but very relaxed! It's fun to walk over to the adjacent bookstore with a shake at the end of the meal :)

Tommy's is always a favorite--I take all of my friends from out of town here! I know I'll be coming back here forever!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan but I love this place! Cool atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Lots of seating. Delicious food, and not all veg or vegan, they do serve dishes with meat. They make the best French onion soup I've ever had. I could eat it every day, so yummy!"}
{"text":"oh dear. where to begin...

over fried falafel. all crunch, little flavor.
spinach pie was doughy and limp and had like no spinach or any real discernible taste.
lemon gf cookie was truly inedible. sent it back...
peanut butter vegan cookie had a good texture but was tasteless, and just surprisingly terrible. TERRIBLE. i'm not the kinda girl who throws away a cookie. trust me.
coffee was insipid

there was baba and homos (as they are fond of spelling it) that were ok at best...

no thank you."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the menu has something for everyone. I cannot wait to take my family here the next time they're in town. If you don't order a milkshake, you're making a mistake."}
{"text":"Didn't order much in the way of variety but I wasn't feeling it. The fries were good, but the cheeseburger tasted weird. Weird as in, it was a totally plain burger that was well done and boring. Milkshakes are really expensive and they're fine but not $5+ good. They're big, maybe that's why they cost so much. And it's in Coventry. I don't know, I guess I was underwhelmed by the whole experience. Staff was great though!"}
{"text":"This is a really great place for vegetarians, vegans, or people with other special diets and ordering here for them is stress-free because of the offerings on the menu.

It's the kind of place where you can get soy-a-melt, tempeh, or sunflower seeds in your tuna sandwich. Tastily creative and healthier than a burger or some other sandwiches.

This food is ordinary, average, not bad, A-OK as Yelp puts it.  They have funny names for their falafels, spinach pies...etc.  Try ordering 1 \"aunt rose\" or \"uncle gay\" with a straight face. They also serve milkshakes, which is a good thing.

...Oh, and their to-go cups are nice to keep and to use again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is the amazing highly recommended. Great hang over food along with the best jerk chicken in the plaza.

Customer service: 5/5"}
{"text":"I've been here to eat before, but it's been a while, so all I'll say about the food is that it is decent.  Definitely a spot for the healthy eating crowd.

I just stopped in for a milkshake.  Their reputation in this regard is well-deserved.  Was able to order and receive my excellent milkshake in about 4-5 minutes."}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times, and I have always been disappointed with the food and the service.  I think they thrive on the fact that people who live in the neighborhood, don't like to leave the area.

It is also very annoying that you cannot order a side of fries, you can only order a big platter of them, enough for 4 people.  When most of their menu is sandwiches, you'd think you'd be able to get a side of French fries without having to feed your table and the table next to you.  I find the pita bread for a lot of their sandwiches to usually be kind of stale.

As people mentioned, the entrance is tiny, and if just a few people are waiting for tables, you can't even come and go without a hassle."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a real treat for us when we are in the area.  We live in Cuyahoga Falls, but when in the area, we always stop in at Tommy's.  I always get the CeeBee and have never been disappointed.  I recently broke down and had one of their yummy milkshakes.  I highly recommend both!

The last time we where there, my boyfriend did not like what he ordered. The waitress kindly let him swap it out for a CeeBee. My daughter is a vegan and opted to try something new.  She was bummed that she, too, didn't stick with the CeeBee.  

We took my daughters friend there, who hasn't been exposed to a varierty of food.  He liked his food and was grateful to try something new."}
{"text":"Service is ok but portions very. Especially when it comes to the fries. I will say I love the hummus."}
{"text":"This place has been a regular destination for us in Cleveland for over a decade now, and it continues to be a restaurant we recommend without hesitation.  A huge vegetarian, vegan, and specialty menu, decidedly friendly to those with specific culinary needs (i.e. no gluten, etc.), which succeeds in not isolating those folks who experience the onset of panic when \"vegetarian\" is mentioned.  Yes, meat does exist here, and yes, I'm sure it's tastily cooked and presented as well.

We pretty much only ever get the same meal when we come here, which is ridiculous due to the massive selection available.  The \"Ceebee\" is freaking delicious, however, and I drool when thinking about it: pita stuffed with falafel, hummus, bean sprouts, cheese, and some other wonderful things, all heated together.  I'm glad that there's only two portions included in the meal, as I could probably gorge myself sick on this stuff.

I'm a big fan of Tommy's hummus, as well, which one can purchase as its own plate in either the normal or \"spiked\" variety (which features everything from BBQ sauce to the moon, apparently).  I tend to get the normal hummus plate, sometimes with cheese, to split with friends, and we're rarely disappointed.  When I ate there recently, however, the hummus wasn't as up to par as it normally is - I suppose everyone has their off days.

Snag a booth to eat in if you can, as it enhances the overall aesthetic of the place - wood polished by the feet and rears of thousands, random plants everywhere, easy access to the bookstore next door, show and concert posters crammed onto the wall in the entry foyer.  Generally, Tommy's is clean, well-lit, small group/family-friendly, and satisfying to the stomach.  The servers are hit or miss, as the place tends to employ its share of hipster kids, who can either be friendly or awkwardly removed from normal social niceties.  We've rarely had an issue with that, however.

Recommended."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here for breakfast a few days ago. Super cute place with a very homey feel. 

I have to be honest, I didn't even look at their lunch/dinner menu, since I was so hungry for breakfast, so Im not gonna say anything about that. 

The breakfast menu was solid. Some sandwich options, some omelets, and a 'pancakes and more' category. 

BF and I each got an omelet. He got 'The Fitz', which is \"4oz corned beef and cheese\". And I got a 'John Z', which is \"Falafel, ham, cheese, onions, mushrooms, green peppers and tomatoes\". 

We both agreed that they were filling options that didnt weigh us down. I found mine to be very tasty, and the BF enjoyed his as well. 

I will definitely come back here to try their lunch/dinner options at another time."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy but we were seated within 5 minutes. We were greeted and had drinks within another 5 minutes. I had the BLT- it came with a  PILE of bacon  on it. Fries were delicious, black cherry milkshake was good but not all it was cracked up to be. We sat at one of the tables in the front along the wall. In my opinion, they're too close together. I felt like people sitting on either side of me could easily hear my conversation and I kind of felt uncomfortable. All in all it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I decided to check this place out. I usually get the General Tao (which is delicious btw), but decided to venture off with their BBQ chicken leg and vegetables. The chicken was BLESSED. It's basically a part of the chicken leg deep fried and they put it on top of veggies?!?!?! Geeez, so good. My co-workers tried some of my chicken and had to go and order some more. The food can be a bit salty though, but still a great place for Chinese Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwich. Tasted OK. Left full (tummy and wallet)."}
{"text":"It's hard to come up with anything to say that hasn't already been said. I love Tommy's. 

I've been eating there for the past 25 years of my life. My grandparents used to take me when I was little, after the Childrens' Museum, my friends and I used to get dropped off on Coventry and eat there when we were in middle school, and as I got older, Tommy's has remained a fixture in my image of home.

I haven't ever had anything that wasn't delicious. The fries are especially amazing splashed with malt vinegar. I love their falafel and their babaganoush is unreal, so the N.S.(falafel, veggies, baba and sesame sauce) is my go-to order. If you're feeling like splurging, the milkshakes are a whole lot of wonderful."}
{"text":"I can remember people liking this place back in the day when I'd visit the Coventry area. I remember my cousin recommending the milkshakes and I think they also might've had delivery service. That's about all I remember, but we were in the area and didn't know where else to go, so we went to Tommy's. 

We walked in and no one greeted us. Yes, we could read the pole, but you just got the feeling that we'd end up in a situation where we are sitting there, waiting for 15 minutes just to be sat (during off hours). Server/host tried to seat us in his section, but the place wasn't busy and I really just don't like having my table two feet away from other customers (plus, I talk loudly - hearing loss - and it's just better for everyone). This seemed to annoy him and I told him that I was sorry and thanked him, to which he didn't respond. 

Our new waiter seemed to be judging us and I don't know if he's just always a hipster douche...or if he didn't like the way we were dressed (conventionalish clothing/post-Browns game stuff)...or that we asked for non-veg recommendations...or because I didn't like his recommendation...or because we took a while to order (menu is waaaaay too big). I actually don't care why, but seeing his unfriendly face made for an unpleasant meal. Unlike what most people say on here, food actually came out quickly. He was not a bad server and refilled beverages. 

Milkshake was pretty good, but no whipped cream. This place might be cool for veggie people, but, to me, the food was bland and seemed \"off.\" Also, our server didn't tell us how humongous the side of fries portion is and we totally could've split one side (and still had a lot left over). Sorry, tuna doesn't work well on pita. My gf's pizza tasted like cafeteria pizza from middle school. My fries were okay, at best, but also included several burnt fries mixed in. I barely ate a thing and our server could not have  cared less. He didn't ask if anything was wrong. Oh well. 

This place/area feels a little smug/pretentious/overpriced and, as much as I have great memories of visiting the Shaker Heights area, I was reminded of that feeling when I ate here. Will never come back and will try to find something better for this region before I go back next time. Any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Vegetarians love this place. Lots of choices for the all versions of vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike. Ultra thick milkshakes.  Yuuuge plates of handout French fries. Lots and lots of tea to drink.  Eclectic wait staff, eclectic food, eclectic people watching on Coventry.  I've been coming here for over 30 years and still love the casual ambiance and earthy hippie food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tommy's for decades, and although the food is almost always excellent, the service is completely hit or miss.  Unacceptably long waits for simple food, like salad and soup, really detract from the great food.  The servers and kitchen really need to get it together."}
{"text":"It's Tommys it's bad ass great food for 30 years.  Great meat pie great service great milkshakes.  This is a Cleveland institution.  If you don't care for it just leave.  Same recipes all these years despite fires and problems.  The owner is amazing as is all his food."}
{"text":"Been going to Tommy's occasionally (usually just for milkshakes and sometimes a salad/sandwich) for a few years now. After today's experience, I will not be going back.

Got there around 11:30 this morning (a Saturday, although it was not busy at all until about 45 minutes after we arrived). Got seated right away and ordered less than 5 minutes later. Proceeded to wait about 25 minutes just for milkshakes and another half hour after that for 2 turkey burgers that came out charred to a crisp on the bottom (presumably, they had been cooking the entire hour we had been waiting for our food). 

We also asked for fries that never came but were also not listed on the bill, so I guess I'll let that one slide. Why didn't we ask our waitress for them? Because she only came around to comment that our milkshakes should be right out after 25 minutes of waiting then dropped the food off and booked it, probably knowing how bad she had screwed up our lunch. No apology, no nothing.

There were other tables that sat down nearly 20 minutes after we arrived and were finished with their meals before ours even arrived, so I don't understand what could have possibly been taking our order so long. Food is okay overall although terribly overpriced ($9 for a blackened turkey burger with no side? No thanks.), but the service is just awful and enough to make me never return, even for those delicious milkshakes. I'll trek it out to Gordon Square for some Sweet Moses next time I want to satisfy my sweet tooth - even better shakes and MUCH better service.

The two stars are overly generous, just like the fact that we even bothered to pay the bill for this terrible experience."}
{"text":"legendary. such a wide variety of food on the menu, especially great vegetarian and vegan options. personal favorite is the veggie burger. milkshakes are great too! environment is hip and a warm atmosphere. it does get crowded and sometimes there can be a long wait, but that's because everyone loves it! what i love most is that every time I go I see Tommy, the restaurant owner for over 30 years, in the kitchen area cooking and serving meals for customers."}
{"text":"Some restaurants have great food and some restaurants have great service and some have both. Tommy's is simply breathtaking and their shakes AR great for carryout - even if you're hundreds of miles away."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review

After our first night in Cleveland I set out to find the best or any gluten-free restaurant and came across Tommy's by locating it on YELP. Who would have thought Cleveland has an entire hippy district with nothing but hipsters, gluten free, vegans, toy stores and what not. Totally reminds me of Austin, Texas type atmosphere so felt pretty much at home, the only problem with Tommy's is signage.. we drive by three times looking for Tommy's thinking it was out of business but finally found people walking into a building with no sign. 

We were quickly seated, and given gluten free menus by our totally vegan waitress with that natural energy of a snail. However for appetizers we got like a toasted cheese sandwich which was the best thing I've ever eaten gluten-free, like BAM. Also got a gluten-free french onion soup which is probably the BEST french onion soup I've ever had as well, like damn Tommy's is doing it right in Cleveland.. I could get use to this. 

We ordered to much food and I forgot what I got for main course but was a sandwich with bacon, cheese, turkey, and something else and called something famous, I'll try to find it. Also got a side of french fries which were toasted so darn good. Tommy's is a hypo-allergic friendly LEGIT gluten-free/vegan restaurant and I'd advise anyone to try this place it's friendly homey atmosphere is epic. 

Thank you Tommy's for providing us allergy sufferers with a legit place to eat and feel safe."}
{"text":"When I think of Coventry in the 70's, I think of hippies and coffee shops. While those are gone, Tommy's remains. Yes it is a throwback to an earlier time, but not in a bad way at all. It is still a cool place to go and eat and people watch. My favorite is to go there for breakfast. In my opinion, that is the best part of the menu, especially if you are not a vegetarian. My only complaint is that they don't start serving until 9 AM, except on Saturdays. I am a morning person, but I guess most of their customers are not. My favorite is eat, people watch and absorb the 70's music. I have never enjoyed going there for dinner. The remainder of the menu items seem more like lunch than dinner. I am not a vegetarian, but I enjoy the freshness of most items. Their smoothies and shakes are also worth ordering. Service has always been very friendly and attentive. It is hard to live up to the reputation of being an icon, but Tommy's does that. It is not the place to go for a traditional steak dinner, but still worth a trip."}
{"text":"I visited again and the burger was not as good. It seemed like there was no seasoning like salt or something on the burger at all and it needed it. Also I didn't get lettuce and tomato with my burger unless I was mistakenly ordered a different type. The fries were good and hefty but the server definitely could have been more attentive. The burgers used to be so good, what happened?"}
{"text":"Somehow, people in Cleveland absolutely love Tommy's. I've been here about 4-6 times already and I still can't say that I've ever crave it.

I usually get their RLT (Roast beef, lettuce, tomato), but today i also got their broccooli risso soup. 

1. the brocoli risso soup was a reallyyy small cup, and they charged me $6.50!!! the rice was undercooked and there wasn't much flavor in the soup.
2. my usual RLT, they never add enough sauce so the roast beef doesn't have enough flavor to it. 

I think this place is worth the try because everyone seems to love the place, maybe next time I'll try a different entree."}
{"text":"I love the counter culture feel of Tommy's. The ambience is great and I love the fact that its connected to a local bookstore. As for the food, it's just \"A-OK.\" Nothing terrible, but nothing amazing. The middle eastern dishes are good, but I would much rather go to MoMo's. Kind of pricey considering the portion sizes and while I appreciate the need to eat healthy it would be nice to have a side of french fries with my Reuben. The long and short of it is: I've had better, but I've also had much worse. I would certainly recommend Tommy's  for the atmosphere (not so much the food). With so much amazing fare in Cleveland, Tommy's definitely wouldn't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place solely for how awesome they developed it - a restaurant and a library connected.

Their menu is extensive - almost too much!
And as one might have guessed - because of their extensive menu (literally one slight difference in each type), the taste gets missed. 
I did not enjoy my pita sandwich at all.

Wish they would limit and cut down on some menu; for their good and for customers as well!
We were too overwhelmed by them all!"}
{"text":"Blech. My pita was horrible. The refried bean to vegetable ratio was like 90:10 and disgusting. I thought vegetable meant field greens, or maybe a salad mix, but they meant a couple of diced green peppers and onions. 

The service was horrible for a weekday lunch. I had to ASK for a straw. Ricidulous. 4 drinks and 1 straw?! Worst. server. ever. The table next to us had to ask for water.

The cherry milkshake that I tried was decent. The plain grilled cheese and pizza slices were fine as well."}
{"text":"Like Kevin, I also had my first seductive taste of hummus at Tommy's. Mythical and much loved  spot in Cleveland Heights -all the Ohio kids I know having nothing but intense love for this place."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was little. They have the best milkshakes - I always get a chocolate one and they can't be beat. The salads are really good, and all the ingredients are very fresh. My parents always get the Lauren salad which is apparently delicious. I also like the pizza and many of the sandwiches. (A favorite is the toasted cheese with veggies, forget the name.) I've had pretty good experiences with the service. This is a very casual place so I guess I don't expect too much. Tommy's is truly unique and I love it."}
{"text":"Tommy's is pretty wonderful. Fantastic milk shakes, fries, spinach pies and salads. I love that they have a vegetarian french onion soup as well. And it's delicious. The prices are reasonable as well, especially given the serving sizes. 

It's great that they have soy free vegan cheese too. Not many places accommodate vegans with soy allergies. 

My only complaint is that sometimes the service can be seriously lacking. While I've always had friendly servers, the person who seats people has almost always been extremely rude. There's a man there who may even be the owner who's extremely abrasive. I find it obnoxious that when I walk into a restaurant to spend money that I'm yelled at and ordered around. It's very odd. But it's still definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm Vegetarian and Tommy's is a gift to Cleveland, always has been.
A staple to the food scene, this hip and healthy restaurant makes everything from fresh juices, milkshakes (that you may not finish it's so huge), to veggie burgers, hot dogs, wraps to fries. If you like hearty vegetarian food that doesn't leave you wanting something else, this is the place. 
With meat also available Tommy's will please even the toughest critic.

One tip, when you walk in, if there is a wait make sure YOU add your name the waiting list, there isn't really a host or hostess."}
{"text":"It's just a Diner with vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free items. I ordered the Baba and it was good. The Greek salad was meh. Iceberg lettuce, a Tofu-Feta that really didn't mimic a feta taste. I tried the banana bread it wasn't to my liking... the coffee was very much like what you'd get at a regular diner. I think I'm good with crossing this one off the list."}
{"text":"I love Tommy's.  Granted I have this problem where I order the same thing everytime I get there so I can't really give it a solid review.  The M.R. is a delicious spinach pie with mushrooms, falafel and cheese.  I immediately take out the hot sauce, drench it on and eat a piece of heaven.  The spinach has a strong acidic taste which brings it out above the other ingredients.  I also love the falafel by itself, or in a wrap.  However, my friend ordered the boiled tamales and I found them to be a bit boring.  
The four stars is for the price.  While the 7-8 bucks for the spinach pie isn't bad, I calculated how much my milkshake was costing and immediately stopped ordering it.  It came out to almost 8 bucks.  Granted it's delicious but come on.  It's a milkshake.  Yogurt with banana and peanut butter.  Goodness, I'm a grad student.  That's almost all of my grocery budget.  So for that alone I cannot give them a five star rating.  Even 5-6 bucks is expensive.  Also, sometimes the service can be spotty.  I've waited several minutes for a server or have had to flag down the server when I've been consistently ignored.  Other than that, I'll go and eat my spinach pie and when I start raking in the big bucks, I'll come back for the shakes."}
{"text":"Coventry (Cleveland Heights) neighborhood institution! Super eclectic menu with great Mediterranean options and traditional classics like their burgers, fresh cut fries, and handmade milkshakes.  It is a chill environment with friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"A fun, funky restaurant with an eclectic menu, Tommy's seems to hit a nice balance -- there's an emphasis on the sorts of food preferences that can easily be annoyingly fanatical, but Tommy's never stumbles into that quagmire.  Instead, they serve interesting, tasty food in a welcoming atmosphere that just happens to highlight the various food philosophies they service -- thankfully, without losing sight of the actual food."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local at big fun next-door...it was great with all types of fare! Cape Town spinach pie for me grilled cheese for the little girl. Get a milkshake too :)"}
{"text":"First off have to say I really love Coventry.  The location for Tommys adds to its appeal.  This is a perfect place to take the kids or just hang w some friends . Menu is huge with a great selection of non meat items . However their burgers are great .I really enjoy having the choice of having a amazing turkey or veggie burger also. Now I can't finish with out saying hands down the best milk shake ever. Oh and don't worry if u don't do milk they still have shakes for you !! Tommys hats off for opening upstairs for us tonight so we didn't have a long wait for the 6 of us. Great staff and service ."}
{"text":"What's all the ruckus about this place? I live down the street and have gone 5 times, always looking for a reason to love it. Staff is  friendly but the food is just, blah? It feels very basic and assembled, rather than anything special. It's also expensive for the type of food. You can get fresher feeling burritos, for example, for $3 less up the street at Chipotle.

I waited 15 minutes for my appetizer to arrive on my most recent trip and ate another bland meal, writing tommy's off for good. Sorry Coventry die-hards, I tried!"}
{"text":"Last time I ate here everything was just bland..... very very bland. Breakfast potato thingies were barely cooked - not crispy at all. Sad."}
{"text":"I'm in love with a lady named Coleen! Your malts are incredible. Doesn't matter what kind of mood I'm in, I can always eat a Colleen! A+++
We've been going to Tommy for about 15 years and I've always had the same love for this place and big fun. It's almost a tradition of sorts. My family came in from VT and they're very picky eaters. They all ordered something different and finished their meals with no complaints. To me that's winning. Lol! We got some malts to go and all of the kids were happy. Your staff is amazing and extremely friendly. Very helpful too! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I find myself going back to Tommy's time and time again because the food is so great! I love to take friends from out-of-town here to show them a great and inexpensive establishment. The menu is very long, so it usually takes me several minutes of reading and narrowing down to figure out what I want to eat! I have honestly never had anything that I haven't liked here. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer of the meat-free options here, like the Tofu salad sandwich (which tastes incredibly like an egg-salad sandwich!) and the Quinn, which is a cheese and peanut butter sandwich (I know, it sounds like it shouldn't work, but it definitely does!).

When you come here, you absolutely have to try the milkshakes! They are fantastic, dare I say the best in Cleveland? You can mix more than one flavor, or add different toppings into your shake to make your perfect flavor. For example, I usually get a chocolate milkshake and add peanut butter, which is a great combo! They also have dairy free milkshakes so that vegans and people with lactose intolerance don't have to miss out on the fun!"}
{"text":"Tommy's serves great food in generous portions at a good price. I am a vegan and often dine with vegetarians as well as omnivores and Tommy's seems to have something for just about everybody. 

Why 3 stars then? The service is almost always terrible. Unless you go with a large party, expect to have a 2 1/2 hour long dining experience and be forgotten about or ignored. Refills never come, servers don't come back to check on you unless it's to drop off the bill. I ordered dessert once and it was never brought even after flagging 2 people other than the server down. The quality of the food almost makes up for this, however, and makes Tommy's a restaurant that I still enjoy eating at.

I think these problems are less the result of poor servers and more the result of an understaffed restaurant, but the experience can often be terrible if you're in a crunch for time."}
{"text":"I first found this place 13 - 17 years ago when i was in college in Cleveland, OH. We were back in that town this past week and I had an opportunity to return - several times. They had the same great toaster cheese sandwhiches, that sill tasted so great. I don't know what makes them taste great, whether it be the cheese (muenster on this one), the sesame sauce, or sesame seeds. We went back there the next day.

One note - I love Falafel and Hummus. HOWEVER, here, the sandwhiches WITHOUT Falafel and Hummus (the toasted cheese ones) are better, because they have more cheese and sauce. So this is one place where I would not order. I take that back - if it wer a \"to go\" I would order those, since the regular toasted cheese get messy and would be hard on a \"to go.\" I wish he would open a store in New Jersey, but considering he has had only one store for 20 years, in Cleveland, I doubt that will happen.This gets a a 5 star for absolutely great sandwhiches, and you know I rarely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"They recently hired a new chef and the food now is amazing. They offer complementary green tea and the servers are very pleasant. Much recommended."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews about this little restaurant, I decided to try it today.  It didn't disappoint me.  5 stars for cleanness.  5 stars for service(we were served by owner's teenage son, helping out during summer break, I guess).  The dishes that we ordered were really good with reasonable price.  See my photos with description.  

Will definitely recommend other foodie to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites in Cleveland.  Get the milkshake!  

The kids love it too.  There's something for everyone here.  Great food!"}
{"text":"This place was utterly disgusting I am traumatised by their food. Good service but the food was repulsive. I hardly touched my meal. The vegan shake was good but other than that their fries taste like store bought frozen and defrosted. I also had the a Mackenna, biggest mistake of my life. My friend ate entire meal but felt sick afterwards. My other friend didn't finish hers and wasn't satisfied. Tommy's you disappointed me."}
{"text":"The best falafel is everything in my life the JJ it was so good and I had that every afternoon live in Cleveland Ohio its right next door to the best Chinese place in Ohio.. Hunann Coventry.. Always super super busy has the best ice cream and night and has the best fries in town"}
{"text":"I probably enjoy Tommy's for all of the wrong reasons.  

My favorite meal at the place that is known for its extensive vegetarian options is a meat pie, specifically the Keith.  What do you get when you combine richly flavored lamb with two other rich flavors, falafel and baba?  You get a plate of comfort food, but with some unexpected and unique flavors (curry).  And their fries are excellent.

Unlike most Clevelanders, I don't get too excited about Tommy's milkshakes.  I've tried a couple of times, and maybe my expectations are just too great because of all the hype, but I've had better shakes from United Dairy Farmers.

I love the atmosphere, and love that there are often student musicians there providing entertainment.  I've always had good service at Tommys, too."}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian breakfast place on Coventry. They are a vegetarian establishment so you will be doing good for yourself and the animals by occasionally going vegetarian/ vegan. The lady at the counter is suuuper suuuper friendly and was nice to explain the menu to me. The first time I got the French onion soup which was traditional and delicious as well as the Elsie sandwich - a vegetarian BLT with an unexpected slab of peanut butter in the center to spice things up (so good!) For my second day in Coventry I was going for the inn on Coventry but they don't do take out fare on weekends. This brought me back to Tommy's. I ordered the tofu scramble per another customer's suggestion and French toast. Will post more updates later on!"}
{"text":"The wait to get in can be maddening, but it is so worth the wait. The food is delicious  and the shakes are divine!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! A little twist to Chinese. Ordered the chili beef (great) , sweet and sour chicken (with real pineapples amazing) , fried chicken wontons (good) and short beef ribs (okay depends what you like) on the first visit! Came back and had general tao with fried rice (great), chili beef (again) and pepper chicken (not on the menu, special order was amazing! ) 
One thing I'll note ask for chili beef to be crispy ! 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Just the greatest place on the friggin planet. Get the TLT with cheese and a choco milkshake for a meal you'll never forget."}
{"text":"Great food. Super clean. Friendly staff. Quick service. Menu spans all customers-Vegan to real burgers."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland monument. Goes back a half century or more and many have called it a favorite over the years. It is good for vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores alike. What it might no longer be good at is providing value. French onion soup that is veggie friendly isn't easy to find, but is it worth $7.75 for a normal size crock? Plus, if you order a hamburger and elect for the lettuce, tomato, and onion option, it is an unadvertised additional $1.99. We were taken aback by the pricing and extra charges in this otherwise family establishmemt. It's a good place, but is it worth the trouble and expense? Maybe if you want to pay extra to feel good about supporting them. They might be legendary, but they charge too much for soup and hamburger garnish. They were packed enough and on a wait, so the public is tolerating it. We won't hurry back."}
{"text":"Tommy's has been a favorite of mine since I was in high school back in the 80's!  I've had many an amazing MR4 there!  He is the sweetest guy!"}
{"text":"Went to tommys tonight and ordered a vegan milkshake I get that that's douchie but the girl that brought it to my table set a chocolate milk and and chocolate vegan and we asked which one was vegan and the girl said I don't know and walked away so now I'm playing Russian roulette with a milkshake worried about having awful squirts tomorrow morning. Something must be done."}
{"text":"Tommy's dates from back in the early 1970s, when Coventry was a proper hippie enclave. Today, they're still known for their milkshakes and extensive vegetarian offerings, but the menu has been expanded to have more or less something for everyone, carnivores included.

As everyone else has said, the milkshakes are the real stand-out here. There are a ton of different options, all customisable, and I've yet to try one that I didn't like. The food choices are extensive: you'll be presented with a selection that looks more like an encyclopaedia than a menu. I'm a big fan of the Donovan and Wildflower falalfels, and the black bean chili is also a must-try. Everything is very reasonably priced; there's basically nothing on the menu that's more than $10.

Service can sometimes be spotty, and there can be a long wait for a table at busy times (no reservations), but the good food and cheap prices makes this somewhat easier to bear."}
{"text":"Tommy's is the essence of Coventry Road, such a cool, cozy, friendly, hippy, veggie friendly spot with variety of interesting middle eastern and diner food options, something for everyone in this relaxed diner. Our server was great, always refilled our coffee, I feel guilty how many cups I can drink at breakfast, lol! I loved the vibe here and the art display on the walls, it appears to change often, I love a supporter of local arts. On my visit, I ordered the Spinach pie with falafel and tahini sauce, be prepared, it is huge! My husband had a tuna pie, he loved it. They have a unique large menu, Tommy's is the place for a great brunch on good old Coventry Road."}
{"text":"Do not recommend going here. I'm a veggiterrian and all they had was shitty soy burgers, nothing that anyone would want. The menu was blan and nothing caught my eye. Service was awkward. Nobody greeted us and it was painfully loud in there. I walked right out before I could order anything..don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Tommy's?! I love everything I've ever tried here. Their falafel dishes are stupendous and I'm a fan of bean sprouts in particular, so I appreciate them being in so many dishes :)  I've enjoyed the meat dishes I've eaten, but I have to say that their real specialty is vegetarian and vegan food. Plus, milkshakes. Dear lord, what delicious milkshakes. 

And you can't beat taking a walk through Coventry afterwards to work off that delicious shake you ate!"}
{"text":"Don't sleep on Tommy's.  I'm not adventurous so I can only speak for the veggie burger and fries, but they're amazing.  So many vegan and vegetarian options to choose from, great little spot and inexpensive! Love it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Quite the institution on the east side, Tommy's specializes in vegetarian/vegan dishes, yet has burgers/roast beef/corned beef for your omnivore friends. I am a full-blown meat-eater, but I always order vegetarian dishes here 1) in an attempt to try to eat healthier, and 2) in order to make a date think I eat healthier than I do. 

The brunch here on Sunday (or anytime) is great, as is pretty much anything else on the menu. Don't worry about not getting filled up -- even the falafel here is delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"I don't know why people love this place. Food is bland and every time I go, I'm reminded by how much cheaper it would be to just make it at home. Only giving it two stars because their milkshakes and root beer floats are fabulous. It would get three because its tofu milkshakes are kind of yucky."}
{"text":"This place is pretty crowded but actually accommodates more people than it looks like from the outside. I ordered root beer shake, bacon cheeseburger and fries. 
The portion of all the food is very generous. The cheese burger was well made and very big. The root beer shake was disappointing because it didn't really taste like root beer and was way too sweet. It also had a weird chocolate aftertaste. The fries was not super crispy (unless you find the tiny pieces) but still okay. Reasonable price for the portion and quality. Would come again."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Fried rice with chicken leg, $8.50
General Tao chicken, $9.95
Sweet & sour pork, $8.50.

Fried rice did not taste Caribbean nor the fried chicken!

Both s/sour and general Tao chicken were made with fat pieces covered with thin batter.

Waste of money."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by Tommy's, but that might simply be due to the fact that the restaurant was completely hyped up by a friend.  They were described as having the \"best\" milkshakes around and I would strongly beg to differ.  The milkshakes taste like a slightly better than those from McDonalds.  Other places in Cleveland offer better, more ice cream-esque shakes.  I also ordered one of their falafel pitas.  Falafel is usually a hit or miss for me and, unfortunately, theirs was a total miss.

I'm hoping that Tommy's is better than my first impression -- I'd have to come back to decide, but I'm not altogether sure I'd be willing..."}
{"text":"Before everyone was a worldly eater with self-imposed dietary restrictions this place and Johnny Mangos were the only places to get healthy and somewhat lesser-know flavors.  Now even the grocery stores carry such things.  Not so special anymore.  Service can be genuinely nice to downright awful...depends on who ya get.  The girls at the shake counter are always miserable.  Guess the scoopers elbow from getting ice cream is really a drag.  Food is all priced well but 6.00 for a take-away banana shake if nuts.  Its that good, but I better get some love me long time for those prices..."}
{"text":"Tommy's is perhaps one of the best healthy or vegetarian/vegan restaurants in the Cleveland area.  I've always received great service and being a blind person, they know how to be quite helpful in getting me to my table and are knowledgeable in blind person's table placement; that is the clock method.  They have a wide array of hummus and filaffel platters.  Plus tons of filled sandwiches and salads.  They also have an old fashioned soda fountain with malts, egg creams and milkshakes.  Don't get the fries though, they're unsalted.  Overall, a great location in Cleveland Heights!!"}
{"text":"The cutest interior.  A lovely staff.  And a major must if ever back in the Cleveland area.

The items had:
-French Fries.  Soaked with salt, malt vinegar, and ketchup.  YES.
-Shake.  Moosetracks.  YES.  YES
-Delaney: tempeh, swiss, sauerkraut, thousand island, spinach, rye bread.
-Veggie Burger: homemade patty!, wheat bun, loads of onion, tomato, lettuce, brown mustard.
-Greek Salad.  Tofu feta.  Super fresh.  

But the stars of the show were the pickles.  AMAZING homemade pickles.  I could eat a bucket of them."}
{"text":"Tommy's is one of my favorite places in Cleveland because of their variety of vegan options. Their tempeh salad sandwich and tempeh Reuben and melted cheese in a pita with veggies can all be made vegan (among tons of other menu items) and they are fabulous. I just had their tofutti milkshake for the first time and the waitress was right- it tasted like cake batter. My boyfriend ordered a regular shake and he said that my non-dairy shake actually tasted better. My brother eats meat at every chance he gets and he even ordered the falafel here. This is one of those places where you know you should try more menu items but you want to order your favorites every time you go."}
{"text":"A Coventry landmark for many years, Tommy's has a large selection of vegetarian (and non-veg) menu items.  I recommend the milkshakes most of all.

Seating always seems to be a wait (10-20 minutes usually), but there are a couple of benches if handicap accessibility is an issue.  The restaurant and restrooms are consistently clean.

Tommy's is always very noisy, so this is not the place for a quiet conversation."}
{"text":"First timer, and had a iffy experience. I enjoyed my tofu sandwich and my fresh soy milk, but towards the end of the experience it was annoying. THEY DO NOT TAKE DISCOVERY. We spend about an hour or two, going back and forth with the server about the card issue. If only we were warned or given a small reminder in the beginning, we would of been prepared or reconsidered other options. Our card seemly worked previously at other stores, and grocery market yet we were confused on why it wasn't working for such a small restaurant. 

 Servers could be less annoying, and give more space to the guest to enjoy the meal, every 10 minutes to check would've been fine. 

Better situation management would be better."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend who lives just off of Coventry and she suggested we go to Tommy's. We were greeted when we walked in and wrote our name down on the list. There's a sign to let you know to write your name down while you're waiting, but people who came in behind us seemed to not understand this. We were seated fairly quickly and we both ordered burgers with fries.

My burger was beautiful and so delicious! My friend and I both commented on how generous the veggies were - thick slices of tomato, for example. Fresh! The fries were probably the best I've had in a long time. My burger was cooked to perfection. At the end I ordered a mint chocolate chip shake, which was THE FREAKING BEST!

Tommy's has a lot of options for all people and I appreciate them for being so inclusive even though I have no allergies or specific requests food wise."}
{"text":"The service here is stupid slow. All the waiters look like they are in their 5th year of art school and consciously despise moving quickly and/or accomplishing things. Avoid dining in unless you want to wait an hour and a half for someone to limp over with your falafel sandwich. The food is good though, so I wouldn't write the place off completely -- just stick to take out."}
{"text":"A year ago, when I'd been a vegetarian for my 32 years on this planet, I would have given Tommy's a better review. But now that I'm a vegan? Meh.

Yes, there are plenty of vegetarian options here. Like milk shakes, fries, and greasy veggie burgers. Food you could find at any vegetarian friendly restaurant's menu. Sure, there are some other unique items like spinach pies, falafel, and tempeh sandwiches, but I'd really categorize Tommy's as diner food versus vegetarian food.

I recently went to Tommy's and was disappointed to see how few truly vegan options there were. Yes, things could be veganized, but...you can veganize sandwiches and salads just about anywhere. 

I am thankful for the memories I have at Tommy's. As a vegetarian kid in the 80's, there weren't many places I could go to eat. But now?  I really feel like there are better options elsewhere. 

Sorry, Tommy's. You used to be my go to place but now you're just a place I won't be going to."}
{"text":"Heard about Tommy's years ago from Rachel Ray's $40 A Day and it does not disappoint. All of the food is fresh and provides a breath of fresh air in the often corporate world that is typical Ohio dining. Yes, you'll be served by Coventry's own brand of hipster and they might not always be super friendly, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The description for this restaurant says vegetarian, American (traditional), Vegan.  I don't know about you, but never in my life did I think I would see American (Traditional) and Vegan placed side by side with such little incidence. And while they do serve burgers with fries, Tommy's is about as far from traditional as you can get and still keep the title. When I first sat down at the bar (I was by myself which is lucky because I was able to just walk in and sit down. If I had been trying to seat 3 or more I'd have to sign in and wait, and the wait is pretty long due to the high demand for a seat at a table or booth) I was accidentally handed the gluten free menu. This menu was so extensive I didn't even realize it was a menu separate from the non-GF menu. Since I'm not GF this small mistake was promptly rectified by one of the incredibly chipper, helpful staff members working behind the bar. After perusing the standard menu it was clear that in spite of the fact that they are incredibly responsive to the dietary sensitivities of their patrons, it does not hinder the diversity of their menu. They have so much food. This was actually my second time visiting this establishment, but last time I went safe and got a burger. I was intrigued by the fact that they had falafel on the menu too so for the sake of being through I got those too. Both were wonderful and highly advised.  This time I decided to be a bit more bold in my ordering choice and got a meat pie. A meat pie contains lamb and beef and is in a deep fried dough. They're are a number of combinations of additional fillings, I got the Keith. I highly recommend it, so much so that when another costumer took the stool beside me, and asked what I had, I recommended it to her, she got it, and also enjoyed it. I also got a shake which is ostensibly the \"best shake in Ohio\" according to the same helpful server behind the counter. They make their peanut butter homemade so I had a chocolate malt with peanut butter. I was skeptical about the flavor combo though so the super helpful staff member named Leemah helped me out with a trial run before I got the full thing. It was amazing. Probably the best malted shake in Ohio. When it was all said and done I was grateful to have to have experienced the awesomeness that is Tommy's again, and will certainly be back. Leemah and the rest of the staff are accommodating with a smile, and made the already great meal even better. Thanks and see y'all next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I can't sleep and I'm writing this review at 2:45 in the morning and my stomach is growling just thinking about how awesome Tommy's  food is.  The falafel and the chili are my two favorite things on the menu.  I always order a vegan chocolate shake made with soy milk and almost always order fries.  The fries are made they way the should be, cut fresh.  Something has to be said about the service, IT IS AWESOME, in all the years I've been going here I've never experienced any service that was nothing short of stellar."}
{"text":"This review is for the brunch.

So I'm actually very surprised that I haven't reviewed this place yet.  My girlfriend and I are regulars here for brunch - it's our favorite of the places in the Cleveland Heights area.  They give nice, big portions, and it's very cheap.  I always get the rachael ray omelet (so named because, of course, it's what rachael ray had here) and a side of hash browns.  My girlfriend always gets either the beetle omelet or some waffles with fresh strawberries.  We love both the omelets and the waffles.  The hash browns could use a little salt.

We've also been here for dinner once and it was okay, but seriously, come here for breakfast.  If you arrive before 11 you can avoid the rush on Sunday."}
{"text":"When the vegans in your life just can't find anything to eat, it's off to Tommy's. The falafel is great--in wraps or in omelettes. The tempeh sandwich is good, and the more carnivorous fare is great.  

The service is pretty weak, though. It usually takes the servers too long to get around to your table, and getting a refill on your coffee is a challenge. Tommy's also has a clown that comes in on some evenings as entertainment for the kids, but it just makes dining a little weird and uncomfortable. Balloon animals and baba ganoush do not mix well."}
{"text":"Best Shakes and Fries hands down.  My familiy goes regularly to nosh on these two things.  :-)"}
{"text":"The best. Addictive. Proven by repeated international flights to Coventry for a fix. you are warned!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, meh on this place.  I was told this was the place to go for vegetarian and was excited to see that most of their menu was veggie options, but that being said their menu is too overwhelming.  I know that it's going for that deli menu thing where they have all these sandwiches named after people, but seriously I read that entire menu and it took me forever.  I mean seriously, there is a falafel sandwich done 20 different ways when it seems simpler to me to just say falafel and what toppings you can put on it.  

I got the Mediterranean plate and i dug the baba (so good) and the homos (i really don't understand why they spell it that way), but the falafel wasn't really good and the grape leaves were just ok.

My dude got the milkshake which he said was amazing (i'm not eating dairy right now) and the veggie burger.  I really dug the veggie burger, very tasty.

I saw some people with salads and they looked kind of pathetic for a healthy veggie place.  I mean how could a majority of your salad be made with iceberg and it be a healthy place.  This place is cool if you are veggie and you want deli type food, but there are definitely better places out there."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at 12:20 there was already a waiting list. We were seated after 20min. But value waiting! Very good falafel sandwich and tasty milkshake with real ice cream! 
Don't go if you want to have beers, it's a no alcoholic restaurant."}
{"text":"At first glance, Tommy's is your typical mom + pop diner--bright colors, local artwork, plates passing by piled high with hand cut fries--it quickly distinguishes itself, however, by providing a vast array of vegetarian-friendly options. Tommy's is a local institution, grandfathered onto virtually any list of 'Cleveland Best Eats' the last 20 odd years running. Indeed, the website features a laundry list of celebrity guests including: Danny DeVito, Anthrax (musicians), Alicia Keyes, and Derek Hess. You'll be in good company. While hungry patrons can snag the usual burgers or chicken, the veggie options dominate: hummus, baba, spinach pies, tofu, seitan, and tempeh are all available, and all delicious. Portions tend to be humungous. The seitan sub is a two-hand affair and then some, and a steal for $9.79. Though not uniquely spiced, and comprised of pretty rudimentary ingredients (the diversity of non-meat items notwithstanding), Tommy's food is eminently palatable.  Everything is ala carte, so expect to throw in extra for fries, though they are definitely enough to share. The milkshakes are out of this world as well--the chocolate in particular is so profoundly good it must be tasted to be believed. Well worth the $5: Vincent Vega would be proud."}
{"text":"Best falafel in the city (it anywhere else for that matter!). I've yet to have a bad experience at Tommy's and have been going for over 10 years. Don't skip the basket of fries. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love the DC and fries.  It is absolutely the best comfort food this side of the Cuyahoga River."}
{"text":"I live in LA now, and the one and only thing I miss about living in Ohio, is TOMMY'S. I grew up eating the food here, and it's been a family institution ever since. My mom used to come here for lunch everyday when she was in college! We don't visit Ohio without eating at Tommy's.

The rest of our family may not be as passionate about this place as we are, but my mouth is watering just thinking about this restaurant. My favourite thing about Tommy's is that they are still recognizeable. They have not changed much since I was a toddler, and they still carry the same open and friendly vibe with the same amazing food!

Their falaffel is top notch, Their salads are big like I like it (Only complaint is the ice berg lettuce), they are the sole reason I love spinach pie, and (saving best for last) YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER MILK SHAKE. 
I 100% stand by that statement. I have traveled a pretty large portion of the globe, and no one's handscooped milkshakes can come near to the one's at Tommy's. You don't know what you're missing if you never order one!

with that being said, the only downside to Tommy's are as follow:
They should ditch the ice berg, and use real lettuce.
They get obnoxiously crowded sometimes.
They pack a lot of flavor into their food, which may be a little much for some guests.
I gain 5 pounds just by staying in the general vicinity of this place...!"}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians--there are TONS of options here (kind of overwhelming, tbh). Tommy's is in an awesome location and the atmosphere is cute. It's connected to a cool bookstore, too. If you're a burgers and fries/massive salads/milkshake kind of person, this place is for you. I've been here quite a few times and while there are many things I can eat, I haven't found anything that was particularly \"amazing.\" The prices could be knocked down by a buck or so, too ($7.75 for a small portion of french onion soup? $7+ for a tofutti \"milkshake\"?) seem a little steep for Cleveland area pricing. Other menu items, like the salads or fries are massively portioned, so it really depends on what you get.

Note: non-vegan shakes are much more reasonably priced. I had them many a time before I converted to veganism and I definitely enjoyed them!

There are a lot of dishes that offer variations on falafel, hummus, and baba ghanouj. These tend to be decently good but not amazing/authentic tasting. Why not go to Aladdin's or something of the link for this sort of fare?

That all said, after trying a lot of menu items, the \"tofu salad\" is actually really good."}
{"text":"This review is solely based off of their milkshakes. I got to taste the chocolate malt, banana split, and mint chocolate chip. My eyes rolled into the back of my head for every sip I swear. I can't even really comment on the food since I haven't tried much (fries, pizza, ect.). But them milkshakes are more than enough reason to go here."}
{"text":"Love Tommy's!! A Cleveland classic! A vegetarian's paradise. The Tofutti shakes are the best!!! And the chic-free sandwich is amazing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"A gem of a place in an amazing little corner of Cleveland called coventry. This place has been here a while and if you are making a stop at any one of the cool shops on coventry you need to stop here for a snack or a meal. 

Start out right with one of the richest, smoothest milkshakes in town. Tons of options here, no one will be disappointed! Just bring someone to share with! 

Next up, I LOVE the falafel! Best thing here. I get the ceebee almost everytime! Awesome menu though, this place fits well for the vegetarian, vegan and meat eaters alike! Lots of options and even those picky kids will find something to enjoy! 

The veggie burger is one of the best in town too! 

Finally, the fries.... Ohhh the fries! Def best fries in town... Don't pass on these when you come! 

Overall, this place definitely earns their 5 stars for cleanliness, great service and one-of-a-kind food choices!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat in the neighborhood! It's the best.  The Colleen is my go-to."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Tommy's was 1980.  The food was unusual and amazing.  Recently,   I have been to Tommys several times .  Each time I ordered a different meal... All were delicious!  Guess what.... Tommy was there!  Give it a try you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good place for vegetarians.  I think this is the first restaurant I've been to where they have dishes with seitan and tempeh.  Their meat entrees and salads are good too from what I hear.  The shakes are really tasty.  I had the peach milkshake and it was smooth and creamy with chunks of peach inside.  I went one other time and had an escarole and potato pie which I didn't like because it was really bland.  Overall though, good stuff!

Dinner:
Becky pie (spinach, cheese, and tempeh)
Peach milkshake

Total with tax: $10.88"}
{"text":"Four stars for the meat pies and the milkshakes.  This place is great for lunch - the meat pies are huge, so you will definitely leave full.  One time, I ordered the meat pie and a milkshake and it was almost too much.

There is plenty of seating in the restaurant.  I most recently tried the Ralph.  As I mentioned, the meat pie was stuffed with food.  The vegetables are very fresh, there was plenty of cheese, and the cook definitely did not skimp on the meat.  I think the meat could have been marinated a little better, as there was a little bit of a gamy taste.  But otherwise, it was a great take-out lunch.

Also, if you have friends who are vegetarians - plenty of vegetarian options on the menu.  One of the best selections for vegetarian food that I've seen at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Tommy's and My Finances:
-Sally Mae lending, meet Tommy's Restaurant. You can thank Tommy's for a decent amount of my stipend loans.

Tommy's and Ethics:
- Tommy's made being a vegan for half of college possible.
- Tommy's made delicious and softened the guilt of the devolution into a vegetarian and then meat-eater.

Tommy, the Man:
- Tommy himself dug through several bags of trash to find my retainer which I had accidentally crumpled up in a napkin (yeah, gross, I know, but I was really hung over, okay?). I bet if you asked him, he would remember this. Wouldn't you? 

Tommy's: Supernatural
- Their coffee is not real. Read that however you like. 
- This was my chosen first meal (BBQ Chicken Sandwich w/fries and a peanut butter soy shake) after I spent some time in the hospital for food poisoning and hadn't eaten in days. You thought their food and shakes were good when you're NOT dehydrated and emaciated? Think again. Try the Chipotle up the street for the food poisoning part. Cleveland Clinic will take care of you after that. A cab ride from there to Tommy's is maybe $10 -- all in all (if your co-pay's good), it's a great deal."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a Cleveland tradition and a place I've been going to since I was a kid.  It still has a post-hippie, early 1970s feel that has stood the test of time.  The vegetarian/vegan options are great and the menu is full of creative names and extensive options.  Although their tends to be an emphasis on the veggie food, there are plenty of options for the meat-lover crowd.  The portions aren't huge, but you'll feel a bit healthier (and lighter) for it!

The broccoli risotto and french onion soup are great starters.  All the sandwiches are awesome too (check out the grilled cheeses!).  There's also a wide selection of desserts, milkshakes, and smoothies to choose from.

They do lack in the service area, although the waiters and waitresses are nice/helpful enough.  You may be here awhile, but the atmosphere should more than make up for it.  It's a bright place in a wonderful neighborhood.

Another plus is that it's connected to the great mom and pop bookstore, Mac's Back Books!"}
{"text":"I really like Tommy's...if they have a fault, its being held up to the expectation of their own legend.

The food does not float down upon clouds from heaven. Sick puppies do not find a home with every order. You will not lose weight after eating breakfast. Keep a level head, and you will be happy. Sure, it skews more towards the \"alt\" eating lifestyle, but that is what makes it great...and I'll eat anything. Sure, if given the option, I will almost always opt for the fake meat/veggie choice, but at the same time, I'm a complete pussy, so I don't go all the way with it. But I'll go to Tommy's and enjoy absolutely everything on the menu...and you won't find more than half of whats on it anywhere else in town, period...cheaper or not.

You can get bigger portions for less money elsewhere. You'll get more attentive service elsewhere. But if you want a true Cleveland experience, go to Tommy's...you won't find it elsewhere. I don't care if the entire staff is high...if anything, I'll be jealous. I don't care if I get merely satisfied instead of stuffed...I eat too much anyway. Its all fresh, all unique, and thats it. Oh yea...incredible milkshakes! Best around.

Be sure to go nextdoor (and you don't even have to go outside to do it) and check out the bookstore...grab a few sci-fi mags and an old novel or two and get your nerd on. If you get a slight complaint twitch, remember you won't find any place else quite like it anywhere and shut the hell up."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tommy's since I was about 17. I haven't been there in quite some time, but was there this past Friday evening. Nothing, I mean nothing about it has changed. This is a good thing, (although the restrooms could definitely use remodeling) because it filled me with nostalgia.

Our server was aloof but it was pleasant. It just appeared to be her personality type, but it worked for her. She checked up on us the right amount of time, and almost had a sad yet mysterious aura around her. (I've been reading too many mystery novels, obviously.)

Our food was classic. The dishes here definitely remind me of diner food, they just cater to vegetarians. If you don't want a healthy, macrobiotic quinoa bowl and just want some fries or nachos and a good tasting veggie burger, you won't be disappointed. We shared a huge plate of greasy fries, I had the classic grilled cheese on gluten free bread, and my friend ordered the non veggie burger. My sandwich oozed with cheese, just the way I like it. I didn't necessarily feel healthy after I ate it, but I felt satisfied, and sometimes that's all you really want."}
{"text":"Think diner but healthy. The fries and the milkshakes here are top notch. The coffee ain't bad either. I have had fantastic experiences with the seitan subs, most of the falafel sandwiches, and most of the salads as well. The place is pretty cheap too.

Yeah, like everyone else here says, the service is crappy. But the place is always bumping and you get young and good-looking (though inept) servers and staff instead of old and weathered (though adept) folk serving you your grub. A trade-off I can live with.

Coventry will be completely BoBo in 10-20 years, so get there sometime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite place in In Cleveland area. Great for anyone and everyone. Has great Vegan choices as well as all the meat and cheese for the carnivore. I wish we had a Tommy's in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian's paradise.  While they have a lot of meat items on the menu, there are a significant amount of vegetarian options available.  

Their homos is good and we always get the Spiked Homos (homos topped with veggies, bbq sauce and cheese...then broiled) for an appetizer.  

Their sandwiches are really good, all of the ingredients are fresh and the food is simply delicious.

Oh, expect to wait for a table...this place is so good there is often a short wait, especially during meal times :)"}
{"text":"Get a milkshake! They are awesome but be careful getting at the extra in the tin. It has a tendency to rush into your glass, so use a spoon.

I'm always very full after I eat here, with leftovers to boot. But maybe that is because I have a hard time not getting a milkshake...

The food is fine, but don't go here expecting top-notch, super fast service. It's a laid back atmosphere; everyone is really nice, but don't go in expecting too much from your server."}
{"text":"I always forget that I hate alfalfa sprouts...but that's my fault.  The veggie burger was great!  My friend got a salad with falafel on it and she kept raving about how yummy her french onion soup was.  It did look fantastic!  The cheese melting over the ceramic bowl was a nice beautiful touch...damn...after thinking about it, now I want French Onion soup..."}
{"text":"Best homemade milkshakes around!

I love the book nook they have there as well!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed Tommy's, as I used to grab lunch there a gazillion times when I used to work on the east side for a few years around the turn of the century.  I loved the place so much I would be remiss if I remained mum about this Cleveland institution.  The manager there must have gotten sick of me asking them \"when are you going to open a Tommy's on the west side?\".  Anyway, they used to smell me coming, as my favorite addictive items were the tasty 'Uncle Russ' and 'JJ' felafels which I often ordered there for lunch.  On many occasions, I would dine in and order one for takeout as well, for my afternoon snack or to munch on as I was driving home to the west side after work.  I must have been a sight to behold tooling down Chester Avenue, one hand on the wheel, and the other shoveling in and scarfing down a 4 hour old felafel like it was the only thing in the world that mattered!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Tommy's besides that its practically an institution. They've been around since God was a boy. If that isn't a testament to their quality and reliability then I don't know what is.

Tommy's is known as a vegetarian eatery to most of the Heights dwellers. They do in fact serve meat. But that's really beside the point.

The food at Tommy's is always a delicious melange of masterfully assembled ingredients. Hummus, falafel, sprouts, veggies, cheeses... I'm getting hungry already. Every item has a name, i.e. the Ceebee (my fav) so be prepared to a little reading. The menu is long too - lots to chose from.

If you need convincing but dont want to sit down. Take a stroll down Coventry, take in the atmosphere and when you are ready for a treat, walk in and get one of their amazing milk shakes (or yogurt shakes). Its practically a religious experience. Trust me!"}
{"text":"Had the Carribean style fried rice with chicken on top was okay. Also had the chicken wings BBQ really good. Would definitely go back thumbs up."}
{"text":"I believe the popularity of Tommy's has given staff a \"we don't care attitude. Yes it has a great menu with many veggie items but that doesn't mean you should be treated with disrespect. 

I get the delay in being seated because of popularity. I don't accept the understaffing (our server had a dozen or more tables.)This led to a long wait to take our order (after flagging her down) and her saying she was busy (our fault?). She then got orders wrong. Food came out over a 15 minute period starting 20 minutes after w placed order. When we asked our server about the delay, \"were very busy.\" No apologies. 

Our check came and had several mistakes on it. Server proceeded to explain it was OUR error. When we called her on it, she said it was loud and very busy. She never came back to take payment; we went to front to pay. 

Spoke to manager who just said, sorry. No attempt to make it right. 

We left without a tip. None was earned. 

NOT RECOMMENDED. GUESTS NOT APPRECIATED."}
{"text":"I'm surprised people are so in love with this place. Went for a business lunch today (not my choice), and ordered the Caitlin salad. It was mostly sunflower seeds (isn't that just supposed to add flavor, not be the majority of the salad?), the lettuce was extremely bitter and oddly flavored, and the Sesame dressing was buttermilky and also extremely unappetizing. I was starving so I ate a portion of it, but mostly all I enjoyed were the bits of cheese. Weird."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast, not so much about the lunch or dinner.

The pancakes are great. Light, fluffy and taste amazing. I had no issues with them. 

The milkshakes here are pretty good. Not the 'omg best thing in the world,' but pretty damn good. Calling it a small step above McDonald's is a little harsh, in my opinion.

Burgers here are pretty meh. I mean, maybe I shouldn't order burgers at a famed vegetarian, vegan, hippy-dippy place. Fries were not good. You know those little pieces of fry that end  up being dark brown and inedible? My fries had a big ratio of those to good fries. Not good.

Tried the seafood salad here. I would not recommend it. It was basically iceberg lettuce + whitefish + imitation crab. They called it crab meat on the menu. Maybe they think people won't notice? I don't know, but I get kind of uppity when I'm promised actual crab and they don't deliver. The dressings are pretty amazing though!

I would come here again for breakfast in a heartbeat. Lunch or dinner, not so much."}
{"text":"Oftentimes a wait if going during lunchtime/dinnertime, but worth the wait.  A ton o' vegan/vegetarian options including 'milk'shakes!! Enough said!"}
{"text":"The first restaurant I recommend to any vegetarians visiting the Cleveland area.  Huge menu variety and selection, even meat eaters will leave happy.  Very reasonable prices.  Delicious for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, any any eating excuse inbetween.  Don't forget to order a milkshake which I think is a Tommys signature thing, I see frequent to-go shake or smoothie orders being cranked out at the bar.  

A trip to Coventry is always fun, and you must stop by Big Fun and take in the vintage and nostalgic toys (I know, wrong review, but that place is adorable)."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as much as I did in the 90's.  While I do appreciate the loads of healthy food options, something about the chaotic vibe bugs me.  To my disadvantage, I was hungover and it was Saturday afternoon.  All I wanted was food...asap.  It took a while for our server to get it together.  And the busboy kept clanging plates around when clearing tables.  And, I was NOT the only one that annoyed with the sound he was making. 

Great unsalted fries.  They keep the skin on. YUM.  Wish they offered a side with their sandwiches though. 

I know it's been mentioned in previous posts....but seriously, what is up with \"homos\".  Spell hummus right, douche bags!"}
{"text":"Usually, there's a wait for a table, but it's worth the wait.  I've been a patron for about ten years.
Food is excellent but usually takes awhile to arrive.  Service is slow and minimal, but the good food sort of makes you forget about it, like how a cute newborn makes you forget your 24 hours of agonizing labor.
If you order to-go, check it before you leave, cause they sometimes confuse orders.  
This place has an excellent brunch!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. Sooo good! When we lived in Cleveland Heights, we only went once and I remember not liking whatever we had too much. Now that I live on the west side, I've been once and it was great! Go figure. Now I can't go as often as I'd like. I had the BW I believe. Some sort of pita with veggies, cheese, falafel and other stuff. It was super-fresh and delicious. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm skipping the meat whenever I eat here. They have a ridiculously huge vegetarian selection. Solid place, only downside is no booze. Bummer but still definitely worth a trip to try Tommy's."}
{"text":"We were out on the east side yesterday, so we thought we would hit Tommy's for dinner since neither one of us had been there in awhile. We were seated quickly with menus and drinks, and then everything slowed. down. to. a. near. stop. After taking our order, our server didn't appear for another 35-40 minutes. Didn't check on us once during this time. I am usually patient in restaurants, but even I was wondering where the heck two sandwiches and fries were by this point. We kind of think he forgot about us. So, 40 minutes after ordering, we received our food. 

My omnivore husband went with the Delaney sandwich, which is a vegetarian take on a reuben with tempeh as the star. I had a veggie burger with Daiya cheese added (it was a weekend splurge for me!). We shared a side of fries.

The sandwiches are pricey when you consider that nothing comes with them. My veggie burger was fine, but not as good as my favorite veggie burger at a certain little cafe in Edgewater. I thought my husband's sandwich was better. The fries were outstanding. 

The menu features lots of vegetarian options and things that can be veganized, but overall, it wasn't a great dining experience. I think Lakewood and Cleveland have MUCH better options for vegetarians and vegans, yet Tommy's continues to get the buzz. Makes me wonder why. I would go back, but would go to several other places instead if given the option."}
{"text":"tommy's is SO GOOD! it's no surprise to me that a tommy's milkshake was one woman's dying wish. 

not only is tommy's delicious but it's always consistent. it can get very packed on the weekends but that's to be expected. I usually like to go for lunch during the weekdays. 

I normally get the Steph sandwich (turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce and tomato on pita). they have so many vegan options here so it's always such a nice addition to be able to have daiya vegan cheddar added to a sandwich. they also have Veganaise! these are both so nice for people with allergies or people who are simply just vegan. on top of the vegan alternatives, they have plenty of vegan menu items too. my absolute favorite thing on the menu is the strawberry tofutti milkshake. I would ABSOLUTELY ask for one as a dying wish. no joke. my mom is a big fan of the falafel so today I tried something new and got the Ceebee (falafel, tomato, lettuce, peppers, sesame sauce, tahini and added daiya cheddar). it was spectacular! my fiancé got the Cigar and loved it. however, he does always complain about the sandwich's getting soggy and deconstructed shortly due to the fact that they are made on thin pita. i have found in the long time that i've eaten here that as soon as you get your sandwich, flip it so the top piece of bread is on the bottom and the problem is solved. it's also always a treat to get an order of fries too, especially with the malt vinegar provided on the table. they also provide hot sauce, ketchup and plenty of extra napkins on every table which is a huge plus when it comes to having to bother your waiter for little things like that. 

the service is always consistent as well. there's nothing bad to say about this place EXCEPT the bathrooms are always awful. they are ice cold and honestly never clean. it's such a shame!!! the restaurant itself is usually always clean, especially for the heavy traffic of children passing through, but the bathrooms are just, bleh! for the amount of time tommy's has been around they could definitely use an overhaul. this is a small price to pay though for such delicious food, just be sure not to lose your appetite by using the restroom!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both the times that was amazing the food is good the prices are a little high but the portions are good the service is great and everyone seems nice not only that but it's connected to a bookstore which is pretty cool can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Falafel and milkshakes!!! Fries...bomb! Breakfast...bomb! Meat pies...bomb! Veggie burgers... bomb! Yesterday I was caught between wanting a falafel and breakfast. Well,  my problems were solved because they have an omelette with falafel in it. Also ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and of course cheese.  It's sounds like an odd combo especially with the ham, but their falafel game is so good I had not a doubt I would be nothing but satisfied.  Oh and it was so delicious!  A chocolate milkshake to wash it down! Yes a chocolate shake for breakfast! I wanted to treat myself and it definitely was a treat.  An inexpensive treat! I would've taken pics for you guys but I was just too into my meal to pick up my phone. Ha! Ain't that something!?"}
{"text":"Best bang for the buck , lunch dishes are only 6.99 . Food taste good and they give a good portion"}
{"text":"Extensive menu with tons of great options from monster salads, awesome hummus, falafel, spinach pies, and burgers. The milkshakes are ridiculously good. Lots of good vegetarian options as well.

The service can be a little slow, but they are friendly and don't mind being flagged down if you need something. The food is completely worth the (slightly longer than average) wait. Everything I've had has been freshly prepared, not something out of a freezer, including the fries - which come in a pretty sizable portion for two or three people and are delicious."}
{"text":"As much as I appreciate the wonderful selection of vegan and vegetarian options here, I really don't get the draw for their food.  I've heard so many good things about their pies.  Every time I try one, I wish I didn't.  There is something they put on them, maybe a tahini sauce (which I usually love) that makes them taste almost spoiled to me.  I feel like the flavors and seasonings are always off.  If I have a spinach pie, I expect the spinach to stand out and taste fresh, and it never happens for me here.  There is actually nothing I like about their pies.  The fillings and crust are flavorless and mushy.

I love the shakes, that I will admit.  I love the ambiance, the open-ness and local art on the walls.  Service is fine enough: nothing amazing, but far from poor.

I do like that you can pretty much ask their cooks for anything you want here.  For their dietary challenged, that is awesome.  For this reason, I bring my in-laws here when they are in town (my hubs and I secretly groan about it too).

Overall, I feel like everything they serve here I can make better at home.  I think they overcook their veggies, and don't flavor and season their food well.  Sorry, I know so many people love this place - but not me."}
{"text":"This city does NOT mess around with comida. I went for bretfast and had the egg sandwich with peanut butter. I was hesitant cause I'm not a hipster dufuss, but the server assured me it was the tits, so I gave it the green light and was happy I did. Hit the bookstore in the next room and the old school toy store next door. Made a morning of it. This place is a must. Maybe I am a hipster dufus."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is amazing and it's in a really hip area. I came here recently and it seemed like a hippie sort of joint, everyone had dreadlocks or looked like a hippy or a hipster but the food was AMAZING. When you're here opt for the THC... no not the pot that one of the patrons or servers of this place probably smokes, its the sandwich that this place serves (on a pita instead of bread). Get it and you will not be disappointed, and you will enjoy it with a side of perfectly crispy fries. Oh and if you want a starter go for the broccoli rizzo soup that they have it tastes AMAZING."}
{"text":"After signing in to be seated and waiting 20 minutes on  a Tuesday at 2:40pm, we decided to leave because of lack of acknowledgement and poor service."}
{"text":"One thing I miss most about living in Coventry is walking to Tommy's, a Coventry institution for years. You might have to wait for 20 minutes but it's worth it. Vegetarians are thrilled with the variety but there is something for everyone. I appreciate they serve breakfast until 1pm on Sundays. 5 star omelets, tempeh burger is great, tofu salad nice and light, falafel pitas delicious. But they also have meat pies, corned beef, and \"regular\" food. Don't forget to split a side of fries, I freaking love their fries. I also like being able to walk next door to the book store without having to go outside."}
{"text":"Tommy's is one of my all time favorite restaurants anywhere.  They have great veggie creations and other delicious selections as well.  I love the broccoli rizzo in particular.  Other than that, I always try different sandwiches and I have never been disappointed.

The last time I was there with some visiting relatives the staff was not only friendly and helpful but the maintained a sense of humor despite my brother in law teaching my kids how to stick teabags to a window.  Nice.

Yes kids, Uncle Bo is a fun guy and has righteously earned his nickname of Monkeybutt."}
{"text":"I've been to Tommy's twice, both times with friends' little children. It's a perfect atmosphere for little kids and adults alike. The menu is intense and will take you awhile to decide. They have a wonderful Mediterranean flare which is welcome! The last time I was there, I had the French Onion Soup which was tasty but not the best I've ever had. In fact, I think my nephew out ordered me with his simple grilled cheese. My sister got the turkey sandwich on pita which looked amazing. Also we ordered a plate of fries and we couldn't stop eating them! 

The reason I give this place 4/5 stars is because of the service. While the wait staff is very nice, it took awhile for us to get served. 

Also, I want to mention that Tommy's is a great place for a variety of dietary preferences (vegan, veg, gluten-free, etc)."}
{"text":"Blah.... that's all that needs to be said.

I'm not sure if we ate at the same place because the food I got was super bland and over all gross"}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice an I have to say I'm amazed. The wait is pretty long but the chefs are unique.  I had a turkey burger first time around with a peach and strawberry milkshake. I have to say I was impressed. Yesterday I had two slices of their cheese pizza and it was literally a bite unto utopia. I'm still salivating thinking about the flavor and texture of the pizza. Their portions are pretty hefty, especially the fries. I would highly recommend this place. Great service as well, definitely a hidden gem in Coventry."}
{"text":"Tommy's, how I love thee.

Every time I visit Tommy's, two things are certain. One: I am getting a vanilla malt. Two: I'm not going to be able to decide what to eat because it all sounds so good. 

Every time I go to Tommy's, I try to order something new. There's so much variety in the sandwiches that it can be pretty overwhelming the first time you visit. I've usually been able to find something that hits the spot. 

Tommy's is a Coventry staple for me. The service is always decent, I've never had to wait long, and I always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"If you follow a strict diet of vegetarian or vegan, this place is for you. 
If you don't, I wouldn't recommend it.

There aren't a lot of vegan/vegetarian places in Northeast Ohio, which is why this place is so popular, I think. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the spinach pies, the falafel, the veggie burgers, the veggie dog, etc, but it was nothing special. Still great.

But when I brought my omnivore friends and family here, there wasn't a lot of options beyond your normal menu. 

Other than that, I highly recommend Tommy's. A bit pricy at times, because the entrees don't include sides. It's good food, a good setting, and in a generally hip / trendy area. (Coventry.)

If you are in the Coventry area, you should stop by! I loved the BBQ Seitan. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"Definitely met my expectation. A lot of people hyped this place up so I was expecting it to be good, and I was surprisingly pleased because I'm not a vegetarian (I love meat). I had one of the falafel sandwiches which came on pita bread (delicious and fluffy), with bean sprouts (surprisingly tasty), and some sauce that just tasted perfect with the sandwich. I also got fries and a black cherry milkshake, which were also recommended and \"can't go wrong\" moves! Would recommend to anyone in the coventry neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service with phenomenal food at a good price. Came in here on a Friday during lunch when it was busy, and we were seated and got our food pretty quickly. Was up in Cleveland for the week and came here on Monday and Friday, probably should've every other day too."}

{"text":"Tommy's is a great concept, and the food is good, but the service is so slow that I never want to go back!  And then I forget that the service is slow and I go back and I'm pressed inside this vise of waiting, waiting, waiting for the server to greet me, take my order, take my plates, bring me the check...

I eat gluten-free, and the menu is okay for us, but it's not good enough to keep me going back when the experience is so grating.  Maybe if I could eat anything on the menu I'd have more motivation and give Tommy's another star."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  One of the few places where both vegetarians and omnivores can find plenty to chose from.  Plus, it's always full of a mix of college students, old-school Coventry hippies, high-school vegans from the suburbs, and young families.  The wait can get pretty long but it's attached to Mac's Backs, a pretty cool independent bookstore."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place with my boyfriend and this place was right across Vaughan mills. There was lots of tables, super clean and the people were super nice and attentive. I do recommend their peppered chicken wings! It was delicious and maybe would be better if they had more chilli peppers but that's my preference. Their chilli chicken was gooood too!"}
{"text":"I've had a few of the pies here, they're okay but not good enough that I would get it again. I loved the milkshakes here though, so if you want milkshakes, definitely try them here! There are a lot of different flavors available. I think I got the cookie dough or moosetracks, something chocolatey."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of Tommy's from childhood. However, I have not been back since about that time -- until recently. My boyfriend and I are attempting to try some local lunch spots now that we both work nights and let me tell you this was not a let down! There was a pretty hefty wait time but we were able to avoid that by sitting at the 4 person \"bar\"/counter. Service was quick and efficient. I got the Ceebee and IT WAS AMAZING. I was nervous to try falafel and now I want to eat this sandwich every day. Just thinking about it has me salivating -- also it stayed really well. I was able to eat the other half after work much much later in the day. Definitely recommend it to everyone - meat eaters and vegetarians alike!"}
{"text":"Lived in the area for 4 years before making out to Tommy's but the place did not disappoint! We came for brunch and I had a basic omelette and a stack of chocolate chip pancakes, which were cooked just right! The chocolate shake was also really thick and tasty.

The wait at around noon on a Sunday was a little bit long (maybe 45 min), so it's probably a little best to come earlier on weekends. Service was great and the waitress was very patient with splitting a large table onto separate checks. 

There's a good amount of seating around the back and definitely a few larger booths to accommodate big parties if necessary. 

Overall, I'd definitely come back and try some more of their brunch selections."}
{"text":"Tommy's was my go-to place when I lived in Cleveland a few summers ago. Since I was in town, I thought I'd see whether it was still as good as I remembered.  It is!

What other restaurant has 10 types of tasty falafel sandwiches? Vegan options? Meat pies? Several types of spinach pies? Milkshakes?! There is something for everyone here. Really. And so many options! The food is fresh and so tasty.

From what I recall, Tommy's can get a tad busy sometimes, but it's a fun space with local art, and it's connected to a cozy bookstore. 

My only question is, why aren't there more places like this?"}
{"text":"Food was good but place is understaffed. It took 10 minutes for a server to get to get to us and then another 30 minutes for our food to come out."}
{"text":"Tommy's was great! prepare to wait but I get it, the food is great and worth it! My bf got the famous milkshake! I have to eat vegan due to some health issues, so I enjoyed the hummus and the spinach pie, which were both good! The fries are great! Definitely a nice little place if you are enjoying Coventry."}
{"text":"Satisfied!!! and ready to go back for more!!! I ordered the jerk chicken lunch special with fried rice, spring rolls, pepper chicken wings, and the chilli chicken. Amazing... each bit was full of flavour.

From the outside you can't really tell what's inside until you step in. It was 3:30pm on a Saturday and one table was occupied so we ordered, and got everything quick! My first time trying Caribbean Chinese food. I wasn't sure what to expect. It was like Chinese food with a twist.

The jerk chicken was different but your tradition jerk chicken from other restaurants, more soy sauce was added to it. The chicken wings were AMAZING!!!! I would definitely go back just for the wings 12 pcs for 8 something! All I have is great things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Great place!

Big portion of the Hot and Sour soup, and tastes great!

Singapore vermicelli noodle was really good, I asked for just veggie and they had no problem accommodating. 

I was told the egg roll and spring rolls were excellently well. 

Clean place and friendly service."}
{"text":"I would give this place a solid 4 stars.  The place was packed @ 1230 on a weekday which is a good sign. We had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for a table with was OK for my party of 3, and they were very upfront about the wait time, as well.  When we were seated, we were greeted very quickly and our drink orders were taken and brought quickly as well.  We decided to split a shake three ways and they were very kind enough to let us do. The shake was thick and hand made, and not too sweet.  I got a burger cooked medium well. The burger was cooked closer to the well done side which was fine. Although this was the case, it was still very juicy, flavorful, and well seasoned.  The veggies that I got with the burger were fresh too. My friends and I shared the fries since the fry portion is a whole plate. They tasted lake they are fresh hand cut fries which are always a plus in my book!  One of my friends did have an issue with her corned beef sandwich, though. She complained that the corned beef was too tough and didn't taste fresh. But our server was awesome and replaced my friend's meal, without complaining or back talk.  The prices weren't bad either.  I would recommend and will be stopping back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've never reviewed Tommy's. This place is pure heaven. I get the same thing almost every single time. I know I should try something new, but it's just SO. FREAKING. GOOD.

Their milkshakes are amazing (even the vegan ones are quite good), the sandwiches and burgers are super tasty, and their fries, oh their fries. It's funny, sunflower seeds on a grilled cheese sounds weird, but for some reason it works and is super delicious. I highly recommend either the Zippy or the Ripp, which are both grilled cheese with sunflower seeds on them.

I also actually got a tossed salad this time, which I (incorrectly) assumed would be some small side dish. Let me tell you, this was no small. They seriously overfilled the bowl to where I had trouble figuring out exactly how I was going to mix in the dressing. But it was totally worth it. I definitely want to run back and get that salad again.

The only thing that sucks about this place is that the parking situation, but trust me, it is worth it. Now I want Tommy's all over again. Sigh."}
{"text":"Th food here was marvellous, and delicious. It is a small restaurant, family owned, and really nice service. Honestly, the portion was big, and the price is not that bad. It was really good, oh my god, I would totally come back. Perfect for take-out on a busy day when you just don't want to cook!"}
{"text":"Came back here with fellow yelper, Joyce P. Finally tried the food.. and omg, it was GOOD.

First, the menu. Man, how cool is it, that the 85% of the menu was UNIQUE to the place. You could sure, find your normal middle eastern food, but then there were random meat/spinach pies/random dishes in itself. My friend got the tofu salad pita sandwich. She claimed it was amazing. I got the MR3- spinach pie with mushrooms, curry, and a whole lot of other stuff. OMG, it was good. WOW. hahha. It was definitely... salty, but it was good.

I definitely love Tommys. It's unique, it's hip, and what a cool menu."}
{"text":"The best items on the menu at Tommy's are the milkshakes and malts.  It's all downhill from there, although they do have pretty good falafel, fries and burgers.  The food is average at worst and pretty good at best, probably deserving of 3.5 stars (curse the whole number rating system!).  The service is usually terrible and there's always a long line, but it's such a Cleveland institution (and the milkshakes are so damn good) that people are always coming back.  If you don't like it, at least it's on Coventry where there's a lot of stuff to do."}
{"text":"UGH

this summarized my emotion for this restaurant.


jk, i'll explain more - first of all, this place is always very crowded. they don't take reservation either. the entrance is very narrow and small so it was very uncomfortable for me to wait by the door.

secondly, their food was just so mediocre and pricey that totally does not worth my wait. One of my friends ordered this sandwich that literally was just two loaves of bread with a BUNCH of ham or whatever in side. It was so disgusting looking and I'm sure even my imaginary three year old daughter can do something better.

Their milkshake is probably the only thing that MIGHT attract me to go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take out of town guests.  We love their milkshakes (chocolate peanut butter is the best) salads are generous.  French Onion Soup is the bomb. Baba and hummus are crowd pleasers. I usually get the veggie burger or the toasted cheese.  Never had a bad meal. Service is great,  atmosphere is artistic and fun.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great vegan/vegetarian food, and widely varied!

My favorites: the fries (malt vinegar is on the table), the tempeh salad, the vegan taco salad (kind of plain and boring but I like the bread bowl), and the Delaney (a vegetarian rueben).

They also have vegan ice cream and shakes.

Now the bad:

Some of their dishes (like a steamed vegetable/rice thing) are completely tasteless; but I guess that's what some people are after, so when in doubt: ask. Most dishes have been very flavorful.

It's often annoyingly crowded/noisy (with too little room to wait for a table) and parking in Coventry can be a bear. Solution: go at off times if you have a large party or aren't in the mood for bustle/waiting."}
{"text":"There is no milkshake in this world that can compare to the chocolate tofutti milkshake...and it's vegan?! Just awesome! The food is also out of this world...I've yet to find a vegetarian Reuben in Chicago that is even half as good as the delaney. The spinach pies are massive, so make sure you're hungry if you want to tackle one!"}
{"text":"Unless you want bland food or are craving a milkshake, this place is not worth the trouble.  After a 20 minute standing wait by a freezing cold door, while several tables sat uncleaned, we were just about to call it quits when our party was called. Though they do have a limited number of meat entrées, no effort or imagination goes in to these carnivorous offerings - they are truly an afterthought. Their \"loaded\" hamburger was on an airy, untoasted bun without mushrooms or grilled onions and totaled a whopping $10.50! Factor in the cost & inconveniences of limited parking and I left asking myself why we didn't go to Five Guys instead?  FG burgers are truly loaded: larger tastier and cheaper with a dozen more toppings. My son's corned beef & egg sandwich fell apart just by picking it up since it was an overstuffed sandwich of paper-thin pita.  Thereafter it was a corned beef omelette that he ate! Their 12 options of grilled cheeses sounded all the same and the best thing about a grilled cheese is the option for bacon, of which there was zero, even tho they have several bacon items on the menu. The fruit cup smoothie tasted of 90% OJ & definitely not of the fresh squeezed persuasion. Their vegetarian bean soup was watery and bland with only one type of bean. So two vegetarian options and two meat entrees and both of us agreed we would come back for neither.

I know they offer some nice vegetarian options, but I could find no mention of locally sourced cheese, milk, eggs, meat or vegetables. Even my vegetarian friends admit that the food quality isn't on par with other places.  Perhaps this was a unique, creative place in the '70s but the food scene in Cleveland has greatly improved since and unfortunately Tommy's is still in the '70s.  And like the food, the atmosphere is bland.  How 'bout a wall color other than white?  

In looking at the yelp reviews for the last two years there is a disturbing pattern of 3 or less stars. In fact would be interesting for yelp to provide a summary of reviews by year and I think u would see a significant decrease in the last few years with the overall rating being skewed by hundreds of older reviews. A menu refresh is long overdue with more flavorful & inspired vegetarian and local options. The vegetarian community has long (clearly too long) supported this place and deserve better! Their prices are too high for this unimaginative food; don't settle for this less than average vegetarian diner as there are much better out there."}
{"text":"Had a great time yesterday! Delicious burger, fun environment, and friendly and funny waitstaff. The place is open with tall ceilings, lots of well-cared-for plants, and a fun local atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yay Tommy's! This was my first time coming to this establishment but my boyfriend is from Cleveland and has been coming for years. He knew Tommy's before he knew me! There is a cup he still has from when they used to give milkshakes in them. 

I eat plant-based so this a place that can be a life saver when the argument of \"where do we go to eat with the vegan?\" occasionally comes up.

A small group of us came in for a quick lunch with our varying dietary wants and needs. We had prompt and kind service. The simple yet cozy interior was clean and the place was pretty full for lunch. It is adorable that there is a local bookstore connected. Perfect for if you have a wait, or maybe even if you don't.

Now onto the food. I definitely enjoyed the extensive choices that I could select from! They have very creative vegan food combos on the menu. For someone that loves all things lunchtime this was exciting. I ended up with the tofu egg salad on a pita, recommended by the sweet waitress we had. It was a huge portion and delicious. I ate the whole thing like it was going out of style. The others had sandwiches, also large in portion, that they loved. (They knew they would, again, they've been coming for a while) :)

Nothing negative whatsoever to say!

I will return (an anticipated high amount of times) to Tommy's on my future visits! Thanks Tommy's! :)"}
{"text":"I like Tommy's.  I know lot's of people who love it, and I'm ok with that, because it is a good place to eat, and has been that way for a LONG time.  The thing is I never seem to crave it.  Whenever I do go, I have a hard time picking from the menu, not because I'm a picky eater, but more because I'm afraid it won't fill me up.  Oddly enough, I end up enjoying whatever I end up ordering, and with a side of their delicious fries I end up being satisfied.  

I am certain the problem is with me and not Tommy's, and when friends come from out of town, I am quick to recommend it if they are going to be in the Coventry area.  

The menu is pretty expansive with a heavy leaning towards middle-eastern food and there are  LOTS of options for vegetarians.  My recent favorites are the THC sandwich (Turkey, ham, and cheese, not reefer) and the Gordon meat pie.  

The milkshakes are really good, as are the fries.  Be sure to order both.

Tommy's always seems to be crowded, but they've got lots of tables and the wait never seems to be too long.  Make it a point to go there if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"We tried Tommy's for breakfast and the omelette dishes are solid. I was not impressed with the pancakes at all. The home made peanut butter was excellent. 
I will definitely return to try the vegetarian options for lunch."}
{"text":"I appreciate all of the vegan options!  I was there for breakfast and had the tofu scramble. I do think that they could be seasoned better, besides the salt and pepper on the tables. Maybe switch the vegetarian sausage available as a brand to a vegan brand. But it's great that so much is available on the menus, thank you!"}
{"text":"Insanely good! Huge menu, lots of vegan options. I got the Delaney sandwich with vegan mozzarella instead of Swiss and a chocolate Tofutti shake. 10/10. Can be a bit pricey- I paid $20 for these. Sandwich didn't come with fries. They do have a side of fries for about $3 that's big enough to share with 2-3 people."}
{"text":"the service sucks and I have nothing want to eat when I saw their menu. NO veggies at all.when we. had beef rib combo"}
{"text":"Tommy's has a great selection of vegetarian foods. You can tell that they use quality and healthy ingredients in all the foods they make. I recommend the Donovan pita sandwich and their french onion soup is the only vegetarian french onion that I have ever seen. I tried the peach yogurt milkshake today and it was a meal in its self. This is a great place to take your friends, family, or just yourself. There is a parking garage across the street with meters."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places in Cleveland. It's right on Coventry, which means you can catch a great lunch or dinner, and then spend the day/evening exploring the area and window shopping. The inside is really bright and lovely, with light wood booths, tables, and floors, and plenty of seating. The servers are mostly really young, but I've found them all to be polite and accommodating. Service can sometimes be slow in the evening because they are straight packed.

They have a ton of Middle Eastern and vegetarian options. One of my favorite things on the menu are the spinach/escarole/potato pies, my all time favorite being the Lindsay-- delicious creamy tuna salad, melted munster cheese, perfectly cooked mushrooms, sautéed spinach, warmed tomatoes, and oddly enough, sunflower seeds. The combination is strange yet AMAZING. I also love the tossed salad. Yes, it's $6.30 but it's also HUGE and comes with a ton of veggies and freshly grated cheddar/munster cheese. It's a meal unto itself. The ranch dressing they use is the stuff legends are made of. Banana milkshakes are also my favorite, but beware: sometimes they have a small surcharge for fresh fruit blended in your milkshake that they don't tell you about. 

This is one of those reviews that after writing it, your mouth is watering and you wish you could eat exactly what you've just described. Tommy's, I miss you!!!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is. The food is expensive. The hummus tasted store bought. The baba ganoush was not that great either. Falafal was decent. I could make a milk shake at home. The sandwiches are not that great. The french onion soup is something crazy like $6 a hit. This place is over hyped in my opinion. I think it is like Melt, people just convince themselves that it is really good when it in fact is average and just priced high. I would rather go to Grum's down the street. I am beginning to think that is overrated too."}
{"text":"In a world where obesity is becoming a pandemic and fast food runs rampant, Tommy's is a great change of pace.  The menu offers fresh choices for not only the meat lover, but more importantly, the vegans and vegetarians.  Health-conscious carnivores are not left out either.  Whatever your preferences are, Tommy's probably offers something you'll like.

I've been there twice, once for brunch and once for dinner.  Had the Wildflower falafel pita-wich for brunch and Kalle salad for dinner.  I think my bf had \"less healthy\" dishes including a phosphate shake and meat pie.  I was also convinced to try their fries.  Now, you really need to be a health junky or in the mood for some raw food if you're going to order the healthy choices.  Aside from the falafel and baba in my pita and the turkey cold-cut in my salad, everything else was raw and unseasoned.  So if that's what you're expecting, then hooray!  I was expecting my broccoli and cauliflower to be blanched, but oh well, next time I'll ask if they can do that.  Speaking of which, they're pretty receptive to changes and adjustments.  

But one annoying thing, why was my turkey slices of cold-cut turkey??!  With all the freshness and goodness of that salad, I was quite disappointed that the turkey was basically sliced turkey breast that you buy from any old deli.  *Sigh*  I wish I had known that.  Another thing (and this is somewhat nit-picky): the surface of my cauliflower florets were shaved off giving flat edged tops and corners.  Being an avid home-cook, I know this is done because when cauliflower has been sitting around for a while, the surface starts to brown (aka early signs of rotting).  In order to save what's left, you can shave off the top.  I usually blanch it to kill whatever bugs might be lurking naked to the eye.  It's not as bad as something like mold that spreads microscopically.  I would never recommend shaving off pieces of molded tomatoes and eating the rest.  But given that this is a restaurant that sells itself on healthy, fresh choices, I was slightly disturbed by the salvaging of cauliflower (served raw).

Alas, this place is definitely worth a try given it's unique menu with a variety of options.  By the way, don't forget to sign in on a clipboard in order to be seated."}
{"text":"Place is clean. Fast service, friendly wait staff.  Just not my kind of food. Do like the night that magician and balloon guys were there. Kid friendly. Usually go after big fun adventure"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty fair and the layout of the restaurant is really nice. Everything would be perfect but all their waitresses look unhappy/moody every time I go. I understand people get in funky moods but every time I go?? A little genuine friendliness goes a long way! Now I also go to all the restaurants on this road and I can say the other restaurants don't have this vibe from majority of their waiters/waitresses staff. Not sure if it's the general attitude, the worker's pay or the work culture (probably) of this place or all 3 combined. I live a block away but will settle for takeout! They don't really have a strong customer experience (although I can vouch those who give me my takeout are always sooo nice at the register) so I would recommend they put some time and resources into improving customer service, maybe pay their staff more if that's the issue??"}
{"text":"Well done by the team at Tommy's! Yelp keeps making me make this review longer to post so here's another sentence."}
{"text":"As a vegan, moving from Cbus to Cleveland cut my eating out options down to almost zero. A \"meat & potatoes\" town. Tommy's is one the the very few places I can actually go. True, most items are Veg so u have to \"veganize\" but it's better than paying $10 for parking to go to Flaming Ice Cube or Pura Vida downtown. In a land of imperfect or nonexistent options, Tommy's is better than nothing."}
{"text":"Great food, great laid back atmosphere. I gave it a four because the service was slow and there was quite a bit of a wait, but I really loved this place. I highly recommend the falafel!"}
{"text":"I just had the seitan gyro. When i can make something better myself, that does not say much about a restaurant. The \"meat\" was bland and the yogurt sauce chalky. Not to mention they wanted to top it with SALSA?!? I ordered Greek, not Grexican. The tofu egg salad sandwich- same deal. Bland as all get out. I applaud them for being a long running veg institution, but at this point they're coasting on their rep. I don't really dine in here much, so i can't really rip on the service( i shudder to think how bad it might be). After being to Real Food Daily in LA and having mind-blowing veggie salisbury steak, most other places are gonna fall well short. I could go 3 stars, but with this much word of mouth, i expect more. A Booger King microwaved veggie burger is truthfully more satisfying than anything i' ve had at Tommy' s."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tommy's for more than 30 years and haven't found anything like it anywhere else in the world.  While billed as a vegetarian restaurant there's plenty for my fellow carnivores to eat as well although there's enough on the menu to make you forget about meat.  The portions are generous, the service friendly and the environment is everything good about Coventry Village.

On your first trip to Tommy's make sure you save room for one of their thick creamy Milk Shakes."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday breakfast. Well it was 12:10p, but it was Sunday so who's counting? Do note that on Sunday brunch service ends at 1p. When I got to Tommy's there was a wait of about 20 minutes with 5 groups ahead of me. Interestingly enough you add your own name to the host waitlist (a clipboard lying on the counter to the left). A whole bunch of regulars seemed to know this. 

Once seated things moved quickly and the coffee, which was really quite good, was continually refilled. 

I ordered the Elsie Combo. It is basically a triple decker BLT plus two fried eggs, American cheese and house made peanut butter ($6.29). I got mine on rye. It was, despite the peanut butter, a pretty simple tasting sandwich. I did enjoy it though and would get it again. 

My friend got the Zeke which is like an omelet wrapped in pita bread. In this particular dish there were also onions, green peppers and American cheese.

Both entrees were a little small and are a la carte so you may want to consider a side of sausage or something. 

Despite a full house I didn't feel rushed. We were given more coffee even when handed our check so there was no rush to leave. Next time I want to go for lunch. The milkshake and burger seemed popular."}
{"text":"I had the sampler plate and my partner had the falafel JJ sandwich. The sandwich was good. I wasn't a fan of the sampler plate, and although they spelled it differently (seriously, \"homos?\") the hummus tasted burned.  The baba ganoush, hummus, and tahini sauce basically all tasted the same except for texture and the eggplant in the baba ganoush.  The actual restaurant was fun with all the plants, pictures and booths.  The service was on the better side of bad (unfriendly but kind of timely... our water wasn't filled like restaurants with exceptional service and we got our food at a good time).  The shake was nice and thick... probably the best thing about Tommy's."}
{"text":"Tony's has a cozy ambiance that reflects a Cafe setup.  The wait staff is nice and the booths are comfortable.  I ordered the John Z omelet with a side of hash browns. It had falafel, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. It was delicious.  I was disappointed with the hash browns because it was \"home fries\". The cook did not shred the potatoes. I still recommend visiting Tommy's."}
{"text":"Awesome falafel and hummus!! Absolutely love the tofuitti chocolate shake. I ordered something new and wasn't a fan of it and the server took it with no questions and had me look at the menu for something to get in its place.  I was expecting some hint of attitude about it but it never came! Super nice staff and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food with a great selection! Cool vibe in the heart of Coventry! If you haven't been I strongly suggest it."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, even if you are not vegetarian. I went during lunch, a bit ahead of the lunch crowd. Servers were very courteous and attentive. The falafel was our of this world and the veggie burger was very tasty. We also ordered a side of fries and a strawberry yogurt shake. Any meal you order here seems to be very healthy and FRESH. To top it all off, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are just right. And I usually have a decent sized appetite. I will definitely try to make it back in the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was a little scared of the menu when I read it online. Falafel? Tempeh? I'm not familiar with those terms! Thankfully, the waitress was great and patiently answered my many questions. Started with the melted cheese, came in sandwich form, was simple but satisfying. My meatlover bf got the meat pie and devoured the whole thing. I got \"Ceebee,\" a falafel sandwich with veggies and hummus, that was not only filling (I could only eat half) but really delicious. Topped the meal off with a rich cookies + cream + peanut butter shake and it was a really satisfying meal. I didn't miss the meat.

Trying to get seated is a little confusing though. There was a 3-person party in front of mine but there wasn't anyone to take names or even greet you at the door. I had to call my friend that had been there before and he asked me about a clipboard which you put the # of people in your party down and a name. They called mine first and the party in front of me (who didn't write themselves down) started protesting. I was nice and gave them my table since my friend was late anyways but in a busier night I could see a lot of people getting mad if they don't know what to do."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait! Best milkshakes anywhere. Great sandwiches. Love the \"Curly\"; ham, cheese, onions, peppers. Yum!
Great menu for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores, too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a 5 star.  Based on the story I heard about them and the amazing staff.  Unfortunately the food just didn't hold up for me.  I am a foodie. This is a known fact.  It also is known that it takes a lot for me to not like a dish.  So they definitely had some flaws. 

The first major issue was my breakfast.  While the eggs were amazing, they served me probably the worst home fries I have ever had in my life.  They were only cooked on one side and most of those were burnt or not flavorful. Then came the toast.  Wow....   I promise you I am not messing around when I say this,  they were like bricks.  The toast was so hard I couldn't eat them. I was afraid it would chip my tooth (need a filling repaired so it's weaker).  My wife didn't like her meat pie at all

On the bright side,  this almost was enough to make it a four star, the pancakes were to die for. They were super fluffy and super filling. I would have been happy just to eat those!"}
{"text":"Last month, 15 of us went to Tommy's for a goodbuy lunch. One of us went 30 min in advance just in case it would be too crowed as I heard from friend. 
The sign is very small and all of us get lost just 10 feet from it. When we got in, turn out there is not crowed as we expected but getting filled 30min  later ( so it's better to get someone there specially for big group).
The enviroment is a plus. The food were served a little late but it is understandable for a big group. I ordered a \"meat pie\" served as pie (as it sounds) with lamb meat, mushroom and cheese. I have heavy taste and it is perfect for me with the special vinegar on the table (means it might be too talty for you). The lamb meat cooked very well and overall  for the pie is 4 and 1/2 star out of five. 
Down part of the dish is that there is nothing eles in this dish.  And I did not get full after this cheesy pie.
Overall, it is a good place to go once for a while."}
{"text":"Tommy's is one of my favorite hangouts with friends and family when visiting Cleveland. I wish I could clone it for the Bay Area. 

Among their specialties, they make great meat and veggie pies and pita sandwiches. 

For years, I've been stuck on the MR3, a spinach pie with falafel, babaganoush, mushrooms, curry powder, and sesame sauce. It's so good, I probably dream about it when I'm away. 

The meat and veggie pies are very filling - correction - they're extremely filling. So, if you have lunch here, don't count on a big appetite for dinner. 

When with a group and only when with a group, I order their fries. They're thick and crunchy but not greasy... and go great with malt vinegar. 

Today I tried the Lindsay, a spinach pie with tuna, mushrooms, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, and cheese.  Hmmmmmm. This is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I have a really hard time finding the good in this place.  It's touted as this mecca for vegetarians/vegans, yet when I see the mounds of iceberg lettuce and canned tuna, I can't help but be reminded of the salad bar in my college dining hall (interestingly, Tommy's mid-80's-esque spartan ambiance feels like a cross between a cafeteria and an airport food court).  

I, fortunately, am not a vegetarian or diet-restricted and so I have little reason to celebrate the fact that Tommy's is one of few gluten-free or macrobiotic-friendly establishments in Cleveland.  While there is a wide selection for meat eaters,  I have the toughest time ordering because nothing ever sounds appetizing.  The Curley -- coldcut ham + layers of melted cheese + green peppers = enough unsatisfying grease to induce a bout of pancreatitis.  I know that vegetarian/vegan and healthy are not synonymous, a fact that I am reminded of after each meal at Tommy's.  It's as if they're trying to cover up the fact that their food has no flavor by piling it on with cheese or tempting patrons with \"exotic\" tamari sauce.  

I think what I find most annoying is how people rave about Tommy's fries and shakes, which granted, are good, but is the kind of praise reserved for any self-respecting diner, or drive-thru for that matter. Tommy's homemade unsalted fries for $3.39 (which we will inevitably douse with salt) and a milkshake for $4.59 -- pricey, and I haven't even ordered my meal.  Beyond all reason, Tommy's has become a Cleveland fixture and is wildly popular, so expect a wait if you come on a weekend or most nights around dinner.  I just don't get what's so special about Tommy's.  The food is about as healthy as what you'd get across the street at Panini's or a few doors down at the Winking Lizard, even though it aspires to be so much more."}
{"text":"Nice people and broad menu, but we found the items we had very bland. The \"rebel bbq sauce\" fallafal just tasted like tomato sauce and the veggie burger Was mushy. We were hungry so figured we would get a vegan shake (toffufi) and something in it just sits in your stomach. I had a spinach pie on a previous trip which was good."}
{"text":"Tommy's is a solid place to take vegan / veggie friends, or partake in an excellent milk shake.  Aside from these points, the food overall is quite average, at a moderate price.  I've never been enthralled with the food here, but never disappointed with a meal.  Selection is huge, but somehow most of the food tastes remarkably similar.  The interior is quite bland.  Nice place to eat if you don't have other options, but with the number of quality ethnic establishments on coventry, I don't typically go out of my way to eat at Tommy's.  Service can be slow at times."}
{"text":"I've recently gone vegetarian and decided to give Tommy's a try. The service wasn't too great; my boyfriend and I waited almost 20 minutes for a server to greet our table...but the food is delicious. My boyfriend ordered a veggie burger and I went the different route and tried their \"Dee-lite\".  Our bill came out to be pretty cheap and we both left satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Such good vegan/vegetarian options. Generous portions (amazing fries and milkshakes). A really fun and casual place to go with friends."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the most overrated restaurant in Cleveland. People at Case and other people that I know who live around the area treat this place like it's built on a cloud in Heaven...in my opinion, it's on the subterranean levels of purgatory.

There are three good things on the menu: the Ceebee, the fries, and the milkshakes. If the milkshakes weren't so great, I would have given this one star.

Everything else stinks. I don't like ordering the same thing at a restaurant every time I go there, so I have tried other things on the menu at various points in the hopes that something else will be good...but I wind up disappointed every time.

The portions are very small and the prices are quite high in comparison as well. When I go out to eat, I like to leave feeling full and satisfied...and that doesn't happen at Tommy's unless I eat everyone else's leftovers or spend a lot of money.

Many of my friends take their out-of-town guests to this place; when I hear of their plans to do so, I always try to intervene and take them to somewhere with better food that more accurately represents Cleveland (such as The Winking Lizard or Siam Cafe). If you're in Coventry and are dead set against eating at a bar, go to Hunan Coventry. Honestly, in the five minutes or so that it has taken to write this review, my opinion of Tommy's has gotten even worse...so I'll stop before I change my review to one star."}
{"text":"I'd had their mindblowing milkshakes before, but this was my first time ordering off their food menu. I went with the Curt Burger, a bacon cheeseburger topped with grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo, and of course, a chocolate malt. For $9.99 the burger was just the kind of slightly greasy diner food I had in mind and quite good. The burger didn't come with fries but thankfully I didn't miss out on those since a few other people at the table ordered fries. As expected the chocolate malt was the star of the show and at a whopping 20oz. I felt like I enjoyed two malts with my meal. 

All the prices were very reasonable, the space was charming, and the servers did an awesome job keeping up with our party of five. Coffee refills and water just before you realize you need one. Although their shakes remain the big draw, I can definitely see myself coming back with a group for a casual late breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I usually only eat here if I can get it to go. And after living next to it for three years, I usually always did. The salads are amazing. I have dreams about them now that I've left the neighborhood. Piles of raw, tasty vegetables, paired with delicious things like hummus and falafel. The spinach pies are also tasty, if you don't want to go the healthiest route. I think the prices are reasonable, too.

Now, the service. It was never very good and it continued to decline rapidly through the years. The servers only check on you twice. Once to take your order, once to get your money. Everyone who works there has an attitude like they're god's gift to the scene and you're seriously putting them out by asking for something. There's a very clear division of labor. I've never, ever seen a female busser, hostess, or cook, or a male server or behind the counter. That's weird to me."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner and split dishes so I could try two things at this diner. I had some of a cookie dough milkshake which was AMAZING and then I had half of the pizza burger as well as this amazing falafel sandwich that had tuna and mushrooms in it. I know, falafel and tuna, what a strange combo, but it was delicious. It had the smoothness of the tuna with the texture of the falafel and this was all in a toasted pita. And of course, we also ordered this huge plate of fries. 

This place is super cute with its decorations and they have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options! The prices were pretty reasonable and the wait wasn't too long. This place is great for families and I would want to try everything on the menu here! Our waitress was also really nice and everyone was just so full of energy. 

If you are ever in Coventry, go to this place for sure. It is the equivalent of the Chicago diner and you will love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tommy's! I first heard of Tommy's before I even moved to Cleveland. I was at a best friends wedding in DC and a few mutual friends who grew up in Cleveland learned I was moving there and spoke SO highly of Tommy's. They said they always make it a point to go to the restaurant when they go back to Cleveland to visit. 

It took me a while to finally try Tommy's once moving to the area, but once I did, I was hooked and have kept going back for more! It's in Cleveland Heights so the area is super cute and the thing I LOVE about the area is you don't have to hunt for parking, you can find a spot easily in that garage! 

My favorite thing on the menu is the Falafel sandwich! I love their pita and their falafel balls! They have SOOOO many varieties of falafels - cheese, barbeque sauce, veggies, etc. etc.etc. but I just love me a plain traditional falafel sandwich. I'm also in LOVE with their black bean chili - SOOO amazing to bring home in the winter, add cheese on top of, and throw some hot sauce in.... YUM!! 

Every time I go, there's always a loooong wait and they're always crowded. I usually get take-out because of this and usually they have my order ready within 20 minutes. 

Can't wait to keep on going back. I want to try the spinach pie next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I have been here in forever and I forgot how good it was. Deff come here for vegetarian food- it's the best (and I'm not a vegetarian). This is a Cleveland staple. Glad I rediscovered it again! Oh, PS, they have meat as well haha!"}
{"text":"A decent place with a large number of vegetarian options for sure.  I was quite happy to find a place like this in Cleveland.  Unfortunately, the food is just ok and the prices are high.

I had a seitan fajita thing inside of a pregnant looking pita football... it was meh.  The salsa tasted like very cheap grocery store salsa, and the flavor overpowered the rest of the dish quite fully.  It also didn't come with any sides, which is weird for how it was priced.  There is also no beer or alcohol served here as far as I can tell, which to me is a bit odd.  I guess I'm just used to every place having at least a small selection of national brews and a few local microbrews.  I have to keep telling myself that Cleveland is not Denver.

I like the idea of this place, so I would probably come back and try something else.  I was just expecting something a little better."}
