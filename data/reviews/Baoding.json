{"text":"Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Really good quality Asian cuisine that is always reliable. Been going there for years and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Baoding is great.  The service is outstanding, the food is fresh tasting.  The vegetables are always nice and the proteins are well cooked.   Don't come here if you want greasy, nasty cheap Chinese food.   Go to the food court at the mall and spend $7 for some crap instead.   If you want much nicer quality food in a nice atmosphere with excellent service, come here.  Yes, you will pay more, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Baoding consistently offers quick service and consistently great food.  I have been atleast 7 times.  Ive been there when they are busy, and during slow hours.  The service is still quick, with a smile.  My water glass is always kept full!  Excellent job.  One of the best restaurants in charlotte, regardless of cuisine type."}
{"text":"Service is excellent at lunch. Fast friendly and attentive wait staff. Food is consistently great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! Gave our family a table on short notice and made really nice accommodations for our baby."}
{"text":"The service is top-notch -- wait staff is highly attentive.  There is a small bar area and dining area is 4-seat tables and booths along the wall.  The food is very good and consistent.  I have dined here many times and have always been pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed that I don't try more items when I eat here, but I come in specifically to get the chicken fried rice. It is nothing like usual Chinese restaurant fare as it is not soaked in soy sauce, and the chicken isn't the cubes from a can. All in all, everything seems to be freshly prepared in their kitchen. The spring rolls are made here and delicious, and the scallion pancakes are another favorite appetizer.

The waitstaff has been here for years and are very good.  Anyone that walks past your table will fill your glass or take your empty plate.

The atmosphere is very nice.  It seems that you have two choices in Chinese restaurants--corporate Chinese like PF Chang's, or red and gold with paper lanterns.  Baoding has it's own look, and the music is not some kind of bad kung-fu movie sound track, they play a variety of normal choices.

When I want Chinese, this is the place for me."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING,  FOOD AND SERVICE IS AWESOME. I can't tell you how impressed I am with the quality of food and how attentive they are . A must go place. WOW"}
{"text":"Baoding has become our favorite Chinese restaurant in South Park.  The food is simple and good, if a bit expensive.

They have a lot of good choices for a vegetarian (vegetable with tofu soup, steamed vege dumplings in spinch dough).

Their house fried rice is terrific and different from others I have tried.

The manager and servers are nice and friendly, if a bit aggressive."}
{"text":"This place will become one of my favorite places to eat Chinese. The food was very good and the shrimp was very fresh. Id definitely recommend trying this spot out!"}
{"text":"Good location, Good atmospehere, and Good Service.  Food is unique, not your typical Chinese.  Chilled cucumber salad and the dumplings are worth trying.  Not your usual soy soaked fried rice, it was still fried, but not brown, none the less, still very very tastey.  Low mein was okay, nothing special.  The seaseme fried tofu was perfect.  Good selection of drinks and due to certain restricitions on my diet, i did not have any meat, but have before and the shredded beef, three glass chicken, ad"}
{"text":"They handled our large group of people very efficiently and got all of our orders right and everyone enjoyed the food. We will go  again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"THE BEST Chinese in Charlotte.  Hands down.  Great service.  If you are thinking of going to PF Chang's...keep moving down the street to Sharon Corners.  Shopping center is difficult to get in and out of but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Once for sit-down dinner, second time sit-down lunch, third time carry-out. The first time was the best time. I ordered beef & broccoli with brown rice. I thought the beef was of good consistency (not chewy or fatty like other chinese spots) and it was very flavorful. The following occasions I was not as lucky. Food was bland (fish with noodles & beef & broccoli again) and was just average chinese food. Perhaps this place is hit or miss with the flavor. However, the service has been consistently good and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Charlotte that I have found. I am a pretty healthy eater, but often find myself craving the occasional Chinese splurge. 

The quality of food is great here - I don't feel gross after eating Chinese food here. I recommend the Seseme Chicken and the Cashew Chicken. 

If you are a fan of fried rice, you can't get fried rice with your entree, but you can get an appetizer with fried rice."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best Chinese food in town. Great service. When you order take out and they tell you 20 minutes, it's never 20 minutes, always ready to pick up when we get there!!"}
{"text":"Our all time favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte! Consistently delicious with excellent service. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty atmosphere and great service, but if you are from New York, this food doesn't compare with the quality and flavor of what you have become accustomed to at a Chinese restaurant. First of all, the green beans were way too salty, the sesame chicken and crispy pulled beef had a weird, harder than normal cookie-like crust on it and had far too much rice wine vinegar, and the glass chicken was flavorful, but rubbery. The best dish was the chicken lomein. You will surely get better and less expensive food at your average take out restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Baoding ! There were 6 in our party and everyone had a great meal. I had the szchuan chicken and asked if they would substitute broccoli for the red peppers and they graciously complied. Everyone said they had a great meal and that they would order the same thing again! I would highly recommend Baoding."}
{"text":"Found myself alone for lunch and remembered the sign outside while visiting 'Moe's'.  Asian grill $5.99. Can't be good, right? WRONG!!!  This was EXCELLENT!  They had 4 or 5 choices of lunch choices and the flounder was excellent!  That and a diet coke was less than $9!  And again, did I say EXCELLENT???   Go, give it a lunch try..... You will see for yourself!  Oh, and the staff was almost too attentive, and extremely courteous.  Can't wait to take my office buddies."}
{"text":"Having not eaten here, currently waiting for my takeout, I think 3 stars is pretty fair and accurate. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Consistent excellent food. I've tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The stand out in my opinion is the moo shu. Baoding's preparation of thid dish is exceptional."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of flavor. Great choice for lunch meeting since the food is good, service is very fast, and parking is ample."}
{"text":"Baoding.....I had been hearing about this place since I moved to Charlotte and was dying to try it.  The place is gorgeous on the inside....what I would totally expect for a restaurant in South Park.  

The food:  My boyfriend and I both had the same opinion.....ehhhhhh.  It was nothing special.  I had soft shell crabs and they were okay, but I was left with a fishy taste in my mouth that never quite went away.  The veggies that came on the side were tasty, cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend at scallops that were supposed to be spicy but they weren't....at all.  The portions were small and nothing to freak out over.  Maybe if I tried somethig else.

The service:  The servers looked the part for sure, dressed very nicely.  When we first arrived, our server was right there and as I tried to order the beer I knew I wanted from the extensive list, he plainly told me, \"No, you don't want that one, you want this one.\"  I'm a seasoned beer drinker and I know what I like and I know what I want,  so I didn't really appreciate the denial from my server.  Also, as soon as our beer was delievered, we didn't see him again until after the end of the meal.  Our food (appetizers and dinner) was brought to us by different servers each time.

All in all, I would probably go back, but not any time soon.  I wasn't super impressed but maybe trying something different from the menu would help.  The beer list is superb and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I ordered the dumplings and pineapple fried rice.I've never had fried rice that was so white-It lacked flavor. The dumplings were just okay. I don't think I will come back here for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Since moving away from San Francisco my husband and I have kind of given up on getting good Chinese food, unless we are in NYC. We don't particularly mind though, and when one of us gets a craving we'll ask the other \"want to get some bad Chinese food?\". Sort of like how the movie Blue Lagoon is so awful it's loops around again and becomes enjoyable.

Baoding is not bad. It doesn't make your heart race either. Prices are pretty spendy for what you get. We had soup for appetizers: Hot & Sour and Velvet Corn. Both were very ordinary but fine. For entrees we had Tangerine Beef, which could have been spicier. Also had Sauteed String Beans, which were nothing to write home about, just a big 'ole plate of beans.

The service is where they set themselves apart. We were seated immediately on a busy Friday night. The atmosphere is comfy and dark with lots of booths for some privacy. Drink and food orders were taken promptly and food arrived swiftly.

We had our normally darling toddler daughter with us who became An. Absolute. Nightmare. When she became too distracting to the other diners we asked for our food to be wrapped and the staff quickly got us sorted -- but not before our daughter smeared food on the wall mirror by our booth. Great, just great.

Husband removed the kid from the premises as I tried to settle the bill and clean up the mess. The staff were gracious and complimentary of our kid, despite her behavior, and brushed it off when we tried to apologize. If we eat here again it will be as take-out!"}
{"text":"Can't seam to get good food here anymore. It was too cold, too Salty, fishy taste, soggy. Not up to my standards. I have given them 3 more tries really wanting them to do better. Sadly not great. 

Before Dec 2017..

Nice ambiance, Great food!!!

APPETIZER:
·Basil rolls- Amazing!! So delicious!!!!

·String Green - it tastes like it's in beer batter. Mmm! Omg, these are amazing. 

LUNCH / DINNER:
·Vegetable brown sauce-  Broccoli, Onion, & snow pea- excellent!! The egg roll can go either way. I've had excellent and not so hot. One time the roll was raw dough inside. 

·Green beans, onions, broccoli with non spicy light brown sauce- incredible!!! 

·Shrimp- my friend said everything was delicious except the egg roll.

·Streamed shrimp and veggies - Not the best - my friend said it was a little better with shrimp sauce. Huge portion though!

·Fortune cookie- the fortune was good, but the cookie was not"}
{"text":"Always good, always fresh and hot. Sometimes, I notice large tables do not get their food at same times, but smaller tables do.  Steamed dishes have lots of spinach, snow peas, cabage, carrots, mushrooms and a generous potein.  Pineapple fried rice is awesome.  Parking out front can be tricky at times, busy plaza.  Good service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you are a South Park yuppie you will love it. If not stay away. Nuff said.

Staff is rude. And they are idiots"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for Chinese food, I usually want Jo Jo China Bistro (Baoding's sister restaurant); however, we had a coupon for Baoding, it's closer to home, and it's in SouthPark, so how bad could it be?  For being in an old strip mall (where the small Barnes & Noble used to be) that needs some refreshening, we were pleasantly surprised that the interior of Baoding was very upscale in appearance and nicely themed and decorated.  Better yet, the pricing was reasonable compared to other SouthPark restaurants.  I decided to try an entree I had never had before -- Three Glass Chicken.  I'm not sure of the meaning behind its name, and I'm not crazy for dark meat chicken as the dish contained, but the abundance of flavors (garlic, ginger, chili peppers, basil, cilantro, wine, sesame oil, and soy sauce) it offered sounded delicious and too good to pass up.  I wasn't disappointed.  The dish was very tasty, despite the more greasy dark meat.  

The service was so-so, but we didn't let that impede our visit.  We enjoyed Baoding, and it can be great for either casual dining or on a date, but Jo Jo is still my preferred Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to just pick up dinner a long time ago and it has always been great. This time we decided we would go in for lunch and it was still really good!! 

We did a little buffet style and tried a little bit of everything! We had the House Lo Mein, Beef and Broccoli, Fried Green Beans,  and a Cucumber salad. It was all really great! The service was great and it was not that pricey"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my birthday. The food quality was excellent. This restaurant has been in business for 25 years. Everything came out hot and delicious. Our waiter was outstanding! Give this restaurant a try. You will not be disappointed. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We came here the other day based on the reviews. I'm not sure where people were eating but it couldn't have been here. The rice was not cooked completely and the chicken was very burnt and crunchy to eat. Will not be back go to Taipei express in Myers Park."}
{"text":"Bauding has the two primary factors that make a great restaurant a great restaurant:  staff and food.  Everyone works as a team at Baoding - from greeting the guests to serving the food.  While we waited at the bar for a table, the hostess offered to take our drink order and in the blink of an eye, our drinks were being served by the bartender.  Once the table became available, our bar tab seamlessly transferred to our table without a problem thanks to the teamwork amongst the staff.  I would recommend ordering the veggie rolls as an appetizer - they are very fresh and a great start to the meal.  I had the moo shu chicken for my dinner, which I'm used to assembling the meat, noodles, and vegetables myself like fajitas, but at Boading, they come pre-assembled, which I thought was genius! (They are also great for lunch the next day if you can't finish all of them at dinner.)  Other great dishes I've had include the Singaporean Rice Noodles which is filling, yet not too heavy like most noodle dishes.  While eating, any of the wait staff that passed by checked in to see if we needed anything - drink refill, soy sauce, etc., not just our assigned waitress.  Again, everyone works as a team. Bauding is definitely the go-to restaurant in all of Charlotte for delicious Chinese cuisine and the most friendly staff you'll ever find at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Some very solid Chinese food, but definitely a little more pricey than most.  Otherwise, 5 stars.

I have no clue why it took me so long to check this place out.  I love Chinese food, the more authentic the better.  Anyhow, I finally made it for a quick lunch.  $10 lunch specials are about twice the price as most places, but still not that bad of a deal.  Especially when you factor in the quality.  I nibbled off of everyone's dishes at the table.  General Tso's, Hunan Chicken, Hibachi trio, Szechuan chicken, etc....  All pretty solid.

No complaints, other than a little more than I'm used to spending on Chinese food.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Seems to be on the decline......pricier than other options for comparable food. Best Chinese in Charlotte is China 88."}
{"text":"Chinese food here in Charlotte is my least favorite food to eat. Why? Because it never tastes fresh. It seems that most places serve overcooked meats and veggies loaded with salt and grease. Baoding however is different. The food is fresh, tasty and light without being overly salty or greasy. The menu is pretty standard but they do have some interesting \"specialty\" menu items. I recently had the Three Glass Chicken. YUMMO! Beware, there are WHOLE cloves of garlic in this dish as well as chilies and ginger with a kick This entree has a very unique flavor and is a nice change from your typical Chinese dishes. I also like the fact that I can have Brown Rice instead of white with no questions asked.

I find their common dishes like the lo main and the chicken and broccoli to be good but a touch on the bland side. It's nothing a little soy sauce couldn't fix however yesterday we found ourselves at a table with no SS. Really? AND no chopsticks. We had to ask for both.

All in all I find Baoding to be a solid go to place. The atmosphere and staff are on point as well. A good place to go when a craving for Chinese food kicks in."}
{"text":"Yum! Another bookmark checked off the list! 

I met a friend for lunch and this place was packed before noon! That's always a good sign. We were seated and greeted right away. See what I did there? :) 

I ordered the lunch special hibachi with comes with chicken, shrimp and beef, a side of veggies and your choice of egg roll or spring roll. I chose the veggie egg roll but they brought the spring roll in error. I was already digging in and didn't notice but our waitress brought out the correct roll. So I can honestly say, both were delicious! 

My hibachi was delicious too! The meat is full of flavor and the spice was just right! Not to mention, the portion is enough for two meals!

I'm adding this to my list of favs in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out yesterday for lunch at the recommendation of a friend and I can say that I was pleased with my visit. The inside is adorable and totally unexpected considering that it's located inside a generic plaza! Yelp says the attire is \"casual\" but I would recommend trendy/business casual to not feel out of place. The staff was super friendly and it wasn't crowded [so maybe I just missed the lunch rush?]. I read other reviews about bad customer service but I think they mistook an eager/attentive server for rushing. Most Chinese places I've been to are big on pleasing their guests; I think pride+perfection in their work is a huge importance in their culture. If anything my server tried to over refill me on soda [lol] but due to dieting I limit myself to only one soda per day. She even boxed up my leftovers for me, I love when a place does that! Honestly I didn't look over the entire menu because I was craving an orange flavor so I went right for the tangerine chicken with white rice; I wasn't disappointed at all but it could have used just a little more orange flavor (I just prefer it really tangy). Overall the food was yummy, fresh and a very nice portion size= worth the price [note: the best/freshest snow peas I've ever had in a lo mein dish]. It also came out very fast, especially considering that I ordered two dishes... about that: my only critique would be is that they don't allow substituting lo mein noodles for rice via a small up-charge =\ but being it was lunch prices I ordered the vegetable lo mein as well [I won't do that for dinner whenever I come back though]."}
{"text":"The Szechuan Wontons are actually Thai style peanut sauce wontons.  The Kung Pao chicken is completely lacking in spice.  The pork fried rice is their own mild concoction, not reminiscent of any particular style.  And the brown rice was mushy.  Bland was the only word that came to mind at the end of a $35 take-home dinner.  

The $2 egg rolls were the best thing about it, lots of flavor, but still not enough of a reason to choose Baoding over other local options other than the dining room which is huge and cozy.  So three stars for having a nice atmosphere for a sit down dinner.  Now if they can just add some character to the food..."}
{"text":"I definitely went at an off time, so maybe that affected it. The ladies were a little too on top of us and checked on us every 30 seconds and I was still reading the menu.... anyways... neither of us enjoyed out meals. The chicken is that weird rubbery texture, and the meals were pretty small. I would much rather go to my regular Chinese place and get a giant delicious meal for cheaper."}
{"text":"Baoding used to be one of my favorite restaurants when they first opened - which believe it or not was around 18 years ago. 

While it may not be the same level of Chinese food that you could get in San Francisco or New York, for a Charlotte Chinese-American place, I think they are offering a good quality of food - much better than their location competition.  

First off, I really like that they offer steamed white or brown rice with your entree instead of what I consider to be Chinese \"fast food rice\" - the ubiquitious cheap fried rice that you get at most Chinese places around here.   I also like that they give you a choice of spring roll instead of egg roll. 

I normally order the Chicken with Cashews here. I know, its not adventuresome or sexy or spicy - but I really like the way they make it here and it has always been one of my favorite dishes.  The chicken is cooked just right - not overdone chewy or rubbery.  The cashews, mushrooms, and brown sauce have a good flavor and they put enough cashews in the sauce- unlike the cheaper Chinese places.

Because I have Jo-Jo in Stonecrest, I don't venture out specifically to go to Baoding - when I am in the neighborhood at lunch or dinner time, I'll definiitely drop in to enjoy a good meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time did not disappoint (Except for the Sake selection). The spring rolls, chicken wonton soup, pork dumplings....All was exceptional. Service is outstanding. Would def recommend this place to anyone looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's been about 5 years since I've been to Baoding, so we decided to go here for lunch to mix things up. We started with some hot and sour soup and spring rolls. My bf loved his soup, and my veggie spring roll was out of this world ! The waitress was kind enough to ask if I wanted shrimp in my spring roll, and since I declined she steered me to the veggie roll. 

My entree was the sesame chicken with brown rice . It was delicious! The sauce wasn't overdone (as in the chicken was floating around in a ton of sauce). The chicken was cooked perfectly, too. The brown rice was delicious as well, even if it is simple. I can't believe we stopped going to this place, and we are putting it back into our South Park restaurant rotation !"}
{"text":"Honestly, coming from Los Angeles, I was disappointed by the lack Chinese food options in the area, but  Baoding is a good consistent lunch stop. They have a very easy menu with your standard fare, they are quick and the staff is nice enough. I wouldn't recommend it for dinner, but it is a great lunch standard. The place is a bit small for big groups though."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to Baoding for lunch because we were near South Park and decided to try it.  The restaurant is very nice inside with comfy booths. 

My first impression of the menu was that it was very Westernized.  I appreciate all kinds of Asian-inspired cuisine but I think I was just hoping for more authentic Chinese. I ended up ordering the Chinese-style steak and my hubby ordered the Firecracker Shrimp.  They were both good but my steak was little on the tougher side.  His shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

The service here is beyond nice and polite. They get 5 stars for their customer service."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service for take out. Always important during work travels. It was hard to decide on the menu options. I opted for the Chicken and Shrimp in Spicy Brown Sauce and Basil Wraps. Both delicious!"}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte nearly 20 years ago and were immediately introduced to this restaurant based on recommendation.  ~ Have always loved this place, consistently great food, excellent service and atmosphere ..  Tonight we went on a Friday night, expecting a wait.  The entire staff was more than gracious about the wait - which was acceptable in our eyes for a Friday night.  Thanks, Boading, for the extra special treatment and for making us feel valued!  You are a gem and service to this extent is rare!  The food alone keeps us coming back but the outstanding attention just made our Friday night a huge treat! Keep up the great work!!!  Your efforts did not go unnoticed!!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The three flavor Chicken was delicious. Service is quite good. The restaurant is very clean and in a convenient spot. Price is reasonable...

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Once my daughter could sit at the table, we went back and thought it was good.  Now we had a baby again so I guess we can't go for another 2 years.  Get high chairs!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I ate in a Chinese restaurant I was, well, literally in China.  While the American version of Chinese cuisine is prolific here,  the number of restaurants that can actually prepare it well are few.  Baoding is the shining exception.

I am always impressed with the happiness of the staff.  And it's contagious.  Someone at the top sets a great example 'cause you can't fake enthusiasm forever.  Xiexie!

Food quality is excellent and priced accordingly.  The evening menu has greater variety more akin to China, without traveling there to get it.  I'm interested in tasting their Beijing Duck.  I wonder if it's anything like the real Peking Duck.  Next time.

So, in the mood for Chinese food?  Look no further than Baoding.  I say, \"Give 'em a whirl!\""}
{"text":"Here the food is good.i have ordered spring roll and house fried rice , both are very good.one house fried rice is enough for 2 ppl if you eat moderately.quantity and quality is good and also nice ambience with Great Wall if china painting on the wall and mirror made it looks like big restaurents.worth visit and I will visit this place again and again."}
{"text":"Great environment and excellent servicing to customers. Well lit making it perfect lighting and enough to fit alot of parties. Food is overpriced for the portion you're getting. The average Chinese restaurant is cheaper with same quality taste. Will give a second try."}
{"text":"Waited a long time to try this place. Wish I had waited longer.

The service was very good; everyone was very polite. However, the food was borderline bad. I ordered the Sesame Chicken lunch special. The chicken portion was at least half vegetables, which was very disappointing. Not that I don't like vegetables, but I ordered chicken. The chicken itself was mediocre at best. I'll take \"fast food\" chinese any day over this. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Without question the best Chinese food in Charlotte IMO. Got the sesame chicken and veggie lettuce wraps and both were incredible. The chicken was fresh white meat chicken fried to perfection and glazed with a homemade sesame sauce! Everything tasted super fresh and the fact that they make their sauces in house should tell you everything."}
{"text":"Really impressed by this place.  We stopped here because we were in SouthPark (a rarity) and saw this place had good reviews on Yelp.  The beer selection was fantastic, and they had a great assortment of dishes.  If you got one of the specials, your entree could cost up to $15 but if you stuck with simpler chicken or veggie dishes, the plates were a more reasonable $8-$12.  My hubster got his fave, ma po tofu.  It is an easy dish to screw-up, but I'm happy to report that Baoding did an excellent job.    I was really impressed by the Shrimp Steamer dish I ordered.  Baoding is obviously trying to provide more health conscious options  through these \"steamer\" (i.e. steamed veggies and your choice of protein) dishes which are served to your in a bamboo steamer.  Despite being \"healthy,\" I thought my steamer dish was really tasty.  

During my time in Chicago, I found good authentic Chinese places, but I never found a really great Chinese-American joint, so I was pleased to stumble upon Baoding here in Charlotte (of all places!).  Oh, and the employees were really friendly and charming.  I plan to be a frequent customer here."}
{"text":"We were in the area shopping and ended up eating lunch at Baoding.  The food and service was excellent.  The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Since half stars arent part of the rating system, I'll add that imaginary 1/2 in the written review :)  So, the usual drill:  In the area, lunchtime, we decide on Asian, look across to see Baoding, settled.
They have attractive decor and I particularly liked the overhead drapery in royal purple.......elegant touch.  It was lunchtime so a lot of tables were occupied.  The menu was limiting in my opinion, they had 4 seafood choices, 4 chicken choices, 4 pork, 4 beef, and a couple apps and maybe 4 soups.  Perhaps the dinner menu is different and has more variety?

I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp (xx spicy) and my lunch buddy ordered Garlic Shrimp and we decided to sample the Singaporean Noodles.  Entrees come with a choice of 2 crab rangoons or a spring roll.  Both dishes turned out to be delicious, not quite my spice level although I requested it, but still tasty.  They didnt skimp at all with the shrimp but they did with the vegetables and rice.  The mound of rice was so tiny, I barely got 5 bites out of it.  I would NOT suggest the noodles at all, they tasted funny and purfumey, left a horrible aftertaste.  The service was okay as the server seemed frighteningly bored --- probably preferred a day of golf instead :)

I would eat here again, if Im in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for quite sometime. This is the first time I've eaten from there though. I was in the area last week and wanted to bring some takeout home. I called in and got the yellow chicken curry with veggies and the steamed veggie dumplings. The curry was nice and had a little kick to it which I appreciate. It also came in a two-parter take out container; rice on one side and saucy curry in the other like that. The steamed veggies, not my favorite. Baoding, like Akhana, serves their veggie dumplings in spinach skins/wontons and I just don't like that. They aren't sticky enough. Skip those. 
Overall, fast, hot, ready when promised and friendly. I'll go back but only when in the area I think."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot in the South Park area. However, if you are in a hurry the service is a bit inattentive. If you don't mind asking for things, you'll have no worries here. 

It's been a while since I was here last, but a few co-workers wanted to eat here so I happily went along. I was pleasantly surprised that their lunch portions were good. Since I don't like eating the same flavor for the entire meal, I ordered both the veggie fried rice and veggie lo main. Both were good and I'm glad I got a little variety. I definitely had leftovers. 

You can eat for under $10 an entree for lunch here and it seems very popular since it was a packed house."}
{"text":"We received the BEST service in all the restaurants I've been to in Charlotte, and I'm from here. My fiancé and I had the specials going on for that night and they were both very delicious and more than enough. This is now our favorite Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with my In-Laws who were craving good Chinese. So my friends at work recommended Baoding, and I decided to take a chance and go. Boy am I glad we did! Authentic Chinese? Not so sure. Yummy? You bet! 

My Father-in-law had the wonton soup, and he raved at the complexity and depth of the broth. The potstickers were good, just wish they were a LITTLE more crispy. But they were very tasty....just picking. The veggie egg rolls were yummy too.

We ordered 4 full entrees, and threw in their Singapore noodles to make it 5. I've got to say that EVERYTHING was very tasty! The dishes that featured Chicken was REAL chunks of Chicken, not 90% breading with a tad of Chicken. Had their Tangerine beef which was good, but I would like to see a tad LESS Tangerine bits in the dish. Tasty nonetheless. General Tao's was very yummy too.

All in all, a VERY tasty meal in a town generally lacking good Chinese (except for Dragonfly off Park Road which is equally yummy).

Definitely will return to try other tasty morsels!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Tried the Thai chicken, medium spice, and it was one of the better meals I've ever eaten.  I would say it was indeed \"medium\" spicy, so perhaps should have gone higher.  Clean restaurant in a nice shopping center, and convenient to the Hilton Garden Inn next door."}
{"text":"Alright, so Boading's got a super cool interior décor.  Loved it, especially the decorations with the Halloween theme for this season was fun and enjoyable, they laid hundred's of beer bottles on the walls inside the restaurant as part of the décor which as fun as well.
The Food - the hunan chicken I ordered was very tasty, loved the sauce.  the spice level was just on point and quantity was good enough.  the brown rice that came along as a side was not fully cooked for me, not sure it was just me or that's how they serve usually.  Wife's Szechuan chicken was tasty as well, the meat was cooked properly, veggies had a good texture and not soggy.  I wouldn't say the taste was the best ever, but we weren't disappointed.
we are suckers for steamed chicken dumplings and it was delicious.  its such a simple, bland dish but it has to be perfect and here it was perfect - it was steamed perfectly, had good texture (not too much dough), inside stuffing was just right and the sauce it comes with was just simple and perfect.
The service was good, our server was kind and engaging and attentive, always checked on us to see if we needed anything and if everything was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...

When I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.

Personally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.

The soup is always great.  The service is also nice."}
{"text":"Wish we had half stars as this is a strong three with high potential to be a full four star.  An excellent Chinese restaurant.

The shopping center in which it is located is \"in a hole\" meaning that you have to slide down into their parking lot and shops.  And Baoding is just about exactly opposite one of the entry drives, which makes it hard to get around cars parked in front.

We went for lunch.  Interior was warm, to the dark side of light, but cozy and pleasant.  Menu had all the standard meals and we ordered quite a variety, all of which were good.  

My best take-away experience was that the kitchen will cook to order if you have something you have had overseas or would like a certain dish cooked differently, no problem.

In my many travels throughout Asia I spent a lot of time in Kuala Lumpur (KL) my favorite breakfast was Bee Hoon, the small rice/glass noodles stir fried with shrimp, squid, and lots of other stuff.  Very yummy.  Problem has been that Chinese/Asian restaurants in the Charlotte area only serve Singapore Noodles, which are Bee Hoon style, but always, to my disappointment, cooked with curry powder.

At last, Baoding understood what I wanted and even offered another way to prepare this dish with a white rather than a brown sauce.  The waitress knew exactly what I wanted but checked with the chef, who also joined our table discussion and out came a wonderful pile of Bee Hoon in white sauce.  The waitress assured me that if I did not like it that they would replace it.

I did and was, and continue to be, happy with my Bee Hoon.

And I appreciate how Baoding takes special orders in stride.  And that says a lot about how competent their kitchen is.  Yes, sir...this is the place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars after eating dinner there on a Friday night. 
First, the staff was quick to seat us, and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Extensive beer menu was appreciated. 

Dishes were ordinary American Chinese.
Appetizers: the Szechuan wontons were tasty, and the Spring rolls were good too.

Ordered the chicken steamer and am happy to report there was more than enough food for two, with plenty of fresh vegetables. 

Staff was very attentive!

Wouldn't drive down to Southpark just for Baoding, but would return if in the neighborhood.  Good food, great service."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte! Superb flavor experience. Have never had hot and sour soup this good. The subtleties of flavors were impressive. Generous portions and the lunch prices are really reasonable. I was very impressed by the huge scallops we got on our lunch special. Everything was perfectly cooked and arrived fresh and hot. All four of us loved our meals and we even asked for takeout so we could enjoy more at dinner.  This place is pretty far from our house but it is well worth the trip. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while, since they opened some nice Chinese restaurants near me in Dilworth.  However, this was the only place we would get Chinese when I was in high school, and the food was always delicious.  The restaurant itself is nice and intimate, the only negative is that it's in Sharon Corners, which is a miserable shopping center to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Ugh... Way overpriced, same taste as the food court at the mall. And when I asked to change one thing on a dish, was told \"NO\""}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place for my daughters birthday. The won ton soup was lovely and light. Lo main was tasty and fresh. We really enjoyed the veggies with shrimp in the \"white\" sauce. It's just a soft light moisture to really let you enjoy the flavor of the veggies and shrimp not be overwhelmed. Could definitely tell the sweet and sour sauce is made fresh, because wow what a difference in flavor and consistency. We'll definitely return when we need more Chinese."}
{"text":"When I walked in, it was decorated in a nod towards hip and trendy and so I was expecting mostly an American lean to all of the dishes. While true that they have standard stir fry dishes and even hibachi-like selections, they do a decent job of Chinese dishes. I had the Baoding duck aka Peking duck. It was actually very good. And they even used ACTUAL moo-shu pancakes and Chinese buns, NOT tortillas. (I am especially put off when restaurants use the understandably similar tortilla in place of the moo-shu pancake but it's just not the same.)

My friend really liked his Hunan beef stir fry. We enjoyed the steamed dumplings appetizer. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"More Gourmet than most Chinese!  The Service is VERY Polite!  They said they would NOT exchange Vegetables on the Sesame Chicken, if I wanted Onion order something else!  Probably Laughing a little (it surprises me sometimes, not this time) so I ordered what I really wanted \"Sesame Chicken with NO Broccoli\" and a Spring Roll, White Rice!  They added steamed : Green Beans, Carrots and Red Bell Peppers. No Onions with Sesame Chicken! My English is OK, ok I flunked College English five times, no Joke!  My Chinese is mostly Perfect Canadian (French Canadian English)!

Sesame Chicken was Very Good! 4 yelp stars!

Spring Roll was good. 3 yelp stars

Basil Rolls (think Vietnamese Summer Roll or an Unfried Spring Roll [I think]) These are Very Good!  Jicama instead of Noodles!  Crunch and NICE Flavor! These are better than almost all Chinese Rolls and Better than some Thai and Vietnamese Restaurants... When I think of it that way, it is a Pretty BIG Compliment!  These Basil Rolls get 4 yelp stars!

Hot Mustard is as hot as Dragon Fly which means it is therapeutic (to me) some will think it is TOO hot... I think it is Perfect and Drowned my Spring Roll... My eyes did not cry, my nose did a little and I drank more water than usual, again I say Perfect!  Probably from a Large Jar? This time that will be just fine.

Yesterday was my Third Dine here, second Lunch."}
{"text":"It is American style Chinese food that's the reason you won't see a lot Chinese people eating there. To me, it is same as panda. But service is way nicer."}
{"text":"Okay so take the Chinese food place that's down the street - they charge 5 bucks for a ton of food right? Well this place is similar to that except they charge a ton of money and give you less food (albeit better prepared). I can't fault them for that right? It's \"Murica\" after all. So if you have too much money and want some well prepared Chinese food - this is your place! Edit: Actually, the food is quite well.  I love the mushu chicken, the Hibachi Trio, and the fried rice is prepared unusually well. I was shocked at the pricing at first but after eating several of the dishes here it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very decent Chinese food - more than adequate in a non-coastal city ;-)"}
{"text":"Classic Americanized Chinese food. Greasy and good. Fry up some sort of meat, put a sauce on it, steam some veggies on the side and serve with rice. Well done. I'd go here again and again. Not bad pricing, either. I ordered the sesame chicken. The sauce was unbelievable. Reminded me of a buffalo wing/sesame chicken sauce. So totally conventional but great."}
{"text":"Baoding is the best Chinese food in Southpark. That being said I think it is a little overpriced, but not overpriced enough to stop me from having it every other week."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!  Everyone is so friendly and attentive.  I also love that they offer white meat for their chicken.  That's important to me.  The Cashew Chicken was tender and there were tons of cashews and mushrooms.  I only wish it was offered spicy.  I solved that by adding some chili sauce.  Next time I'll pass on the vegetable spring roll.  It was too bland for me, the Crab Wontons were much better."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte for many years. 

The wonton soup has the most delicate dumplings ever.  Chicken fried rice is outstanding. 

They have all the traditional Chinese selections as well as many modern recipes. It found elsewhere. They serve many steamed items for the health conscious. 

Want something customized?  They are terrific at making creations off menu for me.  My favorite is Chicken in garlic sauce with broccoli. It is simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"I ask a simple question: how can the general tso's chicken dish be sweet? General Tso's is meant to be spicy or at least have a little heat. If spice/heat scares you, feel free to order the general tso's at Baoding. There's none to be found!

I decided to stop in for lunch to-go on a Saturday afternoon because I had a craving after strolling the aisles of the nearby Home Goods. I walked in and placed my order. While I waited, I was very kindly offered some tea by the hostess. It was a cold day so I took the hostess up on the offer and it hit the spot.

Once my order was ready, it was brought right to me and I was able to stock up on whatever condiments and utensils I needed. I was very much looking forward to enjoying the general tso's but completely thrown off by the sweetness that I didn't finish it.

My dish was part of the lunch special so it came to a total of $9 (plus tax). I really would love to know what's considered \"good\" at Baoding because this didn't do it for me at all. What was lacking in flavor at Baoding, the customer service fully rose to the occasion."}
{"text":"I give Baoding 5* based on my expectations, the great food, attentive service, and pleasantly nice design inside. This isn't your typical take out Chinese restaurant. It is a little more expensive than that but you get a lot of food with an entree and the servers were very attentive and friendly.

I got the beef Kong po and it was great. Definitely would return here again if looking for a quality Chinese food restaurant close to the SouthPark area."}
{"text":"Baoding is our go to restaurant for Chinese food. The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable and the service is unbelievable. In my opinion the food (especially selection) is better at PF Chang's, but Baoding has them beat on value and service. I prefer the overall experience at Baoding."}
{"text":"My friend Jenn and I were very skeptical about this place when this place was suggested as a meeting place. We are not fans of Americanized Chinese food. However, our friend promised us that it's the best Chinese restaurant he has had in Charlotte area.

I was really excited to see that they offer Peking duck as I scout the place out on Yelp. There are also some other dishes that got me really excited such as three glass chicken and spicy wonton!

I got a duck dish, one of my friends got a seafood clay dish, and the other friend got orange chicken. When he told us that he's going to order orange chicken, we were shocked because that's probably one of the most Americanized Chinese food. He ordered it extra crispy and spicy which tasted just as great as it sounds! I enjoyed my duck. I wish I had asked them to make it spicy because the sauce was a bit too sweet to my liking but the meat was very tender! My friends seafood clay pot (she also asked them to make it spicy) was also very good with plenty of seafood in it. 

The service was also top notch. We had a great time there. I definitely want to come back try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I base this review on lunch only.

I have a dream. My dream is that one day ethnic restaurants that modify menu offerings to suit \"American\" tastes to the degree that people in the restaurant's native country would have difficulty identifying those offerings call themselves \"(fill-in-the-blank)-American\" restaurants. Thus...

Baoding is a good Chinese-American restaurant in the South Park area. Other Yelpers have described it well: it is attractively appointed with comfortable seating and an upscale bar. The service is consistent, as is the food, which explains the steady stream of middle-aged lunch patrons. I did not notice anything on the menu that would raise anybody's concern or curiosity. Spicy items were designated as such.

My lunch, Hot and Sour Soup and Garlic Shrimp arrived (temperature) hot, well-presented and adequately seasoned. Neither dish was particularly fresh or inspiring, however.

My thought: if you need a place to go that's consistent, Baoding is a good choice. If you're a food adventurer seeking authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere. I would not characterize Baoding as a good Chinese restaurant, but I will say it is a good Chinese-American restaurant."}
{"text":"This is comfort food find - no joke. I dream about their glass chicken dish with white rice and chill oil. If you have not been here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"We came today, Sunday, and several specials. Was excellent. For $6.95 I had flounder w peppers, onions, pineapple, brown rice, spring roll and salad. Boyfriend had fish, chicken, beef for same price. They let me change the special from fried to grilled flounder. Excellent price, clean, fast service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Asian food, whether we eat in or take out. Consistently good, year after year after year."}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times.  The food is pretty good, the service is always good, and the restaurant is nice and clean.

If you were to compare, I'd say the food at this place isn't as good as their sister location, Jo Jo's China Bistro in Stonecrest, though it is good.

Just like Jo Jo's, this is more upscale Chinese style restaurant than the norm and it's certainly worth trying.  I'll certainly eat here again though it might not be my first choice --though perhaps is Southpark it might be for Chinese."}
{"text":"Great food , excellent service, very reasonable priced .
Ms. May ( server) really makes you feel at home"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and having friends recommend Baoding, I thought my search for solid chinese-american food was finished, but unfortunately the search continues...

I will preface my review by telling you that both times I've eaten from Baoding has been via takeout. The first time, I got their signature dish, glass chicken and it was not only bland but I felt like there was more whole cloves or garlic than chicken. 

The second, I was eating with family so we got a few dishes to try, I got beef w/ broccoli, lo mein and hot and sour soup. The beef w/ broccoli was okay but once again, a little bland. It tasted like they had tossed in a little soy sauce and just a tiny bit of oyster sauce with broccoli and beef. The lo mein lacked flavor and simply had too many HUGE pieces of celery. The hot and sour soup was the best thing I had there. 

One bonus point for them is that the service is fantastic. Not only are they fast and friendly but as I waited for my dishes, they offered me some green tea."}
{"text":"This was my first time having dinner at Baoding. My husband and I were regulars at their sister restaurant, JoJo's, for almost ten years and we were devastated when they closed. We missed the food, the atmosphere and the familiar faces. So we decided to give Baoding a try on the off-chance it might be some sort of substitution. To me, JoJo's was the best Chinese food in Charlotte with impeccable service and a relaxing atmosphere so it has big shoes to fill.

We walked in and immediately the ambiance grabbed me. It was dim but not dark and the lighting and décor were eclectic and sort of mellow. There is a big mural on the wall behind the bar that looked really neat and we recognized the same over the table light fixtures that were at JoJo's. Look, a piece of home! Our server was quick to bring our drinks - I had a glass of wine and the hubs had some cold sake. We took our time with the menu because it was unfamiliar and organized differently than the one at JoJo's. I was sad that they didn't have egg drop soup. (JoJo's used to not have egg drop soup but then eventually added it. Maybe Baoding will as well.) Instead of a soup, I got a spring roll, which was very good. Hubs got a spring roll and the hot and sour soup, his usual favorite, which he enjoyed. It was just as good as JoJo's, although a different color and slightly different ratio of ingredients. 

For our main courses, I got the moo shu chicken (my JoJo's favorite) and he got sesame chicken, his overall Chinese favorite. The moo shu was presented differently than it was at JoJo's (there you build your own with the tortillas served separately, here they were served already wrapped up) but it was every bit as good. The flavors and textures were basically the same so I was pretty happy. Hubs really loved his sesame chicken, saying it was just as good as what he was used to. 

We saw only one familiar face from JoJo's but he was happy to see us and presented us with a free dessert for being JoJo's regulars, which made us so happy. We used to get free desserts and such a lot at JoJo's so it was so nice to a. be recognized and b. be treated as regulars in a new place. I can't emphasize enough how grateful I was for this gesture. (Also the chocolate cake he brought us was to die for. It tasted like a gooey brownie. Yum.)

The food, service and ambiance were all something that I look forward to experiencing again. We had such a lovely dinner and enjoyed it immensely. We'll likely become regulars here and get our Chinese fix at Baoding for the foreseeable future. Here's hoping they add egg drop soup to the menu!"}
{"text":"If I could I would have given this place 3.5 stars. A good place to grab some Chinese food. Went on a Tuesday evening and there weren't that many people there. We had the Beijing duck which is rare to find in restaurants in Charlotte nowadays. We also requested to have both the buns and moo shoo wraps. Not the best I've had but decent enough for me to go back for more. The portion was enough for two people to finish but we both weren't super hungry. My friend and I also got the virgin pina colada which was ok. A bit on the icee side but the flavor was good. I can't speak for the other dishes they have since I've never gotten them but I would come back from time to time if I'm craving Chinese food that isn't fast food.  


Service was fast and they were accommodating for my friend since she was using crutches."}
{"text":"Solid food.  Great for take out as they are very fast. Kind of expensive but good quality. Try the pork or chicken streamed dumplings."}
{"text":"First time I've been here in five years and it didn't disappoint! There wasn't a lot of traffic on a Saturday which I liked... but based on the food it should have been packed! The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good! The rest dishes were savory and well prepared (had the Kung Pao chicken and crispy orange beef). You can get white or brown rice. The crispy beef was still crispy and the orange sauce had a little bit of a kick to it... just the way I like it. 

The service was nothing to write home about, but decent nonetheless. 

You know its a good Chinese place when all the staff talks with a think accent :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Professional service. Convenient Southpark location. Intimate. Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the service also and I was very happy that it was a non-smoking restaurant. They have an elaborate beer menu which was a plus also."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in over 10 years I can't figure out why now ! It's right up there with some of the top restaurants in Charlotte for Chinese cuisine. Quite busy on a Friday night and lacking a few servers but the food it's self was outstanding we started out with potstickers and fried green beans which are the star of the appetizers. I ordered Singapore noodles and my husband ordered Mooshu  pork. Except  for the pancakes being a little dry the stuffing inside was filled with pork, cabbage and egg was very good, my Singapore noodles were loaded with shrimp and chicken,  it was a huge portion but could've use just a little more spice.  I will come back and not wait 10 years  again."}
{"text":"I've been to Baoding twice and each time was fantastic. It's hard to find authentic Asian food in Charlotte, but Baoding is one of the rare few. The owner is Taiwanese, which reflects in the flavoring of the meals too. That was even more of a plus because it hit the spot even closer to home. My favorite is the seafood clay pot, but the duck and mushy are also great."}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese food in all of Charlotte. My family has been eating here for years and the food and service is fairly consistent, if not, at times outstanding or above average. There are definitely some servers who outshine the rest. One in particular who will remain unnamed. I'm sure the regulars know who I speak of! I'm not going to tell you what to order, it's all good, so get what you normally like and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Also, I have found that the food tastes it's best during their busy times. I also really dig the disco lighting and the techno music they sometimes play. Not even kidding. Listen carefully, I think maybe this is on Friday nights."}
{"text":"I came here because Jersey Mike's closed at 9 but I'm glad I did!! Upon entering the restaurant the decor and lighting puts me in a mellow mood and the host was very nice. She assisted me right away and pulled out a seat at the bar while I reviewed the menu. She wasn't far away and actually went over the menu with me. She offered me water and I accepted. The food didn't take long and while I waited the manager came out to speak and we engaged in light conversation. I ordered the chow goon which was delish!!! I also ordered vegetable fried rice for my friend which he didn't enjoy as much (no seasoning) and actually ate half of my entree, exclaiming how jealous he was. I tasted it and he was not lying. But, I will definitely be back and the only reason this place didn't get five stars is only because of my guests underwhelming experience with his entree."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind Harpers, Baoding has a dark, modern decor which is inimate enough for two but accomodates a larger group as well with being too loud.

People who mention the greatservice are not joking - our waiter was on top of our glasses and needs the entire meal.

I ordered Spicy Pineapple Shrimp an asked that it be made extra spicy. What I got wasn't spicy enough for my tastes but it was absolutely delicious.

My friend got a chicken dish that was recommends by the waiter which was spicy and served in an adorable pot right there on our table. Heavy in lemongrass, he was also disapointed in the spicyness.

They would have gotten five stars had the dishes been extra spicy like we requested but I undrstand that most people don't like big heat :) next time I'll emphasize very very spicy an see what they can do with it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I was especially impressed because I normally do not enjoy Chinese food.  We had the pan Sears dumplings, wonton soup, 3 glass chicken (good if you like ginger) and the sesame chicken.  All four were tremendous!!! I can't wait to go back and try more.  This establishment definitely opened me up to trying more Chinese cuisine. also service and drinks were top notch.  The the sake tini if you dare."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food is hard to find and this place was average. The highlight of the dinner was crab Rangoon. Crispy on the outside with lots of filling. Great crunch to it. The Beijing duck is second best. Duck was not gamey at all. Very tender meat with crispy skin. Condiments were fresh as well. Shrimp chow fun was good. Wish there were more vegetables but still good. House special fried rice was not too salty. It was just right. Chicken lettuce wraps were nice and subtle. Seafood clay pot is worth skipping. Very bland  with no depth at all. Strawberry panna cotta had a weird texture with imitation strawberry flavoring. Tasted like medicine. I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I like the seafood tofu and 3 glass chicken. Pecking duck is also nice choice, but I personally don't like the wrap..too thick. Will be there repeatedly."}
{"text":"Went last night with a party of five. Had a reservation and table was waiting for us.  The food was good especially the chicken wonton soup. However, the service was another story. The food took a very long time to come out and one meal arrived about 5-10 minutes after the others. Plus, we had to ask for water a couple times.  We will return though. Chinese food options are few and our favorite Jo Jo in Stonecrest closed down."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Our server Mei who knows my wife was very courteous. Threw a  \"Hao, bu hao\", at her. The rest was phenomenal. I usually don't order Fried Rice, due to the high salt, and sauces. My wife ordered it and was very homemade, House Fried Rice which was just that, Fried Rice with Chicken, Pork, and Shrimp. Beware since this comes in Flintstone size portions! Seaweed salad(so original), and Chicken, Shrimp, Broccoli."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  We had the chilled cucumber appetizer and it was delicious!  Wife is a vegetarian and had the Eggplant in garlic sauce. Marked as spicy but wasn't (still tasted good).  The texture of the eggplant was a little off-putting (more like a cooked plantain).  I had the Asian steak which is really a pepper steak; good quality ingredients (scallions, onions & mushrooms) but mostly a one-note dish.  Spring rolls were good.  Sauces provided seemed off; weak mustard and a slight ketchup taste to the duck sauce. 

Will come back to try the hot and sour soup and edamame."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food in Charlotte, pretty upscale. BaoDing has the best Singapore Noodles in town in my opinion! Food can be pretty Americanized but still much better than some place like PF Chang's. Definitely have their traditional dishes on the menu. Always great service - especially Kelly!"}
{"text":"Pretty much every other day, I have a craving for Chinese food lol. We needed to refuel from the shopping and I found this place on yelp. The reviews didn't lie, this place was great. It is tucked away in a really nice strip mall. The decor in the inside reminds me of Vegas but it is nice.

I wasn't a fan of the veggie rolls. However, the potstickers appetizer was really good (pan fried). I got the General Tso Chicken, without the spice, since you can alway get spicy dishes without spice. It was really good!! I wish I had more rice on the side, but that is okay. The flavor was amazing!!!  

I was able to try the Chicken Lo Mein and the flavor was amazing!! To me, you never know how the Lo Mein noddles are going to be made, but the way they made their noodles were great. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in Charlotte. Highly recommend, yum!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent the night I visited with one of my BFs. Our water was refilled frequently, our waiter was great and in between servers would stop and ask if we needed anything, even a visit from the manager. We felt pampered.
I loved the warm Sake, and the waiter would come by whenever my cup got low and pour it out of the little china pitcher, so I didn't even have to do that :)
They have brown rice, which I so prefer. The Spring Rolls were excellent.
I really enjoyed the ambiance here. The ceiling treatment over the booths made you feel like you were in some exotic tent. The whole place was so pleasantly colorful, yet intimate.
I had the Chicken with Cashews, which had sautéed mushrooms in it as well. the seasoning was very different than the Cashew Chicken I've had other places. It was not as sweet and the flavor was more complex. It was fabulous, so I will probably be stuck on it for awhile before I'll try something else.
My BF had Singapore Rice Noodles, slightly spicy and nicely balanced with veggies. The portions were large enough for us to each take some home.
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Chinese in Charlotte.   Unfortunately, they let their manager  and some of their staff go AND changed what was a very good menu.  However, they will still make you about anything off menu.  Servers are friendly, food tasty."}
{"text":"This place is really not that shabby at all. Not 5 stars, but hey 4 is worthy. Here is why, this place actually puts effort into its interior decor, which stands out from the rest of Asian restaurants. It also has a very well stocked bar, you are after work one day and you are craving Asians but also want a nice mixed drink, they got you covered! I LOOOVE their pan fried flat noodle YUM YUM YUM, they didn't have a veggie option listed and I asked if I could have it with fried tofu, and BAM, it was done! 
The appetizers are also quite good, very nice flavors. My mom also came here for their lunch specials before and said they are quite unique. Instead of regular Chinese take out lunch this place has angel hair and tilapia type healthier, higher class food. HECK YES! What I also love is I don't end up smelling like Chinese food after I walk out of here, so not a worry if you need to return back to the office afterwards or continue on your nice date. They also have very nice lighting in here, not too bright, not too dark, just right to add in a little romantic kick. I love the way their booths are sectioned, it makes you feel like you are in your own little world with draperies over you, check it out guys! Not bad of a Chinese joint for Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I really like the inside of this restaurant & it's comfortable & cozy.  The food is consistent, but there are several things we like on the dinner menu that aren't on the lunch menu & that's a little frustrating because - well - because it's Chinese Food for pete's sake!  I will say that sometimes the waitstaff has been downright rude, but not always.  We walked out a few years ago when one guy just was a jerk, but we've gone back this year and the service is ok, but I still notice how the waiters are quick to either ignore you or give you a curt, slangy answer (nope - yeah - what).  It's just the men though, so maybe it's just a cultural thing?  I don't know.  In Southpark it's the only choice I know of."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I go very frequently and they know me on first name bases. 

Food is always freaking awesome!!! If you haven't been this is a must go. Vivian, May and Michael are wonderful!!!

Always excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"I saw the great reviews on Yelp and wanted to go here. This place is pretty close to southpark mall. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server was awesome as well as the other servers helping each other out. 

I started off with the chicken wonton soup. It's $3. There were 3 wontons in it. Broth was good and savory. Had fresh spinach in it. Wontons were good and juicy and complimented well with the broth. 

I got the house lo mein as my entree and was pretty surprised at how large the portion was. Noodles were delicious and it came with shrimp, chicken and pork. I added hot chili oil to it to spice it up. 

My husband got the asian chicken and added broccoli to it. He got a side of brown rice with it. Chicken was tender and the sauce had a good pepper flavor. He had a big portion as well. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was hot,the way I like it! I absolutely love their brown rice. Our server was attentive and expedient. We've been here several times and they have NEVER disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'll say that I had a marvelous experience here. Let me echo the previous notes on the service by saying mine was excellent. The wait staff are very polite and attended me well.

Tonight I ordered a hot tea, spring roll with shrimp and chicken, and the Ma Po tofu with brown rice. The roll was crispy and piping hot which I liked. The tofu was good - didn't think it was all that spicy (even though the menu indicates it's a spicy item). The atmosphere inside is urban/upscale, with jazz music playing in the background. Certainly not what I'm accustomed to in a Chinese restaurant but I enjoyed it. I plan to go back to try the Chinese eggplant - check it out if you're in the South Park area. Loved it."}
{"text":"Ordered from Baoding a couple weeks ago on a rainy week night. Haven't been to a Chinese restaurant in Southpark yet and decided to give this a try after a recommendation from a coworker. I ordered pick up and when I went to get our food the inside was cozy, with a mix of classic and trendy Asian decor. Tables were filled, but there were even more orders ready for pick-up customers.

I ordered the Singaporean rice noodles after trying to decipher a menu item from a picture I saw on Yelp. I was happy to find out I guessed right and ordered what I saw in the picture. The noodles were thin and long, the curry taste was not strong nor was the dish spicy. There were lots of veggies and plenty of chicken in the dish. I would have loved the meal even more if it came saturated with more sauce; it was a bit dry, but still flavorful and delicious. 

When I'm in need of a quick good Chinese meal, I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"This place is always great. I have not fined here in 15 years bout it still remains superb. Great quality service and food."}
{"text":"I went to this place wanting sesame chicken, and I got what I asked for the chicken was amazing. Best sesame chicken I've had. The food is good I would highly recommend you get the sesame chicken. The service is okay and the waiters don't speak to much English but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly I've turned so many locals on to this place! It's AWESOME! Don't be worried about so many in line at the front door but it's wise to make reservations! On a Thursday it was a 20-30 wait but we switched gears & ordered take out & were out the door in 15-20.  They are so kind & accommodating at the front desk! Eventually they will know you by name!!! 

I confess I mostly order the same thing every time but you'll find your favorites & call them your usual! For me & my family it's the pineapple fried rice with chicken & extra pineapple! Also we order chicken & broccoli with white sauce (they also have brown) & we add cashews! YUMMY! We sometimes order from here 3Xs a week.  If you're eating in the restaurant then order the green beans.  Crispy fried & hot on site! Go for it! 

Love the atmosphere it's great for get together a with friends & families or don't worry if you're only one, sit at the bar!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Chinese food in Charlotte. This place has awesome General Tso chicken! We also got the duck, which wasn't bad but want that great either ( you don't get a lot and it was crispy/dry). Other than that the ambience is nice and the service is very good."}
{"text":"This has been a go to Chinese for a long time for our family. They have changed the menu since our last visit and we enjoyed the new format. Our three entrees were very well done. I had an Egg foo yung a dish I loved as a teenager, lots of shrimp and chicken, great egg, and rich gravy."}
{"text":"I came to this place on an early Sunday afternoon and it was packed already!!! Good sign!  I was happy to see they have vegetable egg rolls on the menu...NOT spring rolls...I can't stand when people don't understand the difference. 

I ordered my standard lo mein and it was a huge portion size, that I mostly finished! Lol.  I LOVE noodles.  It had a good flavor and I was pleased with it.  The egg roll wasn't my favorite...it was a little mushy, but I would try it again. 

The restaurant is pretty big, well decorated, and the service is good.  I was happy with my lunch and full!"}
{"text":"Ok I can finally say there is some great Chinese food out here in Charlotte!  So far from what I've tried, this is THE BEST CHINESE here.  We went for lunch and ordered the chicken wonton soup...a must have as it was delicious.  We also ordered shrimp & chicken with garlic sauce, as well as shrimp & chicken with cashew nuts.  Both dishes were absolutely flavorful.  And don't forget the veggie spring rolls, a great compliment to your meal!  We absolutely will be back, this is our one & only spot for our Chinese fix!"}
{"text":"The Thai curry dish and the Singapore rice noodles are my favorite. Great food, mostly consistent. This is my go-to Chinese restaurant in South Park. Highly recommended. Good restaurant for takeout as food is usually ready within 15 to 20 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurants I have ate at... 
Everything was wonderful. The wait staff were super nice.  Atmosphere was pleasant"}
{"text":"Upscale Chinese restaurant that uses fresh ingredients. They have the typical  Chinese dishes. 

Everything in the menu is good. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, skip this place. 

If you are on a meeting, or trying to impress a person used to Americanized chinese then this is your place."}
{"text":"I went to the Chinese restaurant Baoding today for lunch.  A restaurant that I have not been to in a long while...I think it has been at least 4 years.  The quality and service is still as good now as it was then.  

Atmosphere - Modern and clean with Chinese murals and a mirrored wall to one side giving the place a nice sense of spaciousness.

Service - Well dressed (white dress shirts & black pants) wait staff attend to your needs while a manager roves the area to validate everything is as it should be.  The wait staff was very accommodating to meal modifications and presented the food as ordered.   

Food - I ordered a modified Chef Jack's Special, New T Chicken.  I modified it by changing the chicken from lightly breaded to no breading and asking for the brown sauce on the side.  It was tasty, but could be a little spicier for my liking.  The dish did come with a veggie roll and I like the fact that I was able to get brown rice instead of white steamed rice.  

Price - The lunchtime price was just $6.95.  A great deal for the quality!

Overall - Why did I wait 4yrs to come back?  Well, I live north of the city and forgot all about this place.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took the family last night because many neighbors had suggested it for a meal. 

OK food, not too exceptional. Nice ambiance and service level was acceptable. 

Nothing about this restaurant made think \"I am glad I came here tonight\" Expensive food with medium taste profile. Not to return, I am afraid. 

We tried a sampling of spring role, velvet corn and chicken soup, fried crab won-tons, Asian beef & chicken, ginger shrimp, and pineapple chicken fried rice. 

8 shrimp for $15+. Really enjoyed the Asian beef & chicken - good flavor. Crab won-tons tasted like only cream cheese and no crab. Velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper."}
{"text":"All of the food here was really good! Not only that but the interior is very nicely decorated and the staff is extremely friendly! By them noticing the birthday on an ID, we got a free birthday cake slice! What a great evening."}
{"text":"The food here is crazy good. I am a sucker for the pineapple chicken  fried rice served in a hollowed out pineapple."}
{"text":"Finally a good Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!  Baoding was a breath of fresh air compared to the crapt restaurants that we've been used to.  The food was fresh, homemade and full of flavor.  The service was amazing...I was asked if I needed a refill at least 4 times even though I didn't need it!   We started with the  crag Rangoon and wonton soup, then had the pork dumplings, hunan shrimp and garlic chicken.  The garlic chicken stole the show, packed full of flavor.  The hunan shrimp was very good and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  The garlic chicken was even better, packed full of flavor, and very tender.  I was overall very happy to find a Chinese restaurant that I enjoyed eating at here in Southpark."}
{"text":"Had not been here for several years, and my previous recollection was that its appearance was attractive but food overpriced and above average but not great.  Tonight's meal with friends changed my thinking. 

Food and service were excellent!  Appetizers included fried dumplings and lightly fried green beans, both very good. One of the main courses was Peking (Bejiing) duck. It was fabulous- best I've ever had, including what I've had in expensive New York City restaurants. Well-cooked, very crispy and served with scallions, hoisin sauce, and thin wrappers. Only $20- I'd say a very good value. Another main course that was delicious was shredded beef with szechuan sauce. 

Will definitely return and am adding Baoding to my list of favorites. Need to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in the city.  They also have the friendliest staff.  I highly recommend the Szechuan chicken and the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"On my continued hunt to find the best Chinese in Charlotte, I decided to check out Baoding this past Sunday night, after not visiting for more than 10 years.
Upon arriving we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and saw that almost every table was full, that is a good sign!

We started with spring rolls and wonton soup. The spring rolls were light, fresh and deep fried to perfection, and served with a great dipping sauce. As for the wonton soup, one of the best of have had. The broth had an amazing flavor and came with three chicken stuffed wontons, spinach and thinly sliced eggs.

As for the entrees, we ordered the Beijing Duck, duck served with plum sauce, cucumbers, scallions and thin light pancakes, and Chicken and Shrimp with mixed vegetables in a brown sauce.
the Chicken and Shrimp was a large portion, allowing me to have left-overs Monday night, and was delicious. They do not skimp on the protein. As for the veggies, too many I cannot even recall, but they were cooked to perfection.
As for the duck, I am not a huge duck fan, but I did make one pancake and enjoyed it very much. The plum sauce gives the duck a nice flavor and the meal is definitely something I recommend checking out, especially if you like duck.

Throughout the meal, the service did not disappoint.  Baoding is definitely a go to Chinese spot in my mind!"}
{"text":"Great food and good location makes this chinese restaurant one of my top pick in the area"}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood special under \"Chef Specialties\" Was supposed to have shrimp, scallops & crab. Guess what? NO CRAB. Manager explains they took it out because people didn't like the fake crab meat. Well don't advertise as real crab & take it off the menu!!!!! The manager didn't offer anything. It would have been nice if they had told me this before I ordered. The noodles were soggy as well... This place put me in a BAD mood & I will never, I mean never go here again!"}
{"text":"We were searching for a nice Chinese food restaurant where we could sit down and eat (PF Chang's doesn't count), and were pleasantly surprised by Baoding.  The restaurant has a nice and calming ambiance/decor.  The servers are very attentive and pleasant as well.  

We got the pan fried chicken dumplings for an appetizer.  They were good quality, but kind of boring tasting.  For the entree, we got plane lo mien noodles and General Tso's chicken.  The lo mein noodles were great, and the chicken was even better.  The chicken was extremely tender and crispy, not chewy and weird like at some Chinese food places.  And, for some reason, I didn't feel horrible after eating it....so that's a nice surprise.

We definitely look forward to coming back here again for a nice relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"After much anticipation, I finally made it out to Baoding...for lunch.

I had the chef's special: Szechuan shrimp, chicken and beef with brown rice. It wasn't horrible, but it was bland. Very bland. I expected spicy as the description stated, but its about as spicy as a spicy chicken from Wendys. The baby corn in the dish tastes like it was just taken out of it's soaking liquid (or can) and thrown right in without being drained. It tasted very watery and has not absorbed any flavor from the gravy (and yes I know the corn won't absorb much flavor at all).

Since this restaurant is highly praised, I just going to have to come back another time. Maybe for dinner and I'll just hope they won't disappoint me then too.  

On the plus side though, my fortune says, \"You will inherit money and jewelry.\" Wait a second, hmm.... inherit? That isn't necessarily a good thing is it?"}
{"text":"Came here for New Years dinner after sightseeing Charlotte. We didn't have a reservation because we are homebodies who never go out to eat on New Year's Eve and we thought most people were like us. We were wrong, the place was packed! There were plenty of 30 something hipster couples, men with bow ties and loafers and women with enough sequins on their dresses blind anyone sitting within a 10 foot radius...apparently it's a trendy place to eat.

Our server May ( she said May with a Y not E) was super friendly and couldn't have been more courteous. She was very warm and attentive to our needs. Actually everyone from the owner was very attentive. One of the members of our party is wheelchair bound and they accommodated us without a hitch even when we didn't have reservations. A nice gentlemen, I believe the owner came over several times to make sure we were comfortable. Nothing but stellar customer service!

Food: The food was delicious! Everything was amazing, from the jasmine tea to the main entrees, the rice was extra fluffy...loved our meal!

We were shocked at how affordable it was! For such good caliber food..going into the city (NYC) for dinner would have easily cost us more than double the bill.

This is our new favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. Thank you for a delicious meal and wonderful service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to Chinese food and this is one of two Chinese restaurants I will go to because of the freshness and quality of the food.

This particular night, I made a reservation for my dinner group. When I called a day in advance they said their private room was already booked but they could seat us in the dining room. When we arrived we were seated in the private room so Thank you for that! It made conversation much easier.

Baoding has a broad menu with options including szechuan, kong pao, garlic, tangerine, vegetarian, steamed and so much more. I started out with their hot and sour soup with had a nice peppery flavor without being overly spicy and I ordered the garlic chicken (extra spicy). Ok so Chinese restaurants don't do spicy well but thy did bring out chili sauce so I could add my own. The flavors were good, chicken was tender and I wasn't hungry 2 hours later! 

The service was excellent. The staff was very accommodating and everyone in our group seemed to enjoy their meals.

Thank you Baoding!"}
{"text":"My expectations for this place were high. But I should have just walked in with the assumption that it is just like any other Chinese food carryout but with a more fancy front.

The customer service here is impeccable. A++++ for sure. They are very kind and courteous here. 

Wh

Basil Rolls: I paid $6 for two rolls. Highly disappointed. 1/5. It was literally a little rice noodle, lettuce and basil. OVERPRICED and no flavor.

Crab Wonton: I mean it is cream cheese with imitation crab in a wonton wrapper. Same as you get any other Chinese place. It is hard to mess these up. 4/5

Shrimp Steamer: It was okay. I wanted a healthy option so I did forgo the sauce that they give you on the side. Tons of veggies, not so much shrimp. There were approximately 6 pieces of shrimp. For the price I paid - my expectations were that I would get more that. 3/5

Shrimp Chow Fun: This was definitely the best dish of all but Chow fun is one of my favorite Chinese dishes. The wide rice noodles with a sweet soy base. So simple and delicious. 5/5

Overall the food for me differs none than other small delivery/carry out Chinese food place. So I wouldn't venture back as it is out of the way for me."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I ate at in Charlotte 15 yrs ago. My new friends took me here and I've been going back since. I get the \"Shredded Szechuan Beef\" almost every time. It's a dinner item, but you can order it at lunch. The spring rolls are great as well as the fried crab stuffed wonton appetizer- my new favorite. I often have a business lunch here (reasonably priced lunch specials) and my wife and kids like it as well."}
