{"text":"The Green room has been open in Scarborough now for over 5 years.  It is a michelen star restaurant and specially opened on Monday for my cousin's surprise birthday last night.  The setting was amazing, the food was of the highest standard and the price reflected the standard.  If you want budget, go Florios. If you are looking to have an amazing meal and spend a little more, go to the Green Room.  I had Fishcakes for the main meal and Bailey's cheesecake for Desert.  WOW!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, great ambiance, friendly staff. Fantastic food. Can not wait to visit again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was working in Scarborough and the promoter who booked me took me here for a pre-gig dinner. Although it was a flying visit, I was highly impressed with the ambience, food, staff, service, decor and pretty much everything. A wonderful, wonderful restaurant with fine locally sourced food and highly attentive staff. I really hope I can return for a more relaxed and indulgent visit."}
