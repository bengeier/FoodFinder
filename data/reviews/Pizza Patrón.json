{"text":"Pizza is good but Wow second time ordering here and always get my order wrong and I always repeat my order twice! Having to wait another 15 minutes"}
{"text":"One star for the price. Cheap pizza that has no flavor and no pizza sauce. If you want a good, cheap pizza, go to Little Caesars and pay the extra $1 plus tax. Only reason I have gone back 4 times was to see if this place was consistently bad before I wrote a review. It is bad. I've even tried a different store. I will never go back again and I would never recommend unless a person is starving and can't afford the extra dollar at another pizza place or go to McDonald's and order off the dollar menu."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza! Not a bad price at all. We got 3 large pepperoni pizzas for about $12. Cashier was polite and food was served very fast."}
