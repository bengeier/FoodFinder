{"text":"We always get the thin crust pizza with sausage, pepperoni and green  peppers. We can always count on Nellos to provide consistency. The food is great ! The sausage is the best, it is fresh, crumbly and flavorful. Not store bought tubes or rolls.the best thin crust in town!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch or dinner.  The salids are a standout and the pizza does not disapoint."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nello's for over 25 years at their various locations all over the Valley. The Scottsdale location on Shea, however, has been my go-to destination for some time now since I relocated nearby. I love the food and the company at this location. The quality of food and service combines the vibe of a family pizzeria, neighborhood bar, and specialty food shop. The pizza rivals, if not beats,  the likes of Chicago, New York and LA pizza spots. The rest of the menu is delightful as well. Often, I head over to Nello's just to grab a drink (specially-curated wine and beer selection) and hangout with the staff and owners. They truly make you feel like family while serving up awesome eats. Must try."}
{"text":"Authentic street signs!  The guys working here seem like tough south side guys which is sort of weird but thats alright. Still... I've got news for ya. The pizza isn't even close. We can say it's the water or whatever but they even call a pizza \"the UNO\" and it's a pizza hut special on a bad day. Not even close.  Skimpy crumbled sausage as opposed to patty and a nothing crust. The advertising might fool ya to come there once thinking it's chi style but you won't come back.  

I'm not saying that its the worst pizza ever, because its not.  But it certainly isnt Chicago style and its simply mediocre mid-size crust pizza."}
{"text":"Had the meatball sandwich, I think they need to rename it the mushball sandwich the meatballs fell apart rendering it to a inedible mush gosh. The bread should have been toasted more as well. 
I think grandma forgot to write down the recipe right. She obviously forgot the eggs and breadcrumbs. Also the silverware was cheap and flimsy, I bent the fork and knife trying to cut the chewy doughy bread.
Although the service was great and atmosphere pleasant. Other options for Italian food are out there."}
{"text":"My daughter was adamant that she wanted Nello's pizza for her 16th bday party. I ordered 12 pizzas. They were ready on time and fresh out of the oven. Many of the guests commented on how good the pizza was - thank you Nellos!!!"}
{"text":"ok. i went here specifically for the pizza. i've been on a mission for 25 years to find the best pizza in arizona. i want a pizza that's going to taste similar to back east, and not fake, boring pizza. this place is in old scottsdale. the restaurant is fairly small but cozy, cute, and has a bar and a few plasmas. the pizza was very, very good. it had quality cheese, quality italian sausage,  authentic rich tasting sauce, nice crust, and overall great flavor. the very best? no. one of the best, definitely yes. i would rank this 3rd best pizza i've had in arizona. a great place to go. they have a full menu of pasta, sandwiches, burgers and appetizers."}
{"text":"What a great family style pizzeria. There was nothing they served us that was not surprisingly tasty. The stuffed mushrooms are a must try. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the classic crust is the one you want in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had their lasagna with meat sauce the sauce was very good who was I knew it was one of the better ones I've had recently I definitely would recommend and go back to it again. Didn't get to taste the pizza I did look at the pizza on some tables,  being from Chicago I'm not sure if I would go there to get pizza but I surely would go for the other food.

Went back a second time had what they  call Bella pasta, it's a combination of white cream sauce and marinara sauce on penny plasti it was good. If you ain't here try to get Brooke as your server she's great. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Start out with the cheesey garlic bread topped with fresh tomatoes. Grandmas homemade sausage recipe is one of a kind. Order the Numero Uno, you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Nello's is an excellent place to just kick back and relax especially on Art Walk night or in the midst of similar activities in old town Scottsdale, they also offer the lure of live music on Tuesday and Saturday nights. 

My favorite appetizer pizza combo thus far is the eggplant bruschetta and the pizza rustica with a small river of Kilt Lifter steadily flowing to my table. The pizza is thoughtfully done, always tasty, and the ingredients always seem to be very fresh. 

While I've been pleased with their desserts I would rather walk to the Sugar Bowl next door and hazard 10,000 ankle biters to get a good old fashioned ice cream sundae or banana split.

{"text":"luuuuvvv, the food, service & ginny. 
ginny rocks~the service rocks & the 
food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza is FANTASTIC and I love the SALAD DRESSING!!!

Nello's has been a favorite for years and they never fail to deliever what has made them famous!!"}
{"text":"Shopping - I hate it. Except for the PGA Superstore - but that is another review.  Anyway, we were hungry, so we decided a pizza sounded good. Nello's is in the same shopping center, so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer.  

The inside is neat, clean, and boring.  But we were there to eat pizza, so my wife had a spinach salad, and we shared a Grand Deluxe Pizza (pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions, black olives & mushrooms). And, of course, beer.

The service was excellent - we were immediately seated and a server appeared immediately to take our drink orders; brought them right back, and took our order. And it was only a short wait for the food.

My wife really enjoyed the spinach salad; and the pizza toppings were above average.  They pride themselves on their crust, which I found was better than average.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I found the sauce rather bland.

Pizza is really a matter of individual taste, so others may like the pizza much better than I did.  I will certainly come here again, and maybe upgrade my stars if the sauce is a little spicier."}
{"text":"Nello's is conveniently located right down the road from my work, along with a ton of other pizza options but I've already tried all of those so I figured I'd give Nello's a shot. I ordered for pick up and the girl on the phone was very courteous, upon arriving to grab my pizza the inside decor was friendly inside. The pizza was mediocre overall. I did enjoy the crust which is huge for me, but the sauce was very bland . My toppings consisted of sausage, jalapenos, and green peppers. Good toppings! Unfortunately that and the crust was the only thing that got me through the few slices I ate due to the disappointing sauce. I will give them a try again in the future because based on the reviews it seems very hit and miss. Hoping for a more well rounded pizza next time."}
{"text":"I like the pizza but it is a little too deep dish for me.  The real score here is the clams and mussels appetizer that costs 10 bucks.  You can't get more clams and mussels for 10 bucks anywhere in this city.  I just get that and a side salad and I am set.  Please never take that off the menu."}
{"text":"Love your pizza but the service is BAD.  Management needs to keep an eye on the service.  There are a thousand pizza places in the valley and when dining in service is important."}
{"text":"Obviously the pizza is good, but their wings are amazing! Cool atmosphere and customer service. A tad bit pricy, but overall great food. We'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Walked into this place while visiting for Spring Training.  It was open late (plus) and it was casual (plus, because I wasn't all kitted out like the rest of Scottsdale!).  Boyfriend was pleased by the beer prices.  I liked our Sante Fe pizza--  It was quite light for a deep dish.  It wasn't super oily or soaked in cheese.  However, it wasn't a pizza I would totally crave.  We also had the caprese salad which was ok but the sundried tomato dressing was really good.  Service was a little chilly, but the bartender seemed to be having a very good time!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4-1/2 stars.

We were on our way out of Scottsdale, and stopped by this area in oldtown Scottsdale.  No idea how good the food would be, but were pleasantly surprised.

Champagne salad - the carmalized walnuts were really good in this salad.

Crab stuffed mushrooms - one of the best mushroom dishes I've ever had!  the mushrooms with crab stuffing is very flavorful, but they also put it in a plate with their marinara sauce and melt cheese over it, which surprised us, but the sauce was superb.  Great balance of sour and sweetness with the marinara sauce (I prefer a sweeter marinara as some are just really sour).

BBQ chicken pizza - not too bad.  the bbq sauce was a bit too sour for my taste, but a good pizza overall.

This place was a great surprise for us.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally a parent-friendly place where I can bring my new main squeeze to plan and debate pizza ingredients like everyone's negotiating my dowry. 

Yeah, the massive salad with everything in it w/ homemade sun dried tomato dressing was divine, and thank goodness for the affordable beer flight sampler while we devoured 2 amazing thin crust pizzas + limoncello tiramisu (details: a build your own meat version my main squeeze \"construction managed\" with my dad, and an \"every vegetable under the sun\" version with my mom) -- sure, that was nice, BUT, most importantly, 

...the parents offered spring training Dbacks tix and inquired when \"we'd all have another great dinner together...\"

Thanks a lot, Nello's. Now I gotta maintain this spring fling after the love chemicals fade... 

But it looks like our love chemicals will never fade when it comes to you!

Thank you to the pregnant waitress who put up with the dad/bf showdown and especially to the owner/mgr who didn't push us out as the last ones there, only inquired as to whether we enjoyed our pizza.

If only I could get this late night delivered every day of the week... I'd be fat ;P"}
{"text":"Just picked up a 7\" pepperoni pizza after seeing Nello's on Check Please Arizona on PBS.  The gentleman behind the counter at Nello's opened the VERY small box to reveal a VERY small pizza.  I said nothing about the size since it is a 7\" pizza and it was just for me since I was trying it out for the family.  As I stared at it, he said:  the pepperoni is under the cheese.  He read my mind,  \"Where the heck was the pepperoni?\"  As I ate the first slice it took quite a bit to find a VERY, VERY thin slice of pepperoni.  Not happy.  The second slice had a thin slice of pepperoni that was visible and which I could taste.  Had a good taste but not enough to be called  a pepperoni pizza.  I paid $7.38 for this tiny pizza with virtually no pepperoni and frankly I am embarrassed at myself for being misled by a TV program and for paying such a premium price for a morsel of pizza.  
 The next time that I buy a pizza with pepperoni, I will check to make sure it has enough pepperoni to be called a pepperoni pizza. I don't want to have to hire a search party to find the pepperoni in my next pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the Seafood pizza and it was not good. It's deep dish style pizza, but the toppings were not to par. My sister and I thought the crab was real crabmeat. But maybe to other people they don't care, but if it says crab i'd expect crab. If it's imitation crab, it needs to state that. There's a big difference in the two. And what we got was imitation crab. We were disappointed to say the least. It was quite greasy because they had lots and lots of cheese and not so much topping. Our waitress was pretty nice though. But I'd want to try the numerous pizza places before coming back here."}
{"text":"To all the goat cheese lovers out there, I have 2 words for you.... PIZZA RUSTICA.  It's to die for, with roasted red peppers, mushrooms, olive oil, mozzarella and goat cheese. I ordered the 7\" with the original pan crust, it was rich, creamy and full of flavor.  It's THE best pizza I've had in the valley. Fuh gedd abou da pizza joint with the fancy yellow box,  bada-bing, bada-boom, Nello's is da place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Nello's but I have never been to this location.  I went on a lunch break with a group of people, and the service was slow (even though the restaurant was not that busy).  It took awhile to get our food, which we ended up taking to go because of the wait.  

As far as the food goes, I love their honey mustard salad dressing, and their salads are crisp, fresh, and the croutons were delicious! However, I wasn't impressed with the chicken parm sandwich, the chicken was tough and I ended up picking it off and eating the rest.  

I may or may not come back to this location.  I only would if I had enough time to sit and wait for service...the service was very disappointing and I would hope the managers address this."}
{"text":"Nello's is one of my favorite to go for drinks and appetizers after work. I just went again, tonight, and remembered how much I love it. The setting is nice, the bartender is awesome, the food is good and the wine list is pretty good, too.
My coworkers and I generally head to the Tempe Nello's for happy hour, simply because it's the only place we've found between all of our apartments. But the ambiance there is much more \"kid-friendly, chucky-cheese.\" The Scottsdale Nello's has live jazz and mood lighting.. much cooler.
I like the eggplant bruschetta as an appetizer, as well as the tortellini salad. My three girlfriends and I always split one of each, and the sizes are perfect for four of us..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with friends/tourists for spring training baseball last week. I am giving this place 4 stars for the family atmosphere, staff was great without about 12 people, beer selection was good, and food was better than average. Friendly, family place, and we could even park in their tiny lot next door in downtown S'Dale! I'd go back."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a salad. We think he forgot. Our chicken parmesan arrived obviously microwaved. Food was indelible. We did not see a manager to express our displeasure."}
{"text":"Love the spinach salad and pizza, if you like deep dish, here is pretty darn good regardless of which ever one you choose."}
{"text":"I love this place, I mean I really love this place but there are two or three other locations in the valley that don't post anti gun signs. I personally don't feel safe in a restaurant or a department store that doesn't allow gun owners that have the legal right to carry a gun enter their place of business.  After the shooting in Colorado, San Bernardino and Las Vegas I feel we need to protect ourself and our family and I choose not to do business where I don't feel safe. 

If you don't mind the fact that this place \"post\" this type of signs then go and check out the menu because the food is great! I'm sorry for the negative review but I feel that if you post a sign like that most respected gun owners will follow your rules but that simply means that a dangerous person with bad intentions may not. That to me is very scary. Please let me know if you ever decide to change your rules and remove your negative signs."}
{"text":"I hear all the time from people how great this place is. When you walk in the place it feels cookie cutterish, nothing stands out.  If getting the stuff pizza and have to wait 40 minutes it begins to play apart of the overall experience. 

The Wait staff was very friendly, they do a great job there.  The night I went in with my kids, our waitress did a great job taking care of them. 

I tried the stuff pizza. It came to the table looking delicious.  After the first bite or two I was disappointed in the flavor.  It lacked the big taste I thought it would have with the sauce on top. The dough also was lacking.  
The cheese was plenty and good but could not make up for the overall taste.

I might be hard on them but I love pizza.  I would go back for another try but would not be my first thought."}
{"text":"Maybe we hit it on an off night but we will never be coming back here again. Very mediocre service. The restaurant only had a handful of people there and it was slow. The chicken penne with pesto sauce was bland, tasteless and the chicken was rubbery. The eggplant sandwich was below average at best....We ordered a sandwich to go and it took way too long for what we got. I see all the great reviews which leads me to believe that we hit it on a bad night but wow...it was bad. I am disappointed because I really looked forward to trying this."}
{"text":"The pizza is good if you prefer to have a lot of dough and a little bit of toppings! Not what I expected! Maybe their pasta is better! I'm not sure what the hype is about this place! Go to Vitos if you want really good pizza!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on glowing reviews from a native, however, after the hype I was pretty disappointed.  The service was really great, but I wanted a tasty pizza, and this pizza was not tasty.  Maybe I am spoiled coming from the East Coast(great pizza), and then living in Chicago(mecca of pizza).  The crust was so blah and the sauce had no flavor."}
{"text":"While in Arizona my girls and I love our comfort food which is pizza!! We are never disappointed when we go to Nello's pizza. They have some of the best pizza, cheese bread and salad I have ever tasted!!!  The restaurant was clean and inviting. The employees were friendly, helpful and always had smiles.."}
{"text":"Nello's has been in the Phoenix pizza business for some thirty years. Their deep dish Chicago style pie is as good as the originals in the \"Windy City\". TERRIFIC SPOT !!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for a slice and my favorite place in old town was closed.  So, we'd been meaning to try Nello's anyway so we went in.  

We ordered the 14\" Numero Uno, which is homemade sausage with mushrooms, pan crust.  It looked great and it smelled great, and it had a great cheese coating, so imagine my surprise when I bite into it and find that its very bland.  The crust was good.  I can taste the cheese..  I tried putting a ton of red pepper flakes on top and then parmegan cheese, but it didn't help much at all.  

Very interesting.  I kept eating it trying to figure out the problem.  I've had mushroom on pizza before by itself and it didn't taste like this.  The crust is ok, not undercooked although it kind of tastes similar to undercooked dough.  I think it might possibly be not enough sauce.  I'm still not sure...  But I will stick to Best of Italy, thank you very much."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at the Nello's on 48th st and Warner in Awhatukee, so I was pretty interested in trying this location out.  They are all owned individually so I expected it to be a little bit different which it was.  Still good, but I think I like some of the selections of the other Nello's better.  Not that big of a deal because I have already been here twice over the last 2 weeks, but I liked the soup of the day and the panini's they had at the one in Awhatukee.  Still a great place!"}
{"text":"Nell's has been one of our favs for years. However, Sat Night the manager/owner, not sure was sooo rude.  I felt sorry for the servers he was mean to them.  Very uptight & stressed out.  We pulled a chair up to our booth & he scolded us & we had to move to a larger table.  It was so weird, he made us & our server feel like we might do something wrong, he was just waiting for someone to break the rules. Why are you managing a public place if you don't like people?? Food is always great thankfully."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a nellos pizza when I'm on the go!  The last time I went the service was a little slow which wasn't ideal. Of course I will go back but am hopeful I won't have to wait as long."}
{"text":"This is a decent enough place, but not something I'd go out of my way for.

I ordered the pesto penne with chicken dish. First out was the salad, but only about a minute before the entree - there seemed to be some confusion somewhere in the kitchen, so I think the timing of my salad was a victim of that. But no big deal.

The pasta dish was okay. It may have been a little light on the pesto - there wasn't much green on or in it at all. The chicken was breaded a little differently than I'm used to - not bad, but I think it would have been better if it was flavored with something a little more distinct instead of a generic dark breading.

I ordered a cannoli for dessert. This was pretty decent - not my favorite cannoli in town, but it had all the right stuff."}
{"text":"We've been going to Nello's Pizza, at multiple locations, for years yet I've never written a review about them.  My wife actually began going to the original Phoenix Nello's decades ago when she lived in an apartment complex adjacent to it.  Subsequently we went to the Tempe Nello's for about 5 years and the Scottsdale Nello's ever since.

In short, they have absolutely fabulous pizza, probably some of the best pizza I've ever had - and I've lived in Chicago and New York City.  I won't go into details about their pizza but we've had probably all of them.  You can refer to a video segment on \"Check Please! Arizona (which is specifically about their Mesa location).\"

We always begin with appetizers and a salad.  All there salads are excellent but we frequently fallback on their Antipasto Salad.  We're not big fans of their \"house\" dressing, but that's OK because they bring the dressings on the side so you can add as little or as much as you like.  We always order 2 different dressings because my wife and I have different wants.  My wife is a huge fan of the Peperoni Rolls Appetizer, which is good but I'm tired of it because she always wins and we end up getting it.  I'd love to try all their other appetizers but I'd have to deal with my wife first - something I'm not about to do.

In the past several years we've decided to \"live dangerously\" and have tried many of their other offerings, including sandwiches (I love their Italian Beef and their Meatball) and entrees.  All there pasta entrees are wonderful.
In all the times we've been there I've only had a couple bites of their Cheesecake (while with another couple) which is also terrific.  However following their meals I'm always full.

This is one of our \"go-to\" places.

As we understand it the Nello's Pizza locations are all owned by brothers.  Their father owned a very well established Italian restaurant in Chicago, one of the brothers came out to visit Phoenix decades ago, fell in love with Phoenix and moved here.  His brothers followed and now they all own their own location.  I don't know that their menus are all identical but I'm told they are all very similar.

A wonderful restaurant with great food; the Scottsdale location has had the same wait staff for years and they are always friendly.  We love this place."}
{"text":"It was our last evening in Scottsdale and we were sick of the turrible Mexican food.  We stumbled across this place in old town Scottsdale and it was everything we were looking for - reasonable prices, no wait, and food you can't go wrong with.  We ordered the pan pizza with a few toppings, side salad, and 2 beers.  Our total came out to about $30!  
I don't remember our waitresses name but she was super sweet, friendly, and fast.  
You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love Nello's.  I miss it so much, as I moved from Scottsdale a couple years back.  My favorite meal there was to start with an Individual Dinner Salad with their house dressing, followed up by the 7-inch Margherita Pizza.  I love their Margherita so much more than just about any other restaurant I've tried.  They use a really nice San Marzano tomato, rather than just slices of roma tomatoes.  Just the right amount of cheese and basil, all on a chewy yet crispy crust.  So tasty, so simple."}
{"text":"Ya know - I could see this place being very inconsistent and I was there on a ho hum day.   The wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad, they have a weird assortment of imported beers, and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor.  We order a PESTO chicken pizza and we had to bite around on each piece to find the pesto, no flavor, a bit dry and the pizza was really late and warm - late and warm which means =  sat there for a while.  Our waitress was nice, cute, fun but hey that only gets you 2 stars.   The salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good. - Thats all folks.!!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni rolls here are awesome! You get six 2\" diameter rolls here with dipping sauce for $6.49 so they are a little expensive but they are well worth it. They also have Woodchuck hard cider on tap which is very good as well. Their deep dish pizza is OK. It would be better if they cut the huge chunks of sausage up into a little smaller pieces so it could be spread across the pizza more evenly. I have not tried their thin crust pizza or other menu items at all. Last time I was there to pick up a to-go order of the pepperoni rolls, the person waiting on me was very friendly and took the time to describe the various dipping sauce options and the available drinks they had."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Pizza I have ever had. I had to go to Nello's after hearing my boss rave about it. I went on a Saturday night; the place was about 20% full. I ordered a sausage, onion and greenpepper thin crust. My first clue that this experience was taking a turn for the worse was when the pizza arrived with the toppings on top of the cheese. Maybe that's why there was no taste. Not even the seasoned pepper's flakes could bring this pie to life. The sausage was nasty. In summary, Nello's was brutal."}
{"text":"I've loved Nello's since I can remember!  I love being able to build my own pizza! Excellent sauce!"}
{"text":"My friend who's a native phoenician took me here after he got off work and it's one of his favorite pizza places. It's actualy a really classy looking italian restaurant and their specialties are pizza and calzones. They had a cool bar area with widescreen tvs to watch sports that you could still see in the dining area. The place is kinda noisy but it created more of a fun atmosphere. Business people came for drinks after work, and families hosted birthday parties for their kids. For our starters, we got the crab stuffed mushrooms, mozarella platter and bruschetta. They were all very tasty! I esp liked the mushrooms and bruschetta. Then we shared a spinach salad which i liked bc it had bacon and tomatoes and the dressing they used was really good. He had a calzone ( i can't remember what kind) and it looked really good, lots of gooey cheese coming out of the pizza shell. I had a half margherita/half bbq chicken pizza and they were both good. The crust was really crunchy and the pizza itself had all the right flavors. It's definitely a fun place to eat if you're hanging out with your buddies =)"}
{"text":"I was elated when I saw the new Nellos go up in Old Town.  If you like Nellos anywhere else in the valley and havent been to OT, race your pretty little face over there tonight.  For salad.   I too am not a huge fan of their pizza and I cant put my finger on exactly why but I think it has something to do with the sauce...  Just not what I get excited about.  But the upgraded garlic bread with cheese and tomatos paired with their amazing and very generous spinach salad...now there is a food worthy of blowing your diet over.  The atmosphere at this location in particular is better than the others, plus its in Old Town so less screaming children means more happy hour fun for you and me.  Rumor has it they have live music there sometimes too.  Parkings a bitch at high traffic hours but isnt it at any OT hotspot?  Get over it or road trip it up to Shea or down to Tempe for other fine locations."}
{"text":"Was stoked to try this pizza because it seems to have several good reviews.  However, the sausage and mushroom thin crust I had was mediocre at best.  Very bland, not much flavor."}
{"text":"We do not come here often, this is the kind of place we stop by when we are already nearby and think pizza is a good idea. The pizza is usually very good and that is what we always end up having. Service is usually from OK to good, and this (March 31) time was a little odd, the place was not busy and the service was not bad but not friendly either..."}
{"text":"Best Pizza since I've moved to Scottsdale from St. Louis. We get carry out all the time"}
{"text":"I met up with my parents at Nello's last night for dinner. The hostess was very sweet and sat us right away. It was a little chilly inside and we have no issue when we asked to be moved outside. We had the patio to ourselves, which was nice. We ordered a 12 inch thin crust pizza and it was pretty good. I loved the square slices- so much easier to eat. My only critique about Nello's was that the server was a bit slow when it came to refilling our cokes and getting/giving back our checks. It was crowded inside so it wasn't a big deal but my mother had to go in and ask for a refill herself. None the less- we will go back to Nello's in the future and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My favorite is the thin crust deluxe combo pizza.  A definite must!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 7:30pm and ordered a salad and a large pizza and same with our friends and we did not get our pizza until 8:45pm! The service was unacceptable, and did I mention that there were only 3 couples in the restaurant!!! Never again will we be going to the restaurant! Poor service!"}
{"text":"best thin crust pizza i've had in the phoenix. great variety of toppings - including goat cheese. sausage, goat cheese and onion - best pizza combo around."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff, beautiful artwork on the walls, delicious food. 

We had the hot wings and the garlic bread for appetizers. I had the margherita 7\" pizza. All of it was very tasty. 

Prices are great, especially for Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is still a great restaurant which as been around since 1984. The classic pizza is a deep dish. Love this pizza, has excellent flavor and Nellos does not skimp on the ingredients. The salads are excellent also. Very casual and take out is easy with a separate area to pick up the pizza. Excellent service and even though the restaurant was sold a few years ago, it is still good. I highly recommend Nello's to everyone."}
{"text":"Really great crust. A bit to much sauce on the pizza. A very good side salad with excellent blue cheese dressing. The pepperoni rolls are really tasty. I would recommend this place for families and groups. A good eat in pizza place is a great find. Unplug from your technology and spend some time talking with the family and enjoying some good food with a very helpful staff."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza was decent.  The crust had the perfect level of thicknss and crispiness.  We appreciated the homemade sausage on the pizza but overall it was just average.  The pizza was lightly topped and the taste was a bit on the bland side.  The antipasto salad was very ordinary but it came with tasty homemade house dressing.

I would return and try their Chicago style which is what they are suppose to be known for."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered lunch from here I called to have food delivered. They acted like it was an inconvenience to deliver even though the location was literally around the block. OK, I disregarded the attitude and patiently waited for the delivery. When we got the food, we couldn't believe how SMALL the portions were. We ordered 2 ceaser salads and they came in the smallest box possible. After about 6 bites, the salad was gone. They were over $10 for each. Unacceptable. Today, I ran in the for a slice and a soda. $5.98. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The slice was SMALL and had absolutely NO FLAVOR. I'm more than disappointed that I gave them a second chance. Oh the owner/manager, whoever it was sat on the phone while I waited for my tiny slice of pizza taking a personal call and never even looked up at me while I waited. Very unprofessional and way WAY overpriced for food that isn't even remotely good. Do yourself a favor and don't go here. I'm positive you'll be disappointing."}
{"text":"Gluten free thin crust is available in 12 or 14\". Tasty!  Convenient location NW 101 and Shea Scottsdale. Decor update needed."}
{"text":"This family-owned small chain of Pizza joints is my favorite place in Arizona to get a pie. I have never ventured to Pizza Bianchi, partly because I am told that there is an hour and a half wait, and really, who has an hour and a half to wait outside in Phoenix for pizza? I have been to Grimaldi's. Grimaldis was very adequate.
Nellos is extravagant pizza! They make their own sausage in house. Chicago style. They have Sicillian style too, but I avoid it and opt for a thin crust. I have had a few salads at Nellos and both were ample and delicious. This place seems like a good place to watch a game or have a pint as well, with plenty of good beer on tap. 
One of the owners is a local artist so there are plenty of fun things to look at even if you aren't watching a D-Backs game.
I like the atmosphere at the Gilbert restaurant the best. The outdoor patio is great, but the artist/owner runs the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered a caprese salad w/ grilled chicken to share along with a bowl of veggie minestrone. 

The salad was awesome, I loooooove their house dressing. The soup was a little bland, but still pretty tasty, and was easily rescued by some red pepper flakes, dash of salt and parmesan cheese. 

Keep in mind, the salad portion is pretty sizeable (even with 2 of us having lunch we were unable to finish the whole thing, although we tend to be light lunch eaters). Staff was very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"The food is always great. The service is hit or miss. The last two times we've been here it's been a miss. Not busy at 6:30 yet can't refill a water or ask how our pizza is after it arrived. Different staff each time we come. Recommend getting their awesome food to go if you come here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nello's since they built out their very first restaurant when 2 brothers from NY decided to move to AZ. I used to go there was I was younger because they were cute..lol. Now I'm go for the food, the cleanest restaurant you can find, and the service. Their pizza is as good and consistent as it always has been. The lightest deep crust you can imagine, what you order on it in every bite. Sandwiches, Italian Beef is my fav. Everything about this place is exactly what a great dining experience should be. Nice to see good things happen to good people."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch and it was my 10th visit (approximately) and my wife's 50th (near her workplace, so lunches there).  

Nello's expanded their menu over the past year or so, and I was quite happy to find a decent sandwich on wheat bread that I ordered as a half with a side salad.  Nice sized salad, great sandwich (Sorry, can't remember the name but it was fairly lean meat and onions)

The service was excellent from a 20 yr old young man who was attentive without hovering. 

 Nice selection of wines, beer and ciders with many on tap.

Nello's also serves brunch on weekends, which was news to both of us.  Their short brunch menu had a few nice dishes and they offer Mimosas, Hyacinths and other brunch style drinks."}
{"text":"Nello's was my first job when I turned 16.  (The one in Ahwatukee) but I love all the staff and the food is always great.  Thank you to the Mei brothers for the great food and service and thank you especially to Danny Mei for giving me my first job 8 years ago :)"}
{"text":"Went here right before I got my first tattoo with one of my girlfriends.  She used to work at this place back in the day and would always tell me how awesome it was.  So we stopped in since I had an hour before the tattoo artist would be ready.  We got the eggplant bruschetta to share and it was heavenly.  I believe eggplant should be included in more dishes and was so happy to find it be the star of this appetizer!  It was perfectly cooked eggplant and the bread was a crunchy balance to the soft eggplant.  We both got salads as a light dinner and I they were completely overloaded with veggies and cheese!  Next time I have to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Chicago style deep pizza...and I was happy to hear they have a thin crust one, too.
 I had the \"Sicilian\" thin crust... and the topping saved the pizza. It is very very thin...almost like a cracker in texture, but the sausage and peppers really made this a tastey pizza.

On another visit, I tried the Italian Sausage sandwich with Au Jus... AMAZING!!!
Fresh bread, great tasting sausage and the Au Jus.!!!! Just great!!

I have not tried the past yet, so an update will be coming."}
{"text":"Seated right away for lunch great service by Matt wonderful food delicious perfectly cooked pizza and a very large salad All for 9.99.  The house dressing is fantastic.  I had a four peaks beer and in lieu of the drink that came with lunch they served me an iced tea to go how accommodating.  I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Last weekend, we visited this restaurant for dinner. I had finished golfing and ate a late lunch, 2:30 PM. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:30PM and it wasn't too crowded. We ordered their spinach salad, the European thin pizza and Deluxe combo mini-pizza for myself.
They make awesome salads, fresh spinach topped with real bacon, hard boiled eggs, scallions, radishes, mushrooms, tomatoes and side of garlic bread. Had better garlic bread elsewhere.
After the salad, I was getting pretty stuffed, but managed to finish the Deluxe Combo pizza which comes with pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions, black olives & mushrooms.
All in all, a great meal."}
{"text":"What a difference a year makes. While we weren't impressed with our previous experience at Nello's, my very pregnant wife heard a rumor that the house salad dressing has the right combinations of spices that are actually known to put women into labor. The restaurant is aware of this rumor, the manager says she's been told several times that it does the trick, but spoiler alert... it did not do it for my wife. However; the house salad dressing (and the garden salad) is awesome.

The waiter also recommended the buffalo wings with Nello's own sauce. The sauce is just a tad spicy (another alleged labor inducer), but not hot enough to ward off those who don't like hot flavors. Even after eating an obnoxious amount of food, I had to finish off the plate, the wings were that delicious. We also split a chicken parmigiana sandwich which was quite good.

Oddly enough, skipping out on what Nello's is known for, the pizza, really changed our perception of the place. Nello's still has a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which is always a great way to save cash on the meal. We're looking forward to our next trip. Which will most likely be with the baby that the salad dressing did not help come out already."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Nello's for years now. The reason...great service and great pizza! We just love their house dressing...I actually buy it by the bottle and it's always gone within the week.

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nellos Pizza is awesome.  Had the lunch special which includes a salad. The house dressing is very unique because it has a slight hint of tomato taste to it and goes great with the salad and pizza. The place was clean and the bathrooms were clean. I have been here several times but today the waitress was the best. She was very attentive promptly refilling drinks and providing 5 star service. The pizza and salad were fabulous and filled this man size hunger at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the Scottsdale area. My parents discovered this place since it's in a shopping center pretty close to where I live. I'm pretty picky when it comes to great pizza being from both NY and Chicago. To me, pizza is either edible or it's so good I have to go back for more. I always get the personal pizza with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. There's only one other place that I know of where I can do this combination and that's in West Lafayette, IN where I went to college. The amount of sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and the crust is really good too. The salads come with homemade croutons which are delicious. I always steal them off of my Mom's plate. The service is always quick and friendly whether you dine-in or carry-out. Love the Chicago themed decorations too, even if they are Cubs related."}
{"text":"Crab stuffed mushrooms are amazing! Cooked perfectly! Enjoyed the thin crust,12 inch Rustica with pepperoni and it was SO good! I was only going to eat half of it after the mushrooms but couldn't stop myself. Service could not have been better and Tavish was great. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, Awesome Pizza!  Being from the Chicago suburbs, I am used to this style pizza and haven't found many places that even offer it.  It's as good as it gets and is as good as any I have had back home.

It's a traditional pizza and not a typcial chain type of pizza.  it's a homemade dough thin crust (not cracker crust thin) pizza that has a lot of flavor. We haven't tried any of the other food they offer but I have been told it's the old Marcello's Pizza that used to be in Stoughton (prior to my existence in the area)!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here, not sure if we got lucky with a good server or what according to previous posts. Cozy restaurant and our food was good. I had spinach dip and the bread/pita was seasoned and delicious. We so had pesto pasta with chicken. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Nello's is definitely a family restaurant.  Of the times I've gone, every other table except mine had at least one young child at it.

Nothing is wrong with that, unless you were hoping for a quieter atmosphere.  

If you're looking for a spot to bring a date, this isn't it.  But if you're looking to have pretty good pizza and really good salad with some pals or your fam, then definitely check Nello's out. 

They have good beer specials and cool art on the walls depicting The Beatles, Elvis and other musicians."}
{"text":"Most people go to Nello's for the pizza, which is quite tasty by the way.  But I go for their salads.  They are sooooo good!  I didn't know they had a Nello's in old town until I saw it driving around one day, so my friend and I decided to stop in for lunch.  We normally go to the Nello's by the 101 and Shea, but this one might even be better.  It isn't as much of a family spot as the Shea Nello's, so you won't hear near as many loud, crying children.  (Disclaimer- I don't hate kids, I like them.  I do.  Just not as much when they scream when you're out to dinner).

Anyways, my favorite salads are as follows- in no particular order:

the old world classic with black olives, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, feta, romaine and more...soooo good!

caprese with mozzarella, basil, romaine, black olives and carrots

and the strangely good champagne salad with romaine, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and candied walnuts.

Next time you're at Nello's, try skipping the pizza and trying the salads- they're more than enough for a meal and they're deeeeelish!"}
{"text":"High marks for the tasty pizza, but beware the build your own option!  We ordered a 14\" thin crust with chicken, roasted red bell pepper, mushrooms, and feta, and the bill came out to $27.50!  I ordered from their online menu, which did not list the price of these ingredients. If I knew it would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it. I spoke with the manager who apologized for those prices not being listed on website, but stopped short of doing anything to make it right, apparently unconcerned about losing a 17 year customer. We like their pizza but there are other excellent, less pricy options we'll choose next time."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup and it was ready right on time.  Pizza was great, definitely the best I have had in Scottsdale.  The peperoni rolls are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Nello's Old World Classic salad with their house dressing. The salad has everything I could want in a salad... sun dried tomatoes, red onions, pepperoncinis, garbanzo beans, feta. Their house dressing is an amazing bottle of deliciousness. It's such a good combo! I don't get this excited about salads, but this one is worth the raving. 

I haven't had a pizza I've been crazy about yet. We've tried both the pesto pizza and the sausage with the hand tossed crust... both were decent, but almost lacking in flavor. I've come to the conclusion that the hand tossed crust is too bready and I think the thin crust will be a better bet. 

I haven't had a drink at Nello's but they have some good beers on their list (eg Franziskaner which I rarely come across)."}
{"text":"Service was bad. All workers including what seemed to be the manager stood around and talked to each other instead of tending to the three tables in the restaurant. The three tables during happy hour should have been my first clue. Entire order was burnt. Was asked by a young man clearing our table why we didn't eat the crust. The crust was black b/c it was so burnt. We were nice to everyone and didn't make a scene, and was not even told thanks when leaving because the staff  was too busy talking to one another. Truly disappointed and will never be back."}
{"text":"This place was cool to stop into on the way to a game.  A friend and I each ordered a 7\" mini pizza and it was great. Thick crust, but not overly filling, which is always a plus. Also ordered a salad that we split and it was pretty tasty. This place has character and the wait staff was really nice. I look forward to visiting again next year."}
{"text":"I ate here in the afternoon, sober. I ate a slice as a leftover tonight and was blown away! It was great cold! Tasted just like this place in Cleveland called Danny Boy's Pizza. The sauce is a little bit on the thicker side with a kind of deep dish crust. I thought it was excellent tonight, but am not sober writing this."}
{"text":"Greatest thin crust deluxe combo pizza ever.
Wonderful craft beer selection, but getting a bit pricey in wines.
Super Italian beef and sausage sandwiches."}
{"text":"Looking for service with a smile? Go somewhere else. But if you want good food at really reasonable prices--this is your place. 

My group at work had a team lunch here (12) and I arrived early to alert the wait staff that we were apart of the \"separate check club.\" Our lovely waitress gave me the look of death. She really didn't respond, so I wasn't sure if she actually heard me, so I repeated myself again. Sunshine cut me off and said \"I got it.\" Ok, you got it? So you will bring 12 separate checks right? umm not so much. Sunshine brought one check and felt the need to make the comment \"we usually look down upon this.\" 
Uncomfortable. 
To be nice, once again. I wrote everyone's name and the amount to charge them on the check, pretty easy right? Apparently not for Sunshine. I got the eye roll. For a split second I considered kicking her in the face, but with my boss sitting across the table from me, I didn't think it was wise. 
On the flip side, the food was really good. My pizza was delish, and the house salad dressing was so could, you can drink right from the bottle. Worth the try for sure. Just leave your pride and self esteem at the office."}
{"text":"I love the relaxed vibe of this place, and am obsessed with their homemade salad dressing! I also love their eggplant bruschetta. I live in San Diego now, but whenever I am back in Scottsdale, I have to stop by Nello's!"}
{"text":"Great salads - especially their chicken Caesar. Their pizza is better than I remembered. They also have a delicious pizza bread appetizer that's good to split. The food here is above average for a chain, but as far as pizza places go it isn't remarkable. 

There's nothing particularly special about this place. I've enjoyed the food and the service a little more at the Tempe location, but this one is in such a convenient spot. It gives you the opportunity to walk off your dinner while wandering around town looking at art galleries and whatnot. 

I had realized that I gave this place a 4/5, but the review sounded like I kinda hated it. I also said this place wasn't as good as the Tempe location, but I think I gave that one a 3/5. Don't listen to me - I must not know what the hell I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Get the Garden Salad with grilled chicken and the Nello's house dressing.  So simple and good.  It's nothing fancy, I promise.  There is just something about the crunch of the iceberg lettuce, the grated fresh mozzarella, the subtle spice of the chicken and the INCREDIBLE pizza SASE dressing...  oddly satisfying.  This is a total local hangout.  Lots of families.  You can bring the rug-rats here.  Everyone else does.   

The pizza is average.  Stick to the salad and bread sticks (basically an entire seasoned cut up pizza crust)."}
{"text":"Dropped in here with a few friends after work one night. Turns out, they have a nifty happy hour till 6pm that offers a good selection of draft beers for only $4. They have pizzas ranging from enough for 1 person, to enough for 4 people. I order one for 2-3 people with the anticipation of leftovers, however, it was so damn good I looked down and realized I ate the entire thing.

The pizza is magical, the wait staff was attentive, and the location is tucked away just enough to feel like its a local gem that isn't over populated yet."}
