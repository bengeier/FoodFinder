{"text":"For a burger there probably isn't a better place to go. It can be a little slow at lunch since it get's so busy but it's well worth the wait. I've tried a number of different burgers on the menu and they've all been good. For fries I usually go with the 50/50 option and they are great."}
{"text":"The burgers are perfect, the same as their Lake Shore location. Service is great too."}
{"text":"Really wanted to write a positive review. The place is brand new and well decorated, also the staff were friendly and cheerful. However, the food while generous in size was not very good. My main issue was everything was cooked rare. The meat was deep red, the bacon in the burger barely cooked at all and rubbery. Even the fries were not completely fried, they were very hard and uneatable."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission. It may be impossible. But, That won't stop me. I want to try every gourmet burger, and every poutine, that the GTA has to offer. Yesterday, I came one step closer to completing that mission.  Getting to Woody's was easy. From the 427, I took the Brown's line exit and headed south until I got to Lakeshore. Parking is available in front of Woody's and on the street next to it.  Once inside, I had a hard time choosing an item from the menu. Everything sounded equally tantalizing. I settled on the Bistro Burger and a Poutine on the side.   The wait for my order was slightly longer than I expected. But, the wait was worth it.   The offerings for toppings are as creative as they are diverse. I opted against Salsa and roasted red peppers but loved that they were both available and didn't cost extra.   The beef was charred to perfection and crispy on the outside but soft and juicy on the inside. If you're looking for a traditional poutine, their poutine is one of the best I've ever tried. The portions were just the right size too.   The staff is young and very friendly. The atmosphere is casual and laid back.   I would have given Woody's a 5 if the burger was warmer when it was served. It had cooled down a lot by the time I got to my table. Perhaps my fries weren't ready? And it cooled off in the meanwhile?  Great stuff, keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is a winner: delicious burgers (thick and juicy), an excellent selection of toppings, freshly cut fries, and a pleasant corner patio.  What more do you need from a burger place?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a thick, smokey and juicy burger woody's is the place to go! I always get the coronary burger it has cheese, bacon crispy fried onions and a fried egg it is absolutely delicious! The ingredients that they use are high in quality and everything is fresh and made to order. The only issues i have is the limited number of seats inside, and when it is super busy the burgers can be put together improperly and have come out slightly more charred then id prefer."}
{"text":"Amazing quality and value. Sweet potato fries are delicious!! Unique burger options :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Decent prices. Beer selection a bit limited but hey thats a burger joint. The cashier was a bit rude but I understand it was crazy busy and all other employees were so smiling that they made up for it. This place was packed and it makes sense because the food was yummy and the ingredients fresh. Love the pager system that let you know when your food was ready."}
{"text":"The burgers are massive! The sweet potato fries are amazing and even the garden salad is very good. If u love burgers u need to try these!"}
{"text":"It might have felt like a roadtrip getting out this far west with the Gardiner Expy closed, but it was worth the gridlock.  Brought out here by fellow yelper, Kyra S., who'd followed her nose here while out driving, I too was drawn in by it's clean looking exterior, cute patio and undenable delicious smell.  The menu is what you'd expect from a gourmet burger shop, but with some extra surprises.  Beef, bison, chicken , veggie and pulled pork are the options amongst the burgers.  They proudly display they only use naturally raised local meat, which is sure to add to the quality of the taste.   Several speciality burgers already have the toppings picked out; The Greek has feta cheese, red pepper, fresh cucumber, tomato and tzatziki while the Tandoori Chicken Burger has roast red pepper, sauteed onion, curry mayo, cucumber and garlic yogurt sauce.  All the toppings are included, aside from the options in cheese which are $1 each (brie, cheddar, feta, swiss, gorgonzola and smoked gouda).  Six mayos double as dipping sauce for their handcut yukon gold or sweet potato fries (can't decide which you want - they'll mix it up for you and give you both!).   Prices are good, ranging from $5.35 for a classic beef burger and upto $7.50 for a bison.  For a combo with fries and pop add $3.50, want a beer - it's another $2.00.    Customers are given buzers to take back to their table, so you don't have to wait around while your burger cooks over their hardwood grill. You get to direct the dressing of your burger which makes all the toppings seem a bit less daunting.  Although I was tempted by the cheese stuffed burgers on the menu, I couldn't resist getting the bison burger.  It was juicy and flavourful and nearly an inch thick.  The bun held up well to all the toppings and the fries were decliously thick and tasty.    They're licensed, with both beer and a few mixed drinks on offered.  A note on our table let us know that several nights a week they have half priced mojitos or sangria, etc depending on the day.  Salads looked fresh and colourful as they past by, and the coleslaw looked nonetoo creamy.    If you fiind yourself out near Long Branch, or want to see where it is exactly the Queen Street Car ends - get yourself to Woody's.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best burger joint in Etobicoke by far. The quality of the food is great and the Cali burger is amazing. One downside is the guys working in the kitchen have seen them eating fries while working. Find it kinda unsanitary but overall the burgers are great.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Entirely disappointing.  Husband's greek burger was dry and lacked flavour.  There was also not very much feta on it.  My veggie burger was the worst I've ever had - mushy and crumbly and not at all \"burger-y\".  Fries were Ok.  Cole slaw order had barely any cole slaw in the box - very odd.  Also, there was a women working in the kitchen that came out to speak with her friends who were there with a baby.  She held the baby and then went back into the kitchen and continued to cook without washing her hands.  It was expensive and totally sub-par.  Marky's BBQ was much more of a quality restaurant.  We wanted to like this place since it's close to home - but it was very disappointing.  This restaurant will not last."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the burgers aren't consistent. This time the patty was so over cooked that the beef was rubbery. Even all the toppings and sauce couldn't make the burger taste better. I'm done and never going back. There is plenty of good burger places that can cook a proper patty."}
{"text":"Almost as perfect as a burger could be - hot, juicy and jam packed with grilled goodness. The patties are thick and filling and there are a ton of fantastic toppings to choose from. We had a side of fries with our order which was equally delicious. Space is a little tight inside so get there early especially on weekends if you want to dine in. Pretty much our go to place when we feel like having an awesome burger."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place to get a burger in the GTA. I always leave full and happy. It is kinda pricey, but you will not be disappointed. I have tried Burger Priest and all of those other fancy burger joints, but this one is THE best!"}
{"text":"The boom burger is amazing! Always love coming here for a tasty, grilled to perfection , hot off the fire burger. Staff is really friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with suggestions of what to have. Thanks again Stephanie for the suggestions. Ill be back and soon!"}
{"text":"The burger was great. The meat was juicy and moist and well flavoured. However I was abit disappointed to find a lettuce head inside my burger as part of the toppings.."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but to avoid this, call in and place your order ahead of time."}
{"text":"This burger joint is da bomb. 9 out of 10 in my books. Real wood fire, beefy beef, one burger hits the spot and leaves you satisfied. I had the bison burger and it was awesome! The meat had BAM! A good slab size, not to small for the bun.  Lots of room to sit, great beer to accompany my burger and big screen tv's to drown out the nagging wife. As Arnold would say \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Fantastic! Get the 50/50 fries and any of the extraordinary burgers. Have tried most and surprisingly my new favourite is the Tokyo burger.   Pickled ginger and wasabi mayo. You must try it! Wait can be longer during peak hours but totally worth it! A five star gem *****"}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers. The taste of the meat.. the the execution of the cheese stuffing inside the burger patty.. the tons of gourmet toppings (tzatziki, salsa, dijon mustard, sauces, grilled sweet peppers, sweet sautéed onions,... etc)...  Everything is nothing short of amazing. The server is very sweet too!"}
{"text":"Replacing Marky's BBQ joint,  this place is really good and a welcome addition to our neighbourhood.  Been there twice and offerings are consistently delicious.  Easily surpasses most BWV and Junction burger joints.  Kudos."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I had the Mac & Cheese....AMAZING! Beef Stuffed Gorgonzola....AMAZING! Yukon Gold fries....AMAZING!  I am so stuffed...I can't move. I can barely type hdbahsj jfkjckx jfkjckx jndjajjsjslskx....AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had! Excellent quality of meat and toppings. Good fries"}
{"text":"If you are ever around this area, forget 5 guys or your typical burger joint, WOODYS is the place to be. Awesome custom burgers at its best! Order the half and half fries (sweet potatoe/reg potatoe) large servings."}
{"text":"Best non-soya veg burger in town!! I have not tasted anything like this before in Toronto!! The patty is not dry or chewy like most of the veg burgers you get at other places. Every burger is made from scratch...they take their time to make each one of them. Good side and drinks options..totally in love with this place. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is gem! And when they're really cooking it infuses the whole neighbourhood with the delicious scent of BBQ. I come here often and have never had a bad experience. Some of my favourite items include the gorgonzola stuffed burger with fried onions, the memphis pulled pork with coleslaw and of course the fantastic sweet potato fries which are the best i've had anywhere. The only crappy thing here is that the awesome patio is not smoke free so its essentially off limits to children and non-smokers"}
{"text":"I must agree with all the reviews here. Woody's is well worth the visit. Handcrafted patties, gourmet toppings and sauces, and a stuffed burger that will make finishing your fries the most demanding task of the day. The staff waste absolutely no time in processing orders and getting customers stuffing their faces, which is refreshing considering the abysmal service I've faced at big comercial establishments.  The only drawback, which I must concur with past reviews, is it's lack of seating and size, and awkwardly narrow positioning. That being said, it's fairly easy to overlook those technicalities since the place has such a great vibe and, as an added bonus, is only minutes from the beach! Boom!  If you've got time on your hands and a hefty appetite, stop by Woody's. Just get there early. The place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Very Good burgers and fries as advertised!  I find them less greasy on the burger and fries side of things vs the major gourmet burger places. The hickory smell eating in was awesome!"}
{"text":"great burgers as usual poutine was amazing sweet potato fries weren't the greatest stick to the regular fries"}
{"text":"Wandering on a Sunday, decided to Yelp for the best burger in the area. A short drive later, I pulled up to modern looking, patio booming Woody's Burgers Bar and Grill.  The restaurant itself is pretty small. 6 or so tables inside with an eat up bar - it was packed! I chose the patio... Additional 6 tables outside, small eat up bar facing the avenue, and a speaker playing local radio adding some ambiance.  Perky gal at the register took my order and gave me a pager. There is a sign explaining that good food isn't always fast... Looking at approx 15 minutes for them to cook your burger from fresh.  The buzzer goes off and I head back in to customize my toppings on the Classic Beef with Cheddar & Smoked Bacon. Anything you may want to add is there and they are liberal with adding it all on.  Serious trouble trying to bite this burger! It is stacked pretty high - and the flavour matched the physical presence. AMAZING! Wood grilled makes all of the difference! Small Poutine would have fed at LEAST 2 people. Fries are crunchy and perfect. Will have to return to try the Sweet Potato Fries another time.   Nice to meet you Woody! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I discovered Woody's about a year and a half ago. We were very happy with the food, service and quality of the meals we had there.  We had made this \"our\" burger joint and would come here for dinner every few months. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was to die for and the 4 Cheese Burger with Cheddar was heavenly. The variety of toppings is wide. The fries and poutine are very good.  Unfortunately, our last two trips to Woody's have been a big disappointment. It seems as though the quality in the meat has gone down a lot. The past two times we have been there the once juicy patties were now dry and dull. They lacked any real flavour and seemed to be overcooked. The quality now tastes more like a sub-par frozen burger. Unfortunately we probably won't be back. I want those juicy burgers back! I guess I'll start going back to the Priest."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a great gourmet burger joint to have lunch. So we googled burgers in Toronto and Woody's was the first one that pooped up,  so being the first one we said that must say something. We didn't decide based on any reviews and just drove there. We're coming from Thornhill and just glanced at the address and saw Lakeshore Blvd. Toronto alas don't be fooled they're on the cusp of Toronto and Mississauga thus it's way west of the city so it was a 35 minute drive for lunch. As you walk in the door you're hit by the beautiful smell of wood burning smokeyness. Reminds you of camping and not the greasy smell of the fryers which was very welcoming. The chalkboard menu was a nice added touch to remind that this was no corporate chain you were eating at. Few beers on tap and a small dessert menu to top it all off. Pretty fair pricing given \"gourmet\" burgers was the main focus. I had the Boom Burger, my husbad had the Coronary Burger with the half fries half sweet potato fries and a bottle of Canadian for a total of $27 and change. Not too bad in my opinion. My burger was alright, nothing to write home about. It was a lot more greasy than I would have liked, the bun was dried even with all the grease dripping down my fingers and for having pulled pork on it I was disappointed in how dry that was when you're expecting nice sweet juicy gravey from that scoop of pork on top of your beef patty. My husband in a manly fashion devoured his burger washed it down with his beer and said it was good. He finished it in what seemed like 3 bites before I could complete my first few chews. But burgers aside I must say that their Yukon gold fries were pretty amazing. Getting the half and half was a good choice with each bite the mix of sweet and savory was perfect.  The service was great as you would hope to be served, it was pretty busy when we were there and we did manage to get a table. We didn't wait long, it's pretty efficient that they have little buzzers that notify when they're done cooking your order instead of all just crowding in one herd. So traffic control was taken into consideration. On that note to sum up our experience I would say good lunch. Would definitely visit again but only if I were in the area I wouldn't go out of my way to say I need a Woodys burger."}
{"text":"A gem of a burger boutique in Long Brach. Well worth the visit. Homer Simpson would love  the Fred egg option. Excellent sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We used to love this place and have continued to drive in after moving to  Mississauga. Called in an order said 15-20 minutes, took 30 no big deal. Charged for mac and cheese (which is usually really good). But then realized that there wasn't any in the bag?!Had to go back to be told they're out of it? But we had ordered it when we called in - and were charged for it!! Had to ask to be refunded!! They actually let us walk out not telling us they didn't have mac and chase and charged us. On top of that, unapologetic."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Toronto hands down. Great toppings and combinations. I am not much of a fry person usually but they are excellent here too. Tough to stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Alpine, friends had California, everyone was happy. Caesar salad also looked amazing. The only average thing was the fries. Good thing you can order ahead."}
{"text":"Thought I would expand my taste buds tonight and try a Bison burger.  It was pretty good.  It seemed extremely lean which I like.  It was a bit pricey but I think I would try it again.  They should get rid of those notification buzzers.  Too tacky."}
{"text":"Very cozy place, the burgers are very tasty and I absolutely LOVE the sweet-potato poutine. The only problem I have with the place is the lack of tables but that's about it, really."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Can't find a good hamburger anywhere is this city. I just want a thick juicy burger that drips down my chin when I bite into it. Not to be found at Woody's. Small, dry, rubbery patty stuck between 2 parts of an oversized bun. The proportion was completely off. On the plus side, fries were ok, service was friendly, place was very clean...but the burger...well...let me know if you have a better suggestion."}
{"text":"Woodys never fails...consistently innovative and we'll made burgers at a fast food price.....shows how good a burger the chains could give us and still make money if they weren't so greedy!....excellent hand cut fries!...I go for the half and half....reg& sweet potato....the one thing that I find irksome is the prominently displayed tip jar and the fact that as I am placing my order and paying with debit I am prompted to add a tip......for what?.....taking my money?....once my order is placed I am given an electronic device which flashes when it's ready.....I then have to go pick it up...get my own napkin fork and condiments and take it back to my seat....now this is fast food I get that and am OK with looking after my own needs and then putting my own garbage in the container.......or would be pleased to give a wait staff 15 to 20 per cent to come take my order then bring it to me along with implements and condiments.....check to see how my meal is....come by to see if I want another beer or dessert then clean up after me....no problem with that but they either need to go to the wait staff model or stash the tip jar and debit prompts for tips for service they don't offer......Crisco"}
{"text":"Interesting burger joint. Has a lot of menu options ranging from your classic burger to wild variations and some vegan/vegetarian options. I have only been here once but was happy with my classic burger. My friends vegan burger was good but falls apart easily (it's probably hard to keep it all together when it is just vegetables). Fries were great, both sweet and regular fries. The coleslaw is different tasting than anywhere else I have ever had it, I'm on the fence about that food option, not sure if I would order it again."}
{"text":"I ordered in pick up here at the Jane location. The burgers were amazing but they were out of the mac and cheese so I ordered poutine and my fries tasted hard and undercooked so that was a little disappointing. I would still go again but maybe not order the poutine."}
{"text":"Smokey turkey burger is delicious and you can load it right up (note: not a first date food - so messy! lol) Fries are really good - similar to chip truck fries in the country!   Super tiny patio (fills up quick!) but it's a nice spot to people-watch. Staff are really down-to-earth and friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, the burgers are awesome, the Coronary is my fav, and I'm visiting again sometime this week.   I would put them in the top 3 in Toronto, and if they want to be 1st, change the gravy and offer a free breakfast with ever 10 orders (the price of a burger is worth every penny,  but is up there, HOWEVER customer loyalty should be rewarded with a free breakfast every 10 burgers; And that Chef  would make you #1 in my book)"}
{"text":"Delicious veggie burger and caesar salad, great patio, and friendly service at cash... too bad about the snarly one working the grill (Wed. Aug. 16, 1pm)"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers fries pulled pork place was very busy atmosphere very good we would go back there in a minute"}
{"text":"I have good things to say about Woody's.   Let's start with the food. It's great. I had seen pictures of the food online prior to my visit, and it appeared to be a good size. My burger was even thicker and juicier in person. Filled with flavor, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, pretty much a slam dunk. I had one of the unique burgers, it was called the boom burger. It had some pulled pork on top, which was good too. I had a poutine as well, I added a picture. The gravy was this odd sweet flavor, but it was excellent overall.   The service was fair. It was ridiculously busy when I went, and they were clearly short staffed. They did the best job humanly possible, without coming across as rude.   Finally the decor, I didn't get much of a view of the interior. I sat outside on the patio, which was decent enough. Crappy lakeshore view but what could you really expect.  Overall quite good, worth a visit if you want a great burger, and don't mind paying a little bit more."}
{"text":"Everything that I've had here is delicious. If you're looking for a WAY above average burger-joint, this is certainly worth a try. Way better than every \"fast-food\" burger I've ever had.  This place deserves a position among the list of high-quality craft-burger joints in the city.  The 50/50 fries, half regular fries and half sweet potato is such a nice touch for people like me who have trouble deciding."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out given all the hype.  Quite pricey, but expected that since they serve \"gourmet burgers\".  As other reviewers have mentioned - THE WAIT IS LONGGGGGGG.  We went in 40 min before they closed and it wasn't packed, but still had to wait another 35-40 minutes for two burgers and a poutine.  Then they rushed us to finish eating ASAP because they were closing soon??  I'm not really sure what the logic was there.  Burgers were OK - the patty was kind of dry.  Poutine was amazing though - gravy and cheese curds were to die for!  Their house draft was alright too.  Would come back to try another burger (maybe it was an off day?), making sure to allot LOTS of time to eat!"}
{"text":"Last night a friend recommended I try Burrito Brothers on Lakeshore at the foot of Brown's Line. After my delicious Burrito in a bowl, I decided to head down the block, well two doors down and what do I see but this busy little spot called Woody's Burger. I took a peek inside and the patties seemed nicely charred, the fries lovingly golden brown. I meandered on in for a closer look and decided right then there I had to go back, TOMORROW, which turned out to be today and it was definitely one of my best decisions ever!  With the rain out tonight, the patio was, well, inhospitable, so I decided to double up with \"some guy\" sitting alone. He was clearly a regular as he enjoyed his burger with focused intention.  A short conversation later confirmed him to be a full time regular.  Waiting for my chow, he asked if I was getting fries, I confirmed, prompting him to recommend the Chipotle Mayonnaise as the right companion.   Woody's isn't a blast in for a burger and bolt out kind'a place as the burger takes a good 10 - 15 minutes to cook. The upshot is that it's so fantastically good that I was quite happy to savour every moment.  When it comes to fries, they have both sweet potato and potato, a mix in a single order is available; the sweet potato with their custom ketchup is a good pairing as was the other.   I had the Alpine Beef Burger with Swiss Cheese, smoked bacon, sautéed mushroom & onion and Dijon mustard. Everything, absolutely everything, was cooked fresh with my order and it was amazing.  With all the gourmet burger joints popping up, most of which I've tried, Woody's is hands down the best.  Not only do I recommend it, I think I'm going to take everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Woody's is THE place to go for a burger in the South Etobicoke area. The burger patties are made fresh and grilled to perfection. They have several burger options for all types of taste, from Turkey to Beef, to pulled pork. It's all delicious. My favourite is definitely the Tokyo burger.  Woody's is a order and sit down kind of restaurant, it gets packed! So many sure you're ready to wait, as sometimes it takes about 15 minutes to get your WELL worth the wait burger. They have several additional toppings that you can get with your burger. They also serve sides like salads, fries (omg, fresh cut), poutine (better than smokes in IMO) and MILKSHAKES, and even beer for those who want some beer and burgers.   Service is not the greatest, but they get your order in and serve your food hot and ready, so that's worth more to me!   Our go to place for burgers ;)"}
{"text":"Yikes, considering the other reviews I went on the WORST day possible. We ordered 2 burgers, slaw and fries and the place was jammed. 25 minutes later..... yes 25 MINUTES LATER we were called in to be greeted to be rushed to select toppings, which I should say the selection was expansive and tasty.  Retiring on the patio, we found our burgers to be dry, hard and grey, completely overcooked and unacceptable for a $10 patty. I would have sent it back, but was not prepared for another 30min wait to grey patty sadness.  The fries were OK, soft and boring, the sweet potato fries were best but the seasoning was poor and the fries were JUST warm enough to eat.  The LARGE slaw was perhaps a CUP of bland cream/vinegar cabbage, unseasoned and blah. For $5. Comon people, a gallon of slaw costs $3 to make, so lets throw a little ginger, heat, whatever. But don't sell me a cup of loblaws slaw for a fin, OK?  The sad thing is, the menu is tight but the execution this day was a complete fail. Obviously in the food biz, consistency is king. With a lack of training or capacity, even the best menus fall flat on their face.  At $37 total for 2 burgs, slaw, fries and pops, I can't see my self going back."}
{"text":"We went for the first time after hearing such great things. The cashier rushed us and was just plain rude. It wasn't that busy and there was nobody behind us waiting to order. She could have taken the time to explain things to us, but she treated us like we were inconveniencing her. My husband ordered the plain burger (he doesn't do fancy) and I ordered the Memphis - a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and fried onions. We both got fries and a drink.  Our table wasn't cleaned and there was lettuce all over the bench.  We got our food and the first thing I noticed was that my husbands burger came with a side of fries and my order came with a separate order which is much larger (not sure what that's about). He thought his burger was really good. I wasn't so happy. The pulled pork was on the dry side and pretty typical. Bun was soggy. Barely any toppings on it (I had to take it back and ask for more coleslaw). Fountain pop was good but small.  Lesson learned, next time I'll get a burger and hopefully a friendlier cashier :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice. I ordered the Bison burger the first time and I don't remember the name of the second one. Both times were fantastic! I hear it's busy all the time and I totally understand why! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is the one you should stay away from to keep yourself in shape. The food is so good that one burger is never enough for me"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and sweet potato fries for the first time and they all arrived burnt - seriously burnt! I tried calling them immediately but they had closed. Very irresponsible of them and I'll never order from them again, ever!"}
{"text":"After seeing the review of the day for this place, it set off a reminder that I too had paid them a visit a while ago and I also had an delicious experience!  It's located just on the last bit of Etobicoke, one more light to the west (a mere 200 meters) and this joint would call Mississauga home. In fact if you're traveling along the Lakeshore East Go Train line, you could hop off at Long Branch station, walk a block, eat and get back on before the next train arrived. Hint Hint!  Having never been, I asked the staff on hand what they recommended and without question they advised me that the Boom burger is their best seller. Naturally I went this way, and who wouldn't, I mean a Classic Beef burger made with their house made pulled pork, grilled jalapenos, smoked gouda, fried onions, chipotle mayo and smoked ketchup - foodgasm? Yep!  The burger was awesome and while I abstained from fries this time, they looked fresh cut and damn fine!  I'll be back - just as soon as I work off the last burger!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Burgers, beer, oh boy! The burgers are great, charcoal grilled and big, the perfect combination for any dedicated carnivore. Lots of condiments for those who don't like their meat naked. I tried my Beef Classic with smoked ketchup, grainy mustard, pickles and jalapeno peppers.   The perfect pairing is the fifty-fifty mix of regular and sweet potato home cut fries and an ice cold Ontario craft beer.  Best of all is the frozen custard, a creamy type of ice cream. As far as I can tell Woody's is the only spot in Toronto that has frozen custard on the menu."}
{"text":"Burger tasted great. The fries were a bit soggy. I hope to come back here again and try more menu items."}
{"text":"First thing I notice about Woody's is all the flies that are there. Seeing them leaving unattended bucket of uncooked fries hovered by tons of flies was a big turn off.  Regardless, I got the poutine and the Coronary Burger!! It was a massive burger was hard to hold it and not drop anything. The patty was a little overcooked and dry other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Location/Service: Restaurant is along Lakeshore - limited parking is available, but there could be more along the streets at the back.  Inside is modern yet with a classic burger joint feeling to it - you ordered at the cash, find your own spot and wait for the pickup.  Staff were nice and made sure you have the toppings that you wanted for the burger. Note the food is made fresh - so it can take up to 10-15 minutes.  But they give you a little buzzer that notifies you when it's done (a little nice gesture).   Food: They have regular and specialty burgers - price difference is not huge.  So I went adventurous and tried the California Burger.  It has pesto mayo, guacamole, fried onions and classic beef patty.  The buns were very crispy (which adds extra points for me) and the portion was enough to fulfill the late night craving I had.  The patty was also juicy and done to the right moment.  Unfortunately I didn't have any picture because I was very hungry and devoured it pretty quickly - but it's a good hip burger joint to come for a quick bite or small catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Woody's took over the old Marky's BBQ spot, which, was a higher overall price point.  It's great to have a burger place in the neighbourhood, and they do a decent job.  I like the variety available on the menu, that there are many options to try and like.  Woody's served me, my wife, and our 1 year old boy well."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the alpine burger. Great fries and the turkey burgers are great. Service is inconsistent. but the product is great."}
{"text":"Best burgers in toronto and worth the trip out of town. Unreal toppings and great fries and poutine. I always take the chance to stop by if I can. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"Tried the veggie burger and a California Burger. The veggie burger was crumbly and didn't taste good at all. The California Burger was just decent. For people to say this is the best burger place in the city doesn't make any sense to me. Perhaps these people have never ventured east into Toronto and actually eaten a burger that tastes like real food"}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger at the moment.  The flavour added by the wood burning grill makes a huge difference and makes them unique.  You can get a burger cooked on a flat top griddle almost anywhere.  (Which is not a bad thing always...just too common).  I almost always order their stuffed cheese burgers.  The meat stays so juicy with the cheese cooked inside.  They have really good topping options...although I try not to complicate the cheeseburger too much and try to enjoy the fundamental flavours and texture.  Order your burger with a side of 50/50 Fries and sweet potato and you will be smiling."}
{"text":"Always passed this place every morning on the way to work.  Decided to try this place out with my co-workers and oh my word it was pretty tasty.  I had the Boom burger. Holy gigantic! Pretty good :) my friends had the 4 cheeseburgers and they loved it.  Fries were amazing. The small fries is alot! Great for sharing especially after eating a gigantic burger."}
{"text":"Wow, my best friend took me here, and was completely blown away, the burgers are uniquely grilled over a real wood fired grill, smoking and charring the burger incredibly well. The burger actually had a pink smoke ring just like a smoked brisket, very impressive! I got the cheddar cheese stuffed burger, and their fresh and delicious yukon gold fries. Prices are decent, about $9+ a burger..   The burger was large, likely a 1/2lb burger, the bun was brioche style and fresh. Sitting here writing this the morning after, im still blown away and would actually go back tonight if i could (too far for me, you guys need a shop downtown!)  The burgers take a while to cook because its not traditionally made, so if you go, expect to wait 15 or so to get your food. Its totally worth it. Love this place! One of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite after the movies, found Woody's on Yelp and highly rated. Great corner location with an outdoor patio, and they sell beer which goes great with burgers!  An Ok burger, but nothing spectacular. The buns were off, perhaps they should toast them. It is my firm belief that the bun makes the burger as the bread makes the sandwich! Poutine was also ok, again lacking in flavor. Plenty of topping options, perhaps too many.  A great place for a beer & burger if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Definitely in my top 5 best burgers in Toronto. The cook was very friendly and seemed to love what he does.  The inside is a little cramped for seating but go on a nice day for lunch and the east facing patio which faces a quiet side street will be great!  I had the Bistro burger combo which wasn't too cheap (rounded to $12). It was delicious though and came topped with brie, mushrooms, sautéed onion, and whatever other toppings you wanted. Their aioli topping was a great choice. If that burger doesn't sound good to you then they had a lot of neat specialty burgers with things like fresh salsa or I believe avacado on them.   If you're a girl like me with a moderate appetite than the fries are overkill and all you really need is the burger. That being said, the fries were delicious and I miraculously found room :)  Recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here last night and it did not disappoint.  It's tucked away on a side street off lakeshore west, so its possible to just drive by it but you'd be missing out.  The staff is very friendly and interior is nice and clean.  As for the food, the burger is sublime, great flavour, texture, and cooked perfectly.  I was surprised to read people saying theirs was overcooked.  Ours came out perfectly pink in the middle, juicy, and only took about 10 minutes.  The fries were equally amazing, perfectly fried and salted, and a huge portion for $2.50.  We got a salad as well and as much as it goes against my dirtbag values, it was amazing.  They have a homemade dressing with great herb flavouring, cilantro, parsley, etc. Deliciousness.  Definitely in my top 5 burger and fries joints, I just wish it wasn't so damn far!"}
{"text":"Woody's serves up a really decent burger.  The patty is flavourful and juicy and the bun is soft. I had the four cheese burger and could tell by the taste that they were using high quality ingredients.   The sweet potato fries are quite soggy, so the burgers are what I would reccomend coming here for.   Kudos to the girl working the front of the house. Somehow she manages to handle Uber Eats orders, phone-in order and walk in customers with a smile on her face."}
{"text":"If you are a burger lover you gotta try this place!  Bison burger is really good! The grill is fire not electric. The whole area smells delicious. Their pooled pork is pretty good too! I will give this place four star rating! One little suggestion! They can maintain their washroom a a bit better!  It's not a fancy restaurant but the food is real good!"}
{"text":"Good menu selection with some good burger options.  The fries weren't they great though.  The regular fries were ok but the sweet potatoe fries were way over cooked and burnt and the poutine was dying for fresh curds instead of mozzarella.  Also the resturant is very small and hot, we went during the night and can't imagine how hot it gets inside during a hot summer day.  I would go back to Woody's if in the area and wanted a burger, but would stick to only a burger.  No more of these fries for me please."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place ages ago and finally made it.  Virtually every positive I heard about this place was fully accurate, from the high quality beef, numerous choices of high-quality toppings, wood-fired grill, great value and others.  I went for the 'California Burger' which had guacamole, salsa, pesto mayo, crispy onions and a few other things. There were numerous choices for toppings, but I decided it really could only use another, which were the roasted red peppers. I also ordered the '50/50' fries which are a mix of potato and sweet potato fries.  The quality of every ingredient was top-notch and the taste was excellent. Again, can't say enough about the quality and taste of the beef.  It's true the seating is a bit awkward, but I think it can be explained by the fact they're trying to fit as many seating spaces as they can in a fairly tight area.  The value here is phenomenal and altogether the bill was about $13.50 which also included a pop. Within this price range, Woody's absolutely deserves 5 star as they're amongst best in class in that regard."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGG burgerssss!! I had the alpine with ketchup coleslaw and jalapeños which was amazing! The alpine comes with fried onions, mushrooms bacon and Swiss and I think some horseradish sauce which is to die forrrr. Service is good, not too slow. Patio is nothing special but almost everything on the menu is. Laid back atmosphere ! But beware not open too late! I would call before I come I evoke be they close at 10 (not sure if summer hours are different)! Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pure awesomeness. Highly recommend the blue cheese stuffed burger. Oh and those fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Driving along Lakeshore with my pal, he said dont you feel like a burger. I said no.  Anyways we pull into this corner and it is the most hip, cute spot ever.   The place is tiny, there are only 6 booths, and then a 5 seater bar with tvs.   It is not at all fast food. Give yourself about 20 mins before your burger is made and your buzzer buzzes off for you to go top it.  All the options were neatly written on a huge chalk board .To give you an idea of how small this place is, if you back up to read the chalk board, you may back up into the booth and people eating.  Tandoori Chicken burger. Turkey Burger. Coronary burger. Guac, different opinions, pulled pork. HUGE BURGERS.  Anyways to the point I had a turkey burger. I cant say I loved it. It was okay, it was dryish, and the toppings seemed skimpy.  Trying to be good so no fries no drink, but the burger was decent.  I would go back here to try something different.   Neat and tidy and clean. this place also offers several newsprint dailys -globe/sun/star.  The guys behind the counter are cool kids."}
{"text":"Once you've had a burger here....everyone else's are secondary.  Fries- share them...cause the burgers are huge and delicious! Beer is always cold.... Smell the smoked meat all over the area...and once you have sat and eaten there....You become addicted. I decided to start and eat through the menu...Have not had one that I did not thoroughly enjoy!  Go...and enjoy your eating and ambiance...which is unpretentiously cool."}
{"text":"You know what- it was not a bad burger. Just the price I paid was not equivalent to the service and for one main reason:  The guy was bringing in a tray of fresh patties. I seen some water drip onto my plate from the tray, he even made a disgusted look. When I mentioned it, he played dumb.  Also my bun was frozen, and when I Told him that it was, they offered me a heated bun. However all my toppings and sauces were already on the old bun. How am I going to transfer that taste. I didnt bother to make a fuss about it. However- service was wack. I'd rather just go their sister store the empenada company."}
{"text":"Burger is great.fries & sweet potato fries are on the salty side. They taste delicious however after finishing half of it you feel stuffed with greasy oily fries. If you eat here regularly you will get fat or unhealthy. Prices are average but can be on the pricey side"}
{"text":"Had a really disappointing and frustrating experience here. After my friend had talked up Woody's Burgers, we drove all the way out from downtown for dinner. We placed our order and went to wait on the patio with the buzzer. After about 45 minutes and another couple letting us know that they had already received their food and were there way after us, we went to inquire at the counter and were told that the ticket didn't get entered correctly and our food wasn't in line to be made.  The front of house person was clearly sorry about the mix up and told the cook, who decided that shrugging was the most helpful response. She asked again if he could bump our burgers up and make them immediately, and he said there were \"a bunch of orders ahead of ours\" that he had to make first and that we'd have to wait at least thirty more minutes. I'm not even going to write anything further about that response as it's so ridiculous and illogical that it hurts my brain. An hour of time wasted and left hungry and upset.  We grabbed the business card of the manager and sent a detailed and pretty polite email under the circumstances describing the situation, expecting them to be horrified at their employee's complete lack of customer service, but instead they didn't even bother to write back.  Super poor all around. I certainly won't be spending my money there and will be warning others to avoid it as well. With so much competition in the burger space, you'd think restaurants would be a little more careful in how they treat their customers but I guess Woody's DGAF."}
{"text":"AMAZING BURGERS! They aren't cheap by any means but the burgers are really tasty. I have been meaning to try their beers they have on tap one day. I've tried a lot of burger places and I am bit of a burger snob and this hits the spot. They have interesting condiments like fried onions - nice little crunch factor to your burger."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while and we've been going here for about just as long.  Their menu hasn't really changed much as far as the staples are concerned although they did add different beers now.  Parking you'll most likely have to find nearby as it is limited on the southside of Lakeshore but there are some nearby side streets as well.    The addition of the outdoor seating was a nice touch because inside could easily get congested and it was hard at times to find seating.  Indoors you could also get overwhelmed by the smoky smell if you don't like that sort of thing.  Remember that they are cooking with wood so of course it will get that smoky smell everywhere inside.  The way this place works is that you order at the cash and then they call you up when it's ready to dress the burger with any other toppings you may wish to add.  You can get sauces or pickles, anything basically on the side if you want as well.  If you want say chipotle sauce for your sweet potato fries on the side for instance.  I've had several of the burgers but my favorite is definitely the coronary.  I'm a big fan of adding a fried egg to meat.  I've not had any of the pulled pork before but my wife has and she says they are great.  We've also had the mac and cheese and it is a really big portion and filling as well.  That in itself is really considered a meal, not a side because of the portion size of it.    The burgers themselves are not gigantic but they are not intended to be nor to they have to be.  They are freshly made wood grilled burgers and that in itself is something you don't see just anywhere which makes this place special.  The cheese stuffed burgers are unique as well.  The coronary is one of those as well.    Overall this place makes a pretty special and unique product that is not common and the quality is consistent as well as the pricing is not so out of line for something that is really your gourmet burger kind of place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the best burger in a long while at Woody's.  My Partner and I dropped by and enjoyed burgers and fries. The burger was charbroiled goodness--nice thick patty fully cooked but not dry.  I found the bun a bit too thick for my liking but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the burger.  I think I would prefer slimmer sesame seed type bun.   The topping choices were numerous and they are generous with portions. We enjoyed the Yukon gold fries they were cut and deep fried perfectly.  Service was excellent the cashier was super friendly."}
{"text":"Stop # 7  Another reason outside of my library goal to visit this area. As a burger guy, Woody's was on my list for too long and now I finally get to add it to list.  I wented with cheese stuffed  burger, large poutine and drink for about 16 buck and given and it was filling, given I had eaten about 2 hours before this, I dont know if that contributed to but I figured all the walking I did would have burned off that meal, their poutine was pretty big, at first it was short of gravy but a request for more solve that, and help melt the cheese more.   The extra gravy made it go from meh to good, the gravy itself was alright but i like melted cheese curd not lumps of cheese. The fries were good, I was here with a friend and his girlfriend, she said they need salt but I didnt really taste the problem  Between the burger and poutine it was great meal and worth the trip and the hype"}
{"text":"If you are craving a juicy delicious burger for the same price that you would pay at Hero Burger but better, come here! The high ratings for this place speaks for itself. Came here on a Friday evening and this burger joint was bustling. You could smell the smokehouse flavour as you approach the restaurant. The burger patties are made from scratch so expect to wait at least 15-25 minutes for your freshly made burger. My group ordered several burgers ranging from the classic beef burger to their signature burgers such as the Toyko burgers. All of which were cooked to perfection. The only thing I didnt like so much was that I found the patty more on the saltier side. Overall, great food, casual atmosphere, and decent service."}
{"text":"You can always tell a place by how busy it is, not the biggest place so thought I'd takeout but a seat came up just as soon as my food was about to be ready, amazing food and service can't wait to try more of what they have to offer!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service-great burgers-GREAT value! This is currently my favourite burger joint. Their scrumptious meat patty is legitimately the definition of fresh burgers prepared right. Most of their burgers run under $10 with the choice of various customization. Unlike most burger places, the patty is still juicy and think coming out of the grill top. The warmth of the shop was created by the light saturation with the sweet fragrant of burning wood used. The buns they use are nicely soft to absorb the sauces that I so frequently slather on top, yet was resilient enough not to fall apart into a sloppy blob. The sweetness given off by the bread balanced the taste of the meat quite well. I rarely ever play it by the KISS (keep it simple stupid) rule, but this would be one exception I would be willing to make. The burgers are out of the WORLD!  There are other items such as fries and sweet potato fries, I like it, and however, they are not the crispy kind. They used a variety of potato that gave their fries a nice chewiness rather than the usual starchy kind. The sweet potato fries are good but also do not have that crunch I normally like. Passable was the coleslaw. I did not enjoy the dressing as it had more of a pickle water taste to it, plus the portion was not that appealing either. They also offer mac and cheese, I have yet to try. They have a few type of local draft beers and ice creams available as a palate cleanser too.  Overall, this is a must try place for their burgers...well worth the travel and wait. Service is fast for the sheer volume of customers they get from time to time. We rarely waited more than 15 min for our food from time of order to delivery. It's a great place to enjoy a fast laid-back meal and take a chance to explore the surrounding local area."}
{"text":"our second time here!  the last time we went last friday and the place was packed.  constant flow of people staying in, on the patio, or taking out.  i had the alpine burger this time (last time i had the bistro) i liked to swiss cheese better than the brie on the burger. bf had the california twice (get the chipotle sauce!).  burger was moist.  as it was done using wood under the bbq, there was a nice smoky flavour to it.  this time we ordered to 50-50..fries cooked perfectly, not undercooked, not burnt!  if you like root beer, make sure u get the one on tap!  we also had the gananoque ipa - a good ipa!  place is comfortable, clean and good place to grab a burger! would go there a 3rd, 4th, etc, time for sure!  ok i am changing my rating to a 5 star now from a 4!  the more i go, the more i think this is my go-to spot for burgers.  they are just so juicy and so flavourful and i love their specialty burgers.  most recently i have been ordering the BOOM - Classic Beef burger with our house made pulled pork, grilled jalapenos, smoked gouda, fried onions, chipotle mayo and smoked ketchup.  it is amazing!!!  you can also add your own toppings on top - i get lettuce, tomato, and relish.  every time i come i get their barreled root beer!  most recently they serve frozen custard.  you have to try it!  it's so silky and smooth and it's like soft serve without the ice and artificial taste!  we ordered the vanilla as they sold out of their chocolate.  the frozen custard was heavenly - real vanilla beans were used.  we got them to go :)"}
{"text":"Haven't had a burger this good in a while. I got the cheddar stuffed patty. I was quite pleased with the selection of toppings, particularly having romaine lettuce instead of iceberg.  The wood makes it good :)"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries do not get any better than this.  These are the burger and fries by which all other burgers and fries must be judged.  It's almost always busy, but totally worth the wait. The smell outside from the wood fire will draw you in."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. Indifferent service but one comes for their proud food. Well crafted and delicious."}
{"text":"Woody's is our go to place for a quick and easy dinner.    Tonight, after an extreme delay on the TTC, Woody's was the dinner destination.   We arrived after 7:00, went to the counter to make our order and 2 of the 3 items we ordered were not available-   We made alternate orders however I felt a little perturbed.   Now, the hostess came over and made an offer, even though it was simple, she made everything better with an offer of ice cream.    She turned a potential bad experience into a positive experience.   Thank you WOODYS."}
{"text":"For a joint that specializes in gourmet burgers this place was a pretty big disappointment. If you go by the majority of reviews then I'm the odd one out. Maybe, if you frequent fast food then this place is an upgrade but it is by no means a good burger by any stretch. It's a sad day when I can produce a better burger without trying. The patties are overcooked and the meat is compacted making for a heavy dense, uninspired burger. Won't be back"}
{"text":"My favourite burger place! You usually have to wait 15 minutes for your order but it's so worth the wait! They have a great selection of different toppings. Don't need a side of fries- the burgers are really filling!"}
{"text":"I was very excited for this place because of all good reviews but the burgers are just okay!"}
{"text":"My previous experiences are a 4 star but my last is a zero, so I am avg'ing it out to a 2 star.  Very recently, I came in for lunch, ordered my food at the front and sat down in the back.  As the kitchen is open to the dining area, I started noticing unsanitary actions by the cook.  It started off by him putting empty and dirty shipping boxes from food (meat? produce?), ON TOP of the food prep area to cut it down for disposal.  As soon as I noticed this, I felt something was off, and I started to pay close attention.  Once he threw out the boxes, he then decided to cut down the lettuce on the same prep area without washing his hands or the area itself.  Lettuce was removed from packaging, no washing of any kind (neither hands or the lettuce).  At the same time, a print out for more orders came in, where he started to handle raw meat with the same unwashed hands and putting it on the grill.  Again, no care to wash his hands before or after handling raw meat.  His shirt had massive holes in them too around the armpit areas which is surely unsanitary (and unprofessional) on a hot day.  The back door where the outside garbage bins are, was open to the kitchen the whole time.  At the same time, a young lady was doing some cleaning tasks.  I saw her pick up a wet, disgusting rag off the floor and threw it in the garbage.  Then using the same unwashed bare hands, to put boxes of new rags on top of the open toppings area to refill the stock below, I guess not a huge deal as she never really touched toppings themselves but still, she put dirty shipping boxes on top of food prep areas.  Not cool.  The final straw came when my burger was ready.  The cook used the same unwashed hands to pick up my cooked burger and buns and put the burger down on the same uncleaned prep area where he was cutting down the dirty food shipping cartons earlier.  Before he was going to start the process of adding my toppings, I asked him to wash his hands as I told him of the things I noticed him doing.  Of course, he denied it to my face.  I then cancelled my order.  The front cash lady was nice enough to apologize and give me a refund without any delays.  I used to be a regular here, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth so am unsure I will go back.  Surely, this would have failed any food safety inspection and hope management sees this, trains properly and enforces better standards.   I liked this place for it's reasonable pricing, good portions and variety of toppings but right now, I dry heave thinking of my experience.  So not sure if I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. Most of the time the burgers (and pulled pork) are five star. Every once in a while you might get a drier patty, or a brownish guac. But I am still a fan.  Staff can be a little friendlier, perhaps. I think the colder treatment we've got was from sort of management or sort of owners? which is strange, but we still fans of the food so we keep coming back! Try their sweet potatoes, and if the place is packed get take out and drive to one of the lakeshore parks (2 mins) and have a picnic on the beach. Do it while it's summer. It tastes even better out on the lake."}

They have the best combo's of burgers here and thus far I've tried the Tokyo (wasabi and ginger on a burger is such a treat), and The Four Cheese (a stuffed cheeseburger - oh yeah!)  Oh my, my mouth is watering just thinking about these delicious burgers!  Their fries are a must too, especially a fan of the option for 50/50 fries (regular and sweet potatoe fries).  I'm a Woody's fan forever!!  5 stars!  BRAVO"}
{"text":"Schöner kleiner Laden mit vielen Variationen von Burgern und der Möglichkeit einen eigenen zu kreieren. Das Fleisch wird auf einem Holzgrill zubereitet und schmeckt fantastisch. Das topping (Salat etc.) kann man bei Abholung an der Theke selber zusammenstellen.  Das Team ist sehr freundlich, schnell und entschuldigt sich vorab sollte die Bestellung länger als 15 Minuten benötigen, was eher selten der Fall ist. Aber das warten lohnt sich.  Mein Favorit ist der \"Four Cheese Stuffed\" mit Cheddar, Feta, Parmesan und Blauschimmelkäse. Das absolute Highlight für Burger- und Käseliebhaber."}
{"text":"You'd better be serious about your burger if you go here. This is not McDonald's.   What it is: thick juicy burgers cooked from raw, not frozen, over wood. Expect 20 minutes to have your burger. It's worth the wait.   My personal favourite: the \"Boom.\"  Beef, jalapeños, gouda, pulled pork, smoked ketchup, fresh bun. Awesome."}
{"text":"this place has such 5 star potential! Problem is their ever rotating staff make one wonder , and the fact that 3 times out of four I pick up an order to realize they gave me an incomplete order.... we are not talking forgetting ketchup on a burger...talking missing a drink or fries and having paid for it.  Their shakes are super yummy....too bad half the time they aren't available.   It looks like they may be expanding to the space next to them....I hope they can sort out their staffing issues because these are truly some tasty burgers!"}
{"text":"Pro:       Fried: A+      Fries are fantastic.  The seasoning on these fries are top notch.  I ordered small fries and they gave me plenty.   Con:     Burger: B  I ordered the Bison Burger.  The Meat was ok.  It tasted bit fake as if they had some fillers.  I am used to Bison meat and this one tasted not 100% authentic.  But I don't know for sure but I can say that the meat tasted adequate at best.  Toppings were scanty instead of generous.  But prices were very good.   They were late with my order - took 25 min, and when I expressed my concerned they gave me a free soda.  Verdict:  I am a fan.  I would try this place again.  My friend had the classic burger and she said it was good."}
{"text":"These burgers are huge.....well especially because I load up it up with toppings. They are really good. A must try."}
{"text":"Came here last minute a few fridays ago to get some carbs and beer before a night out. Got their poutine and asked for mixed fries a few minutes later which was accommodated with no issues.   The patio was nice to hang out at and have a beer while we waited for food. The cheese curds weren't as squeeky as I like em but it was still rly good. Remind me never to have sweet potato fries on a poutine again lol it's just not the same.   I salivated over their menu as I was eating, will come back to try their veggie burger and desserts.   Liked that they had more than a few good beer options :)"}
{"text":"Having been years ago it was overdue for a repeat. The beers on tap are great loved the Oast options. The half and half fries  sweet potato and regular are great. The Chipotle mayo is a great match.   Had the alpine burger great quality ingredients and just enough topping.  Busy spot so be prepared to share seating or wait a bit. Definitely good value for the price point. One star off for being out of ice cream the only dessert options."}
{"text":"Almost flawlessly scrumptious. It is difficult to criticize anything here. I never go for mac&cheese, however,  I took a chance and It was just so creamy and moist and simply yummy. Make sure to try different signature burgers. You won't regret."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and reasonable prices, what's not to love? Tried the alpine and classic beef burgers, they have an extensive topping bar and large variety of sauces. Do try one of their signature burgers was the pairing is very well done, and the small  fries is a great addition to the meal.   Parking can be found along the side of the streets off to the back of the restaurant, will definitely be back soon to get more burgers, this is better than most of the fancy burger places in dt TO, if you are a burger fan, you have to try this place out."}
{"text":"Really good, juicy burgers, super greasy and tasty. Their menu offers a choice of some really great toppings. Be careful, if you get a burger with cheese in the patty, it WILL ooze out the side, and it's steaming hot.   The fries were good but didn't stand out in the same way the burgers did.  Only regret was that we couldn't try their patio because we went on a rainy night."}
{"text":"Now I know that this can't and won't be a full review of Woody's because of my own, self-imposed limitation (that being that I'm a vegetarian). But I have a real passion for veggie burgers and for finding the best veggie burgers in the GTA and anywhere really! While it's great that pretty much everyone from the big chains down to the mom & pops has a veggie burger option I don't think I'll be ordering one from Woody's again. Despite the good reviews from carnivorous Yelpers I can't quite recommend it from a meatless POV.   Now the place was quite busy at about 3:00 PM on cold Saturday afternoon, so that must be a good sign. The sign above the cash indicates that all burgers are cooked to order so it might take up to twenty minutes. I wasn't in a hurry, so another good sign...I don't mind waiting for food done right, so long as it's worth the wait!  For a veggie burger with cheese, plus fries and beer it came to about fourteen bucks and change. Considering what other premium burger joints charge nowadays and the fact that I upsized (!!) to a beer this is actually pretty reasonable. After about a thirty minute wait (they did apologize at least) my burger was finally ready, although I noticed that several people who ordered after I did got theirs first. I swear that this isn't the first time this has happened and that there must be some sort of conspiracy against vegetarians at burger places. Either that or veggie burger take longer to cook for some reason.  The choice of toppings was pretty impressive with about eight different types of mayo and pretty much everything you can think of. The fixin's were plentiful and of high quality. That's what I liked about Woody's. The downside? Well it's a big one: the veggie burger itself. It was dreadful. It tasted as though it had been deep fried and fell apart as soon as I bit into it. It had this odd crunch consistency and not the most pleasant flavour. Waiting half an hour and paying close to $15.00? Not even close to worth it. The fries were also average which was pretty disappointing. Not bad but certainly not great or memorable.   Perhaps their \"normal people\" burgers are much better. The place was packed and the reviews are generally positive so I'm going to guess that they are. But as far as the option for us non-meat eaters, it's not spectacular. It's a shame really because I've been wanting and needing a good (veggie) burger place in Long Branch / Port Credit. I guess the search continues."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say!  This is hands down my favourite new burger place!  Had the burger with pulled pork on it and gouda cheese and it was incredible!  The poutine is definitely one of the must gets here!  Small place with a nice little patio where you order first, then wait for the buzzer and you get to pick your own toppings!  They also have beer and scoops ice cream.  Love the uniqueness of their menu especially the burgers and the prices are very good compared to a lot of other places"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places to grab a burger in the GTA. I had the stuffed cheese burger which was cooked perfectly and juicy. The burgers are grilled over wood which infuses the burgers with some sweet beautiful smoke. Fries are cooked perfect with good crisp, prices very fair based on portion and ingredient quality and they have some great brews by Oast on tap. Place fills up pretty quick but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Talk a live an authentically delicious burger. They have some amazing patties like elk, bison, and of course your classics."}
{"text":"I just do not get the fuss over this place. Been twice and both times the bun aNd the meat have been very, very dry.   Nice idea with the choose your own topping and so forth but the bun and the burger are, to be frank, well below par."}
{"text":"Came here after reading rave reviews from other elite members.  This restaurant is located close to the long branch loop, literally 1 block! There is little parking available so we parked at long branch go.  There is very limited seating available in the winter months as there is a large patio available outside however only about 10 tables inside the restaurant so you have to either take it to go or hope someone leaves.  The menu is quite large with plenty of non beef items. I ordered the memphis pulled pork sandwich with a garden salad. My sandwich was pretty tasty however it was cold in the middle. My salad was fresh however only one dressing is available for the garden salad. I shared some of my husband's poutine which was delicious.  The portion sizes for the sides are huge and can easily be shared.   Overall I was happy with this restaurant, the food was pretty good but could have been better.  The staff were very helpful and quick to clean our table, and the food came out quick.  Pricing was decent as you can get a combo with unlimited pop refills!   4/5"}
{"text":"Been to Lakeshore location of Woody's, great food! Saw earlier today via Uber Eats that another location exists @ Jane/Annette (Bloor). Ordered right away...food showed up looking nice! Great burgers no doubt and definitely do yourself a favor and get some poutine from here, just trust me."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is fresh and tastes pretty good, but a bit on the mushy side. Great selection of toppings and sides. The small caesar salad and small french fries are both large portions and delicious. The small coleslaw was tiny compared to the other portion sizes."}
{"text":"great burgers!  great sweet potato fries... bit slow, but good food takes time......."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about the burgers here but was disappointed.  I ordered the alpine burger but it was super super salty.  They also over toasted the bun so it was super crunchy.  It was a big burger patty and oddly dry.  It had the makings are something great but sadly failed to deliver.  I ordered a grilled cheese for kiddo and he was happy.  They served it a bit cold but that's fine for kids if it were for me I would have been disappointed by that too becuase I love the ooey-gooey goodness in a grilled cheese sandwich.  We ordered a large poutine to share.  Gross.  The gravy was super salty again.  Did they reuse gravy from yesterday and over salt it to hide lack of freshness?  Overall disappointing is the word for this place.  Is maybe try it again to see if the execution cold be improved.  It's got all the potential of something great."}
{"text":"Great burger spot! Small place but busy for a Monday night which can only mean one thing - good grub!! Tried the beef burger and the tandoori turkey burger plus fries. All hit the spot and tasted delicious!! LOTS of topping options like multiple cheese, mayo sauce and veggie options. Even add a fried egg if you want. Great place and yummy burgers with a casual setting and extremely nice staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great hamburger joint!  Not only are their burgers awesome but their fries are fantastic.  Place smells amazing when you walk in."}
{"text":"Overall a very poorly made burger and fries. Absolutely nothing special. Typical unpeeled Russet potato fries done poorly, and a burger that doesn't distinguish itself from any of the run of the mill products out there. I didn't try anything else on the menu. I would probably go back and give it another try with other items on the menu. But from what I saw of the staff working, I'm very skeptical that it would impress me."}
{"text":"Woody's is a really solid place to get a great burger.  The main thing I like about woody's is that it isn't too deep into the heart of downtown Toronto, but rather it's in Etobicoke.  Downtown Toronto is where most of the other good burger places are but traveling through all the traffic to get to these places is sometimes a pain.  The interior of Woody's is nothing spectacular, but not horrible by any means either.  For what it lacks in seating space inside the restaurant it makes up for by having outdoor seating as well, which is pretty nice except for the fact that you only get a view of Lakeshore road.  The service was fine although the burger did take quite a while to be prepared, about 20 minutes.  Not the longest amount of time I've ever had to wait but certainly not very quick either.  I tried their pulled pork burger known as the \"Boom Burger\" which came out to about $15 with fries and a drink.  The burger was pretty fantastic, with a generously large patty and some really tasty pulled pork.  The burger was a bit overcooked for my liking but it didn't really matter at all since it tasted so good.  The overall experience here was very positive.   Although it's not very close to where I live, Woody's is a good enough place that I'm sure I'll be returning several times in the future."}
{"text":"A recent visit to Woody's reminded me why I love this burger joint so much. Sure the mouthwatering, fresh and filling burgers are the main attraction, but I don't glaze over the sides and alternatives to burgers. I had the Cuban pulled pork sandwich during my last visit with a side of their fresh cut fries. With a healthy helping, I saved half for lunch the next day. Prices are comparable to other gourmet burger shops."}
{"text":"Woody's is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner. They serve up really delicious combinations is you order the specialty burgers! Also, their pulled pork poutine is absolutely delicious and filling.   I use to work here (at the Long Branch location) for about 1 year, as a cashier/ waitress, back in 2012, and at the time there was an older grandfatherly gentleman working the prep hours, he would make all of the burgers by hand from scratch, and cook the pulled pork overnight until it was super flavourful, tender, soft, and delicious!   Everything is made in-house, and it was great to see nothing preserved of prepackaged."}
{"text":"What this small burger joint doesn't have in size it makes up for in fries.  This place gets packed on your typical lunch day, so plan ahead.  They warn you that the burgers take 20 minutes to cook, which is a problem.  The 20 minutes it takes causes overcooking.  When I finally made it just about half-way through by cheddar-stuffed burger, I became keenly aware that this was perhaps the most overdone burger I've ever had.  Perhaps I was too focused on the amazing fries and cheese dripping out of my burger to notice how bad it really was.  Juicy and stuffed they were not.  Stuffed makes it sound like a Juicy Lucy.  However, this was more of a double cheese burger, with the cheese sitting between two patties.  Unfortunately that kills it for me.  However, not all was bad.  The french fries were really fantastic.  Opt for the 50/50 of Yukon gold and sweet potato fries.  No ketchup needed as these are some really great fries.  2 stars on the fries alone.  3 off for the overcooked burger.  Mostly street parking is available."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger and some patio time on one of those super warm March days!! Alas, Woody's actually doesn't open up their patio till April, said there was some sort of legal issue? Whatever!! All the tables and chairs were locked up to one side. It was really lame, my friend and I had to make do with one broken bench and one wobbly table, in the shady, unsunny side of the patio. Booo! It was such a disappointment.   Luckily, the burgers were really good. My burger was stuffed with gorgonzola, and perfectly cooked. Great bun too! I don't like a lot of stuff on my burger, but Woody's does have an amazing array of toppings available. They offer \"50/50 fries\", half sweet potato and half regular, and the portion size is just right. Service was a little slow, but not terrible. Will visit again once the patio is really open! :)   One final note: Seriously amazing people watching here. Fantastic entertainment!!"}
{"text":"Get a cheese-stuffed burger. My buddy did and I wish I had, too. There are a lot of toppings you can choose after your burger is cooked, so consider that when ordering initially. We did get outdoor seating and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"one of my favourite spots in the long branch area! such a good selection of huge burgers that taste amazing. i'm not even a burger person but this place keeps me coming back. I recommend the BOOM burger (comes with pulled pork) and half and half (sweet potato and regular fries)"}
{"text":"To me, Woody's and Five Guys have the best burgers dollar for dollar. I have found that Woody's burgers excel in taste and in the fact the bun is of perfect texture. The fries or sweet potato fried are very good, but could be cut thicker so as to not end up with a ton of small bits at the bottom of the serving. The place is very small so good luck getting a seat. Soft drinks are refillable, so take your cup to the front for more pop!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in TO! A lack of pretension and not too many Hipsters. Nice beer selection and a great patio. I have never been disappointed with the food there. As mentioned, the burgers are really large and filling. Very good and it's nice to see some other nice businesses popping up such as Fair Grounds and the Empanada around."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want a made-from-scratch burger with dozens of fresh toppings and sauces. They take pride in their burgers and it shows. Love it here. Their fries are great as well! Oh and while you are there, try the Oast Barnraiser beer, my favorite."}
{"text":"I must have been in at an off time. The reviews are great so I was disappointed when after a long wait I got a dry, over-cooked burger on a stale bun with soggy lettuce.  I try to say something good in my reviews and I can say the place seems cool. Maybe I'll stop by for a drink on the patio."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times since they opened 6ish years ago. It's always been an absolutely rest to come here. The food is all homemade and fresh. The Mac and cheese is especially delicious"}
{"text":"Tucked away at a corner on Lakeshore Etobicoke, this spot is pretty amazing. Mind you, this didn't make it to my top burger places list, but their burgers aren't bad.   Let's take a tour:  Nice patio outside, perfect for summer nights. Walk in - cute diner seats on the left, open kitchen and big chalkboard menu on the right.   Menu:  The list is long. Prepare to stare at it for 10 minutes and not immediately know what to pick if it's your first time here. I went with the simple Beef Stuffed Cheddar and my boyfriend picked a specialty burger - The Bistro. We decided to share a half and half large sweet potato and normal fries. BAD IDEA. Why? Keep reading.   Food:  Portions are massive. I had trouble finishing my burger and between the two of us, we barely finished the fries. Fries were \"meh\". I don't get why people are raving about these sweet potato fries. They are different... in the worst kind of way... TOO DAMN SWEET.   Service:  Friendly. Although the cashier didn't help us save any cost - combo (burger-fries-drink) is almost the same price as burger-fries... and she didn't tell us so when we ended up taking burger-fries. When I went back for a drink, I had to pay for it separately. The chefs behind the counter are super nice. Our fries got cold during Mission Munch (burger eating). So I requested the chefs to reheat them... and they did without a \"but\" ... How nice!   Price: $4.95 for fries... pricey!  Verdict:  Come summer, I am going back to this place for a burger night on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is small, has only 3-4 booths, same for party of 2, and some single seats along the back. Either be prepared to wait or go for takeout or wait for summer.  I got the coronary burger & was not impressed by it. I was surprised the Guy's asking what I want on it. Why don't they make it how they describe it? I had to ask for the onions that it was supposed to have!! They should just ask, do you want any other additional toppings? The burger looked under cooked & I was embarrassed to tell them to cook it more!! It was a BIG MISTAKE, felt sick later in the evening!! I don't know if I would go back here!!  My friend ordered the 50/50 fries, half sweet potatoes & half regular. We were surprised when the fries were served to us burnt! That was rude , & the cashier was surprised I brought it back to get unburnt fries!! You expect us to eat fries we paid for that was burnt, black colour to it!!! Shame on you & the guys to give burnt fries. It wasn't even very good . It wasn't even crispy!! Burger Priest is way better. (It's on the queensway near Kipling)  Another thing it was rude of cashier coming to get our plates....hint hint to leave! They should post a sign then, time limit to sit. There was a man in next booth, he had it to himself! Meanwhile there was three of us, seemed kind of racist..we were Asian & he was Caucasian."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fries are excellent, but the reason to go is the awesome burgers with the amazing range of toppings offered.  Small hardy noticeable place, only found it from the smell of the wood burning grill as I was driving by.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Anytime you're cooking meat over wood I'm game.  The difference between cooking over wood vs. On a griddle where you just set the temperature, is it requires a lot  more attention and care on behalf of the chef.  I hate writing bad reviews when you see a place making attempt to do something different that actually has huge impact on food quality.    So if you're the owners of Woody's here's my sum up of you're Jane Street location.    Kids and families:  first of all you're not in South Etobicoke you will not have the corporate clientele as you do in Etobicoke you are dealing with households that have a higher median income and roughly 1.5 children per house. That being said, you need a better kids menu That's not simply cheese  between a burger bun.  Just walk over to Queen Margherita you'll realize they have three seatings and it all revolves around the age of kids. They do an excellent job at servicing families and I assure you it has nothing to do with the quality of their pizza because that is subjective  Consistent: people in this area want consistent and predictable service. They do not care about price and if they do they are not your Market.    Solution:  I have been to this location now 5 times and there's been a large variance in your product and service quality.  Back of house's attention to detail, energy, and their station management is poor. Front-of-house management is not much better and lacks intuition.    I wish you all the best of luck because I think you have the tools to be very successful in this area.   Cheers"}
{"text":"If you're driving in the area with your windows down, you will be forced to face that undeniable scent of charbroiled beef. It's intoxicating. I left a trail of drool behind me as I mindlessly wondered inside like a zombie seeking brains.   Solid menu for a burger joint. 'The Coronary' features a bleu or cheddar cheese stuffed burger, fried onions, bacon, and a deliciously fried runny egg right on top. Not for those watching their weight, or cholestoral, or calories, or anything besides the  bad ass burger on the tray in front of you.  The wait is a bit long.. 10-20 minutes, but they ARE made to order, so if that's important to you, you can stand it.   The fries are OK, 50/50 split with sweet potato and regular is a cool option. Would like to go back to try their pulled pork selections....although I'm not sure if i would be able to resist the call of straight up BEEF."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and I will never come back nor recommend this place. I wanted to come here for awhile now because I kept hearing about this place on BlogTO. Went here on Saturday and placed more order by 1:10pm and sat down and started to wait. I should've known that it would be slow because after you order, they give you pager to let you know when you're food is ready. When I got there around 1pm, it was pretty empty. Only 1 table inside and a few outside occupied. I ordered a Beef Stuffed Cheddar burger and a side of regular fries. I sat and waited till 1:37pm till my pager went off. I am certain of this time because I sat and watched CP24 while waiting for my food. How does it take 30 mins to cook a burger?!?! The place was even empty too because the girl made a comment to her colleagues \"how come its so dead on a Saturday?\", which they replied \"Why did you say that? you just jinxed it!\". The funny part about this was that literally 5 mins after she said that, people started coming in and kept coming in until I got my food.  When my pager went off and I went up to create my food, I will say that they do offer a pretty big selection of toppings you can have on your burger, which is always a plus. However, the burger itself was so dry and over like cooked. I guess thats why it took so long cause they probably forgot about it. The stuffed cheddar part....there was none. There was hardly any cheddar in the patty. Also I found the portion size of the patty to be very small. If I'm paying almost $8 for a burger i would at least expect it to be at least 8oz or bigger. I would say that the burger was about 5oz.  I guess I must've came on the wrong day cause all the other reviews on here for this place makes it seem like Woody's is the best burger in town. I will agree to disagree that this is probably one of the worst burger joints I've been too."}
{"text":"Great burgers and a great selection of toppings!  Serving of fries is huge, so I find it's best to share.  Milkshakes are also great... Who doesn't love a cheeseburger and shake?  There's a fun chalkboard wall for kids too.  I've only gone in to eat, but they do takeout as well (pick-up)."}
{"text":"Visited the Lakeshore location several times so I was very excited when this location opened up. Had the 'coroner' burger and a poutine. Delicious!   Though perhaps a bit more than I should eat in one sitting!  I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"It's a burger place where you order at the counter, take a buzzer then come back to pick up your food when its ready. No servers which I wasn't expecting but the service was still great.  We ordered veggie burgers with sweet potato fries and they were awesome. Hand made veggie patties with plenty of flavor in crazy fresh buns. This is now one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Finally a decent looking casual restaurant in the neighbourhood! Sadly after my first visit I'm still left craving more.  The burger menu looks extremely appetizing with very appealing flavour combinations. But it's the execution that's lacking big time. The idea of being able to add wasabi or curry to your burger says to be me that this place must be risk takers and serious about offering big flavours. Instead I got the opposite. My burger was topped with such small amounts of each topping I began to wonder if someone in the back messed up the order. Cooked toppings such as caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms were ice cold. Sadly the burger patty was no saving grace. It was overlooked, dense, and lacked the juiciness that you'd expect from a gourmet burger. Kind of reminds me of a homemade barbecue where the host got a little too ambitious with the flavours and didn't bother to cook the party properly. If you are craving a gourmet burger with adventurous toppings I would stick to The Works which is a similar concept except they seemed to have the execution piece nailed down.  I have been back several times since my original visit, but only for the poutine. They do theirs with thick cut truck style fries and loads of dark gravy which is just how I like my poutine."}
{"text":"I like to say that I have tried a lot of different burger shops in town from burger priest to gangster burger to burger legend in Mississauga, but this place is probably my favourite. Their meat is locally raised and you can taste that in the quality of the meat. Also all of there ingredients are fresh and you can choose exactly what you want on your burger.   I tried the bistro burger which comes with Brie cheese, onions and Dijon mustard. When I saw the burger I knew it was going to be good because it was stacked high with topping and a thick piece of beef right in the middles.   My friends had the alpine and tandoori burger. The alpine burger visually looked amazing with melted cheese, bacon and mushroom. This is what I will get next time.   The tandoori burger wasn't that great, but if you are looking for a chicken burger it is the best one.   This is one of those places you tell all of your friends about."}
{"text":"Just had the pleasure to try Woody's delicious veggie burger ($6.95)! It's chickpea-based and made fresh at the restaurant, you can choose from a nice variety of toppings and at least 5 different hot sauces, which is impressive! Most burger places have only 2 hot sauces to choose from.  We also ordered a small green salad ($2.95), which was very filling all on its own and a large order of 50/50 fries (sweet potato & yukon gold) $4.95, they were delicious, we could barely breathe after sharing all this food between 3 people, everything was so good! Of'course, I also had to try the Woody's draft, which was pretty good :)"}
{"text":"Been here many times and love this place. Cuban is my favorite."}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars.  After I saw my friend's picture of his turkey burger and sweet potato fries I knew I just had to try Woody's out. So yesterday we trekked out to Woody's to devour some amazing burgers and fries. We somehow managed to get lost when Dixie Road turned into North Service Road lol.  When we finally arrived the 3 of us ordered the alpine, turkey, and burger stuffed cheddar with a side of regular and sweet potato fries. Luckily the patio wasn't busy so we got to eat outside. It took about 15-20 minutes for our buzzer to tell us that our burgers were ready. Omg, my burger was so HUGE that I had to eat it in sections because my mouth couldn't fit it all in (why does this sound so dirty?)! The sweet potato fries were sooo good! You don't even need to dip it in their spicy chipotle mayo but I used it anyway.  The only minor flaw was that my burger bun was falling apart.  If you want a freshly made local burger that is made from scratch choose Woody's. It's definitely tastier and cheaper than ordering a burger at a restaurant.   I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"So let's start with something critical, the food is good. But not something memorable. I'd say three star food.   Ok, on to the rest: this place is trying to occupy an awkward space between fast food and gourmet burgers in a world full of the \"quick serve\" Chipotle style \"fast casual\" eateries. I'd say they do ok. Decent beer list, fun combinations of food, and tv's to keep you occupied. The problem is the food takes just slightly too long if there's a line, then there's not enough seating to really enjoy the beer you drink while you wait. Now keep in mind I was here in the winter, and they have a patioto expand in the summer, but I assume it would be equally busy.   Now, all of this said, I could see it being worth it considering the menu's creativity, but the food was simply a combination of the ingredients stated with a decent base burger patty. There was nothing that set that creative combination above the cut of a diner putting on those ingredients nor did it even come close to true gourmet burger that comes from top quality beef. It just felt like each bite left me hanging, waiting for the combination of flavors to meld and hit my toungue with an awe inspiring snack. Sadly, I kept waiting during the whole meal. The salad had great dressing, but the ingredients were cheap. The bison was lean and flavorful but the Tokyo combo was just a combo with each flavor separate. It just seemed unbalanced, like a kid who just took his training wheels off. Wobbling, but not falling, making it to the end of the cul-de-sac just barely staying on.   Overall, it would have gotten three stars if the register attendant wasn't so nice. She was kind enough to ask a group to split off an empty table so I could sit down. Then she cleared my dishes and made sure I finished my beer before I left. Good people put this place to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Out go-to burger place in the area and definitely on par with the best burgers in Toronto.  Yes, as numerous people, have noted -- the burgers are made and grilled to order (15-20 mins typically, I've found), so this is not a fast-food type of joint! Luckily, there are some great Ontario craft beers on tap to help you kill the time.   And the fact that they are wood-grilled not only adds to the taste, but makes the whole area around the joint smell amazing. Seriously, when the breeze is blowing right, you can smell Woody's as you drive along Lakeshore -- more than once, this has been the impetus behind a last-minute burger order.  The classic burger is a solid staple, but Woody's specialty burgers have to be tried as well. I personally go for the Alpine or the Bistro + 50/50 fries, of course. (half yukon gold, half sweet potato)  Nice patio on the side of the building which makes spring/summer visits that much better."}
{"text":"In the world of fancy, expensive burgers, there are many entrants.  But few real winners.  This place gets the gold star!  Burgers range from 7.50 for a classic, to 10 bucks for something fancy.  The classic is all you need, as most of the delicious toppings (jalapeños, mushrooms, olives, fried onions, and more) can be put on any burger.  Adding eggs and pulled pork is where you start increasing to fancy land.  And while that's delicious, it's only for the true glutton!  Sides are a bargain, with 4 dollars for small fries, and 5 dollars for large.  Small is easily enough for two people to share, and large is a meal into itself.  You can get beer (tall boys, bottles, or draft) or wine.  But a glass of unlimited soda for 1.75 also does the trick.  Two fancy burgers, two soda, and giant fries came to $35.00 all in.  And unlike other places, the burger alone is enough to fill you up.  Everything else is extra.  Now, the best part, even in winter it's warm inside.  And it's spacious.  I was able to pull my son's stroller in, grab a high chair for him, and never feel cramped.  Even full there's plenty of room.  Comfort trumps squeezing in extra tables here.  And just for an extra delight, the bathroom is ground floor, big enough to fit a stroller in, and super clean.  All in all, I picked the right place for my birthday.  This place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in Etobicoke. Fresh and tasty toppings, quality beef (or it tastes like quality beef), and awesome sides. They must put some kind of spice or herb into the fries cause there's a distinctively yummy crunch to them. Nothing beats sitting outside with a beer and burger on a summer's day."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place...walked by after attempting to get tamales to no avail at The Empanada Company, the smell drew me in.  I have to say that the Tokyo Burger with fried egg that I got was delicious, as were the hand cut fries and the Caesar Salad.   The place is a nice space with a great patio.  The customer service was good, except I could hear the cooks using the F-bomb in the back area that was out of the line of site of customers.....while children were in the dining area.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that I was told they were out of ice cream because the delivery person did not show up , so no milkshakes.....so why not send someone to buy some across the street at Shoppers Drugmart...or at the ice cream shop directly across the street.  I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious, we've always had good burgers from here. They're thick and lush but just be prepared to wait a good half an hour to 45 min before receiving it as their service is kind of slow at rush hours. I've down voted it from a 4 to a 3 because of the long wait time."}
{"text":"Yuuuum.   Okay. So, the usual - nice people, good space (although the skeleton thing might freak out your little kids), good service, and good food.   Bonuses - you can order a mix of sweet potato and regular fries, the veggie burger is pretty phenomenal, and you can have whatever toppings you want.   To note - the kids burgers are huge... For real. Little guys can share, and less hungry adults could be happy with them. They also take a while, so expect to wait fifteen minutes or more... Which makes sense for fresh cooked stuff.   They have a second location now, I think, on Jane Street. And they're worth visiting fo'sho... Just don't be on a diet or expect to leave anything less than stuffed :)"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you will notice the sweet smell of wood burning, and the food will be just as good  Food:  Got the The Boom (burger with with pulled pork on top) and a chocolate peanut-butter shake. The burger was really large and I was glad I did not end up getting fries as well. The whole thing ended up being just over 12.   Next time I would not get pulled pork on the burger, just one of the flavors was enough.  Locale: It has a large patio for the summer, and a handful of booths inside for winter."}
{"text":"Woody's makes amazing pulled pork sandwiches. A previous reviewer complained about the food taking a while, but it's good?.... Good food takes longer than a minute. If you are looking for Arby's or Burger King than you are in the wrong place. The cuban pulled pork sandwich is so tasty and would rank as one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in the GTA. It has sliced pickle, swiss cheese, smoked bacon and chiptole mayo. Not only are the toppings top notch but they make their own bread too. And if you aren't into that there are plenty of other specialty pulled pork sandwiches and burgers to choose from. On top of it all, they sometimes have root beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Excellent, distinct tasting burgers. It's a one of a kind burger place and it's absolutely delicious with great friendly staff. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you have lots of time to spare waiting for an ok burger, then this place is for you! 25 minutes to get serve a burger is just way too long. I have wasted my time, money and yes, precious calories on this place! I wish that I would have gone to McDonalds and either have the same experience, if not better. Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad. Thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Boo!!!  It's amazing how this place is still getting a very high rating."}
{"text":"What kills it at Woody's is the wait-time.  It took at least 20-25mins for my buzzer to go off.  Yes, there is a sign which reads that they made burgers to order, but up-to 25mins?  Not very reasonable, in my opinion.  After having this place bookmarked for months - if not a year - I finally made it out with a buddy who was up for a burger!  Burger itself was good, could've been a bit juicier, but I was uber hungry by the time I finally got my food.  Fries were seasoned very well.  I really liked them!  Prices were very decent, just under $8 for a classic burger.  I didn't feel a need to order a specialty burger since there is an array of toppings.   I'd go again, but bring a friend so you can have a long convo without feeling the time pass by &/OR prepare to shell out money for a craft beer and sip it...rrreeeeal...slooooow."}
{"text":"Poutine is excellent, Burger was ok a bit on the dry side , good portion of meat and nice variety of toppings."}
{"text":"I had a stuffed burger and my friend had pulled pork. They stuffed my burger with the wrong kind of cheese (blue, too, which is strong) but it was a great burger nonetheless. I love pulled pork but wasn't feeling like it that day, but when I saw my friend's I knew without a doubt that's what I would have next time. Overall, a yummy burger but the pulled pork seems to be what makes this place. I plan to return to try it!"}
{"text":"Soooooo gooooood!! Definitely worth the wait, and the drive to Long Branch!  Thick, juicy burgers with super fresh buns and toppings. Jumped into my top 3 burger places in Toronto with just 1 visit!"}
{"text":"Burger tasted good, and service was great. But the burger I got didn't come with the toppings it was supposed to come with. (Boom Burger -- topped with pulled pork, received no pulled pork)  I got it for takeout, and didn't check it till I got home. Spent $12 on just the burger, and missed half of it."}
{"text":"By far the best burgers in this entire city. The place is always busy and the food is always great. I recommend The Alpine burger with the works. Amazing food friendly staff. Don't forget to grab yourself a local beer to wash down the burger. Fries are off the hook as well.don't forget the chipotle mayo"}
{"text":"We visited this address a few times in the mid 2000's when it was Freshwood Bistro and it was around a three star place.  Well I am happy to report the new owners have upped the ante and the burger is a solid four. It is kind of an awkward spot for a sit down meal but we look forward returning when the weather finally allows comfortable patio seating."}
{"text":"As a treat for my sister's birthday, and on her recommendation, we went to Woody's. I had never been before and I was quite impressed by the array of options on the menu board.   Each description sounded delicious, and although it was hard to choose, I finally selected the stuffed cheddar burger and a side order of poutine.   Although my poutine was somewhat mediocre, my burger was simply awesome. It was very thick, perfectly grilled and had the right amount of cheese. Each bite was amazing!  The restaurant is nice, a bit on the small side. I assume there's more room in the summer tome as they have a patio attached to the building. There is little in the way of parking as is common in that part of Etobicoke, but the food was worth the walk from a few plazas over."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Great quick concept! Tandoori Chicken and The Coronary were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Turkey burger was just amazing, added bacon and cheese and did it ever hit the spot. Meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. Some burger joints dry out their turkey burgers, not these guys. Topping selection  was extensive. From avocado all the way to the regular mustard, selection was on point.  Beer selection was great, some local brews available. Hipster vibe...with a line going out the door (Saturday at noon)...part of the reason I was attracted to the place. The facility does have an outdoor seating area. Overall one of the better burgers I have had recently.   Big Rig Release the Hounds was the beer of choice."}
{"text":"Update:  Food was still amazing !! We had the pull pork, the coronary and a veggie burger with side of large poutine. Did not finish!! Soo much food.  We waited 10 mins in line to order; over an hr to get the food. But it was worth the wait! They were super short staffed. But the service was amazing!! It was crowded and we had to wait for seats.patio and indoors were available. Tip-  go and start the process when you are almost hungry! Haha.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Burger was topped with a fantastic bun. Overall I Had the 4-cheese and it was good, not great but good. The burger was pretty big, a good size to be honest. Toppings were all fresh and tasty. Only problem was $8 for the burger is a little steep. Flavor wise very similar to Magoo's, just more expensive. I would however return to try again if I was in the area and craving a burger."}
{"text":"Always a great place to hit up for a juicy burger. Ordered the kids burger as my appetite was not up for a giant burger. The fries were cooked perfectly and served hot. A great place for a local burg in the south Mississauga area."}
{"text":"If I'm going to be in etobicoke and I'm craving a burger, best joint to go to! The prices are so much better than all the other burger joints around here.   Memphis which is pulled pork for under $7 may not look the best but it's pretty good. This time around they were pretty stingy with the meat and coleslaw. When we went in the summer they really loaded up on it. So if you do get the Memphis, ask for extra!  Also got the Boom which was amazing. Come with beef and pulled pork. The patty was thick and juicy. Fully loaded. Under $8.50 definite recommend!  Got the 50/50 Yukon and sweet fries for $3.15 and it was the best fries you could have for a side. Perfect texture and taste. I'd go just to order fries.   Not many tables, but turnover is quick. Surprisingly busy in the winter. In the summer they have a patio so you can eat outside. Very nice!   I'd come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Burgers are life- but this place has the coronary burger and OMGGGG- it has the stuff cheese burger with a fried egg and bacon mmmm add pulled pork and you have an seriously organismic burger!!"}
{"text":"Took a trip to kensignton market and parked at Long Branch Go everyone was hungry on the way home so I took my nieces and my boyfriend here as Ive had it booked marked for quite some time. The day I was suppose to come I discovered the business next door with empanadas and went there instead  So here I am! My youngest niece had a poutine w bacon added (real bacon cut in pieces), which she loved. shes in grade 4 and almost finished a larger poutine she wanted to take the little bit she had left to lunch for school the next day but i told her no lol  Her older sister had a beef burger with brie, bacon fried onions bbq sauce and garlic mayo. she really enjoyed her burger but said the bbq sauce is different from what she is used to.  My boyfriend got a turkey burger w cheddar a friend egg and chipolte mayo. He said its so filling and juicy. He even mentioned how you can taste the fact that it is fresh locally sourced meat.   I had a veggie burger with friend onions chipolte lettuce tomatoes and bbq sauce was delish!!! Meat was well seasoned, the bun is what i especially loved went great w the juicy burger.  I also ordered a large fry for us to share, which of course is home cut and made to order like the rest of the menu. The food does take a bit more time than expected but oh is it worth the wait.  Not to mention the cashier he had to be the nicest sweetest cashier Ive ever met. Multitask king lol. It was extremely busy because nice weather and it was Sunday but he handled it so well. He even brought us waters in a take out cut w straws cause he heard my niece ask me to get a water bottle from the car. I will definitely be returning for the food and the smiles!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is 4 stars!!! I give it 1.5 stars max! For averages of $12 a burger their toppings should not be ice cold! I had the Alpine burger which features carmalized onions, Swiss cheese, double smoked bacon and mushrooms! All of the toppings were cold, the burger itself was lukewarm! The bacon, first time I had bacon jerky it wasn't just burnt to crisp it was chewy like beef jerky! The mushroom and onions that fell out of my burger was cold to the touch when picked up! The 50-50 fries was sad! Forgot to take a pic of my alpine, only took a pic of my dates turkey burger which looks sad as well! Highly doubt I will come back! How could this place be 4 stars?!? It's a Sunday night with three people working plus the cashier! Should have gone to Burger priest!"}
{"text":"Whole family enjoyed this joint! We found something for everyone. And were all full and satisfied by the end. We loved the diverse burger options plus the extra fixings. Also, was pleasantly surprised with the well put-together poutine - the perfect balance of gravy and cheese curds!  An order sheet would have helped since we had two family members that couldn't come in to order on their own within the tight front of house space.  The staff seemed a little hot and bothered, but I can't blame them - having to work behind the grill with 35 degree heat/humidity outside. Perhaps a nice cool a/c unit blowing on them would help.  We'll likely be back. Looking forward to trying some more of the many burger options."}
{"text":"Stopped into Woody's for a late lunch.  Immediately was enticed by the scent of smoked meat that wafted through the restaurant.  Placed an order for the Beef Classic burger, side of poutine and a pop ($12.40).  I was given a buzzer to let me know when my order was ready.  I grabbed a seat outside on the patio and watched life go by on Lakeshore Blvd.  And that's when the wait began...not that I was in a rush - I was happy to be sitting out in the shade on a hot day but when I started to see people who had ordered after me get their food, my stomach immediately triggered a WTF reaction in my brain.  The time stamp on my receipt said 1:55pm.  When there was no action on the buzzer at 2:20pm, I went in and asked jokingly \"Have you forgotten my order?\".  The cashier gave me a indignant look and responded, \"No, that's how long it takes\".  Meanwhile, people who ordered after me had received their order and were close to finish eating.   A few minutes after I inquired about my order, the buzzer finally went off.  It's fine if they had forgotten about the order, a simple apology would have been suffice.  No need to lie to my face.  Was it worth the wait?  The poutine was okay...wasn't a big fan of the gravy but totally commend them for using cheese curds.  The burger was thick and pre-topped with grilled onions, mushrooms and dijon mustard.  I noticed that they have an all-day breakfast and smoked meat sandwiches on the menu so I would like to come back and try that.  Hopefully a second visit to Woody's will not leave me feeling limp about the service."}
{"text":"Due to my lack of organization, we ended up at Woody's on Valentines Day (I'm sure there's like a million penis jokes that I could insert into this review but I'll hold back).  We rolled in around 5:30pm with no reservations (none needed really) to a relatively quiet dining room.    Being a purist, I ordered just the classic ($7.50) and a pint of the High Park ESB ($8) from their 4 rotating taps!  We got an order of fries to split and the mac and cheese ($8.95) for the offspring.  Once our order was up, we were called to the back window, where I was overwhelmed by the choice of toppings!  I chose the lettuce, tomatoes, extra pickles, garlic mayo, crispy onions, and pico de gallo!    The burger was absolutely amazing...extremely flavourful, very juicy and the bun was soft and heavenly.  Fries were done perfectly.  I managed to steal a bite of the mac and cheese before the kids devoured it and it was good - creamy and no skimping on the cheese!  Service was delightful...we didn't get any sneers for being a family.  So happy that Woody's is close by for my burger cravings."}
{"text":"I was truly impressed the food was outstanding, portions were fairly large everything was cooked properly the selections were vast staff very helpful a little pricey but balances out it size , amount and quality."}
{"text":"My sister recently moved to Toronto for school and my parents told me about Woody's. I scored out their menu online and I needed to check it out.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is: 1. The staff could've been friendlier. The girl taking ordered looked less than thrilled to be there.  2. The cheesed stuffed burger does not have cheese on it.   The burgers were a great size and you get to dress them with your choice of toppings. I had the cheese stuffed burger and it was awesome. They also have some really awesome looking specialty burgers.   I give the poutine 10/10. They use real cheese curds, none of that shredded cheese nonsense. The gravy was awesome and the large was an idea portion to split between three people.   They are licensed and have local beers on tap. As well as a few in bottles (corona, Coors light and steam whistle)."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in Toronto, period. I've tried most of their burgers and every single one of them has been excellent.   Today I had the coronary burger and it was perfectly cooked. The toppings were fresh and complimented each other very well.  The Tandoori turkey burger which I order when I'm going through a healthy eating phase is also really good.  Just a heads up, this is not a fast food burger joint. The patties take some time to cook so plan ahead.   The service and ambience are top notch too. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Foods okay, over rated I feel to be honest. I've tried it 3-4 times hoping that maybe it was just an off day.... I way prefer 5 guys burgers over these ones... Cashier is usually nice, cooks usually look like they have some chip on their shoulder."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, there's an aroma of wood burning accompanied by the sound of sizzling burgers which is a deadly combo to make you salivate in under a second. The place was full but seats were always opening up so by the time our burgers were ready we had a seat at the bar which was awesome.  I ordered the Coronary Burger. Let me say its a must get! Awesome flavours! Burger wasn't dry which is key. The bacon was amazing, only complaint is the fried egg was fully cooked so I didn't get a yolk explosion which takes a burger to the next level.  Poutine was great as well, definitely share a large between two people comfortably.   Overall great experience and would come back to try other specialty burgers! Keep up the awesome work and smell!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place! A co-worker was raving about it, so i had to try it out. It's super small fits about 6-10 couples maybe. You have to literally wait for people to get up and finish eating and run to grab their table.  on to the food: I loved mine I got the one with the fried egg in it. It was so delish, though i wish i told them to cook my egg well done since it was dripping all over the place, but next time. The fries i got were yummy too the yukon fries.   My BF got the one with pulled pork on it he liked it but states it wasn't the best burger he's ever had even though i thought it was mine.   we will deff go again! I want to try the one with like 4 diff cheese sounds yummy.   Although I HAVE TO mention that right after eating it, we got bad gas for the rest of the day. I'm hoping it wasn't the meat...maybe not well washed something....I'm hoping it doesn't happen next time."}
{"text":"Perfect,  hits the spot,  no complaints,  I usually get the blue cheese stuffed burger with every topping and it's amazing,  also 50/50 fries with Chipotle mayo for the sweet potato ones.  Iv brought about a dozen freinds and family members here and never heard any complaints.  Also it's priced fair compared to burger priest and tastes better in my opinion.  Only down side is there is limited space inside and in the winter it can get cold by the front door from people entering and existing"}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sandwiches. The Canadian and Memphis (with extra coleslaw) are my fav."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place during my search for a restaurant that serves bison burgers, since I've been craving them a lot ever since I tried it for the first time at a place in Blue Mountain. I absolutely loved it's ambience and decor, which was really chilled with a patio and only a few tables inside and a wooden interior. I also loved their open kitchen, which makes you more hungry as you wait for your burger to be made. Since there were only a few tables inside I wonder how they would manage during the winter. At this time the restaurant was packed and we luckily got a table. They had a minimum selection of burger options, compared to somewhere like The Works, however they were pretty imaginative, such as the Tokyo burger (which I ordered). So I opted for the Tokyo burger with a bison patty because it contained pickled ginger, which I am obsessed with. My friend got the Tandoori burger with 50/50 fries (half white and half sweet potatoes). The tandoori burger is meant to have a chicken patty but was substituted for a veggie patty. We were given a buzzer which would go off when our food is ready. 10 minutes later we got our call and had to go back to the front so that we can choose additional topping, which were with no additional cost (unless we wanted the premium toppings).  The burgers were a good size, typical of a gourmet style burger. The bison was incredible and the veggie burger was good too, but apparently not as good as The Works veggie patty. Probably because the veggie patty here was more of a vegetable based, rather than the soy kind, so it didn't have that meat feeling. The prices were incredibly affordable compared to usual gourmet burger joints and the service was extremely friendly. I would definitely go again and understand why there is such a huge crowd."}
{"text":"Solid place for burgers and poutine! A bit messy with the burger, but overall pretty good. You can customize your toppings, which is nice and convenient. We ordered the Alpine burger and poutine!"}
{"text":"Woody's you are my kind of Burger, you are my kind of man!  Woody's you are a labour of love and sweat!  Woody's put all those gourmet fancy burger to shame!  Woody's you are my desire, the one I daydream of! Step aside 5 guys!   Woody's you are smoking wood burning hot!  Woody's your burgers are so deliciously juicy and cooked just pink inside!  Woody's you made me into such a cheap date! your Beef Classic would have satisfy me with your generous choices of free toppings and 1/2 price Mojitos!  Woody's you even have a Patio!!   Hey! Can someone stop that humming of \"Who Says\" !Ask him to shut up and eat his Coronary Burger! Why is he NOT watching CP24, it was showing inside Woody's!"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap Burgers for a great price! Had the cheddar burger, a little undercooked red meat but overall great for price. POUTINE IS A MUST! Amazing poutine, hard to find nowadays. Really liked woodys!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the better burger joints in the area.  With the slow decline of Apache I have been in search of a replacement go to place and this is it.  This place is friendly and very authentically neighbourhood-gem like.  Menu feels fresh and filled with flavours that make sense together.  Once they get onion rings added to their menu it will probably go up to a 5 rating for me.  Service takes time here because everything is to order.  So go there anticipating a from scratch  grilled burger experience that takes some time and you'll be fine.  Enjoy your first beer while you wait- a good variety of local brews to chose from.  Salt was a little heavy on my 50 50 fries last time but every other time they were perfection, Easily one of the better burger places in the GTA"}
{"text":"Truly great burgers folks....!! Awesome.   And their poutine was incredible too!  Sorry to see that they no longer have lamb burgers though!  But I WILL be back!  Just be SURE to go hungry!!!  Counter staff and cooks really great as well, at least on Sundays!  Cheers Woodys.   And PLEASE put your lamb burger back.....sigh..."}
{"text":"My family thoroughly enjoyed our visit while visiting Toronto last week. The atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable, the menu options were appealing (even for our kids going through the picky/choosy stage), and we liked the local beers on tap. We ordered the Alpine and California burgers, a couple kids burgers with toppings they chose, and sweet potato fries. I'd order the same thing right now if I could. Any chance you guys want to open another location 1,396 km to the south?"}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger in the area. The burgers are big and they put large amounts of toppings on them, so there is no way to complain about the price because it's very resonable. A cool feature compared to its competition,  is that you can actually enjoy a beer with your burger - alot of these burger joints don't offer this option."}
{"text":"For me the veggie burger is what I will order at a place like Woody's (which recently opened down the street here on Jane).  I was really disappointed with the veggie burger.  It literally became crumbs the instant you bit into it.  Crumbs falling everywhere and when you try to pick them up they crumble more.  This is not a burger this is something that should be served in a bowl really.  Like a veggie chili with toppings or something.  Overall it is unequivocally the worst approximation of a burger I have ever eaten.  The toppings are great.  The staff were super friendly but the veggie burger was crap.  Like most of the restaurants on Jane Street there are still very few vegetarian friendly places and you would think that just a single veggie burger on a menu could be celebrated and have fun with it by making it amazing.  But not in this case."}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger connoisseur. Not because my palate is necessarily refined, but because I just like them so darn much. So much so that i once worked for the now defunct Licks Homeburgers for several years.    With all that out of the way, these guys are legit. So much so in my mind that i consider them the best burger ive ever tasted outside of the time i worked at Licks. (Thats right, i worked there for several years and couldn't get enough of their burgers.) And thats a big deal.   What sets these guys apart if their wood fired grills. Although the taste of wood isnt all that predominant when you include all the delicious cheese and toppings, its still there and adds to the experience. On top of that, the size of the burger is about the size any self respecting enthusiast should be looking for. After all, this should be the main attraction in any burger sandwich. The extras such as the bun, cheese, bacon and toppings are also all top notch and complete the orgasmic burger experience in a way that should satisfy most.    I dont freely give away the \"best burger\" monicker to just anyone, only the deserved. And they are definitely deserving."}
{"text":"Your first impressions are made when you smell the BBQ as you near the corner of Lakeshore Blvd and 14th Street. The smell that reminds you of backyard gatherings or cottage weekends.    As I walk in, you notice the sign that says they are not fast food and good food takes time. Cooking a fresh 7oz beef patty cooked to order does take time so sit down and savour the smells of a real burger cooking on the grill.   Today the Boom Beef Burger was what I set my eyes on. Topped with pulled pork, pickled jalapeño peppers, smoked Gouda, fried onions, smoked ketchup and chipotle mayo. Topped with other fresh garnishes you can choose from. For the smaller appetites, they do have a kids menu which would also satisfy.   A thick juicy burger that you won't regret. A burger that fits the bun perfectly. Fresh cut fries, real cheese curds, and a beefy gravy makes for a great poutine.   If you're in the southwest end of Toronto near Sherway Gardens Shopping Mall, this place is worth stopping b"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, lots of options, huge portions (all burgers have double patties and you can add all kinds of toppings) and great taste.  They have milkshakes and also a variety of local beers on tap. I'd give them 5 stars but the place is always packed and it's really a pain to find a seat, especially if the patio is not open. Also the waiting time can be very long, when I was already eating my meal they put a sign at the door warning customers about the 1 hour wait for the food."}
{"text":"Ohhh do they have good burgers. Highly recommend! I love that you can totally customize the burger and it's toppings.  The patio is great too. You can grab a beer as well which is nice on hotter days. I got the California burger, and my friend got the blue cheese stuffed burger. Yummy I'm taking away a star because the bathroom is not very clean. Management, please address this."}
{"text":"This is prob my fav burger place in town everytime I come I get the bison burger and a putine and Amsterdam blond beer love it!"}
{"text":"came in here recently for some food and was met some extreme attitude from people behind the counter. to put it into perspective, it was two hours before closing time and they ran out of at least half of the menu, which the cashier put blame on us for coming so late...?   that's right   we were blamed for showing up later in the day and that was the reason why we couldn't get the food we wanted.   what was even funnier was dealing with the cook over the toppings on the burger, when I explained to him that I wanted what was on the board so far as the toppings it was met with some extreme exasperation.   I brought up these attitude problems to one of the owners in an email and was met with a \"less then stellar solution/response\"   great food, but not worth the attitude.  never going back."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to visit this restaurant last Monday. I don't know how many times I drove past last summer with my window down and the smell of BBQ would taunt me.  Now I know why - a wood fired grill!  Who has a wood fired grill these days?  Very impressive.  Woody's is a small and friendly establishment. The first thing that caught my eye when I walked in was the condiment selection. I love good condiments! The menu consists of homemade burgers, pulled pork and macaroni and cheese with the usual side offerings of fries and coleslaw.   My partner and I ordered their standard beef burger with cheese and a side of yukon gold fries to share. We were given a buzzer and took a seat in a booth. The burgers take a while to cook as they are made to order. This was fine with me as I needed time to plan my condiments! I decided to go with roasted garlic mayo, smoked ketchup and pickles. I don't like to go overboard on the condiments as they tend to mask the taste of the burger. They use a really good sesame seed bun - similar to a brioche and it is toasted on the grill.   Now for the moment of truth - with my elbows out and a sufficient hunch over my basket I took a bite. It was messy and delicious! The only thing I would suggest to the chef is that he dimple the burger before putting it on the grill so it doesn't ball up so much. Other than that it was great. The fries were also outstanding and they are happy to give you a side of flavoured mayo for them. The chipotle mayo was a perfect choice.   I will definitely be going back as the pulled pork menu needs to be explored."}
