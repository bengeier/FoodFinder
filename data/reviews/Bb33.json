{"text":"This place is located in the downtown area inside the Chelsea Hotel.  I ate here with my family for the Summerlicious menu.  Everything was done perfectly.  They offer and cook Canadian cuisine.  I don't really know what that means in terms of style of cooking, but all the ingrediants they used were grown or raised in Canada.  

Appetizers were pretty good as they offered salad and soup of the day.
The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce had so much flavor.  The beef flank steak from Alberta was the tenderest piece of flank steak I have ever eaten.  The maple glazed salmon was so juicy and had a wonderful salmon taste to it. 
   
Desserts were very fancy and perfectly proportioned.  The chocolate dome was wonderfuly chocolatey yet not sweet.  Not your ordinary lava cake rendition.  The panna cotta was tender, light, and cool with the berries.  The cheesecake was not too heavy and the crust gave a nice crisp.  

This place also offers a buffet throught the day.  Most of the other people there were eating the buffet.  I looked at the spread, and it was a very good selection.  

I know summerlicious is over for now, but for $15 for lunch and $25 for dinner, this place is great for fine dining at a very reasonable price.  Most dishes are $20 and more, $30 or more for a protein entree.  

I hope they participate in the Winterlicious event in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the hotel for the weekend and I decided to try this restaurant. It was amazing. I ordered a goat cheese filled phyllo, it was delicious, I could eat that over and over again.

One couple sitting next to me asked question about the menu and one of the sous-chef came to answer them directly. I stopped her to let her know how good the food was. Then, I had the veal and a molten chocolate cake. I don't have a sweet tooth but for people who loves sweet, that cake is the best choice you can make, it was soft and delicious.

Then, another sous-chef came to ask how was the meal and again, I repeated it was excellent.

I'm only disappointed they didn't have the wine I asked for but the waitress offered me another one which was as good as the one I wanted. The service was great. I would go back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Delta for 3 weeks on a business trip and being tired of Chinese food and crappy pizza I thought I would check out the hotel restaurant Bb33.  It was a Monday night and the place only had 3 or 4 other tables.  I was greeted by a friendly hostess who asked what room I was staying in and promptly seated me.

I had heard about the prix fix and was hoping it would be something interesting that nigh but none of the offerings inspired me so I went with the New York strip loin steak. The wines by the glass are very limited and I expected there to be more choices since this was a hotel restaurant that probably has lots of patrons dining alone and don't opt for a bottle.  I ended up paired my meal with a glass of Cabernet Franc.

While waiting for my entree the waiter brought the wine and some nice crusty bread accompanied by a trio of dipping oils and butter.  The first was an oil and vinegar mix which I didn't care for along with whole butter and an herb infused olive oil.  The butter was at the perfect room temperature and the herb oil had a very nice herb flavor but would have been much better using a high grade extra virgin olive oil.

The steak arrived presented very nicely with some herb garnishments a ramekin of  peppercorn sauce, roasted vegetables and the spun yukon gold mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly on first slice but because it was so thin it continued to cook as I ate it.  By the time I was finished it was way past the medium rare I had ordered.  The steak was well seasoned and would have been a great meal if it had been a few ounces bigger.  8 oz is just too small for a New York Strip.

Overall it was a good meal and the service was very attentive but I still expected more for these prices.  For hotel food it was pretty good."}
{"text":"We came here on Canada Day and while the service was a bit all over the place, we were happy with the food (penne alla vodka), drinks and the price. They were also very accommodating to our toddler. I was pleasantly surprised as I've always heard mixed things on this place."}
{"text":"There's no reason to eat here if you're not staying at the hotel. My hamburger was overcooked and dry and the sliced  tomato was pickled, which the menu does not indicate. The \"caesar salad\" was crap and served with the dressing on the side like it was an iceberg  lettuce salad at a truck stop or McDonald's."}
{"text":"Food was good, food selection in their menu is from all around the world; service was little slow but our server was a nice person. Chef also came to our table to ask if food was good or if there is anything he can do to make our experience better. The only reason I am giving lower stars is because manager came to our table to tell us to keep quite for half an hour, and we were not noisy at all; his reasining was the owner's friends were celebration a birthday and they were delivering speeches at the next room and they don't want anyone to talk in the restaurant; it was a weird experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Bb33 for their Summerlicious lunch as the menu looked really nice and it was close by making it a perfect opportunity to try something new.  

We made reservations for two and showed up with an extra person and they accommodated us which was wonderful.  The servers were friendly and efficient which again was another point for them.  

Now on to the food. Starting with the appetizers, the wild mushroom bisque was full flavoured and had the beautiful earthy flavors of wild mushrooms that any good mushroom bisque should have.  I had the salad with Shaved Chèvre Goat Cheese, Aged White Balsamic and Pink Grapefruit Vinaigrette. The flavours worked nicely together and the toasted pine nuts added the extra texture and flavour required to create a pleasing finish for the palate. Unfortunately this is where the experience started going downhill. We had the Salmon and Zinfandel gastrique with the truffle mashed potatoes as well as the braised short ribs.  I'll start with the salmon first as it was the better of the two.  The salmon itself was done perfectly and the caramelized pecans added a lovely touch of texture along with an appropriate amount of sweetness that was paired well with the salmon. The potatoes were very dry and not very flavourful which is a shame given the quality of flavour that truffles can add to potatoes. Unfortunately these potatoes left me wanting something with more flavour and perhaps a creamer texture to them.  The Braised short ribs, I'm sorry to say, were just plain awful.  The braising process is meant to allow the short ribs to not only become tender but to also accumulate and impressive amount of flavour.  Unfortunately the kitchen staff mistook, roasting for braising.  The short ribs as a result were dry, and grossly rubbery in texture. It looked as if they had been sitting under heating lamps for a couple of days.

Now on to desserts.  We tried all three options being the Macadamia Nut and White Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding, the Dark Belgium Chocolate Crème Brûlée
as well as the caramel sponge cake. The bread pudding somehow tasted like orange marmalade with walnuts and a gooey white sauce that was supposed to be a crème anglaise.  The Dark Belgium Crème Brulee was actually a chocolate mousse that tasted of Ovaltine rather than real chocolate and the sponge cake left us dreaming of some PC sponge cake from the supermarket. 

I should say that we did speak to the restaurant manager about the quality of the food and he did thank us for our input and provided us with some coupons and his card for next time.  Unfortunately first impressions are extremely important and even though the service was good, the food was definitely not something I would be willing to try again.  Not in my foodie dreams."}
{"text":"I have been to Bb33 a few times, usually for pre-theatre dinner. What I really like about the restaurant is their menu of Canadian cuisine. I've had their Canadian French onion soup, pan-seared Pacific halibut nicoise, Alberta filet mignon and arctic char. All very good. The service is friendly and courteous. During one of our visits, the sous chef even came out to ask how our dinner was - a very nice touch."}
