{"text":"My favorite place for Vietnamese food!   We like to get the bo bay mon (7 beef courses) ($25), and the family combo (canh chua - soup, ca kho - braised catfish, and goi kho bo - papaya beef jerky salad) ($20). They also have a seafood hotpot, with fish, squid, and veggies with a sour broth - very GOOD for under $25. Banh xeo is also quite good.   Vietnamese comfort food, at an affordable price. Very good service as well."}
{"text":"My mom wants to come here because she likes their food. I warned her they changed worker and they are not as nice as before. The food taste alright but the the attitude change so much I think I would just do take out. The waitress looks so gloomy tired and she cant smile. She looks like she has a bad case of constipation from her facial expression that even ee want to ask for water, we wouldnt feel like it. My mom was very disappointed with this place now but at least now she knows so she would stop wasting her time sitting in. No more sitting in I  this place even if you want the food. That's my advice for you. I hope the food taste the same because it would be  shame the new management would  destroy the reputation this restaurant had for years among the Vietnamese community."}
{"text":"First time here... heard lots of good things about this place.  Got the bo 7 mon and chicken wings...  Wings... WoW... pretty dame good.    As for the bo 7 mon. .. 7.5/10 .... reason is portion is too small and not enough veggies to go with meat.  The sauce is so so...   There use to be this place near Jane and Wilson... Cao Van.... they had the best bo 7 mon. .. Portion was big.. sauce was good.... too bad it closed down... it was the best for bo 7 mon...  Despite a little disappointment... I would come back and recommend this place to friends... this place is still by far the best place to get bo 7 mon. ..."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese Chicken Wings out there.  SERVICE IS HORRIBLE HERE. The staff don't seem to care about their customers and take their precious time with everything. I would only go here for take out of their wings and that's it."}
{"text":"Make sure you know which location you're reviewing. This specific location at Jane and Sheppard SUCKS. I would not suggest coming here at all. Waited way too long for our dishes. If you order the 7 types of beef, it's the fastest. Meanwhile, if you want to order anything else, I would suggest you go elsewhere. My brother and I finished our dishes before my dad got his. When we complained to the waiters, they didn't even know and clearly forgot. Would not be back."}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and I have to say this is the best Vietnamese restaurant is town so far as I ve been always looking for a good, ethnic Viet place for food. They are famous for the 7 courses from beef. You should definitely try that. Also the Sticky rice with chicken fried in fish sauce is amazing too. This is my to-go restaurant for Viet food from now on.  The only thing is the place is so small that will make you feel a bit uncomfortable when your eating and see a long line of people waiting."}
{"text":"This is always one of my favourite Vietnamese places to eat in Toronto. Their killer dishes are fish sauce fried chicken wings with sticky rice, Bun Mam, papaya beef jerky salad, papaya shrimp salad and 7 beef courses. -1 point for drinks, none of their milk shakes, smoothies are good."}
{"text":"Really really bad service with waiter working there they close at 10:00 pm we came  at 9:40  they refuse to serve they said close then we ask order take out took them 40 minutes before they give it to us by the time I got out their place 10:20 pm"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a fellow co workers going away party. She had recommended it as it is her favourite local Vietnamese spot to hit up with her husband and being Vietnamese herself, the place sounded promising.  The décor is what you can expect from a hole in the wall type establishment with sub-par seating arrangements, lack of proper air conditioning and overall sticky atmosphere. They tried their best to accommodate our rather large (9 people) group to much success and immediately served us jugs of cold tea which kept coming as the night went on.   I ordered a classic Vermicelli noodle dish with \"rolled beef in lolot leaves\" and the group ordered the chicken wings to share. The chicken wings were delicious, straight from the fryer, hot and sticky and sweet; all the good things one would love in a classic wing. It came with an interesting side of sticky rice mixed with coconut, which I used mixed in with the sauce the wings left behind. My main dish was very large and based off of the recommendation of my friend and was very tasty. The rolled beef especially was my favourite and I can eat heaps and heaps of it if I could!   Overall a very yummy little spot that if in the area, I'd definitely go otherwise it is a little bit of a trip for me."}
{"text":"Don't understand all the negative reviews. This is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. I've tried many and nothing compares to their quality of food. First, they are not a new restaurant they just changed locations from st Clair west which was really unfortunate as we ventured there quite often and had a lot of long lineups. They moved to Jane and Sheppard and now their old place on st Clair is another Viet restaurant which is just utter crap!! Service is awesome, staff are super friendly! Wish you guys didn't move!!"}
{"text":"Small place,  always busy, great family combo food. Go almost weekly."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Vietnamese all over NA.  This place is a classic - small enough that you get familiar with the staff (family?) quickly and easy to have a conversation about what's on the menu.   Pho is excellent. Fresh ingredients well prepared. The menu is deep. It's cheap. What else could you want?  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You guys should check your bill before you pay. There were changes in the price but they didn't inform you before eating neither fixing the menu. So when my dad got the receipt the prices were different. They include tax in your receipt however when asked for the GST number to do the income tax they wouldn't give it to you. The waitress was being rude to my dad because he wanted the GST number. My family got the popular chicken wings and 7 course beef, the wings were good however the portion of the 7 course beef was too tiny. The service was super slow although there weren't a lot of customers. Probably the worst experience we've ever had at a Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. There's usually a wait for seats that proves it! Don't forget to try the 7 course beef and the chicken wings!!! The best chicken wings in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out with ppl saying it's the best...I guess it's the best they've ever had because it was not good at all!   We ordered the 7 dish plate which were super small portions, pho - which wasn't that great..I've had better soup elsewhere, chicken wings which were dry, and spring rolls- they had no filling...save your money.   The place was so small, not clean, and the service was not great...they were rushing us out..we were still eating and this one waitress was their sticking out her hand trying to take away the plates of food yet their was still food on it..then another waiter comes and asks to remove the plates yet we were not done eating!!!!!   Horrible service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! We were 3 Had the fried chicken, 5 course beef, pho, Vietnamese and fresh rolls :)  We ordered more than what we needed.  It's a small place and ok atmosphere, the service was good. It's busy every time I went so be prepared to wait in line unless you get there before the rush hours.   Have been back a few more time since my first time and no disappointment yet (once she forgot one of my orders but hey I was full by that time so didn't need it :))"}
{"text":"The restaurant looked run down with old faded wall paper with a picture of the beach. Most of the customers were locals or returning customers speaking Vietnamese to the owners.  My husband and I ordered the fish sauce chicken wings and the 7 courses of beef.   The fish sauce chicken wings were a must. They were delicious with a batter that was not overly salty and the center was piping hot.  As the the 7 courses of beef, the menu should call it a tasting menu, as the word \"course\" really threw me off. The portions were small.  For $27 for 2 people, I left hungry. The presentation was nice and the beef was tasty and flavourful.   Many of the customers ordered hotpot, which I'd love to try next time."}
{"text":"I was invited here with a friend and his mom after a long day of volleyball. It was my first time here and I never heard of this place before but apparently it was really popular. There was a wait when we got there as it was full, but we only waited 5mins since we were the only ones waiting. By the time we left there was a line out the door. We ordered the 7-course beef, and #V12 (chicken wings and sweet/sticky rice). Safe to say, probably my favourite Vietnamese restaurant to date. The 7-course beef was delicious, lots of flavour and really authentic, one course was very filling for 2 people and at a great price too! The chicken wings were my favourite; they were different, I don't know what they use to make it but definitely fish sauce, honey, and garlic were used for the wings. We ordered two rounds of those because they were just so damn good. Service was fast! Regardless of how busy it was and very polite as well. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some gooood authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood go to Vietnamese restaurant.  Its well worth the commute though if you're coming from elsewhere.  My husband and I frequent this place a few times a week.    When I think of Vietnamese food, I think Pho, and the chicken noodle salad dish.  The owner's daughter, was so good at introducing my husband and I to all the traditional dishes that the restaurant has to offer, the 7 course Beef hot pot dish, the sour soup, their chicken wings (2 types one with the fish sauce and rice, and one hotter) both dishes delicious.   The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside and in, but these are usually the gems in the city with the best food, and price.   The place does get busy, and it is small, but definitely worth the wait and try."}
{"text":"Just some seriously delicious beef pho.  The broth is amazing..AND they add generous vegetables for only a small charge! so nice! I ordered pho from here for the first time tonight and I had such a lovely experience- the staff were so so friendly, it was unbelievable.  I will definitely be back again !!"}
{"text":"Still one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. Very authentic with great variety. Owners are very friendly.   Recommend all their salad dishes. Very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon with the parents. I ordered hu tieu my tho, and my parents both had pho. A little pricy compared to the other pho places close by but their broth is so good! They have fresh rice noodles for the pho. The beef is tender and the portion was plenty. Staff is friendly and helpful. My dish was delicious. The best I have tried in Toronto, and trust me. I have been to many different vietnamese restaurants. A little pricer but was worth every dollar. Will definitely be back. Thanks for such a great start to my Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place used to be on St Claire and Weston. It was great there and still great now at this current location. Always love the 7-beef. Service can be sometimes slow when they are busy, but they treat you well. The fish claypot is so good."}
{"text":"Pros- Good food. Lots of Vietnamese dinning there. Wings were excellent.   Cons- Onion smell alert. Had to clean everything I was wearing after."}
{"text":"Bun mam & hot pot are delicious. They should renovate place. The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had Bo Bay Mon, and it was delicious. Tasted healthy and fresh and the variety of different beef dishes was great."}
{"text":"I've never seen line ups for Vietnamese restaurants. This is the one place that always has a line up and even knowing that, I am ok with waiting. The food is worth the wait compared to other Viet restaurants. I wouldn't compare a restaurant to homemade food, that's silly. They serve the best mam nem in town. As everyone already knows, they also have the best wings and sticky rice. Service was friendly and efficient even though it was super packed."}
{"text":"Okay maybe I came on a bad day... but I ordered the spring rolls and they were horrific.   SPRING ROLLS Between the Vietnamese spring rolls and the Regular spring rolls (one has pork the other doesn't), I couldn't even find more than 2 small pieces of shrimp in these spring rolls, and the vermicelli with the pork was ground down and SO MUSHY that it turned into a grainy, kind of disgusting, bland filling for a spring roll.  Between the two, I'd pick the Vietnamese spring roll if I had to choose one, because the wrapper was crispy and a lot better.  PHO (rare beef pho, the first one with tripe and so on) I also tried the pho and while I found the broth light, it wasn't flavourful, although maybe it could have been that they don't cover it in MSG like in other places. It was still hearty and delicious but very.. very.. light on the palate.  My gripe is that there was no tripe. I mean there was literally NO TRIPE and I paid for it.  Maybe I should go and try the 7 course beef because it seems to be the dish to have here.   Overall, I'd come back for a second try but I am definitely avoiding the spring rolls. BIG disappointment.  Oh and it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"*updated, below *  If you've ever had the privilege to travel to Asia to eat in a small family owned diner, then you will feel right at home stepping into Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay. It's a small little place nestled in an old run down plaza, but is frequented by a lot of people because there are a lot of essential services here.  The restaurant is definitely family owned and could use some cleaning, but if you're only here for the food (like how most people eat out in Asia) then this place will meet your Vietnamese cuisine standards.   I was greeted warmly by a very polite spoken waitress. Her service was different than your typical joint because she asked if I had any food allergies, and always spoke politely with \"May I?\", \"thank you\", and \"You're welcome\". A +  I only ordered a Pho Dac Biet to try them out. The broth tasted great. The herb dish featured not only Thai basil and bean sprouts but also had the long leaf ngo gai, a wedge of lime, and a chilli pepper. Not many places give such a full offering. I enjoyed it all. I ordered a small bowl and it indeed came in what appeared to be a really small bowl, but its looks are deceiving because it contained a lot of noodles and meat that could easily be classified as a medium at some other places. It was the right amount, but wish there was more space so I could mix in the herbs, it was a bit of a challenge with the smaller sized bowl.  Over all, a good meal. I know a lot of people won't eat here simply because of the location but if you can see past that then the food is worth it.   I don't come by here often but if I'm back again then I will try their rice dishes next.  **Update** So I returned the next day since I was in the area and had lunch, ordered the grilled chicken rice dish with shaved pork skin, steamed egg/meat, and a fried egg on top. I was immediately disappointed by the fact that it was not served with a bowl of soup, but the large portions made up for it. I easily got double the amount of rice and pork than some places. The fried egg had its yolk popped so it failed on the \"sunny side up\" but I don't mind. Overall the dish was okay. The chicken portion wasn't very large, but adequate. It could use some more charring to create that \"grilled\" taste but overall not too shabby.   Having now tried both their Pho and Com I've decided that this place is decent enough to stop by for a quick bite if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Also it's lack of cleanliness makes it a poor place to bring friends, unless they're just as ghetto.   Dropping the rating from 4 to 3. This place has potential to be a gem, just needs cleaning up and paying attention to the details."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. The huu tieu was a solid 3. My mom got the bun thit nuong and brother got banh xeo which looked like a two. The young lady waitress was very polite and apologetic for the slow service. You gotta hand it to her she is the only waitress for the entire restaurant! Kudos!  Would not return. Had way better."}
{"text":"Amazing experience at this authentic Vietnamese restaurant cooked by Vietnamese people.    When you come to these kinds of small family biz restaurants you have to be realistic with expectations and standards. I come from a family of restaurant owners so i know first hand that these people work hard.  Anyways.. The staff, especially this one lady, was super jolly and enthusiastic. Her mannerism and smile may have made my experience even better. I am very big on professional mannerisms and genuineness in the food/restaurant industry.. example: even if the food sucks, the manners and politeness of waiters/waitresses can make you less angry about how crappy the food tasted...well It helps a little.  Thankfully, in this case the food and service were both in sync ! Well done lady!  It's not a \" first date\" kind of resto - definitely a family/ friend setting.  Cash only.   Main food highlights :  We tried their famous and delicious fish sauce marinated chicken wings...only $7 for 7wings + sticky rice and small side salad!  The \"7 beef \" dish is apparently very popular in the Vietnamese culture. It was good! ( see photos) This combo came with a tiny bowl of beef congee, diced beef, a big platter of assorted veggies ( for your DIY spring rolls- fun!) and obviously 7 different kinds of beef.   Everything was great except seating.  It was a teeny bit crammed but manageable ! We 100% will revisit and recommend."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese chicken wings that I have ever had. The seven course of beef is amazing too"}
{"text":"The food here is very good! Normally get the Pho which is always awesome but today, got the fish sauce chicken wings as per other reviews here. Yummmmm!!! So good!!!! I also like their fresh rolls and spring rolls. Always on point!"}
{"text":"Tried the seven courses of beef here! Was tasty! And the Pork &chicken chop rice was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Visited here thanks to the positive Yelp reviews online. There were a bunch of pho restaurants on this block but this was the only one with lots of ppl inside, so that probably says a lot! The food was very tasty and the price was amazing. The bbq beef was quite flavourful in the vermicelli, I would definitely order that again. The waiter was quiet but friendly and fast. My only critique is that the menu is a bit more limited than my favourite pho place downtown. But I'm happy that I know about this place in the west end next time I have a craving!  Note that it is cash only, but there is a variety store across the street with an ATM."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are spectacular. It's made with the finest fish sauce made by the finest Vietnamese chief, Nguyen Thanh Lang. He originated here from Vietnam to pursue his dream to open a fine dining restaurant. Over all, my experience here was delightful. mm so ngon (so good)."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents on the recommendation of my dentist's sister. Overall, I felt that the food was ok but not exceptional. However, it should be mentioned that we did not order the dishes that she suggested, except for 1 side order.   Service was quick, polite, and efficient. We were offered our choice of hot or iced tea as soon as we sat down. We were given menus with a piece of paper and a pen to write down our orders.  We chose iced tea. The tea is unsweetened. We ordered some spring rolls to start. You get 3 per order for $4.95. We also got a side order of beef wrapped in betel leaves (bo la lot) (6 for $3.50) and a side order of beef sausage (bo mo chai) (6 for $3.50).  I got the Hu Tieu My Tho (tapioca noodle soup from the town of My Tho). It was $8.95. My parents both got the vermicelli. My dad got the vermicelli with shredded pork skin (bi), shrimp on a sugar cane (chao tom), and meat patties (nem nuong). His dish was $9.95. My mom got the vermicelli with grilled beef and spring rolls ($8.95).  I was disappointed that my noodle soup did not contain any fish balls nor ground pork, like this soup traditionally has. It only had 2 shrimps, 2 quail eggs, and a few slices of fatty pork. The pork was way too fatty for me to even eat. I gave it all to my dad. The tapioca noodles were nice and chewy, and the broth was fragrant. The broth wasn't too salty nor too oily. It had some fried shallots in it, as well as some green onions and leaf lettuce. My dish was ok, but I wasn't thrilled about it.  My parents enjoyed their vermicelli. The vermicelli was the thin type, which my mom prefers over the thick type. She also loved that the vermicelli was really hot (in temperature). I had a taste of her grilled beef and I liked that it was lean and flavourful. My mom felt it was a little dry and too little in quantity, but still liked her meal. My dad is a man of few words, so his only comment was that it was good, lol.   The side orders of beef (one of the dishes my dentist's sister recommended) were good, but they were really tiny. Each piece was smaller than my thumb (and I have been told by jewellers that I have the hands of an 9 year old). Both types of beef were really flavourful, but a little too greasy.    They forgot our order of spring rolls and brought them out at the end. They were undercooked and not as golden as the ones in my mom's vermicelli bowl. They were still crispy and satisfactory, but I've had better.   In case you are curious, the other dishes that were recommended to us were the hot pot and the fish sauce marinated fried chicken wings.   Decor is simple, and staff were nice. It was busy. Lots of people came for takeout.  The restaurant is in a little plaza. There's some free parking out front."}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese myself (north-bucky) I didn't find the food up to par with my standards. As for the 7 course beef meal, I've had this home cooked as well as in Vietnam, and I found that the courses lacked flavour.   1. The vinegar beef  - beef was okay. Not the best. Could not taste much of the vinegar. The sauce was horrible. It tasted fishy and bland. It was not at all sweet and salty like it should be. 2. The beef salad  - too much chili flakes and the beef was over cooked by the lemon juice. There was no \"fresh\" taste. It was just overall spicy. 3. Cha la lot ( beef wrapped in leaves) - bland, wasn't fried enough so the leaves weren't crispy.  4. Beef Sausages  - good, flavourful. Except the skin, you taste that... how do I explain this. You know when fish tastes fishy, well the sausage had this after taste that was like a pig pen in your mouth. .... :) 5. Beef satay? - dry, spicy as heck!  6. Beef congee - it is what it is. There were ginger in it which was a nice touch  7. Beef with green peppers - dry    Overall, it is different and something nice to just experiance. Food wise, not so great. The place is really small and you can feel like an outsider if you aren't vietnamese. However they do speak fluent English and are nice so that's a bonus. Its hard to find a good authentic Vietnamese restaurant unless you are in the \"crowd\" so good luck people!"}
{"text":"It's in my hood and i've tried it out a few times. The service sucks but their food is ok - nothing special. I wish i lived closer to Pho Pasteur (best pho in TO)."}
{"text":"Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in the city that not many people other than the Vietnamese community know about. Unfortunately it's located in an obscure part of the city. It's best known for it's 7 beef course combo ($25 for 2 people tax included).  I was in the area and decided to drop by for lunch. My friend and I ordered spring rolls, a large bowl of Pho and Bun Bo Hue.  Spring Rolls ($3.75 tax included): The spring rolls were okay, the skin was nicely cooked, crispy but not too crispy but the inside was a little bit disappointing because of the lack of filling. The fish sauce was great, nice and flavourful and not too salty or sweet.  Pho Dac Biet ($6.25 for a large, tax included): The bowl was a fair size, equivalent to an X-Large in comparison to many of it's other counterparts in the city. They didn't skimp on the meat and other items like tendon either. The broth was nicely done, the meat was nicely sliced, minimal fat and a little bit red that allowed it to be cooked in the broth. The noodles were done nicely, not overcooked or undercooked.  Bun Bo Hue ($6.75 tax included, only one size available): I didn't get a chance to try their Bun Bo Hue but my friend said it was pretty good, not oily and it was spicy but not too spicy but very flavourful.  If your looking for a good authentic Vietnamese restaurant that offers all the traditional Vietnamese dishes and that's really cheap, all the prices on their menu include tax or your looking for a great 7 beef course combo  since Kim Bo at Dundas and Bathurst closed down, then Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay is the place you should try out."}
{"text":"Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay is a Vietnamese restaurant located in a plaza on the Northwest corner of Jane and Sheppard in Toronto.  I use to frequent this restaurant when it was located in a small strip plaza on St.Clair Ave West and usually it was the busiest one with two or three other Vietnamese restaurants located in the same strip plaza. In the Vietnamese community they are known for making amazing fish sauce deep fried chicken wings with sticky rice ($9.25 plus tax) and Bo 7 Mon ($32.00 plus tax) which is essentially translated to seven courses of beef. Their vermicelli, rice and pho dishes are not bad but the fish sauce chicken wings and Bo 7 Mon are the standouts. Not a lot of Vietnamese restaurants offer the Bo 7 Mon option in Toronto.  I went on a recent Saturday afternoon to their new location and ordered the fish sauce chicken wings with sticky rice ($9.25 plus tax) and the Bo 7 Mon ($32.00 plus tax), it was more than enough food for two people.  The fish sauce chicken wings are amazing, the wings are deep fried and because of the fish sauce makes the skin sticky, they have bits of fried garlic bits attached to it. Perfectly cooked on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside but the fish sauce and fried garlic bits gives it a great flavour. Easily can compete with any great chicken wing place in Toronto.  The Bo 7 Mon which is seven courses of beef served Vietnamese style. Rare beef hotpot, beef in tropical leaves, bbq beef rolls, sautéed beef, beef salad. shaking beef, beef congee. They give you Vietnamese rice paper, vegetables and vermicelli. You wet the rice paper, add beef, vermicelli and vegetables roll it up and dip it in the mam nem dipping sauce or fish sauce. Really well done, fulfilling and nice balance of dishes with great flavours.  I definitely recommend Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay and as I mentioned earlier their pho, vermicelli or rice dishes won't stand out in comparison to a lot of other good Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto but their fish sauce deep fried chicken wings with sticky rice and Bo 7 Mon (seven courses of beef) are the standouts and worth going to the restaurant to try these two dishes."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in all of toronto. You know it's great food when you feel like you've traveled back to your homeland. They have the best fish sauce deep fried wings ( trust me u have to try it! ). Not only is their food great, the people who work there are wonderful, feels like family whenever I go. So if your looking for a place to eat with great food and great service please do me a favor and give this place a shot! U will not regret it!"}
{"text":"If u guys looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, I have to say foods here Almost taste as good as Home! Most pho place the broth is water down and loaded with msg, but here you can taste the flavorful bones and sweetness of the soup. It is the first time in a long time that I finished all the noodles and broth!  We have canh ga chien nuoc mam with xoi nep, very good! Just enough amount of garlic, fish sauce and sweetness . The only complaint would be the Vietnamese coffee taste good but could be better, it's not brew fresh but from a package. My daughter love Bun bo hue, and most time Bun bo hue is ok for her when eating out, but here she said is good mommy."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5 Service - 2/5   They serve good quality Bo Bay Mon (beef 7 ways) and Chicken Wings with sticky rice.  I grew up eating Bo Bay Mon and this is the real deal and closest to what I had in Vietnam.  It's what they're known for along with their wings however be prepared to wait a very long time for the wings (like 30-45 minutes).  I suggest booking a table and pre-ordering the wings to save time.  Slow turnaround due to lack of staff and poor logistics.  They seemed to be overworked.  You can see it in the waitresses faces - the poor girls look exhausted.  The restaurant isn't super clean and is somewhat run down but it's authentic and has a very similar vibe to the restaurants in Vietnam.  It's typically a full-house and will feel very crammed.  Not a very comfortable eating environment.  I've returned many times and will continue to."}
{"text":"Wow what the heck happened to this place I no longer see the cheery waitress anymore I've been frequenting this place and wow from my first experience to now which is the last the quality has gone way down. They may have changed cooks the deep fried wings my staple comes out way too oily and portioned out small the pho noodle soup is awfully it's full of oily which they do not scoop out. I go here 3 times a week for 2 weeks and it's been all misses never ever again I'm irritated they switched cooks and there waitress needs to know and learn what customer service is. This place has been removed from my bucket list places to go."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Their foods are ok but they don't know how to so customer service. My bill was calculated wrong and the owner was horrible. They even fighted with customer."}
{"text":"Great food! Want to try more of the menu but the pho (chicken soup) is just divine! For $8 w tax you get a massive XL soup that is really a meal for me and my huge son :) There are veggies, sprouts and a lot of noodles. We order it every time."}
{"text":"The only vietnamese hot pot I know of. The hot pot with food items laid out in a circular layout is placed on a burner on the table. Then you cook the items yourself.   The food items is limited but pricing is amazing. Also ordered the seafood pancake and spring rolls. Food here is good.  I recommend it if you wanna try vietnamese style hotpot and good authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"UPDATED: Cleanliness needs to improve but I came back multiple times after this experience and it was probably an off day. I don't want 1 bad apple (young girl waitress) to ruin this place. When I'm served by the nice,friendly guy it is GREAT. for that I'm upping my rating.  ----- I really wanted to give this place 4stars for the food but with god awful service I cannot.   Lets start with the food, I definitely recommend (V12) the Fried chicken wings with sticky rice. A MUST ORDER! Almost every table in the restaursnt ordered this dish. It is more of an appetizer.  The Bo 7 Mon (7 styles of beef) is $27 for a serving enough for 2ppl. I also recommend ordering this. Just remember it is a do it yourself kind of meal. You basically are making spring rolls with rice paper, vermicelli and beef.  1. I ordered lime-monade and 20mins later was told they are out of limes when I clearly see 2 limes sitting there. I also saw her try to make it half way only to stop and do something else forgetting about it.....  2.We ordered Ca phe sua da (iced coffee) which took literally no exaggeration over 45minutes. I was almost done eating....  3. I had to ask for a new cup because my cup was dirty , i tried to wipe my plate with a wet tissue because i didnt want to be only of those ppl but I had to accept it that my plate was JUST THAT DIRTY... i had to ask for a new one and it took forever for her to bring me one.  4.I asked for more vermecelli /noodles and after over an hour when I was done with my food, rdy for the bill she asked if i still wanted the noodles.... seriously wth is wrong with them.   Service was so awful, it pained me. I wanted to go take over and just serve the entire restaurant myself. There was no prioritizing, no organization and on top of that they weren't even that friendly.   For a new restaurant that is trying to succeed in a hidden plaza corner they really need to get their act together. Ive never been so disappointed and upset that I couldnt give them more stars... being the first to review. ARGH .   I hope the next time I go things will be better. (im afraid to go back though because this is a new restaurant and they dont seem to care about cleanliness, it isnt a run down place with old places. I really think they just dont have terrible dishwashing habits and rly dont care."}
{"text":"Small Viet resto, can get tight and cozy during lunch and dinner rush. Staff speak minimal english. Lots of parking. Busy during peak hours, but for the most part - fast turnover. Everyone orders the fish sauce wings and bo 7 mon (beef 7 ways) - its their specialty, really satisfying. We also ordered their seafood hot pot. I ordered their lotus root salad - the lotus roots are too long/big, needs to but cut smaller, lacking flavour and spice - would not order again."}
{"text":"Went there solely on high ratings by other users. Had beef with rice, it was ok. Place is small and inexpensive but saw some orders were big and fancy looking. Friendly and alert staff, but overall one can't expect much more from small restaurant."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow yelpers that I get to experience a full Vietnamese dinner.(not just Pho). We order Pho, the 7 course beef and the chicken wings. It was way too much food for 2 but I didn't regret. The pho is delicious and flavorful. The 7 courses beef is a must! I would love to go back when next time I come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family go here often. The food is very reasonable priced and affordable with overall pretty good service. My favourite is their Bo 7 Mon (7 course beef) and Seafood Hot pot. I always go here to order these 2 combos which is good for 2 people. I take my friends here now. Try to come before the lunch or dinner rush. They are super busy between 7-8pm. Come before or after that time as seating limited and you can call to book a table :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Vietnamese restaurant in the city. I love that they have a wide selection of food that you can't get at your average Viet place. The hot pot for two makes for excellent brunch."}
{"text":"No other reason to go to this place but to have some beef 7 ways and their wings. Tried all their other foods, but I have limited to just those 2 items. The nem nuong in a lot lot is amazing. The wings are crispy and had just the right amount of fish sauce. The coconut milk sticky rice was amaze balls. Definitely one of the best."}
{"text":"The food here is great... once you get it. We had to wait for well over 45 minutes for the first dish to come out, and even then, the five of us did not get served at the same time. My sister finished her food well before the rest of us got ours, which is unacceptable because she had to wait while the rest of us eventually ate. This isn't the waiter's fault by any means, but the kitchen needs to get their stuff together!   1/5 - great food, terrible awful food service.   Edit: I'm writing this review as I'm sitting at the restaurant, which should say how disappointed I am in the experience as a whole. We finally got served our two orders of pad thai served and it tastes like they drowned rice noodles in ketchup. I wish I could give a worse rating."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in sketchville, hidden away in a plaza. It's a gem to find. It's very small, seats maybe, 20-25 people. We ordered the beef hot pot which comes with veggies and rice papers for DIY. I also ordered a Banh Xeo for myself. The food is good and very authentic. The employees there are very attentive and very friendly. The price of the food is great. Cash only though, which is a downfall. I would come back for more if it wasn't too far away."}
{"text":"True Vietnamese gem in the neighbourhood!  Ordered pho, vermicelli and sticky rice with deep fried chicken wings. All excellent!  The beef soup of the pho is both flavourful yet light at the same time, the vermicelli comes with herbs such as asian basil and mint leaves, along with the spring rolls, grilled pork-all in a heart and refreshing bowl. The sticky rice with chicken wings are delicious, reminded me of the authentic viet/Thai flavours I experienced in Asia. Overall, a great experience for both food and service. Will definitely come back again to try the beef 7 dishes for dinner and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday and the restaurant is fairly busy.  They have only one lady waitress and she the owner.  The restaurant is very busy from the front and the kitchen, they have make so much money from the customer based on the pricing of the dish.  However, they tried to cut corner as a result the food is horrbile. they bring out the pho and there were hair and kitchen dust float on top of the soup.  Overall, stay away, they have cut corner by not hiring people so the food quality is suffering and dirty.  She bought out the Tea Pot and you look at it you just lost the appetite.    Having say those above.  Do not go to the washroom before you eat or you will not able to eat your food.  I went to the washroom and there were so much little fly in the washroom; guess where these flies park aftward, in the kitchen.  Yup! will give you food poisoning.  We have stomach ache and headaches after the meal.  TOO MUCH MSG, all the dishes are taste of sweet and it chemically sweet from the MSG.  STAY AWAY FROM Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay.  Bad services, waitress with bad vietnamese attitude, horrible food quality, fly from the washroom parked on your dining table and the kitchen and the washroom. Got stomach ache from  Food poisoning."}
{"text":"I used to love it here! It has changed quite a bit since it has moved to a new location. It still tastes great though. If you love Vietnamese food, you have got to try it here. Lots of different options with food in comparison to other places.   Pros: - Parking: Tons of parking in the plaza!  - Food: The food is great! Lots of options and variations of Vietnamese food. If you are nervous about ordering, ask if Chi Mai is in. She is really great and will help you with all of your ordering. She recommends lots of great options and is so helpful. The food is great for sharing with multiple people - Price: Keep in mind that eating here is not like your typical pho bowl so it will cost more then that but you are getting something very different. I think the prices are very fair for the amount you get.  - Picture worthy: The food looks great in pictures!   Cons: - Consistency: Unfortunately, I have found that the food is not as consistent. I've been eating here since their first location on Eglinton to this new one. The food changes every time I come. Sometimes it is fresh and good and some times the taste is off.    Foods I love: - Fish Sauce Chicken Wings with Sticky Rice (Sticky rice is great but you can order with or without)  - Vermicelli with Spring Rolls, Beef & Shredded Pork (Lots of variations with this dish, feel free to pick different toppings)  - Bo 7 Mon (7 options for Beef - Rare Beef Hotpot, Beef in Tropical Leaves, BBQ Beef Rolls, Sautéed Beef, Beef Salad. Shaking Beef, Beef Congee, you may be able to substitute one for something else, but you should ask the server just in case)  - Bo Lalot (Beef Rolls with Tropical Leaves is fantastic! I love rolling these in rich rolls with vermicelli and vegetables.)   I really like this place and will be back! So many variations for Vietnamese food and they do a great job, just hoping it will become consistent!"}
{"text":"We always get the BO NHUNG DAM here and it is delicious! The nuoc mam chicken wings is also a must. Their bun bo hue is also good."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Vietnamese food I have ever had! My partner and I discovered this gem 2 months ago and we have been back at least 10 times since. Honestly, no Vietnamese Restaraunt on Spadina ave can compare. The food is so fresh and flavors delicious. We have tried different dishes. Favorites are the 7 beef dish meal, Pho, the chicken soup, beef sausages wrapped in leaves and of course the chicken wings with sticky rice. Not only is the food wonderful the service is top notch. The main server named Mya is so super sweet and is a super hero the way she zips from table to table. She is really passionate about the food she serves and is happy to recommend certain dishes to suit your mood. I'm getting hungry just writing this...see you there!"}
{"text":"We always order the 7 beef meal here every time we come and every time it doesn't disappoint.  What better way to feed a meat eat than having it served 7 different ways!  Service is always good as you can feel the family run environment.  As an appetizer to start, high recommend ordering the fish sauce and butter chicken wings."}
{"text":"My go to place in terms of Vietnamese food. Favourite dishes are chicken wings and 7 courses beef. I also find their beef noodle soup unbeatable in town. Definitely will go again and again but beware there will be a line on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Vietnamese restaurant with dishes. This is one of the few hidden gems that offer a great selection of traditional dishes.   I typically order the two person set meal that includes a combination of 4 meal pairings. Also you cannot leave this place without ordering their fish sauce chicken wings with sticky rice   Warning discretion - if your not a big fan of fish sauces etc. You may not like it as much as I do."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You will get the best bang for your buck here!  Their fried chicken marinated in fish sauce and garlic is my absolute favorite!!  It's a great place if you're looking to enjoy some authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"First time here recommended from a friend!   First off it's definitely run by Vietnamese ppl, so they know what they're doing and not giving u a bootleg version of their food   What we ordered   1) Fresh rolls with pork&shrimp - I always order this app when I go eat pho and this was probably the best fresh roll I've had in a very long time!  You can tell it's freshly made bc the rice paper wrap is soft and they don't stuff it with too much noodles like some places.   2) Chicken wings with sticky rice (MUST GET!) - my friend recommended this dish to me and love her for it! It had such a good flavour that was bang on! Sticky rice is literally just sticky rice. But I love rice so win-win! :)  3) Special house pho - delicious clean broth that isn't overly oily and doesn't  leave your lips all greasy! (ie at photrain) another plus in my books! :)  Like the other reviews have mentioned, they can definitely improve on their cleanliness. (i can never trust how clean those chopsticks are)  Everyone seem to have ordered the 7 beef course special when I went. My friend also recommended it and will try on my next visit! :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! So good! Best ethnic vietnamese food in Toronto!   The place is really small but worth the wait.   Toronto has many vietnamese restaurants but by far this one stands out and would be top on my list.   I usually get the 7 types of beef dish. And the chicken wings with sticky rice. I recommend is restaurant to all my friends and family.   A must try in my books."}
{"text":"This place is extremely Vietnamese, it reminds me of my trip to Vietnam.   There service isn't the best but the food is to die for.   Their chicken wings is the best thing on the menu. The portions are to share, with family and friends portions are quite large. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best fish sauce and butter chicken wings in the neighbourhood! Chi Mai is also the best server there, she has great personality and always attentive.   Papaya salad with beef jerky is also my absolute fave and I add some siracha in it to add some spice to it!   My dad also enjoyed the hu tieu kho :)"}
{"text":"My family and I (4 people) went here for a Sunday dinner and it was crowded! The place is a bit smaller than most pho restaurants but it packs a full flavour punch  We got spring rolls, fried chicken in fish sauce, their hot pot special (seafood), and 2 orders of Vietnamese pancakes (banh xeo) - which cost ~$90 after tax  Everything that we ordered was delicious and quickly prepared despite a full house! Their house special hotpot (seafood) stood out for me - savoury and a hint of sour to the broth and the seafood included toger shrimps, calamari, and fish (not the cheap kind either). Tons of bursting flavours with some that I don't get to try that often. However, the portions are small. As well, on the day we went they didn't have beverages available except for tea and water  Clean washrooms"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese experience.  We try the 7 beef course for lunch.  This is second time I have this.  This is so much more yummy.  The vegetable is very interesting.  There is a couple vergetables I have never seen before.  There is slice plantains and one has pointy leaves.  There is another dish you must try is the fish sauce wings with sticky rice.  This is definitely one of the most authentic Vietnamese resturant in north York."}
{"text":"Awesome prices! Bun bo hue was delicious and one of the best I've had (although there were no pigs trotters or congealed blood cubes in it). Service was quick and friendly, the server is great and very nice while at the same time clearly extremely efficient. I'm definitely coming back here.  Only set back is that it's cash-only. But that's not a huge problem!"}
{"text":"4.4 Very fresh and impressive selection of items that you won't find offered downtown.  Service is quick and attentive.  I'd go more often if it were downtown."}
{"text":"Everything was tasty.  But there are a a couple of drawbacks.  The vermicelli dishes had little meat, and the pho-style soup was missing the depth of flavour.  Still, they had nice accents, like freshly chopped chili paste and more unique fresh herbs than are usually offered in other Vietnamese restaurants.  The milk shake was excellent, and the cold coffee was just superb.  Overall, I'd come back here, but I'd try different dishes, like the famous 7 courses of beef."}
{"text":"One of my family's favourite places to dine at. The combos are really good. We always get the hot pot combo, sour soup combo or the 7 beef combo. The restaurant is a family business and they provide great service. Try to come here before or after the dinner rush because seating is limited and there is definitely going to be a wait. Recently my parents have been loving the vermicelli noodles because of the yummy egg rolls. My favourite snack dish of theirs is the nuoc mam (fish sauce) chicken wings."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had the 7 courses of beef. It was quite filling for two of us. Decently priced at $27. We liked all the courses, except for the last one, beef congee (tiny congee and bland). They gave us generous portion of rice paper and fresh mint/lettuce; good and fresh selection of greens to go with your beef. We ordered the famous deep fried chicken wings and sticky rice to go. Haven't tried it yet but all yelpers seem to highly appraise it. Can't wait to try it tonight.  It's a bit out of the way for us, but definitely will come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"pretty much every single person that comes here gets the same thing.  u guessed it ... 7 beef course (and the wings).  couple of things you will notice when you first arrive.  1. they are trying with the decor and wall... but the place is still very very small. 2. almost everyone there is really Vietnamese including the staff.  you will feel like a foreigner if you are not Vietnamese 3. everyone is eating the same thing and almost no room on the table for everything.  i like the fact that they ask you if you want hot tea or cold tea.   nice touch.  As for the food, its not bad..  Its really hard to find places in Toronto that sell the 7 course meal.  If anyone knows any please msg me.. i only know of 3 and kim bo closed down. many places like broadview, train that use to have it .. now no longer offer the special.  I would not say this is the best 7 beef courses i have tried.. they are missing the typical big beefball that other places serve.  the only peeve i have is.. the size of the serving.  some of the dishes were really a joke.  For example the congee that comes in the same bowl as fish sauce.  It was literally two spoonfuls.  Whats the point?   take a look at the picture.  Also one of the dishes that only filled up less than a quarter of the plate.  It just kinda looks bad.     That being said, i would still get it again because after all you do get a lot of choices and variety."}
{"text":"The 7 beef is good but not amazing. Same quality that you could get at other pho restaurants. The main manager or maybe owner Mai is lovely but the reason why we would never go back to this place is the old hag that was running the place yesterday. Maybe she is the mother or mother in law of Mai but she should be kept in the back kitchen given her attitude. She was rude to customers and wait staff. She mixed up the orders and made us wait a long time. The table was dirty. She handled food and money the same time...gross! Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have ever had at an Asian restaurant. We decided to give his place another try to experience the good food as raved by some and overlook the dirty place and terrible service.  The place was busy so we waited. We got seated after 20 minutes and waited another 20 minutes for water downed tea and dirty menus. We ordered quickly as we were pre warned about the slowness of their service.   We ordered their 7 course beef and famous chicken wings, as well as pho tai sach vien and drinks. The wings were good, but took quite some time for it to make it to our table. The 7 course beef was laughable as the portions were tiny. The dipping sauces were tiny as well and we asked for more, we are charged extra $$ for everything we asked. The pho was lacking. Many other great pho options out there.   The restaurant it self was unclean and quite cramped. Once u sit down u cannot move. The service was slow and uninviting.  Not worth the wait. Maybe order take out next time if we really wanted the wings. At the end of our meal which took almost 2 hrs later mainly waiting for food and service we still didn't get our drinks."}
