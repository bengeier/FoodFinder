{"text":"The people working at the restaurant (including the chef) were very pleasant and friendly. The service and food were awful. We were six people. After we placed our orders, the chef told us that because we had such a complicated order, that things were going to take a while. Strange, since we ordered straight off the menu and didn't ask for anything special. It took almost an hour before the first plate came out. The first person finished their plate long before the last person even received their own food. 

My club sandwich was gross. I'm pretty sure the mayo had gone bad. I couldn't finish it despite how hungry I was. 

I'm never going back again. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they are such nice people."}
{"text":"From the modest menu selection one can choose tasty entrees, a delicious main course and a sweet dessert prepared by an accomplished chef for a reasonable price.

They also have the occasional all-you-can-eat buffets. The last one I tried was the Tastes of Italy, featuring a gastronomic tour of traditional Southern Italian cuisine. Definitely a trip to remember."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation, delicious food, reasonable prices and attentive server. My only complaint was the uneven service.  A table of people that came in 15 minutes after us were served their food 10 minutes before our food came out, and only 3 of the 4 people at our table got their food at the same time, the meal for the 4th person was served half way through our meals."}
