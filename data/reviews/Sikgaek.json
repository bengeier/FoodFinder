{"text":"Came in hungry and left extremely satisfyingly stuffed. This was way better than expected. Service was on point and extremely friendly! Love that there are private booths which made our dining experience for a party of 5 more comfortable and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Complimentary sides included too tiny portion of kimchi, pickled jalapeno peppers and seasoned soy beans.  Their noodle soup (kalgooksoo) was a messy and unpleasingly thick concoction of noodles in an egg-y broth.  We also had their fried chicken with green onions, turned out to be a very mediocre dish.  Nothing special, not memorable at all."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited the highly-rated Sikgaek one Sunday evening after playing escape rooms in Downsview.  The restaurant isn't big, but it wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. The service was quick and friendly.   Unfortunately, the food was mediocre.   The homemade noodle soup and dumplings were quite bland, and the size of the dumplings was disappointing. The spicy ramen noodle soup was the only dish that had any flavour, but it tasted exactly like instant ramen noodles.   The dishes mentioned above are perfect if you're feeling sick and you're looking for something hot and soupy, but not if you're looking for delicious, mouthwatering authentic Korean noodles and dumplings."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday after reading the reviews. Loved it! Best dumplings ever!"}
{"text":"This place appeared to be pretty popular among Korean locals when we arrived for lunch. The restaurant is pretty small and has limited seating, but we were able to get the last table. We ordered some dishes to share: dumplings (half fried, half steamed), cold soba noodles with shredded cabbage and beef bulgogi. We all agreed that the food was okay - nothing very different than the other Korean restaurants in the area.  The service was pretty friendly and attentive considering how busy it was when we first arrived. The place cleared out pretty quickly after the lunch hour and we sat for a while chatting and were not made to feel like we should leave."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, I live in the area and had noticed this place where Paul and Sandy's used to be but had never looked further into it until I saw on Yelp that it had really good reviews.  I'm going to start off by saying that I am not Korean and do not have much experience with Korean food so I can't really tell you the \"authenticity\" of the food, so I'm just going off experience and taste.    Since it was a Monday night it wasn't very busy, there were only a few other people who looked to be Korean (also, the couple that came in after us spoke to the server in Korean) eating there which is a good sign.  The inside also looked clean and fairly modern, they did a good job on updating what used to be there.  The waitress was very friendly and accommodating, there was a bit of a language barrier with some questions on what she suggested from the menu and a couple other questions but it didn't really matter as she was friendly and everything got figured out in the end :), the food is really all that matters.  She started by bringing us kimchi which was really yummy, the person who I was with was more familiar with Korean food than I was and said it was very authentic. We ordered dumplings to share, half boiled half fried and they came out pretty quickly and were very yummy.  I really liked that the fried dumplings were not greasy and dripping in oil, and the meat tasted flavourful.  I got the beef bulgogi and my friend got spicy squid and vegetables.  The beef was super tender and had a great flavour, and was mixed with mushrooms.  I ate the whole thing.  I tried a bit of my friend's dish and it was VERY spicy, but also tasted great, she finished hers as well.  I'm also happy that the rice was included and didn't need to be ordered separately and you got a good amount.  The prices were very reasonable also.  Overall everything was delicious and I am looking forward to coming back in the future and trying other things on the menu.  This restaurant is a welcome addition to the area, definitely come check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So far my favorite Korean restaurant in Mississauga, decent taste and very reasonable price.   We ordered the spicy fired chicken full chicken, I would say it could feed four ppl no problem. Love the sweet taste, but would recommend to order half half, if you'd like to taste the original flavor as well."}
{"text":"Sikgaek is by far my favourite Korean restaurant in Canada. They do a great job with all their dishes, (even their side dishes are amazing imo, best Kimchi I've had here also, not overly fermented). I've had Korean friends come here and vouch for the authenticity.   For inexperienced Korean foodies I recommend: - pork bulgogi dupbap - half / half Yangnam(spicy/sweet) padak (green onion) fried chicken. Don't forget to eat yangnyeom with radish!  Customer service has also been amazing for me, but I do come here fairly often. Just be polite and if you don't speak Korean, just make sure you're not rushing through your words.  Thanks/ Sikgaek!"}
{"text":"For those who live near by Islington Station you must visit this new Korean restaurant that just opened up. The food too good to explain. I will just say I havent had a chance to take picture since the food was too grat."}
{"text":"The fried dumplings and their sauce were amazing! They were huge and the filling was really savoury and tasty. This was my favourite of all the dishes we tried.   We also order the beef bulgogi which was tasty and the squid which was a bit spicy for our taste. The hot pork dish had just the right amount of spice and the portions were huge! Definitely good value for the money. Next time we'll go back to try the noodles.   Atmosphere is quaint, unassuming and casual"}
{"text":"A spectacular Korean restaurant, that will impress you with a brilliant dining experience. Top notch food, great pricing & amazing timings. One of the best Korean restaurants in GTA . Definitely worth a visit for the ever discerning foodie."}
{"text":"A pretty decent Korean place. Better than many. I really enjoyed beef bulgogi and the pork bone soup was great"}
{"text":"Wow... Awesome place... Thanks Yelp! Bought three orders of dumplings... Was not disappointed!  Was greeted and seated upon entering, and given hot tea immediately... Not waiting was nice since its lunch time and time is of the essence!  Good game quickly and was delicious!  Will come again!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here to give a try after my girl found this nice place. What we had for the appetizer was their steamed dumplings, their dumplings are way better than the ones you eat at Koreatown, and the sauce that goes with the dumplings. You gotta try their noodle dishes, they were amazing.   P.S.:Their service is also a plus."}
{"text":"Home style hand made Korean dumpling is fabulous! Kalgooksoo is great too..the soup is hearty without being heavy and the noodle is lively."}
{"text":"Dumplings are really good! And the bulgogi hotpot was delicious! Just enough for three people. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"ordered tteokguk online for delivery because I wasn't feeling well, it comes with dumpling, rice cake, and beaten eggs, I asked for extra tteokbokki but didn't know that asking an extra of it will lose the dumplings toppings because I didn't get any of it. never again for $14."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we finally have a place that can make really good + authentic Korean food in Etobicoke..! This means I don't have to drive all the way to up north york..I have to tell you I'm very picky with my Korean food...but this place is worth trying :) -   I had Dumpling soup + Pork Cutlet, Steamed Dumpling and Kalgooksoo (homemade noodle soup). their dumplings and noodles are all hand-made and so tasty and so filling! also the garlic kimchi was very good but I'm not sure if non-Koreans will like this kimchi since it has strong garlic flavours..anyways overall everything was very satisfying.  Next time I'm going to try out Dduk bok ee (rice cake) and Bulgogi.  This will definitely be my go to place when I have cravings for Korean food."}
{"text":"We were trying to figure out a place to eat for the longest time as there's so many restaurants in Mississauga. We stumbled upon this place through yelp and had good reviews and we thought we give it a try.  It was an amazing experience! The service was phenomenal! The dish with chicken and cheese was absolutely delicious!!! We didn't think that the portion would be that much as it said 2 portions. We weren't able to finish it but then again we also ordered alot of different types of food. Pork bone soup was a little bit spicy but good. Shrimp fried rice was really good. Pretty much the dishes we had were all good and they also brought us complimentary soup as well which was nice of them.   We had a private booth which was cool and the staff were prompt and super friendly. We would definately make another trip to Mississauga again to visit this gem!"}
{"text":"Padak (fried chicken with green onions) was so crispy and juicy!  The Ddeokboki with Odeng (spicy soup with rice cake and fish cake) was spicy and so filling!"}
{"text":"We popped in here for a late night dinner. We were greeted by a very friendly female server. We ordered the homemade noodle soup, stir fry spicy squid and seafood pancake. All were delicious and  everything was bursting with unique flavours. Prices were very reasonable for the large quantities. This is a small neighborhood gem, family run with a relaxed atmosphere. We will be back for sure. Always feels good to support a small local restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far one my favorite Korean restaurant spot in Mississauga and even bests some of the ones found in Yonge and finch in my opinion.  I had ordered the gingseng chicken soup, not expecting much for a late night spot in middle of southern part of Mississauga near th china town center.  Boy was it good, the chicken wasn't dry as I was expecting for this kinda soup, it had real chunks of gingseng and a whole small chicken cooked in.  Flavor was spot on, usually I have to dip the chicken in salt in other places, this on the other hand was flavorful enough I just added black pepper.  Clean and inviting, the place owner even checked up on me a few times to see if the food was good.  Highly recommended for a late night food spot and Korean food spot in general"}
{"text":"Very satisfied! Showed up at 11am on a Saturday and had our pick of seating. Friendly waitress explained everything because the English translations on the menu were not very good. I forget the names but we got a spicy noodle soup, a non spicy soup with dumplings and rice cake, and fried dumplings. Portions were huge. Good value for money. Free tea was delicious. Kimchi was probably the best I've ever had. Prices were reasonable and service was fast. Eclectic decorations include vintage Korean movie posters and some beautiful Korean word art. Basement bathrooms were not very clean and there was no soap in the dispenser. Other than that, a truly enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant, quality food and also great service."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza that can easily be missed along Dundas Street near Cawthra Road. I am so thankful to have heard of this place from my sister in law.   I've lost count of the number of times I've gone here already but every time I go I get the same menu items. Cheese DakGalbi and spicy fried chicken (man, my mouth is watering just thinking of this!)   Cheese DakGalbi (please forgive me if I am misspelling this) is a sweet and spicy chicken broth with rice cakes and some veggies and chicken. It is served with shredded mozzarella cheese on their table stoves and eventually the cheese melts (*drooling* I love cheese) sounds like a weird combo but it is so good!   Spicy Fried Chicken is a sweet spicy fried chicken. It's a sticky sauce fried chicken. Which I am so in love with.  If you can't handle spicy, you can always ask them to lessen it and they will try to speak with the cook. Because both are SO spicy.   The servers are so patient and helpful and they usually yell a greeting when you enter and exit the restaurant. Nice to feel acknowledged!"}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken is definitely the best in Mississauga. The food comes very fast and service is good."}
{"text":"Top class Korean, with separated boots for small and large groups. Really warmly recommend..."}
{"text":"It was very disappointed food experience here. I was excited to try their knife cut noodle. Even though It takes about 1 hour from my house I thought it would be worthy it. At first their atmosphere was not welcoming and table setting was not nice. Anyways the noodle soup was not tasty. They are not professional I think. So I wasted my money and time."}
{"text":"Not the same level as Korean food in North York, but still, it's uncomplicated and tasty with that home cooked quality. Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and kid-friendly. The cook gave my daughter some off menu items for free. :) Always a good idea to make parents/customers with that extra attention. Have been here a few times already and will be back for sure.  The kalgooksu (homemade noodle soup) is the standout dish here."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great food and service^^ I've had the fried chicken, Donkatsu and Japtang Teokboke. They were very fresh and delicious. I really recommend here!!!"}
{"text":"I have fond memories for Sikgaek, as I had a very pleasant experience at here before. Unfortunately, this time simply did not compare. The food was decent, but the service was pretty poor.  I absolutely love their banchan, particularly their pickled radishes and seasoned bean sprouts. In the past, they were very kind and perfectly fine with us requesting seconds; however, this time, the waitress had quite a bad attitude when we did so. She was also fairly slow at providing essential items (e.g., napkins).  Food wise, the quality had remained mostly the same. Their fried chicken is still very crisp and not greasy by any means, and is a very generous portion. We ordered a whole fried chicken with the spicy sauce on the side, and the chicken was very juicy with a crisp batter.   I also tried their soybean soup, which arrived with a delicious fragrant smell of seafood. There were many tiny pieces of octopus in the broth, but I was sad to see only one shrimp in the soup.  My dad got the gamjatang or pork bone soup, and his main complaint was that there were many bones, but not much meat at all.   We may still return, but I'm beginning to prefer Song Cooks, as it has more variety and service appears to be more consistent there."}
{"text":"I am in town for work... luckily I am near about half a dozen Korean Restaurants...O never review without at least visiting twice....  At first I thought I found Gem, the people were nice, the food was good.  What I found after two visits, they have absolutely no memory.  I visited the day before, and as usual, ordered enough for 2 people...left.a big tip, but on the second day it was lost...  I travel a lot for work, so I like to fine \"my spot\" in every new location...  Thus place loves your business, but have no memory at all.."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother at 12:30am and had an amazing experience. Ordered a couple dishes under $12 and half a chicken for $17 and left STUFFED. The food was really high quality and full of flavour! The booths are really cute and cozy, and are like a full private room. Will be bringing my friends and family here for sure!"}
{"text":"New Korean dumpling and noodles place in the Etobicoke area neighbourhood. Really amazing dumplings and noodles!! Also love their beef bulgogi. Talked to the owner and it seems like they are a chain in Korea. Really lucky to have this new Korean joint in the Etobicoke neighbourhood. I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"This place is better than expected!  First, my friend, who is Korean, recommended that this Korean restaurant is one of the more authentic place for Korean cuisine.   Second, they serve import Korean beer and white rice wine that you don't see from anywhere else  We ordered lots of mandus (which are Korean dumplings). We ordered both fried and steam Mandu. They are delicious and recommend to order them. We also ordered stew and the spiciness is perfect for this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"My local Korean Canadian friends brought me here so I trusted their judgment in choosing an authetic Korean restaurant.  It reminded me of Japanese Izakaya with some private booths, it's a kind of place guys would come afterwork to enjoy beer and casual dishes such as fried chicken, BBQ, etc. This place seems very popular, the parking space is limited and it's challenging to find a space. We ordered a big pot of Gukmul Tteokbokki , a spicy soup with rice cake, which was a great dish to share among 4 people. Their kimchi jjigae was excellent, it totally hit the spot.  The service was pretty fast, the waitress was very attentive. I would totally recommend this place when in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious with great quick service! What more can I ask for??   Maybe it was because we went on a particularly chilly night and were seated by the window but one tip I have to give is to bring a sweater! While it was really good, it was a bit uncomfortable as we ate our entire meals wearing our coats.   Anyhow, the restaurant may be difficult to find if you're not familiar with the area as it is tucked away in the corner or a small plaza on dundas. Inside however is typical of many other Korean establishments with many wooden booths.   The service here is impeccable. Again like most Korean restaurants, each booth has a service bell. But at sikgaek, the second you press the button you will here the entire staff yell something to acknowledge it. Seconds later, someone will run to your table, ready to assist you. Probably the most efficient service I have ever witnessed!   As we were celebrating a birthday, we ordered a variety of dishes. 2 orders of fried chicken (spicy and green onion), 2 ginseng chicken soups, a spicy rice cake dish, fried squid, and spicy bulgogi. Before we even get to these dishes I have to mention they have FANTASTIC kimchi. I honestly think I have to go back and buy a box of it, so good!   For the fried chicken, the pieces were all whole, unlike most other korean fried chicken places. I don't believe its double fried either but they were still quite crispy. The 'spicy' flavour is deceiving in that its not really that spicy at all! It is however surprisingly sweet, more like a sweet and sour sauce flavour. I definitely preferred it over the green onion but both had their charms.   The ginseng soup you'd think would be pretty boring due to the clear broth but it's just so flavorful! But at the same time very soothing. Skip your regular chicken noodle soup next time you're sick and get this!!! Highly recommend this soup.   The last few dishes were a bit weaker in my opinion but still quite good. The 'fried' squid was fine but let's be honest, it was grilled not fried. Nothing wrong with that but I definitely expected something else while ordering it. The spicy bulgogi was also just fine, but almost unforgettable compared to the other dishes. But this, unlike the chicken, actually was quite spicy!  The spicy rice cakes I did not know while ordering actually had to be cooked some more at the table. I felt that boiling it for longer when most of the items seemed to have been precooked kind of made everything too soft. The dumplings completely fell apart and rice cakes became a bit too mushy for my liking. But overall I thought the flavor was good.   In terms of cost, I definitely think for Korean food this is a bit on the higher end but not by much. In addition, a lot of these dishes taste much higher quality so I think it justifies the price.   While not every dish was a favorite, I think each one of its dishes were solid and I definitely would return again!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean food I've had, we ordered fried chicken and pork bone soup hot pot. However, despite tasting great, both me and my girlfriend got food poisoned after eating.  I ate there last night and I'm still shitting bricks here 24 hours after. So, if you want great tasting food while willing to risk getting food poisoned, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Tasty. Pleasantly surprised. Really liked the starters: pickled onions, kimchi, bean sprouts. Had pork bone soup which had a lot of meat and was seasoned well. Would go back."}
{"text":"My go to Korean joint. Epic hot pot, fried chicken, ginseng chicken, pork dishes. Good service, fun decor. Now I'm hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I enjoy Sikgaek because they open late and they are always fast and efficient with their food. They also are kind enough to offer their booths and corner tables despite only the two of us. I ordered their fried chicken with green onions and I would say it surpasses the quality of the FRY which is their nearby competitor. Their kimchi fried rice was okay, Other than fried chicken, I don't think any of their other dishes have stood out to me."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my friends because we saw the yelp reviews here and the Instagram pics made it look delish! Plus this place is in our area and we don't have to trek to north york. When we went in, it wasn't super busy. I think there was three four tables. Anyways, ordered their steamed dumplings which consisted of pork, onions and glass noodles. It was so delicious! And it comes in 12. And I love their dumplings because the dumpling skin is really thin.   We also ordered kalgooksu which are famous handmade noodles. The noodles are thick and and I found the broth quite flavourful. If you want more flavour you can add more red pepper powder.   I'll definitely come back again, next time I wanna try their donkatsu and their bibimmandu."}
{"text":"What they do here, they do well.   We visited on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 PM - note that on weekdays, from Monday to Friday, street parking on Dundas Street W right in front of the restaurant is free after 4:00 PM. So, free parking, score!  Service was sweet and friendly. They're definitely trying to go for a casual yet still trendy atmosphere - decor was neat and tidy with some definite effort put into look and branding.   We ordered: a) Homemade Noodle Soup ($8.95), b) Beef Bulgogi, with a side of rice ($12.95), and c) an order of their homemade dumplings - half fried, half steamed ($8.95). Portion size for the dumplings and soup were quite large - first of all, I couldn't finish my soup! Like Stephanie S. said below, definitely share this if you order it! The Bulgogi was very tender and had more of a sweetness to it than I'm used to, which we agreed was both unique and delicious. The dumplings were our highlight, stuffed with meat (and Fried being my middle name, I loved the fried over the steamed, but both were very tasty). I really appreciated that they split the dumpling type half-half, giving us a chance to try both steamed and fried, so ask for this if you're indecisive about which type to go for!  Overall, a fine spot for Korean food trying to etch a name for itself for certain dishes and creations - it certainly isn't Owl of Minerva - definitely slightly more upscale, but still a great spot for a casual dinner. We enjoyed our meal (although not the best Korean food we've ever had). What they presented, they did quite well, and above-average. We'll definitely be back for those dumplings!  For our entire meal, with tax and tip, for two people, we paid around $38.00."}
{"text":"Plus 30 with a humid index of 40 and I decide to go for hot dumpling soup......absolutely no regrets! I got the homemade noodle soup with mandu dumplings and it sure did hit the spot. A hearty egg drop soup with rice cakes and mandu. The portion size is huge and only $8.95 for a bowl. I've tried a few different mandu dishes and this is one of the best. Perfectly season and didn't break when picking up.   It's a small family run restaurant with lots of tables to enjoy your meal. Once I entered I was warmly greeted and offered cold water. Parking was a bit difficult to find.  I definitely would come back just to try there two way mandu ....fried and steamed."}
{"text":"The first time I went, which was maybe 2-3 months ago, the spicy pork dish was mind blowing. It had this amazing smokey-esque flavour I haven't tasted elsewhere. At that time, the soon tofu was amazing too. It was almost as flavourful as another soon tofu specialized restaurant in Mississauga.   When I returned recently, and ordered the same dishes, it did not taste as I remembered. I am unsure if I just had this high expectation of those dishes, but it fell short. The spicy pork tasted fine, but did not have that smokey flavour, which did leave me disappointed. In addition, the soon tofu tasted less flavourful and almost... watered down.   Was it the worst I've had? Nop. If I had late night Korean cravings, I would 150% choose this place over Owl."}
{"text":"Saw this place while I was searching on yelp.  Reviews were pretty good so we gave it a try. Ordered pork bone soup, fried chicken and green onion fried chicken. Food was delicious and service was pretty good considering the place was busy when we went.  We will definitely be back with the kids next time!"}
{"text":"My BF and I ordered The Cheese DakGalbi. Which btw it's a minimum order of two! We opted out of the vegetables that came with the meal but left the potato in and we added ramen noodles! The cheese quality was spot on. It melted well and tasted good. It was stringy and easily pulled apart which is every cheese lovers dream come true. The chicken was tender and spicy cut into chunks and slices but there wasn't much pieces, which I was disappointed in. There was a lot of potato I guess coz we took out most of the vegetables. It was chewy but it grabbed a lot of the flavour but I didn't enjoy it. The ramen noodles added to the dish... MADE this dish ( and the cheese). I highly recommend adding ramen noodles!!! I gobbled all the ramen noodles in seconds! Maybe coz I love ramen noodles. This place is okay and I may come back to try other items but I felt like my dish was overly priced.  We got a bunch of the regular side orders when you go to a Korean restaurant such as your kimchi, fermented carrots and radishes etc. It was okay nothing extraordinary. There was a little hair in my radish dish and when we told our serve she was kind and apologetic and gave us a new one.   The restaurant itself was nice, spacious and clean. And the customer service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to try this place out.  I wasn't able to make it to the original location but made it to there new location here in Mississauga.  The new location has a big but busy parking lot.   First impressions,,, clean.  The staff was friendly and very responsive. There specialty is GOOK dishes  (No pun intended) but we decided to go for the table cooked  BBQ Pork Belly, Donkatsu, Bulgogi, Fried Dumplings and PBS.  The staff was so responsive.  They assisted us in cooking the pork belly when we were all to busy chatting.  So nice of them.  The restaurant also has several private booths for those shy people.  lol.  I also have to add that he restaurant is baby friendly.  The staff was quick to refill empty banchan dishes and removing finished plates.   I was outside Vaping when the Owner of the restaurant (Calvin) approached me and stuck up a conversation.  (It turns out that we have mutual friends.)  Nice guy.   As for the stand out dishes that we ate, I have to say that the Pork Belly was delicious and they have by far one of the tastiest Fried Mandu in the GTA.  Unfortunately, they no longer serve steamed Mandu.  I do wish they did though.  My next visit will be all about the GOOK dishes."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple time and this place is definitely as good as it gets! It's family friendly (my family brought a 2 y.o. kid here, we were in a booth so we got privacy and the kid didn't ran around), good late night (I respect this place for having a non-rowdy crowd), good for groups and date night (of course korean food for a date, if you can't accept my facial expressions when I'm eating kalbi then you gots to go!)  The place is neat, they have friendly and attentive staff (I love that button to call service, kudos to korean restaurants), and fast service. First, you have to try their gamjatang, it's only 9 bucks and it's usually the judging factor of a korean restaurant along with kimchi. If you don't make good banchan and gamjatang, then you gots to go! Note their gamjatang rans out and I've been to this place many times when they tell me they don't have it anymore. That's right, it's good. I suggest you get it when it's there.  Other ones that I recommend to order are hot sauce spicy pork dunbap as it has the good amount of gochujang I like that it's good my mouth fall off goodness, any fried chicken on the menu as they are made to juicy crispiness, and kimchi pancake as it's super kimchi."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Highly recommend the kalguksu. It's extremely unique by adding perilla powder and the extra layer of taste it adds to the noodles are absolutely amazing.  I get it almost every single time I go back."}
{"text":"Went to visit around 2pm on a Sunday.  I've been to this place when it was still Minami.  The set up is the same with the tatami booths still intact.  They've upgraded some of the furniture but all in all still the tight restaurant it was before.  It was a tight set up making it even difficult for the staff to maneuver around the seats.  Maybe the divider wall they had just shouldn't be there.  Food:  half fried chicken, gamjatang (pork bone soup) and bibimbap.  The fried chicken came first which was quite a surprise.  The pork bone was next then the bibimbap.  I waited for my rice which by the way the chicken did not come with.  I did have it with the gamjatang.  I almost make it a point to have gamjatang at every korean restaurant I visit.  Often, I don't expect much because Owl of Minerva broth is truly difficult to beat.  This did not beat it but it does have it's upside.  The pork bone had more meat.  It was also easier to navigate than Owl where the meat is more accessible meaning less bone.  The broth is better than most korean restaurant but again not as good as Owl.  The bibimbap was good nothing to rave home about.  The 4 star is the fried chicken.  It was crispy yet very juicy.  I'm stumped because it came first which means it's precooked.  Precooked meat refried often means dry.  Amazing!  0  Service:  great as most Korean restaurants.  Actually I have really yet to receive bad service at one.  It was surprisingly busy even for the time we came.  There was 2 servers and they were efficient and fast.  They were accommodating with several patrons asking for different things.  That call bell went off multiple times and yet didn't cluster them once.  They were composed and polite and still helpful.    I think i found another go to away from Owl of Minerva's busier times.  I'm glad I veered off my norm."}
{"text":"Food and menu need more work, BUT with friendly service, reasonable price, accept credit, private parking right behind the building = worth a try if you are in the neighborhood  Tried: cold noodle (brothy one), fried dumplings (in-house made), and makguksoo (don't know how to spell it but it is spicy buckwheat noodles with veggies)   Highlights: makguksoo! and kimchi was good too  Short menu compared to most Korean places in GTA. I respect restaurants that have limited menus they specialize in, but they have to do it in a right way, right? They specialize in hand pulled noodles (served in hot, thick broth) and dumplings (they make them fresh here!). Because it was so hot on Sunday, we didn't dare to try their signature dish (I will be back to try it to complete my review! so stay tuned!). Instead, we ordered cold noodle with broth (you can get a combo with either of cold noodles (brothy one or spicy one) + 6pc. dumplings (fried or steamed) for 50 cents cheaper than the regular price).  I would have to say the broth needs more flavor (just for heads up, you are supposed to add vinegar and mustard that the server gives you until you get that \"kick\" to it) and dumplings are nothing special (I prefer fist sized ones at Mandoohyang, located in Mississauga). Makguksoo has been always my favorite summer food in Korea. Their spicy sauce is good and shredded cabbages are fresh. Liked their kimchi (not too salty or spicy). They only give you kimchi if you just order noodles and dumplings (this is usually the case in Korea, so don't think they skimp on side dishes). I don't know if you get more side dishes when you order other dishes that come with steamed rice.   Overall, worth a try if you are in the area already. However, it is not worth to make a trip there (unless you want to try their signature dish because as far as I know, this is the only place that serves this specific type of hand pulled noodles). There are better Korean places out there."}
{"text":"I went there with my sister tonight. I had the spicy pork belly, ny sister had the octopus...overall the food was tasty and spicy, although i would have preferred if they cut the pork into bigger bite size pieces.  The service was friendly and I noticed they had private booths which is gr for office functions. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely SUCK! If I can give 0 star i will not give a one star! We ordered fried chicken, but they gave me the wrong flavor, then the cold noddles I don't know the Korean name, it was FULL of ice, which supposed to be soup. I cannot even eat it! Also, it taste so bad, like real ice water. For packages, they only gave me paper box. R U kidding me! Even no foil paper inside? I will definitely not come here anymore!"}
{"text":"This place has been a recent find for me and I adore this place a lot already. Its really nice and clean inside and the servers are really friendly and quick to serve as well.   I like Korean food in general but in this restaurant my go to dish has been their Don katsu lately and I have been liking their kalbi as well. So do try it if your new to the dish and would like something non-spicy to start.   Prices ranges around 10$ and up so its quite on the pricey side for some of their dishes. I think its worth it though, they cook some good stuff.   If you have a kid btw, I would say that the only thing that this restaurant lacks is a ramp for strollers..so I wouldn't think too much about bringing one in unless your child walks.   Anyway, I highly recommend them and am a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the fried chicken in green onion flavour and sweet&hot flavour. The sweet and hot flavour is actually not spicy at all. I don't mind since I can't eat spicy. I found the green onion was too dry for my taste. But it was good as well. I also ordered the fish cake soup. Overall, it was good and I'll definitely be back since it is probably the best you can find in Mississauga without going to North York or downtown."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Its fairly intimate being tables are organized into private booths. Seems very private but you do hear noise from neighbouring booths.  They serve the full breadth of korean foods. Korean bbq, fried chicken  pork bone soup, cold noodles, etc. Its the general place for korean food in sauga.  We ordered the butter squid and saucy fried chicken. Both were very good. I thought the squid could be fresher but the fried chicken was done well. Ive been to many Korean fried chicken places in Toronto and thought this was among the top Ive tried.  I recommend this place if your near china centre in mississaiga. Not many korean options in the area, but this is great place to eat even comparing to the options in koreatown."}
{"text":"Meh. Never read that before, huh? Service was great. Nice interior, I like the booths.  17 bucks for spicy chicken hot plate, expensive.  Terrible heartburn and dirty burps for hours..."}
{"text":"Solid knife noodle soup. I usually prefer the broth clear and less eggy but I really enjoyed their version too. The broth was really rich and satisfying. I especially like their dumplings as its not too garlicky! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am really bummed about my experience here. I usually hit up Seor Ak San in China town whenever I have a craving for Korean food. Maybe it was the 5 star rating I saw for this place, I think I expected too much. I made an impromptu visit to this place on a weekday afternoon with a few friends. the restaurant is pretty small. The service was quite prompt. The menu had limited options and they did not have bibimbap.   We ordered bulgogi, dumplings and pork donkatsu. The bulgogi was served almost instantly which probably meant the food was prepared in advance. Unlike other places, it was quite watery and not temperature wise not very hot. The pork donkatsu was not bad but the sauce on top of it tasted a lot like ketchup. It came with a salad which was again dressed with mayonnaise and ketchup. It was definitely not authentic. The service was a bit lacking as no one came to refill our water. This place is more a 2.5 star overall.  I don't think I will come back to this place especially since China Town has far better options and is much closer."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. I felt like soup so I ordered the spicy ramen noodle bowl with a side of a half fried chicken bowl to share with a friend. The spiciness was less than I expected but I still loved the broth and noodles. The fried chicken was good but not the best I have had. It was actually quite a lot of chicken for a half portion. The regular sides that come with every meal were delicious, with a great kimchi. I would go again to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great late night place. I came here around 1AM after a concert and got the pork bone soup. The waitresses were very nice and accommodating for 1 in the morning. They gave me a huge portion of soup (literally had 6 meaty bones in it) with a lot of rice for a good price! Definitely will be back here. I left so full and happy"}
{"text":"I have been going to Owl for many years as I thought there weren't many Korean options in the West. This restaurant is new find and a gem! Their dishes are priced a touch higher but the overall quality and flavour are there. Their banchan is simple (3-4 dishes) but their kimchi is delicious. A touch spicier than other places. I really enjoy the heat that comes with their dishes - if it says spicy, it is. Nothing that will take away your taste buds though but I appreciate how they honour that.We ordered a hot pot of pork bone soup, glass noodles, spam, hotdogs and some mushrooms. The meal comes with two bowls of rice and easily could have fed 3-4 people. For 2 of us, we had plenty of leftovers. We also ordered half of their fry chicken, their portion was generous (8-9 pieces). The skin was crispy, not greasy. Perfect to compliment the spicy stew! The service is quick and the place is busy even for 9pm on a Sunday. Will come to visit again as I have found my new favourite Korean joint in the west."}
{"text":"I've been lucky that most Korean places I've been to are delicious.  I usually go to buk chang dong soon tofu, but we decided to try something different this day. Their banchan tasted great to start.  The food is delicious like more other Korean places as well and the prices are reasonable.  If you liked this place, definitely try out buk chang dong soon tofu as well."}
{"text":"Yup . Frozen slush soup.   All                                       Recommended! House Kim chi. Pork bulgogi. Dumplings;Linear but good. Boss lady real fine; young lady bit attitude. Clean , varied  prob authentic. Try Korean ' sake' Cum again"}
{"text":"Food is average ! We ordered fried chicken and the forgot to season with salt... no taste at all...."}
{"text":"The marinated spicy chicken (YangNyum) had a very thick sticky sauce that was more sweet than spicy. I wouldn't actually be able to identify it as spicy without knowing it was beforehand. Oddly, the sauce on the marinated chicken made us significantly more thirsty than the plain chicken did. The 'Plain fried chicken' was tender with a nice crispy exterior. While the sauce tasted good, I had a slight preference for the plain option. Everyone I have been here with has leaned at least slightly towards the marinated choice.  The size of the 'half' portion of chicken was large enough for me to be happy with having eaten it independently while two friends were satisfied having split it.  Pork bone soup had pork that easily came off the bone and a broth that had a strong flavor. I wasn't too enamored with the texture of the potato but still enjoyed the soup. This was the only dish that I have tried here that I would identify as spicy.  The hot stone beef bulgogi dupbap came in a bowl that was very warm rather than hot. The flavor was more subtle than that of the pork bone soup.  All of the provided side dishes were good (I really like the kimchi)."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken is their business, and they are doing it perfectly. This is a must go place, when you are craving for a great Korean Fried Chicken.  Ordered 3 buckets of chicken, one dry rub and two sauces. It's finger lickin good!"}
{"text":"First time here. The service was really good. I love that they're open late and you get a little private booth. The portions were large but I wish their spicy dishes were spicier. I would definitely recommend and return here."}
{"text":"This place was great! The dumplings are super flavourful and yummy! And the whole area is clean and the wait staff seem very nice and helpful! The kimchi is delicious too!   The dumpling soup was delicious and the dumplings were perfectly cooked. The egg and seaweed were a nice touch to the soup.   My friends for the rice cake and fish cake hot soup. It is spicy, so if you cannot handle spicy, then this one might be a little too much. But it's super yummy as is the side of hot sauce that they provide."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic korean food! Loved it so much!! My picky son finished his pork cutlet in no time. My mom was so happy found the food she used to enjoy in Korea! This will be our another favorite restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Ate here for dinner before my flight back to Winnipeg. My parents and I were in the Square One area, and wanted to eat somewhere close to the airport, and a quick Yelp search brought this interesting place up.  The place wasn't too busy at 6pm, but it quickly filled up as we dined. It's been a while since we dined at a Korean restaurant, so we took a bit of time looking at the menu. At the end, we ordered a seafood soontofu and the sliced brisket BBQ for two. It didn't sound like a lot, but I wasn't really too hungry as I had lunch about 3 hours before.  We noticed a lot of tables ordered the fried chicken as we were waiting for our food, so that's definitely gonna be on our list next time. Regardless, the food that we ordered was really good. The brisket was juicy and had that nice sweetness that I'm accustomed to in Korean BBQ. The soontofu was about what I expected, it's hard to really go wrong with this to be honest.  Service was good, though sometimes you had to manually wave someone down instead of pressing the button, especially the couple of times they were busy due to the place filling up extremely fast.   Definitely will go for the Korean fried chicken next time I dine here."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! We ordered the deep fried dumplings, pork spicy bulgogi and beef sweet bulgogi. The portions were great, good to share for four. The prices were more than reasonable. Our bill came out to only $50 with three bottles of their domestic beer. The service could've have been more up kept. The server could have taken empty plates and bowls whenever she would come to the table to make more room but that's something minor.  The great food and prices definitely made up for it. The restaurant itself isn't the biggest but felt cozy. I would recommend this place and would go back to try their soups."}
{"text":"This cute Korean restaurant is near Chinatown in Mississauga. It wasn't too busy when we went earlier this evening and easily got two seats in a private booth. Service was also nice enough throughout our meal and we had no issues.  There were three appetizers that came out after we ordered: kimchee, sprouts and sweet sauteed onions. I only really liked the kimchee. I wished there were more options but it's free, so I guess I can't complain.  My husband and I got two dishes: the bibimbap and the pork belly and squid rice bowl. Both were $12 but the pork belly and squid rice bowl was the better value. It was more flavourful because of the spices mixed in to the sauce and had a more equal ratio of pork belly and squid to rice.   The bibimbap was disappointing. It lacked flavour (hot sauce made it a bit better), barely had any meat in it, had a small handful of veggies and way too much rice in comparison to the other components of the dish. I wouldn't recommend getting this.   Portions were big enough that we had leftovers to take home but I just wish that the bibimbap wasn't so bland. Maybe this particular dish is just a miss here? I might be open to trying other dishes here if I happen to be in the area again."}
{"text":"This is a new Korean place in Etobicoke that my friends and I have been meaning to try since we saw all the amazing Yelp reviews. I would rate this restaurant in between 4.5-5 stars. It did not disappoint tonight.   When you walk in, there's quite a few tables maybe 9 or 10 tables down the store. The kitchen is right in the middle of the restaurant. When we walked in there was probably about 4 tables occupied. Not surprised since I don't believe Korean food is super popular in that particular area (compared to Christie and Finch).   The service was great. Was greeted by a friendly server and I had a few questions to ask her about their dumplings and popular dishes. She said the steamed dumplings with vegetables was popular along with their homemade noodle soup - kalgooksu. I really enjoyed the beaten egg broth. Had a good amount of flavour when you mix all the spices together in your bowl. We also got an order of the steamed dumplings and they were delicious! Lots of meat and it didn't feel like they cheaped out on the dumpling filling. I even got an order to go since they were so good.   Overall I would come back again. Everyone was friendly, the food was great. Next time I will try their dumpling soup since I find the noodles overwhelming. Go hungry, the portions are good!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Korean food in Mississauga in my opinion.   They don't have the widest selection, but what they make is quite tasty and the value is there.  My only problem with the place is that others have found out and on occasion now we have to wait for a table.  Friendly staff. Owner is very friendly. Place is kid friendly."}
{"text":"This place serves hearty Korean food. I've come here a few times and they never seem to disappoint; they have generous portions that are always flavourful, which is untrue of other places that water down flavours to save on spices. A good portion of the menu is in Korean, but the servers are kind and will happily explain if you ask."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time the food has never failed to disappoint me.   Recently my boyfriend and I came here and we ordered the half & half chicken- half padak (fried chicken with green onion) and half yangnyeom chicken (sweet & spicy chicken), as well as a mandu guk and mak guksu.  The exterior of the chicken was so crispy! And the meat inside tender, not dry at all. The sauce on the yangnyeom chicken was also very tasty. It was a perfect mix of sweet and spicy.   I loved the mak guksu! It went well with the fried chicken. A great cold noodle dish to cut down the greasy goodness of the fried chicken. Would also recommend the mool naengmyeon from here (another cold noodle dish)"}
{"text":"excellent quality Korean restaurant. It's a tiny place but never too busy, and quite possibly the best Korean dumplings I've had to date."}
{"text":"Update:  I thought it was time to update my review, since I've been a few times to this location.  This location is close to Mississauga Chinatown, in a strip mall, WITH parking.  Restaurant itself is also larger.  Parking definitely makes it waaay more accessible and convenient!  Feeling like Korean Fried Chicken (KFC), I had a choice of Sikgaek and another, newer restaurant nearby.  However, after comparing menus, the other restaurant appears to just offer KFC and other snacky type foods.  Whereas Sikgaek's menu has more variation, including the traditional stews.  We ordered the:  Kalgooksoo (noodles in soup dish) and half an order of Padak (KFC with thin green onions on top).  Kalgooksoo was the usual, good, broth is subtle tasting and gets thicker, noodles get less chewy as time goes on.  The half order of Padak was absolutely HUGE, good enough for 3-4ppl, but I don't think they offer anything smaller than half a chicken.  My friend and I agreed that the Padak was well fried, not too greasy, very crispy, with the meat still juicy.  However, the batter itself lacked taste.  No S&P at all.  So, although it was decent, I'd order the Sweet & Sour one, with sauce, instead as I think that there'd be more flavour!  Booths are great and call buttons are soo convenient!  Great escape from the cold weather."}
{"text":"I gotta say the food was awesome! My family was very satisfied! The service was great and they were very accommodating. Thank you so much!   ! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was a new try for us, we dropped in as a family of 5 and ordered a few items from their menu based on some of their recommended items and everything was a hit!  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was wonderful.  I made a reservation for my father's birthday and they were very accommodating to a large group of 14.  We felt very comfortable and welcome.  The food was exceptional.  We tried many of their popular items from the menu.  Sweet and spicy chicken, pork bone soup, kimchi and seafood pancakes were all amazing.  Also tried the Cheese DakGalbi for the first time and everyone really loved it.  Service was super efficient and friendly. Will definitely come back with more friends next time."}
{"text":"This place has some bomb seafood ramen! We visited Toronto for a week and we've came back a couple of times. The service was great and the food was great too! Definitely going to miss this place."}
{"text":"First, the food is just so so, not impressive at all, there are many Korean restaurants better than this in Mississauga. Second, as a server, I think they should know what is separated bills, is not like simply divided by how many people there, is depending on what did the person order. First time and the last time, disappointing."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers, I would have never tried this place if I didn't check the reviews first.  This corner gem gave such a delightful experience. I super love the intimacy this place has to offer, it was great, we had our own separate booth with wall dividers. As per most Korean restaurants with this format there was a bell so no need to worry about waitress not checking up , just ring that bell and someone will come in and check what you need.  Based on the other reviews, I was well tempted to try the Fried Chicken, and boy oh boy was I ever satisfied! The crispiness, the flavors so delish, I order the marinated fried chicken however got the sauce on the side to ensure the chicken would remain crispy. I am going to have to say by far the best Korean fried chicken I have ever tasted. We also order the famous korean dishes, pork bone soup and beef bulgogi. All very satisfying.   I am excited to go back here maybe with for a mothers day lunch or dinner, I know my family would love this place."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service was so fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been there with bf multiple times for late night eats. Never disappointed. The kalguksu (knife cut noodles) in egg drop soup is a favorite. The rice cake egg drop soup, pork belly BBQ, kalbi and fried chicken are also great. Fried chicken is juicy and fresh. It's also fried in a fairly light airy batter which is just right for me. The appetizers are tasty - their kimchi is noticeably spicier than other places I've been to. This may be good news for those who love kimchi with added kick.  Prompt and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Place is small!  Dumpling soup was good.  I asked if it came with noodles and was told yes.  I found out after... it didnt.  I would have ordered it on the side.  But since it was takeout and I didnt realize this until I got home... too late.  Their english is not the best.  For what I got... priced fairly."}
{"text":"Amazing hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurant. The ambiance was nice - we had a little private room for our party of 3. And the food was excellent. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Food was great, really tasty and comforting. We got the bulgogi hot pot, the vegetable pancake and the fried chicken with green onions. The bulgogi hot pot was large enough for 2-3 ppl, the pancake was well cooked and cripsy on the outside, the fried chicken was out of this world! The service was superb. The waitresses were really helpful and nice, they replaced our banchans without us asking. Love the individual rooms, more privacy. 5/5, will go back"}
{"text":"The food is top notch, service excellent, no need to say more, your missing out if you don't try it!"}
{"text":"Cozy interior, sat in a private little booth area. Food was average, not bad but not good either."}
{"text":"We got Kalguksoo (home-made noodle soup) and Half Fried Chicken and Half Green Onion Chicken. The chicken was delicious! Although this place is not your typical chicken and beer pub, they have great chicken. I loved how crispy and tasty their chicken was. The portion was also very generous. The chicken cost $29, and it could feed about 2 to 4 people. Some pieces were boneless.   As for the noodle soup, it was filled with a generous amount of egg and seaweed broth. I would have liked seafood kalguksoo but they don't offer it. Service was friendly. There were movie posters from the 60's, 70's, and 80's on the walls. I also saw many high chairs, so parents can bring their babies here."}
{"text":"Craved some Korean food after the movies so my friends and I opted to go here, since most of us were tired of Owls!   We got here around 10pm and it wasn't too busy - just a couple tables but the atmosphere was really homey! There was plenty of parking spots when I got there, but I can see it getting really busy during lunch rush given that it's located in the Mississauga Chinatown area.   For food, I ordered the pork kim chi stew. At Owls there is an option to add glass noodles in the stew, but at Sikgaek when I asked for the noodles the server actually told me straight up that it's weird LMAO!! But she still got the noodles in my stew for me so no hard feelings! I must say for $11 plus $5 for the noodles, I was disappointed. Portion was small and there was way too much glass noodles that it was absorbing all the stew!! I never had this problem at owls so I never thought to ask for a little bit of glass noodles only ... plus it's only $2 extra to add noodles at owls with a bigger stone pot.. there also was barely any pork. I only had 3-4 strips of meat tops in my bowl. Broth wise was ok, but honestly I prefer owls kim chi stew 10000x over Sikgaeks. I don't think I'll be ordering soups here in the future LOL   The star of the night was definitely the fried chicken!! Holy it was so good I don't even know where to start. We ordered the original fried chicken wth green onions and the spicy marinated one. The original with onions was my favourite, it was perfectly fried - crispy but not oily at all. Also tons of meat! The spicy marinated one is MEH.. it's more sweet than spicy, the kim chi was way spicier but its still good if you're into the sweeter flavours.   Service was really good too. Surprisingly the young servers knew English really well and was engaging and constantly checked up on us. I know that this is expected but there are a lot of places where servers will only take your orders, leave you alone for the rest of the night and is extremely hard to flag down.  I definitely recommend this place for their service and fried chicken I'm already excited to return to get their chicken again LOL"}
{"text":"So i usually come here for their donkatsu, which is good and i enjoy it. But their coleslaw is just not good at all. I don't know if its a Korean thing or just this place, but their slaw dressing is literally just mayo and ketchup....KETCHUP! It doesn't taste good at all. I wish they would change it. Other than that...I just make my own coleslaw or salad at home. So.."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and nice booth seating. I like the atmosphere here and so enjoyed my kbbq dinner here as well. Ordered 2 servings of Pork Belly and was quite enough for 2 people.  Ja Tang Tobokke soup is highly recommend! The pot was full of mixed fish cake and tobokke. The soup is good for a cold day. A great combination of everything. Lovely place for dinner with some 2000s K-pop music. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"To be honest I don't really get the whole mediocre review because I absolutely love this place. Their food so far has not disappointed. Their portions are a lot more bigger than other restaurants and everything is a lot more flavourful!  Their cheese ddakgaelbi compared to other restaurants like the ones found around Yonge and Finch is much more yummy and they don't cheap out on the cheese like many of the restaurants I've been to.  Cold bucket wheat noodles are also yummy too! Their No. 1 is also very yummy! I've been to many restaurants where the dish is usually flavorless. Keep in mind this dish is a very clean, healthy dish so don't expect it to be crazy savoury. Nonetheless the chicken was fall off the bone, smooth, and flavoured well with the broth.   Service is also always very nice :)"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I stumbled upon this place!! Although they do not serve my favourite- Hwe Dup Bap, this gave me the opportunity to explore other Korean dishes.  First of all I loved the way the restaurant looked, with the private rooms and authentic furniture. The servers were all very friendly and always smiling. The menu wasn't as huge as Song Cooks but they had all the Korean staples. I opted for the MaeMil MakGooksoo (cold buckwheat noodles with cabbage, spicy sauce, and a bit of a slushy broth) and my friend got the soft tofu chigae. We then were immediately served the bachans, which were 3 dishes consisting of kimchi, beansprouts and pickled onions. When we asked for more we were given even larger portions of the bachans.  After eating my noodles I determined that I have  found another favourite Korean dish! This meal was incredible and extremely filling. the broth took in all the flavours of the hot sauce and pickled vegetables. My friend enjoyed the chigae too, which came piping hot with a side of rice.  Service was exceptional and food was fresh and delicious. Sikgaek will now be a regular choice for me!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna start off by saying that it was... a nice experience.  We went on a weekday around lunchtime, and we were their first customers.  It was calm and quiet, and we had own booth.  Parking was kind of tight, but that would be the only major con for me.  We ordered the fried chicken, which was crispy and tasty, as the pictures show.  I also wanted to try something different, but decided to opt for a classic bowl of bulgogi.  It was loaded with onions, but they could be easily picked apart.  The meal wasn't stellar or out of this world, but there's nothing to dislike about it, either.  My friend ordered the bibimbap...he said it was \"not bad\".  Not my favourite set of appetizers, but glad it came with the meal (kimchi's a little spicier than I'm used to...no miso soup side).  Overall, it hasn't really merited a go-to Korean restaurant status from me yet, but I don't mind paying another visit to try out other items as they seem to have a lot. I gave it a 4, but it's really a 3.75 in my book."}
{"text":"This little place is a hidden gem! Found this place on Yelp and ordered a pork bond soup. The broth was nice and dense, spicy enough for my taste. The portion is good, more than enough for a party of three. Customer service was exceptional, our waitress took time to explain the menu and had a smile on her face the whole time. Made our experience that much better. Will be coming back soon, can't wait to try their fried chicken! She happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"One of favourite Korean food joint for me now.  Price is decent for the quality and value of food serving.  Staff is friendly and foods come out fast, plus they open til 2am!  My bf usually doesn't like kimchi but he likes it there. Will definitely recommend it!  HOWEVER, I just had to change my rating 5 stars to 3 because I was try calling them to make reservation to take family birthday dinner (because we have group of 8) and a girl on the phone didn't want to take it.  Called at 6:45p reservation for 7:30p and she claimed they don't take because they're closing at 9pm on Sunday.  I asked if they were busy (if so that would be more understandable) but she said no.   I guess they just wanted to close and go home early.....   shame for losing our biz of the day cuz we would've spent so much..."}
{"text":"The menu here features a lot of dishes that  haven't seen at other Korean places. Maybe they're more traditional Korean? They also serve fried chicken though, and the fried chicken here is amazing! Both the original fried chicken and the green onion version were fantastic although very similar. Next time, I would get the green onion and spicy version to try more contrasting flavours. We also got the kalgooksu, which was very well made but just wasn't my thing. My preference is for more mainstream Korean food like bibimbap I guess. The dish was huge though and probably shareable with two people. This place is definitely one of the top 3 Korean restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times. Love their Korean ramen with shrimp and the homemade buckwheat noodle soup, kalguksu (may be wrongly spelled!). Decent quantity, great price, exemplary quality and taste with friendly service...what's not to love! Always eat here, take out makes the noodles a bit soggy...still tasty...just a wee bit soggy! One star taken away as the broth is not vegetarian. Used to be a deal-breaker for me...but now I eat fish, so it's all good."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?  The Korean fried chicken!! Even the breast meat tastes good. Batter wasn't too thick and there was a crunch to the chicken. I suggest the saucy one may be the better option because the dry rub doesn't have that much taste to it. What you can do is also ask to have the sauce on the side if you want to control how much sauce you want on your chicken! We had the spicy sauce but it wasn't that hot at all. It was tasty though!! For those of you who want spicy, you might not think it's spicy at all so you may ask them to really crank up the spice factor. Pieces are chicken are huge though!!!!  We ordered other things too like spicy bulgogi in a stone pot which was delicious as well. The pork bone soup was kind of sour with the Kim chi cabbage that they added but it still tasted alright. The perilla seeds are crushed and sprinkled on top of the pork bone soup.   LAST TIP?!  An order of chicken will really fill you up. It's pure meat right?! If you want to order more, I suggest ordering a soup because eating too much fried food tends to make one thirsty!! You can order a whole or half chicken and they come in a big pot!!"}
{"text":"This evening we had beef bulgogi and chicken thigh BBQ. The food is really good but unfortunately the service is kinda lost. They have a bell if you need to call the waiter , but seem they not coming unless you flag them.  We ask more for kimchi, the server took the kimchi plate but he never come back for our extra kimchi. I think if you want your customers happy, make sure that you remember what they order."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was amazing!!! we ordered the combo of 2 sets of chicken but was way more than expected lol. The hotpot was the BOMB! loved the dumplings inside and the noodles :) Will definitely bring my fam jam next time. Great place to warm up with some nice hot spicy hot pot and crispy fried chicken!  Service was excellent and very attentive as well."}
{"text":"Not what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised with what I got!  The glass noodles and Korean style fried chicken were my absolute favourite things, and the seating arrangements were really different and cool; we had our own private booth.  This place is a definite do again :) .  I recommend Sikgaek to anyone who would like a little bit of a different experience in atmosphere, and explore new and delicious flavours!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Friendly helpful staff.   Seating was quick Sunday at 4pm.  Enjoyed having a private booth equipped with cooking top built into table and buzzer for service.  They have quite a few private rooms for seating up to 6.  Restaurant was clean.   Parking full in front. Lucky they have added parking in back area.   Enjoyed dinner with traditional seafood pancake ( was crisp) the way I like it.  Ttokgook red noodle soup served with fish cake and sweet potato noodle.  Very nice combo as I'm used to only eating the red noodles in sauce alone.   Also tried their ginseng chicken soup ($19).  Was a nice change."}
{"text":"So this time me and my boyfriend tried this Korean place. He was there before with his friend. We got private room, the staff was very nice and friendly.   We ordered a squid and a hot pot with pork bones, kimchi, potatoes."}
