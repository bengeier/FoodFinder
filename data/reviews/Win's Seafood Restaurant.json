{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch/afternoon tea only ever since the sushi buffet here closed down. They haven't renovated at all as you can tell from the very Japanese decor and the sushi bar at the front).

Food: Not bad at all. I am a big fan of the fish ball noodle soup. The soup is rich and absolutely delicious. The fish balls are also a decent size and very chewy or as they say in Chinese, ??.

Service: Absolutely disgusting. I could already tell it was going to be bad when I walked in and saw all the grumpy looks on the waitresses. Its as if their faces had a sign that read \"I hate this place. I hate this job. I hate everyone\".  When we asked one of them about a missing order, she told us she would \"check\" but then never came back. We then tried asking another lady and she simply told us it was \"on its way\". Our table eventually gave up waiting, paid and left. 

I don't even know why I came here a second time - probably because the fish balls were just so good. Get it for takeout or something and eat it right away."}
{"text":"Thanks to the new management team taking over this restaurant this month. I am glad to see everything is much better than last time I came (two years ago). Manager Tammy and Jack are very friendly and I also can see the smiling face from the staff too which it makes a lot difference in overall atmosphere and service. The $338 menu with abalone, giant crab in creamy rum sauce, 5lbs lobster fried with spices and dried garlic, double fish, crispy fried chicken, assorted vegetables, fried rice and noodles! The menu is just over value! Thanks again for the enjoyable evening for me and my family."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the low rating, as this is a lunch time favorite when I'm in the area. Packed even at 2pm.

Really tasty and reasonably price lunch specials from 11-4 daily. We ordered the curry chicken with potato and rice, and the duck and winter melon soup with rice, both come with drinks. Feels like authentic Chinese, quality home cooking. Good value lunch meal for 2 under $20. Would definitely come here again. Some menu items are not translated in English, but staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Living in the area for 13 years now and never tried this resto until last night (not sure how long it's been around). 

This is a no-frills good ol' Cantonese style restaurant - my kind of restaurant.  No coloured table cloths, no gold embossed dishes, no trendy styled uniforms with little bows on the waiters & waitresses, no outrageous set menu prices - just good food, decent prices and friendly staff.

Our family of 7 went on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and the restaurant was about 3/4 full but we were seated promptly without a reservation - by the time we left around 7:45 there were a few families waiting.  The restaurant has a traditional Cantonese menu as well as a \"Make Your Own Set Menu\".  They also have seafood & house specials that they advertise on a white board on the wall.  This evening we opted to choose from the build your set menu - the menu has about 2 dozen dishes with lots of variety: chicken, beef, pork, veggies - something for everyone.  We chose Sweet & Sour Pork - the pork had an excellent batter which tasted a little like the KFC chicken & along with the usual pineapples & peppers it also had pickled garlic which I've never had in this dish before; Eight Treasure Tofu Stir Fry - the eight treasures include chicken & beef slices, squid, BBQ pork slices, some veggies & of course tofu; and Sweet & Sour Battered Fish - this one just on the \"meh\" side.  The 3 choices were $27 which is a pretty good deal in this area.  We also added a Shrimp & Scallop Stir Fry With Veggies & Prince Mushroom ($22).  With rice, the total including tax & tip came to $70.

This restaurant also offers complimentary soup and a choice of complimentary Chinese dessert."}
{"text":"Located off 16th Ave on the southside, just west of Warden, I consider Win to be a best place for lunch during weekdays. Various specials are available form $4.99 to $6.99 ranging from Curry Chicken Rice, Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice, Fish Ball Noodle Soup and Hainan Chicken Rice. The special comes with HK tea as well.. Curry chicken is fragrant as they use curry leaves.  Fried rice taste wonderful with the salted fish aroma and is not oily.  Hainan Chicken rice is ok, not as good as Phoenix, though. 

Make sure you get here before noon as the place gets filled up very quickly. Service is alright. Trick is to make sure you know what you want and order as soon as Chinese tea is served.  Unless you want to wait forever for change, make sure you leave sufficient amount! You can pretty much get in and out within 30-40 minutes!"}
{"text":"It is a cash only place! Customer service is good especially because the owners are on the floor serving, taking orders, and giving receipts themselves too. They are very friendly. The food is fresh and hot, and there are many options. I've been here for dinner, and gotten the sets and it was plentiful, and delicious. Today I went for afternoon tea and got the eggplant e mein noodles, fish slices and thousand year egg noodle soup, and lo mein beef brisket. We also added a plate of fried fish skin, so delicious and crispy!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice.  If I was not recommended by my friend in Mississauga, I do not know that the Japanese restaurant has turned into a Chinese restaurant.  When I go into the restaurant, the layout is exactly the same.  There are a lot more stickers on the wall with the names of all the dishes.  After browsing a while, not much special that I see, so I order hot pot chicken rice and a vege dish.  The hot pot chicken rice is not really cooked in the ceramic pot.  It seems that the rice is cooked first and then poured back into the pot to be slightly cooked.  When I finished the dinner, they offered us the dessert.  We picked the cashew soup dessert and the squash soup dessert.  They are by surprise very good and are better than the dessert shops.  We are told that the nuts are grinded for the dessert and they do not use ready made powder.

The second time we met with my friends.  The host ordered wine sauce hot pot crab, fried garlic lobster, fried mushroom, curry chicken.  They are very tasty.  The experience is very much different than the first time we visited.  There may be some specialties that the cook is famous for.  All of these dishes are very good except that they are a bit oily for me.  I notice that there are certificates of the cook in the entrance and I recognize that he is the cook with the other Chinese restaurant used to be on the 2nd floor of the Sheraton Parkway mall.

The 2 visits are very different.  Most likely there are good food there but have to know what to order."}
{"text":"Awful experience, terrible service, dirty, bad food and English speaking folks apparantly not welcome. I wonder why they bother having their outside sign in English. Before you judge, I lived in York region for almost 50 years and I eat Chines twice a week on average. With all fairness this was a takeout for me and I saw more appealing fish plates while I was waiting.  Ordered some sort of seafood soup which I threw away most of it. Luckily they gave me some hot chille sauce since i ask for a spicy seafood soup. I spiced it up to kill any other taste since it was a Sunday evening and I was tired and hungry after my tennis match. I have attached the picture of my food. 

Let me explain the experience. On entrance I had dirty crab water tanks on the left and in front of me on the floor a dozen of dirty plastic buckets piled up!!! All over the walls there were writings in Chinese and not a single English sign. I assume they were specials because I could read the numbers 15 all over. To the right of entrance a wooden stand with a pile of menu. Digging way below I snatched a virgin English menu beautifully presented. Before I had a chance a lady rushed to me asking \"what you want\". One seafood soup was available as their special was sold out. I asked what was in it and she replied shrimp and some kind fish. I am not a picky eater so that was good enough for me. 

The soup looked like the regular Chinese egg-drop soup with traces of what appeared to be chopped shrimp and some kind of I assume sea creature meat. Still good enough for me even though it looked like something you find on the airplane in the emergency paper bag.

If you want good Chinese food there's plenty in Markham. The new one called \"Gold Mark\" on Woodbine and Esna Park has a real chef and they treat you like a customer they want back!"}
{"text":"Don't come to Win's Seafood Restaurant expecting fancy food.  Otherwise, their quick service and cheap prices will surprise you.

Win's is at a remote plaza that you'd likely drive by without even noticing.  The decor is dated, remnant of the previous restaurant (used to be an ayce japanese place).  There's supposed to be some kind of waterfall display at the front which is now abandoned, probably due to cost of maintenance.  The restaurant is hardly ever full, so you will have no problem finding a table here.

The menu has standard chinese dishes - nothing too fancy or complicated.  It does include peking duck but as previous reviews say,  Win's isn't the place for it.  The dishes come out quick and is pretty decent.  Service is lacking, as expected in any chinese restaurant, but especially because the restaurant is so big and there are so few staff.

Rather than having just your standard red bean dessert, Win's often has several kinds of desserts for you to choose from - rare for chinese restaurants.  Overall, good neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Would have been 3 stars but the service of this one Asian lady with glasses was so rude it honestly ruined my whole meal and experience there.

The food was decent but a bit salty. Presentation or food is okay too. Service from other servers were okay.

The bad service experience:
Had their combo deal for 6 people. So each dish should naturally be made for 6 portions. At the end of my meal we asked the lady for dessert. Our 6th person didn't come but we have been saving his portions for him to go. The lady told us we can't have our 6th dessert because we only have people dining. I told her that her deal was basically called \"meal for six\" and I'm paying for this meal so why am I not allowed my 6th dessert. She rudely says \"because you can't; because you only have 5 people here\". I responded, \"I'm paying full price for 6. I am suppose to get my 6th dessert\". If I didn't raise my voice i think she would have continued arguing with me. At the end, after our dessert we paid and slowly getting ready to go. She brings the next group of guests, stands by our table and loudly says to them, \"these people are done eating. They already had their dessert, this table will be yours when they leave.\" Excuse me. Are you directly rushing me out to seat your next table? That's rude. 
On two other incidences, she tossed the bill at us and said we sat too long and that other people are waiting for my table. 

Honestly, if it wasn't for her service, this place is okay."}
{"text":"- we orders the eels in a pot for $22, we plow through the entire pot filled with Veges with only 5 thinly sliced eels. Most places Give you half the eel for that price. This is probably less than 1/3 of the eel. Felt ripped off
- waitress was rude while taking the order 
- the E-FU noodles is a common dish for Asians and was done poorly because it wasn't dry enough, which is a basic standard for this dish
- however they did offer a good variety of complimentary desserts, which I normally don't find in most places including herbal essence jelly, tofu flower, black sesame paste, almond paste and walnut paste 
- prices wasn't too bad, $90 for a table of 5 with tax and tips in"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here today, had the worst service and experience ever leaving me to never want to come back. 

I came here with my family for there lunch special curry chicken and fish ball pork bone soup with drinks that came with it. 

So our food came shortly after we placed the order, but our drinks omg.... Took 25mins to come.. Just to bring us lemon tea,milk tea, coffee. What aggravated me was I already asked a waiter to bring me the drinks he said OK. Then 15 minutes later I had to ask a rude lady to bring me drinks.. I called her over while she was walking towards a table but she completely ignored me and rudely replied in Chinese  she was busy while giving me the dirtiest look ever. 

 What the HELLL.....  This is the second time I have been mistreated at this restaurant, just the first time I let it go since maybe it was a bad day.. But this time, I doubt it.

So, later I was already disappointed that the hospitality and service was so rude that made me come to the conclusion to  not give them much tips. 

So we paid and they disrespectfully asked for tips in a manner I have never seen before holding us back, not letting us leave untill we told them they didn't deserve that much tips. They treated us like crap, saying how we didn't give them enough tips and how if we don't like their service we don't need to come back.


Thanks for giving me the worst experience in the world, wasting my money and time. 

Also, I would recommend if anyone comes here to eat, don't ask for much because they are not going to treat you well.

Believe it or not I have never built so much hate for a restaurant till today. If they are not bad I wouldn't bother ranting and blowing off steam on yelp."}
{"text":"There are a few unique dishes offered such as the infamous fish ball noodle soup that has been mentioned multiple times already by other reviewers. 

Another unique dish is the sticky rice stuffed chicken. This dish is quite heavy but was something I've never seen in other places before.  Ps. You need to order this at least a day in advance I believe.

The portions are quite decent considering the price points. The place does get quite packed on certain nights so don't be surprised if you have to wait to get a table. 

There are several types of desserts offered every night and they go on rotation daily !

Be patient as the service can make your meal discouraging."}
{"text":"The service. Is terrible. It wasnt even busy today. 
We ordered drinks and waited for 15mins still havent came
The lady who arrived and. Ordered later than us,  her drink came before us because she knew the staffs here.
And the server (a lady whos wearing glasses and has white hair and a bun),  when i called her and was speaking to her,    she just looked at me and then ignored me and walked away when i was. Still talking . Very rude. Food is average too,  not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant literally down the street from my house, so the convenience factor is definitely a plus. The food is decent, but not usually my first choice to come here. 

Best deal is the lunch menu. Unfortunately it's written in Chinese only (at the top right hand corner of the menus), so you'd need a Chinese reader with you. Lunch menu usually includes Curry Chicken with Rice, Hainanese Chicken Rice, and Fish Ball Noodle Soup. Each one of these three are decent, ranging between $5.99-7.99. Nothing jumps out as amazing, but a nice inexpensive lunch that comes with a beverage. 

Service is hit and miss depending on the time you go. Not the nicest servers, but they do get the job done. Unfortunately, today we sat in the corner of the restaurant, and were basically ignored (as the servers never looked our way). I essentially had to yell in the restaurant just to get a server's attention to come our way. However, if you sit almost anywhere else in the restaurant, you will easily be noticed.

Overall an average place that is relatively quick, with decent food. Not the best place, but it is one of the alternatives in this area."}
{"text":"Recent change in owner? Food is overpriced and mainly has set dinners. We had dinner there last night and found that the ingredients were not very fresh. Husband and I both had unpleasant stomach ache shortly after our meal."}
{"text":"The fish ball rice noodle soup was a really big bowl.  Previously to the restaurant editing their prices, this meal used to be only $4.99!  After a while, they changed it to $5.99, and then soon after, to $6.99.  Most impressive was how there were actually six fish balls within the bowl of rice noodles -- they were so generous!  I really liked the light and subtle taste of the fish in the soup; it was authentic fish soup (made with fish)!  I thought that it was a very decent lunch and meal."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this place to be extremely average, ND service to be so Chinese. 

We were utterly disappointed with the Peking Duck. It was more like a dated bbq duck in its place. I'd definitely avoid as it's not going to make your meal eventful. 

The fish lacked flavour; however, the fish wasn't fishy and was cooked just right. Too bad the sauce was weak and didn't elevate the dish. 

The rest of the dishes were okay, but the service was atrocious. We had to ask for drinks 5 times and finally gave up. True Chinese restaurant service to a \"T.\""}
{"text":"Been visiting this restaurant for years now, and since its located close to one of our friends, we order take-out often whenever we go over to watch games.

Service is super quick, they are usually pleasant, especially nice if you are a regular. Sometimes there can be lines out the door, so try calling to book reservations on friday/saturday dinner hours.

The flavours and unique dishes offered here are why they get 5 stars. The price also is a bonus, every dish is cheaper than comparable cantonese restaurants. My favourite unique dish here: Pure egg white with scallops in gravy. Order this. You won't be disappointed (even if it looks like just soup arrived after they bring it out)."}
{"text":"THERE SHOULD BE A ZERO RATING AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE!!!  FIRE THESE WAITRESSES NOW!!!  when you go to chinese restaurants especially for lunch specials, you cannot expect exemplary service.  however, hawker centres have better customer service than this DUMP!  the waitresses were rude, snappy, scolding, slow and actually were telling customers off.  we thought it was only the one with the eyeglasses but another one later was just as off putting and unpleasant.  

the food itself was fine with lunch specials from $5 to $8.  nothing particularly special.  you can get these dishes in any cantonese style restaurant.  the fishball noodle is unique and flavourful enough with some deep fried fish skin on the side.  

dining out should not be stressful and there are plenty of other cantonese restaurants with similar food and prices but with decent service.   with the HORRENDOUS, UNACCEPTABLE service, this dump disguised as a fine dining seafood restaurant is NOT worth a second chance."}
{"text":"Perhaps the owners got drunk on their own success. The ingredients used to make the fish balls have clearly changed for the worse. The fish balls lost its bounciness and worst of all it did not taste fresh. At all. Service has also taken a dive. We were asked to tip more because we didnt have extra change and were short one quarter from 15%. As formerly regular cuatomers we were shocked. I have not gone back since a year ago and strongly discourage anyone else from doing so"}
{"text":"This is a nice hidden gem in Markham for gourmet Chinese food. I know from the day time meals and decor it looks like your everyday Chinese restaurant, but it's actually pretty nice! I came here on a referral from an uncle and i was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the food and freshness of each ingredient is evident. We had lobster, whole sea bass, abalone, free range chicken (your typical banquet style dinner), at this joint and really enjoyed it! I have to say the food speaks for itself here as you can't expect much service from Chinese restaurants. Sometimes you get a waiter/waitress who's funny and wants to crack a few jokes, other times you get a group that openly talks about your table in the corner. Try out the fancy dinner here and I'm sure you'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The last item on the menu is the Noodle soup with meat and seafood, and it was just what I needed for a too-late-for-dinner dinner. A nice soup before heading home after a long day would do the trick. 

The waitress looked at me quizzically as she asked, \"do you know this is a very big soup?\" \"Perfect!\" I replied. She laughed!  Then I found out why. Served in a tureen the size of a paddling pool, this is the size that normally serves the soup course for a table of 8! In other word, you can squeeze nearly 12 small bowls out of this one cauldron. 

I got to work. I was expecting the standard thin egg noodles in a clear broth with an assortment of protein on top. But this was a thick, robust broth with thicker noodles that tasted homemade. Most of the seafood appeared to be puréed into the soup, except for chunks of real crab meat-not the artificial Pollock based \"crab stick\".

After 8 bowls, I gave in and took the rest home. I'm not sure it will keep, or if the noodles will simply turn to mush. But I had to save face. 

This was a delicious soup. For $15, it is pricey since you can't really see any seafood or meat except for the bits of crab. This would be fine for a table of diners, but is equivalent to two $7 bowls of noodle soup at other places. If whole pieces of seafood and meat were on top of the noodles, I would have hit 5 stars for this one without question. 

I will be back to try the other, more modest sized dishes."}
{"text":"This place is much better than it appears from the outside. Gotta always look out when it comes to Chinese restaurants.

What I like:
- The food is decent, they got a good selection of good seafood
- The portions are quite large
- The food is tasty
- They have four different kinds of dessert: sesame, almond, grass jelly and something else

What could be improved:
- Food was a bit salty

What is just what it is:
- The prices aren't cheap for dinner, but they aren't too pricey either - perhaps with exception of the $38/lb fish that I have no idea if it's cheap/expensive but for a fish it just sounds expensive
- The place isn't gorgeous, but that does not bother me
- The menus appear to be all in Chinese, especially the specials

I think I gotta come back for this $4.99 lunch special. Plus they have a 10% tip option on the credit card machine."}
{"text":"I can sum up this restaurant in one thought... If you were to give this restaurant a score from 1-10 on the amount of salt they put in food they'd probably be an 11.  Seriously... does anyone taste these at all before serving them?

I've been here at dinner and and lunch and can pretty much say I won't ever come back.

Starting with the dinner, we started out with a steamed chicken with chives all over it, not really sure what it was called.  The chicken might as well have died in the dead sea... it was that salty, I don't know how anyone could have eaten this.  Daily intake of sodium would probably be somewhere around 800%.

The peking duck came next.  Now, I kinda have a problem with people not actually cutting the duck in front of you.  One, you'd be surprised how many times a restaurant will \"sneak\" pieces from the dish to use somewhere else.  And two, it's always helpful to see the duck before it's in pieces... I mean, It could have been mangled for all we know it.

Cool thing about the peking duck was that they gave us lots of wraps for it.  Bad thing was that the duck was probably a 9 on the salt scale...  We knew this because we had the duck chopped straight out after they cut the skin off of it.  Another thing about the peking duck that it's not supposed to have a lot of meat on it.  The peking duck here had about 1cm of meat on all the pieces... THICK!  Gah, whatever...

One good thing I actually had was the vermicelli noodles with chicken slices.  This was actually not bad; not amazing, but not bad. 

One neat thing about the dinner however is that you're given a choice of what dessert you would like.  I personally chose the black sesame dessert, which was really good actually.  One thing that I noticed is that they grind the sesame from scratch (and not make it out of a powder).

Now for lunch, it's a whole new ball game...  The congee here is actually not bad as well.  One thing they do is make a congee base for the two different varieties they have; but that's not the good part.  The good part is that it's actually really soggy rice.  So if anyone has had northern china congee, it's kinda like that.  Imagine rice soup, rather than rice porridge.

As for the chicken at lunch... same story.  They seem to really like making chicken that tastes of the dead sea.  Oh, and a side note... this place doesn't accept anything but cash at lunch... sketch... revenue canada... note...

Seriously... they need to taste their food once or twice before they serve it.  It doesn't take a supreme chef to notice something's a miss.  Either that or for some reason the head chef has lost all taste in the salt receptors on his tongue.  I guess that's kinda like a musician that is deaf... wait... wasn't mozart deaf?  Ya... this place isn't mozart."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably price and the quality of the food is A-OK. 

It's the only chinese restaurant in the plaza so it can get busy on weekend evenings. We've ordered the fried oysters, fish, stone pot rice, veggies; all were delicious.

We mainly come here because at the end of the dinner, there's a variety of desserts to choose from. Red bean, black sesame, almond bowls. They used to be good, but I find lately the desserts have been watered down. It could depend on the timing you get to the dessert though."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family. Ordered a four person meal that waitress recommended which included lobster, fish, oysters and a vegetable dish. She guaranteed that the lobster was at least 2 pounds. When the lobster came, it was obviously not 2 pounds and it was cooked the wrong way. We ordered for it to be dry, similar to it being fried, but it was glazed. The same waitress took it back. When she brought a \"new dish\" of lobster, it was the same lobster but with fried garlic stir fried really quickly. Not satisfied at all. The fish was not fresh as some parts of the meat wasn't cooked well enough and some parts cooked too well becoming rough. I would not come again."}
{"text":"Not good to the extent that I feel obligated to revise the rating.

We came for dinner and ordered a dinner combo for 4 ($40 before tax).  Services was okay, but the food was not.  The menu said the steamed fish entrée used a live fish.  It was most definitely made from a fresh but dead fish.  I was okay with this one-step decline in quality, because this combo only costed $40.  I think they should revise the menu description though.  The jelly fish tasted like \"overnight\".  The worst was that the meat of the sweet and sour pork had gone bad.  It had a soured taste that was not from the sauce.  The only entrée that was good was the vegetable with mushrooms.  I understood the weather was so hot that it was a challenge to keep meat fresh.  Yet it was not healthy to serve meat that had gone bad.

They served free desserts.  There were 5 choices: tortoise jelly, almond sweet soup, black sesame sweet soup, sweet tofu and one that I cannot recall.  This offering was new.  It reminded me of now defunct Fung Lam Court on Kennedy Road.  I also saw the manager of FLC working here this evening.  Could there be a change of management?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after craving fish ball noodles. I can't say I was super satisfied - fish balls weren't bouncy enough for me and the fish soup was about weak - the taste of the noodles and soup lacked salt and didn't taste flavourful enough for me. However, this is coming from someone who loves fish. Stronger fish taste is definitely not for everyone! I think this is a pretty good bowl, it just wasn't for me, hence 3.5 stars (rounded up). I think they must've improved the service cause I thought it was alright (nothing stood out for me contrary to the reviews I read). Also price was good - the fish ball noodles came with fried fish skin and a drink for $7.5!"}
{"text":"My 100th REVIEW!!! Hmm.. maybe I should of reviewed somewhere else besides this place... lol... 

It's a bit sad to see this place only have 2.5 stars. Came here for lunch and dinner. Their lunch specials are pretty good. It's very cheap. Usually I get the curry chicken with rice. It's not the greatest quality but its a good decent size and cheap. I sometimes get the singapore fried noodles which is also very tasty. The portions are very good I find. The size is above average compared to some places. 

Came here for dinner as well and the food isn't bad either. Again, there are other places that  serve up similar dishes as this place but taste better but the food here is still pretty good. I guess i am more biased since I live nearby and it's the closest and cheapest thing to grab to eat and again it's really cheap. 

-Good & cheap lunch specials 
- Convenient location with plenty of parking 
- Food is not as bad as some people say
- Service is just average, a bit lacking but it is what it is for this kinda place."}

Lobster
Beef with mushrooms and cashews
Sticky rice with Chinese sausage
Crispy chicken
E fu noodle
Dessert selection - I appreciated the almond soup


Meh
Seafood soup
Sweet and sour pork. Did they overdo the cornstarch? This was bland
Peking duck
Abalone - pass

There were a couple of other dishes, but I did not try them so no comment."}
{"text":"We have a \"win\"ner...for the best value for lunch specials. Of course, you can't go wrong with the fish ball with shark bone noodle soup, which is their specialty.

Oh, in terms of that? Not bad at all! The fish balls were definitely homemade and some of the best I've had. The shark bone soup probably could've done with a bit more flavour, as it didn't really taste much different from your normal chicken soup. The noodles were standard.

I also liked how the noodle soup came with fried fish skin, though the problem was it wasn't mentioned in the menu. We ordered a second fried fish skin batch without realizing our order initially came with it! Better communication there, folks.

Service was blah at best, but that's typical of Chinese restaurants. I'll come back for the fish ball noodle soup, but not sure if any other food there is worth trying out."}
{"text":"Rudest people on the planet are all here everybody!


Bad food, bad employees, bad decor..  With flies and dirty utensils."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 4 years now. In general, it's pretty decent food for a decent price. I'm not upset at the quality or value when I come here so I keep coming back.

I was a bit shocked when I saw that this place has 2 stars. It seems like most people agree that the food is decent but the service is where it is lacking. It could be because I come here quite often, the servers recognize my face so they are alright. By no means would I say service is spectacular here but to be very honest, it's about average for a Chinese restaurant.

The washroom definitely could use some cleaning lol. It's always a mess - a surprise everything on what is left on the floor or how big the puddle of water is. But these little oddly make me smile that it's the same place I've been going to for so long."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this restaurant exist!  The sign on the advertisement billboard ( I guess that is what you call that ship name post) is small.  The restaurant sign is hidden by the trees as you are driving from the West to East.  If I'm not actively looking for this place, it would total gone unnoticed.
Starting from its menu, it does have a few of its own specialty dish, which is seen less frequently.  In fact the menu looks like the restaurant that used to be at Gorvette Rd and Kennedy in the plaza with CIBC, bankrupted a year or 2 back.  Wonder if it is the same operation.
Service... It is the same standard small Chinese restaurants operation model, plates and chopsticks tossed on your table.
Now to the real important thing, the food... The good, you can ask the chef to cut the msg.  For our meal, they did cut it out.  The stir fry dishes are OK, actually everything is just OK.  Nothing special, and nothing especially bad either... Just OK.
All in all, 3 stars for being mediocre.  May give it another shot in the future to be fair."}

This time round Win's Seafood Restaurant did a good job and I know I will be back again.

Homemade Fish Ball in Shark Bone Noodle Soup/Crispy Fish Skin and Hong Kong Style Milk Tea .. all these for $4.99!!!!! Those are all the things I love.. Rice Noodle and Fish Balls!! And of course the price too. 

The waitstaff were really nice too... 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"What to try?

Their lobster, abalone and eel are good choices. I had their abalone 6 head they call it and it's $25 per person for that dish. Everyone gets their own abalone of course! I would say their food is good for the most part. I also liked their A-green vegetable with XO sauce with calamari. Very tasty!! At the end they also have 5 different desserts for you to choose from. Not your typical red bean soup. You get to try turtles shell jelly, almond soup, black sesame or green bean soup. Not too shabby eh? On a Friday, you don't have to make reservations per se because it's not that busy. It's located in an area where it's off the main streets so unless you hear about this restaurant through ad or word of mouth, you would not have noticed this restaurant. It's like a hidden gem! The only disappointment is the staff wasn't too friendly to the customers. I overheard an argument the waitress had with the customers and it wasn't pleasant. Even if it is the customers' fault, it's not professional to let others hear the argument and unless you don't want customers coming back, it's not a good idea to tell your customers off too :/ 

Last tip?

They have free wifi and they have private dining rooms so if you want a private gathering or want a meeting room for your dinner meetings, this restaurant might be a great choice."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have had different experiences. 

The first time was on a weekday for dinner and we ordered the combo dinner for 4 with the chicken and lobster with Maggi sauce. The lobster was made perfectly. The waitresses were a bit off-putting but were attentive.

The second time was a disaster. The place was fully packed and we were not treated well. There was a conflict with which table should have the \"VIP\" room and the waitresses were rude about it. We ordered the same combo but with extra custom dishes and it was like a completely different restaurant from the first time. Lobster was laughably bad. The hot pot lamb stew tasted like it was washed up with water. 

The third time was on a weekday for dinner again. The lobster was almost as perfect as the first time. We ordered the oyster instead of the chicken that normally came with the combo and it was a wise choice. Service was decent again. Their desserts were good as well.

Just be careful of inconsistencies of quality and service."}
