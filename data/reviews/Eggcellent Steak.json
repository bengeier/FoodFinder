{"text":"Service was ok.  The food was ok.  The venue needs a steam cleaning.  Could be a decent venue but needs updating and cleaning."}
{"text":"Are there a while back.  A drunk at the bar screamed profanities while my children ate dinner.  The manager eventually kicked him out but doesn't make sense to have a bar at a family restaurant.  The place needs a deep clean and cosmetic repair.  Food was meh at best.  Honestly don't see the place making it another 6 months.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in about an hour before closing on a Friday. No one else was there. He ordered a steak, I ordered chicken stir fry. He said the steak was good but the mashed potatoes looked like left over home fries mashed up with milk thrown in it. My stir fry was awful! Totally covered with soy sauce. Could hardly eat it. The vegetables were hardly recognizable. Very dried out looking. The salad was good, though, but the dressing was already on it, not on the side. The waitress was sweet, but didn't have the heart to complain."}
