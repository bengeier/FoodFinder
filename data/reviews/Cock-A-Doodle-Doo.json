{"text":"Everything here is not only beautiful to look at, but it's delicious as well! When I first found this place I couldn't believe that the entire shop was gluten free. Plus they have lots of vegan options as well so it's such a great place to bring friends with any dietary restrictions. The vegan sourdough is a staple in my pantry and I can't help but try a new pastry every time I go in- it all just looks so good! This place is such a gem. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally! A gf bakery in Bloorcourt! I've really been enjoying the offerings here since the shop opened. In particular, the one savoury option, the mushroom tart (or sometimes, a mushroom pizza) is delicious and creamy without any dairy at all.  I really appreciate the owners' dedication to making delicious gf baked goods that don't use xanthan or similar products. I do wish they had a larger variety of savoury baked goods, and perhaps a few more 'traditional' sweet options, like a solid chocolate chip cookie.

 Overall, a great addition to the neighbourhood, and a wonderful place to grab a gf snack."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! Cutest place ever. We happened upon it by accident and fell in love. I got an olive oil focaccia bread and a lough on rye-inspired bread - BOTH DELICIOUS, light fluffy amazing. 

Everything gluten free, loads vegan. Mushroom tart, cupcakes, pizza, bread, and MORE."}
{"text":"Best gluten vegan free desserts. Tried the lemon and apple cake, it was delicious. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but when I went to buy Birthday dessert for one, I didn't feel I was missing any butter or dairy, sacrificing texture, taste or mouth feel when eating their chocolate coconut cupcakes or flaky pear tart! That definitely wasn't the case when I purchased vegan desserts at another top rated vegan bake shop. I'm glad I found this place doing an online search. They're a gluten free bakery & pastry shop with vegan options, and they use unrefined sweeteners in a very refined way. You just don't taste a touch of sweetness, but also a touch of salt and other flavourings. Their creations are also beautiful and the service is wonderful. I'm a return customer not just to accommodate my vegan guest, but to indulge in my own sweet tooth for European style country pastries."}
{"text":"Tried the gluten-free muffins and they were nothing short of AMAZING! I would've liked to have taken a picture for the review but I demolished them in minutes! Can't wait to try their other baked goods, which are all gluten and soy-free."}
{"text":"I tried their sourdough bread, chocolate chip cookie and the pear flaky pie. The pie was really tasty, not too sweet and flaky as promised. The sourdough bread tasted exactly like a regular sourdough bread. Very soft and moist in the inside. Would definitely go back to get more of these 2 items. I was not a fan of their chocolate chip cookie - it was a little too dense and not enough chocolate chips.

Overall a great gf bakery with friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was so impressed  :) I recommend the mini pizza - so tasty! Super selection of breads and different desserts. I wanted to take home one of everything!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go! If you want authentic and real whole food ingredients this is the spot! Whether you're gluten free, vegan or not. You won't be disappointed! I've had the bread, cookies and muffins of all sorts and all are delish! The owners are a fabulous and very friendly couple who really take the time with their customers. Stop in and see what I mean. :)"}
{"text":"Um, this place is delicious. I wouldn't have been able to tell it was gluten free if I wasn't told. The bread loaves are sooo good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so delicious and well made. The shop itself is super adorable. The owner is a really nice guy and always offers samples. So glad this place opened up in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The clean simplicity of this bake shop speaks volumes to the wonderful, authentic taste of the gluten free sour dough.  I never though gluten free bread could taste like my great- grandma's, from scratch, sourdough.  What an amazing surprise.  I have tried most of the muffins and three of the breads.  If you are looking for the flavour and texture of real bread, and you want your body to feel terrific after eating, then this is the place for you. For me real bread has always been the style my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother would make.  Now I have found it gluten free!"}
{"text":"The cookie was hard like rock..
Tasted a little bit below average(maybe because the recipe was healthy so the taste was not as good)
The good side-they have gluten free bread
The fougasee is good."}
