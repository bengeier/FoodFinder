{"text":"Seen the perfect 5 stars and had to try it. Worse decision ever, I ordered ribs and chicken...both the worst tasting stuff ever. All you can taste is smoke, I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth. Also had to wash my hands to get rid of the smell. I come from a cooking family these other reviewers must not! My bbq is wayyyyy better...and I'm a girl! Lol! Have to try everything once, right? If you decide to just don't spend 50$ like I did, TOTAL WASTE! One bite of each item, and to the garbage it went!!! Cute little location is the only good thing I have to say."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked bbq Try it out!!! Fried wings brisket pulled pork even the fries are seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Went with friends and my kids, the food was tasty. I would go again, perhaps to try the brisket."}
