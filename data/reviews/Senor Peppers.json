{"text":"I like it here. They've never done a poor job--food is always fresh and hot, service is friendly. Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Bland, dry old meat. Way overpriced. Taco Bell is better and at least has hot sauce. Get this, JALAPEÃ‘OS cost extra $$ at SENOR PEPPERS, what a joke. How is this place open? Because the locals have never had Mexican food and think it's something special, it's not. Go anywhere but here, it's genuinely the worst meal I've ever paid for and if still bothers me a year later."}
{"text":"Minus a star in this place. The worst place I have ever eaten! So white no really authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and the new, bigger space helps them serve even more customers. My go-to for lunch is the fajita taco salad, and the mole dish on the dinner menu is super delish!"}
{"text":"Typical Mexican/American food that's consistent. The fajita burrito is especially good. In the winter the place is great to go to since its about 80 degrees inside."}
{"text":"The food was cold, the waiter was scarce & cranky, I asked for water many times & never got it + over priced food. Also no spices or herbs used...very bland! Skip it."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and always walk away pleased.  It has you standard mexi american offerings as well as some truly authentic Mexican far.    It is as good as any Mexican I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"The food here is great, it is crazy to think that this place and El Rio in Stoughton are owned by two brothers. The food between the two are completely different. I find the food here at Senor Peppers to be amazing, it's fresh and the full of amazing spices and taste. It's more authentic to me. 

However, the service is absolutely horrible. I will always prefer to go here than some other restaurants but I also expect to wait forever to be served. Not only that but I'm lucky if they even get me a drink let alone a refill. No one ever comes to check-in to see if my boyfriend and I need a refill on chips, drinks, or even if we want anything else. I never know what the specials are because the sign is never in view-able range and the waiter never offers to tell us. The wait staff seems to only want to sit you down then ignore you.

Granted everyone here is friendly and I do enjoy the food but the service itself needs to improve."}
{"text":"Stopped by while enjoying the town of Oregon one afternoon. The place wasn't busy; us with our Modelos and another couple with margaritas. Must be a decent place if everyone's drinking at 3pm. Enjoyed a somewhat private booth. Staff was quite nice and attentive. The building is beautiful on the outside; I love the cove of the town it's located in. Inside the restaurant is nice too. The food was disappointing, however I would definitely order again. I'd like to think I ordered poorly with the vegetarian fajitas; it seemed like frozen veggies were used, still wet. Great accoutrements to the dish."}
{"text":"We have always had really good food here. Sometimes we have good service but sometimes we have had REALLY BAD service. Still, the Mexican is similar to Laredo's in Madison and we are glad to have it nearby. We almost always order the same thing, so maybe we've just found our favorites. For me it's the fajita burrito (a common special) or the fajita chimichangas when they don't have the special. Love the cheese sauce. Might not be super authentic but it tastes great. The premium margaritas are very good - much, much better than the \"rail\" margaritas. Love their chips and salsa too.

Now...the service issues...if you're in a hurry make sure you order your food at the same time as your drink or at the very least don't tell them you need more time when they deliver your drink! They often times seemed to completely forget us once our drink was delivered. Now I always hurry my husband to make up his mind by the time we order the drink (especially if we have our kids along and don't want to wait forever)."}
{"text":"Been a fan of Sr. Peppers for some time now.  When they first opened we were regular visitors eating there at least once a week, often more.  The big down fall for the establishment is that their restaurant is not big enough.  The wait is too long.  We either go at odd times or do take out not. I think that it is important to note that in over 20 take out orders they have never made a mistake."}
{"text":"Always terrific.  Staff is cheerful and polite.  Food is consistently great and the restaurant and bathrooms are always clean.  This is a new restaurant and when it first opened they didn't have enough wait staff and often the only person on the floor didn't have good enough English skills.  They have since added more staff and now the service is terrific.  I have yet to meet a person in Oregon who doesn't love the place."}
{"text":"Broke down to get some carryout as we just didn't want to drive into Madison for quality Mexican food. Hated to do it as we've never had good food here. Anyway, checked hours, they're open until 10pm. Called before 9:30pm and got \"Sorry, we're closed\" to which I replied \"Oh, I thought you were open until 10pm?\". \"Yeah, we were slow so we closed early\".
Going to give one star for them saving us from another bad meal from them. Wonder why they were slow? Hmmmm."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The first time was decent, second time the service was slow and the food was subpar. The third time We, a table of four, waited for our food for about 30 minutes despite us being the only table in the establishment. When we got our food the waiter had gotten the order wrong and left to fix it(we assumed) but never came back. The food itself was terrible. I had ordered the fish tacos and they were very dry and tasteless. The rest of the table was not impressed what so ever with their food either. As I said our waiter never came back so we had to flag down the manager for our check and quickly made our way out and have since never been back. As I pass it by regularly on my way to work I can only assume my experience is a general one seeing as there is only ever 1-2 tables at a time."}
{"text":"I know the reviews are mixed, but we had a great experience - especially the food.  
Service was OK - not great at first, but finished well in that food was brought out at a reasonable pace; they checked back; and our check was brought promptly.  

My girlfriend and I ordered Don Julio margaritas, but they tasted as though orange soda had been added.  Made for a strange cocktail - if the margarita were good I could have given 5 stars.

The high score was due to the food.  Chips were run of the mill, but the salsa was very good, tasting fresh, and had the right amount of onion and cilantro.  The server was happy to get us some spicier salsa, which was very hot but very well seasoned and excellent. They also give you complimentary pickled jalapenos and carrots that were really great.  Very nice touch.  

Cheese dip is melted white cheese and seasoned perfectly.    For entrees, my friend got a nice salad with guacamole, and the guac was very good in that it was well seasoned.  My \"devil shrimp,\" in chile arbol sauce was fantastic, and accompanied by good rice and a small salad with guacamole and sour cream.  

Prices were good, and the ambiance was much better than average.  All in, I look forward to going back, especially to try another margarita as I expect what we had was an anomaly.  Recommend trying the place."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices.  Try the Queso Ala Mexicana as an appetizer with chips--it is GREAT.

 I usually order my food as takeout and it never takes more than 15 minutes to get."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant in Oregon WI. This place is the definition of a hidden gem! If you are a lover of Mexican food you should definitely try this place! Affordable and delicious"}
{"text":"SO SLOW.  Very, very slow.  Not overly friendly.  Food is eh.  Go somewhere else!  I'm amazed that this place is always busy."}
{"text":"One star because the food was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular, but the steak tacos were good.  The chips and salsa were bland.  The rice and beans, blah.  

The service was horrible.  We waited 45 minutes to get waited on and get our food.  No real apologies, just excuses."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while....if you want spicy everything and smart ass waiters and managers go here."}
{"text":"Love the fajita burrito special.  Overall, food is good and consistent.  My only knock is the service, which can be slow.   Regardless, it's worth a try and the food has kept me coming back."}
{"text":"Had the burito it was very good. Prices are acerage and service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Not good. Dirty tables and glasses, we were never asked what we wanted to drink,  cold food and lots offensive music coming from kitchen. Pretty awful."}
{"text":"We were happy with our first experience. It's pretty standard Mexican fare, the atmosphere is fun and natural light is really nice! You're supposed to wait by the entrance door (the door on the left) to be seated, our food came out within a reasonable time, it wasn't extremely busy for 6pm on a Saturday night either. We plan on going back to try their margaritas."}
{"text":"By far the worst service/food I've ever had. They literally wanted to charge me $4.99 for their version of fried ice cream...IT WAS CORNFLAKES (some soggy) SPRINKLED ON TOP 1 SCOOP OF ICE CREAM????? It wasn't fried at all. Do not waste your money here. Wow"}
{"text":"Senor Peppers is OK to me - some of the food I've had is insanely spicy(Huevos Rancheros) - you have been warned. The vegetarian dishes I've had I have not been crazy about; most are kinda bland and the chips and salsa I was not a huge fan of. The service was friendly and the seating both inside and out was very nice and well planned out."}
{"text":"Good food with great portions. I got the grilled chicken with mole sauce which came with spicy rice and refried beans as well as guacamole salad. Very good menu choice. Sadly it took me and my party of 3 over 40 minutes to get our food once orders were placed! Not sure what the deal was given it was not terribly busy at the time? Crazy good red and green salsa here! Put it on everything!"}
{"text":"I liked it! The chips were very homemade(which is an acquired taste, thats for sure). I happen to like this style. They have homemade hot sauce, its kind of similar to El Pastor's. I had the veggie fajita burrito lunch and was not disappointed. The waiter was a little stretched but I wasn't disappointed. Prices were fair for lunch. The rice was probably the weakest part of the meal."}
{"text":"Senor Peppers serves up good, solid Mexican food.  They're usually busy, which is an indicator of their popularity in this area.  Worth a stop if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Hit and Miss on food and service!   I have been to many Mexican restaurants, this is only place that you have to ask for more chips.  If crowded food and service is sub par.  On a good night excellent food."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I came in early on a Sunday. Senor Peppers was empty and thus we received very attentive service. The chips and salsa were delivered almost immediately. The chips were still warm and the salsa had a great, mild flavor.  

The interior of the restaurant is bright and pleasant due to the the floor to ceiling window. The tables are nicely set. I wish they would pick a lane, as far as decor goes. Are you going with the colorful, eclectic mix of Mexican tchochkes and flowers or with a more minimalistic fine dining feel?

The entrÃ©es were incredible.  I had the crab and shrimp chimichanga.  Wow! The big chunks of crab and well-seasoned shrimp made this dish a delight! 

I didn't care for the flavor of the refried beans. There was a flavor I could not detect. Pretty standard kids menu: chicken nuggets,  burger,  quesadilla. 

I would love to visit again for dinner, sit outside on the patio, and try a marg!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening and when we walked in, it wasn't clear where we were supposed to stand or wait for a table.  We felt kind of awkward and we seemed to catch the staff off guard by asking for a table.  It took a few minutes to clear a table, but then we were promptly seated.  We received our drinks not long after being seated, but it took a while for the server to take our order.  While ordering, we were told they were out of guacamole! How does a Mexican restaurant run out of guacamole?!  Seriously!  That's like a McDonalds running out of french fries.  It was a huge disappointment.  But, the food was very good and the portions were large."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Had great nachos and salsa.  Service  has never been great but has gotten worse over time.  Same for the portion sizes and quality of food.  Nachos are now 1/4 of the size they use to be and so were the other meals we've tried.  Nothing tastes good anymore. Sad to see a good Mexican place in town go down hill."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the worst experience we had in a very long time.  Drove 45 minutes to check out this place for the first time.  After all it's my birthday and we wanted to celebrate.  We've been sitting here for over an hour.  One drink, still waiting on food.  It's a Thursday - and not that busy.  People who showed up a half hour after us ordered and got their food before us.  It's Mexican food - not that hard to do.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL."}
{"text":"Darn good food for Oregon. Might even be the best restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Awful. Don't go. Canned chicken. Horrid margarita. The service was mediocre and rushed."}
{"text":"I was visiting Oregon, Wisconsin from California and went to Senor Peppers on a tip from a local.  It was a friendly, cozy place in the renovated town center with a menu loaded with the usual Mexican-American stuff.  In addition, there are some dishes off the beaten path.  I especially liked that their drink menu included horchata, a drink that I usually find indicates that someone from Mexico has had a hand in creating the menu.

Portions were big and the place was full of locals on a Monday night.  Clearly it's popular, and not undeserving of this honor.  It's casual and an easy place to take children.  I'll go back when I'm hungry for heavy food."}
{"text":"Nice place it was busy when I was there. Still got fast service. Food  was delicious and almost to much to eat. Warn chips and cold salsa when you arrive. First time there can not wait to go back again. Authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick meal and enjoyed the enchiladas and chili rellenos. The chips and salsa were tasty and the drinks plentiful."}
{"text":"Eek, methinks not, indeed.  Take one part disinterested service, add two parts craptastic food and serve it in a dirty, noisy setting, you got yourself the train wreck of a dining experience that is Senor Peppers.  Move along, folks, there's really nothing to see here.

The signs of impending doom came from the onset of our visit, as my daughter and I immediately found ourselves standing with a confused group of people milling around in the entryway, waiting for the host to seat us.  Eventually, the overmatched host herded us to a table, failing to provide menus or an explanation of who would be serving us.  While we waited (and waited) for a server, we noticed food scraps littering the floor around our table.  (The floor stayed dirty for our entire visit.)  After a 10 minute wait, our server arrived and hastily dropped off menus, water and a basket of warm chips and tomato salsa.  We enjoyed the chips, and frankly, we would have appreciated a second basket, even if we had to pay, but alas, our server never offered us that opportunity.  

Our harried server eventually returned, took our order and disappeared again with no explanation of how long the wait time would be for our meals and totally oblivious to the empty water glasses on our table.

As bad as the level of service was, the food was even worse.  I regretted ordering the Machacado con Hueva as soon as my server placed it in front of me.  Described on the menu as seasoned shredded steak with scrambled eggs, what I received was chewy, bland meat pellets with overcooked eggs, made with a fistful of salt.  This meal took the humble egg to a whole new level of suckitude.  

I waited for an opportunity to send my order back, but the server conveniently never checked back with us until we needed to leave to get to my daughter's soccer game.  (The Senor Peppers website proclaims you can order with no risk - if you order something you do not like, they will replace with something you do. This is a great concept, but terrible execution by our server by never checking back with us.)

My daughter ordered a cheese quesadilla with fries.  While not as bad as my Hindenburg-esque disaster of a meal, her meal was no great shakes.  The cheese was exceedingly bland (not sure if it was mozzarella or Monterrey Jack - too little flavor to tell).  The fries had no crunch, were cool in the interior and were badly under seasoned (the cook must have used up all the kitchen's salt when preparing my eggs).  

The server eventually dumped the check at our table; we promptly paid and raced out the door, barely making it to my daughter's game.  Afterward, I did contact the restaurant's customer feedback center about our lackluster meal, however, I never heard back.  A frustrating end to a forgettable dining experience.  While I generally loathe doling out single star ratings, the perfect storm of lackadaisical service and dismal food leaves me with no other choice."}
{"text":"I have been to Senor Peppers twice and have enjoyed the food thoroughly!  The food was flavorful and taste different for each dish.  Portion sizes are great and the service was good as well.  We will be going back.  So far this is the best restaurant in the city.

They also are knowledgeable on gluten for those with allergies.  Big plus!"}
{"text":"Crappy everything. The service was bad, the guy was a jerk. He didn't care about anything and you could tell he didn't respect us. The food....so gross. Very very cheap. You could tell everything was the cheapest they had at GFS. Everything tasted fake and like cardboard. And it was really dirty. I'm so glad I don't live in the Madison ara so I won't have to ever go there again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Very authentic.  Great service.  Very friendly, courteous, and attentive.  Would go back as much a possible"}
{"text":"We were passing through and stopped at Senor Peppers because we love Mexican food and outdoor seating.  Our waiter was efficient and we really enjoyed the guacamole.  My husband dipped his chip in the salsa and he pulled out a long dark hair.  We wanted to be discrete so my husband went inside to speak to our waiter about it.  We waited approximately 5 minutes for his return, and when he came outside his comment was \"No one in the kitchen has long black hair, so the hair must have floated in the salsa from outside\". 

WHAT???? Are you kidding me?  We sat and looked at each other in dismay, and asked for our check.  Poor, poor customer service.  We will never be back, and I strongly suggest that this restaurant review and revise its policies on how to handle legitimate customer complaints.  Sadly, the very nice waiter was the guy who got screwed.  We just couldn't leave a tip. Our appetite was ruined and we stopped eating our guacamole the second this happened.  It was not handled properly."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Oregon and this is the only Mexican restaurant in town, so we decided to give it a try as we love good Mexican food. The recent thing I've seen at a few Mexican restaurants is they start to charge you after the first basket of tortilla chips and that is the one thing that has seemed to differentiate the great vs okay Mexican restaurants out there. The food was ok, not spectacular and our waiter didn't seem to be interested or friendly."}
{"text":"To start off, the servers all seemed overwhelmed, and they were not too friendly. They were trying to rush everyone along, and it was off-putting. I ordered the chicken chimichangas with beans and rice, my son ordered the tacos with beans and rice, and my other son ordered the kids chicken quesadilla. None of us came close to finishing our food. Not because the portions were big, but because the food was not good. 
The meat in my chimichangas was bland, the beans were super thick, and the rice was completely lacking flavor.
My tacos were drowning in juice, and the tortillas weren't even heated up. The quesdailla wasn't much better.

Skip it. All you have do is drive 10-15 minutes into Madison to find one of a dozen good taco places, all of which are a world apart from this place."}
{"text":"Decent food but the service was so bad it was nearly comical. We ordered the half pitcher of margaritas, was brought the whole pitcher. We pointed out the mistake but they still charged us for the whole. Never came back to ask us how the food was. Walked past our table multiple times but finally had to flag him down to ask for a refill of chips and salsa. Also had to ask for the bill. Terrible service."}
{"text":"The staff did a great job.  The place was busy but we still got our orders quickly along with refills when needed.

The food was great for what it is.  They obviously could make the food a little more authentic but its more appealing the way it's served to the taste buds of the local community.  That said, the food was delicious.  I have about 400 carnicerias and Mexican restaurants within about 10 feet of my house in CA and I liked it.

If you want some comida mexicana and your in Oregon, you probably only have one choice anyway so check it out."}
