{"text":"I'm going to cut straight to the point: The Alamo is slow. REALLY slow. I've never been to a restaurant that had slower service for so few patrons.  I came here for lunch about a week prior to writing this review; at the time of my arrival, there were maybe five or six tables worth of people seated on the patio and maybe two people seated inside. Not too many people, so service SHOULD have been pretty quick.  My co-workers and I didn't have to wait too long to receive our menus, at the very least. The first thing I noticed was that everything on the menu seemed really over-priced. The Alamo looked nice, but it certainly didn't look like a four or five-star restaurant, so seeing $16 for a burrito seemed a bit absurd. I ended up settling on the tortilla soup ($6.50 for a fairly average sized bowl). Very little was priced under $12.   We didn't have to wait very long to receive our drinks and we were served complementary chips and salsa... but we waited about 1.5 hours for our food to actually arrive. Yes, you heard me right. One and a half hours. For freaking soup, a chicken sandwich and a burrito. Seriously? Actually, none of the other parties at the other tables received their food any faster. In fact, a pair of co-workers came in and had to wait at LEAST half an hour to receive food they called ahead for and one of their orders was incorrect. /facepalm.  Not once did either server stop by our table to ask how we were doing, ask if we would like more chips, or to even explain or apologize for the slow service. When our food was finally served, there was no apology and they had forgotten to give one of my co-workers the onion rings she ordered with her sandwich. When my co-worker inquired about it, the server actually tried to argue with her and said she never actually ordered onion rings in the first place! She eventually backed down and said they'd be out in a couple minutes... we waited about 20 before they actually did bring them out and by that time, we had already finished eating.   The tortilla soup I had ordered was decent but nothing extraordinary; it was a tomato-based cream style soup with chunks of chicken in the soup itself. Longer sticks of tortilla were placed in the bowl, resting on the edge with a couple slices of avacado and some sour cream drizzled on the side. The presentation was average and it tasted good but it definitely wasn't worth the price or the wait.  I would have suggested to my co-workers that we just leave, but we had waited so long that there wasn't any time to stop off anywhere else and none of us were about to go without lunch for the day.  I've never been so appalled by the lack of service or common courtesy. After talking to other people I know who have eaten here, I've learned that The Alamo is notorious for taking well over an hour to bring food out and most of my co-workers avoid going there because it always takes two hours on average. I realise that it's likely not the servers fault that the food took so long, but it IS a servers job to make their patrons happy. Either of the two women could have stopped by and apologized for the slow service or offered an explanation. And they certainly shouldn't have argued about incorrect orders. In fact, I would hazard to say that they should have given all of us our orders free of charge for having to wait THAT long but I know that they'd likely go out of business pretty quickly if they started doing that. :P  All in all, over-priced, slow as freaking hell and the service sucked. I'll never go back here and I regret that I even ate here in the first place. Just about the only good thing that's come out of my experience here is that it got me to come back to Yelp after a long absence of reviewing. :P"}
{"text":"We've been to The Alamo 4 times now. It's a small place, and I'm pretty sure they've only got one cook so they don't have the fastest service but the food has been consistently GREAT! There hasn't been a single thing that we've ordered here that we haven't enjoyed. The prices are a *little* on the high side but its authentic and delicious so it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic food. Ordered the individual size meat platter and it was more than enough for my husband and me. Will come back for sure. Eager to try the other dishes. Good service (went on a Sunday). Good portion size. I would recommend them to edit the menu, and make it easier to read. The food photos don't make sense...other than that, really good experience."}
