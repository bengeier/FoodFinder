{"text":"DONT ORDER ONLINE. It doesn't work. I ordered, put my card detail in, got a Confirmation email and an hour 10 mins later the food still wasn't here. I called and they said the online order system has never worked and the guy who built the website took the money and ran....in fairness they did get the food here quickly after I then ordered by phone and it was really awesome."}
{"text":"The food there is great!!!  I actually generally don't like Thai food but I love their food!!  Everyone we've taken there agrees that it's great.  The Coconut Mango Chicken with coconut steamed rice is my favorite.  We get take-out from there all the time now!!"}
{"text":"I was here with a friend of mine a while back but I forgot to leave a review. We drove to this restaurant, found a free parking spot on a nearby local street (the restaurant doesn't have a designated parking lot), and was seated immediately around 6:15 PM on a Friday evening. It was surprisingly empty - I think there was only one other person there.  The restaurant is small but the interior was quite nice - it had a nice, red table cloth and a white cloth napkin wrapping around a pair of chopsticks. The waiter serving us was quite friendly. He gave us the menu, asked us what we wanted to drink, and came to check back on us at a reasonable time.  We also got our meals at a reasonable time. I ordered shrimp pad thai and I think my friend ordered curry pad thai chicken. If I remember correctly, it was a dish with chicken in milky green sauce, with rice on a separate bowl. I'm not a fan of coconut, so it was a little funky, but still good. My pad thai also tasted good. The waiter came to check on us occasionally and refilled our glasses with water. I think the prices were about the same level as Spring Rolls, and since it was quiet and empty (while maintaining that restaurant vibe), it was a good place to have a dinner and get to know someone. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was lucky in my ordering, but I found the Devil's Chicken to be both flavorful and spicy. The Chicken in Peanut Sauce was also nice.  I was surprised at the purpleness of the Sticky Rice, and it seemed slightly underdone, but not tragically so. All in all, I recommend it, and plan on going there again."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is a misnomer. The food was far from spicy and certainly not Thai spicy. I wouldn't even consider the food as authentic Thai.   I must say I was very excited to try this place. It is brand new and I live nearby. I was really hoping it would serve up some authentic spicy Thai food. I went with my wife. We ordered three main course dishes. Before ordering we had told the waitress we liked very spicy food and asked her to tell the cook to make sure the food was hot and spicy. The first dish to arrive was mango 'lamb'. I am a big fan of lamb and know its distinctive flavor. What was served was not lamb but was beef. I advised the waitress the meat was beef but she insisted it was lamb. I didn't care to argue the point and accepted the dish as is. My wife's first complaint was that she found it too sweet, whereas I found it too salty. (My wife prefers salty foods, I prefer sweet foods which explains the discrepancy). However, we both love hot and spicy and found the dish to be very mild and far from hot and spicy.   The rest of the dishes were the same. All of the dishes were saturated in a thick heavy sauce with far too much sugar and salt. There was very little of the fresh herbs, spices and chillies which are the hallmark of authentic thai food. We were both very disappointed and would never go back.   In fact, I had felt cheated. Why call the place Thai Spicy and then serve mild bland food? Why serve beef when the customer orders lamb? Its too bad, because we live nearby and would have gone very often if the food was authentic thai spicy.   The only good thing is that they serve large portions for a reasonable price. Perhaps if you want a moderately priced dinner and don't know authentic thai food and prefer boring bland food you might like it. However, If you are looking for authentic thai spicy food do not try this place. You will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We've gotten delivery 3 times and we've liked everything we've ordered so far. We've only ever gotten delivery so I have no idea what the actual restaurant is like. The prices are good and the food delicious. We'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Thai place to take my parents out for dinner. This restaurant exceeded my expectations. All the dishes were fantastic which was echoed by our entire dinner party. Chicken pad Thai, curry chicken pad Thai, Beef with green curry and basil chicken. Also enjoyed the coconut rice although one member felt it was a bit too sweet. Would definitely go back and recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. The feel of the restaurant doesn't feel authentic and makes you question. But the food is consistent and great. We tried most of the thai food menu and so far haven't come across something we don't like. Highly recommended for dine-in or takeout!"}
{"text":"We've tried so much off the menu and everything is always great.  The chicken wings and their house salad dressing are bomb."}
{"text":"The food is alright but their service is awful. Especially the manager/owner(?) is quite rude"}
{"text":"Malaysian curry was so flavourful, and the Beef pad kee mao had a lot of beef.  The spring rolls (veggie) had a great homemade taste to it."}
{"text":"Our go to in the area for Thai. Usually order once a week or so and never been disappointed. Great Thai curry dishes, red, green, yellow with chicken or shrimp is a can't miss. Can't speak for the Pad Thai as I'm not a fan of it in general, but the curries are great!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I would like this place as much as I did since a lot of the thai places I've been in Toronto have been a bit disappointing. I was also worried about how little reviews this place had and how unhelpful most of them were. Anyway, this has been the only place to hit the spot for my thai cravings since I've been in this city.  What we ordered:  Malaysian curry beef - nice indian flavor, made with eggplant and potatoes and comes with rice. YUM. My fav.   Pad thai with chicken and shrimp - A rule of thumb for gauging good pad thai is by looking at the color. The pad thai here is a nice dark orange which signifies a good tamarind flavor. I personally liked it, but my boyfriend said it was a bit too sweet.   Thai crispy beef - Breaded beef, fried and rolled in tamarind sauce. Boyfriends fav.   Mango Chicken -  We ordered over $35 for take out and were given a choice between mango chicken or pad thai.  We already ordered pad thai so I chose mango chicken. This chicken has a sweet and sour flavor. It also seemed like they used leftover scraps of chicken on the order so maybe that's why it was free. Either way my bf liked it and I thought it was pretty good.    Pad see ew chicken - meh. I could have done without this one. My search for good stir fried flat rice noodles in this city continues. The pad see ew here is not bad, but it's not what pad see ew should be. It's more like a less flavorful version of their pad thai and although I didn't hate it, I don't recommend it.  I also asked for chili sauce/chili powder with my order and got a weird head tilt from the owner. They ended up giving me sweet and sour sauce instead. I almost want to dock a star for this because every authentic thai restaurant should have chili fish sauce or chili powder, but I'll forgive it since the demographic seems to be mostly caucasian people who aren't acquainted with heavy spices/fish sauce."}
{"text":"Actually can't say one thing bad about this place! Service was great. Food was delicious and came out really fast. The price represents the food quality and portion size accurately.   Overall definitely earned the 5 starts  : )  Me and a friend ordered the green curry chicken, veggie pad Thai and garlic shrimp. Our server was like hope you're hungry lol and yaa it ended up being so much food but we still ate it all because it was all so good. Can't even pick the best dish either because each were sooo good in their own way."}
{"text":"My office is close by, and we go here all the time, usually once a week.    I've only been for lunch, but whether lunch special or off the menu, dine- in or takeout, it's always quick and delicious.  Service has a sense of fun and this always makes a meal even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Toronto doesn't really have very good Thai restaurants and this place is very good for the price. Tried the devil's chicken, eggplant steamed rice and spring rolls. Everything went well together and the order arrived right on time. Kudos"}
{"text":"Has a fantastic lunch menu with several options. Different meat options are available for most items. The portion size is very generous and taste delicious. The red curry is particularly flavourful and creamy."}
{"text":"scrambled to find a spot to cater to my hankering for thai and would accomodate us at 10pm on a Friday night. although this place wasn't on my bookmarks list, i agreed to try it after checking it out on yelp. i ordered the pad kee mao with lamb and my boyfriend had the malaysian chicken curry. we paired our meals with two thai iced teas.  the iced teas were the first to come out, my eyes were immediately attracted to the color first. a beigish-brown. not orange with a layer of white like thai iced tea usually is. also not iced. it came out not lukewarm, but warm. the taste wasn't bad; my boyfriend enjoyed it, so i let him have mine.   the pad kee mao was made with pad thai noodles. i wasn't amused since i'd been craving pad kee mao for months now. it was flavorful and spicy which was good, and also the lamb as a choice was different but a nice change for me- i have never seen it as an option before. the meal was plated with a lemon wedge, a cucumber slice, some tomato and a orange slice. the dish was pretty and well-presented.  can't really comment on the curry since I'm not a fan of thai-style curry in general , but it seems like this restaurant values presentation way more than authenticity."}
{"text":"I found this an absolutely delicious purveyor of fine Thai foods. I have been twice now as a nearby resident and this is a dead-set lock as one of my new local favourites. Spicy thai soups, tasty chicken satay skewers, and devilishly spicy noodles and specialty dishes."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised to see negative reviews of this restaurant...it is 100% my fave Thai spot in the city. I have several particular changes that I make to my order and I am always so grateful for Spicy Thai house accommodating my requests. I LOVE the pad Thai, peanut chicken, spicy Thai chicken, and fried bananas! Everyone I introduce to this place is instantly addicted and I am always pleased with the delivery and service as well."}
{"text":"Great food and fast and courteous service! I am coming back. Ordered the Lu Chicken Devil and is was fantastic. A great break in my day!"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes!  The food has lots of flavor and is seasoned just right. The only one star deduction is that it's not a true authentic Thai curry.    On a side note, the service was fantastic as my water glass never hit the bottom and I'm always drinking a lot of water."}
{"text":"I regularly order food from this place since it opened. Always pickup because the few times I tried delivery, it took a really long time. The quality of the food is good but pretty generic for a Thai restaurant in Toronto.   The other night I placed an order for pick up. When I arrived we were told they did not have our order. The man I was speaking to asked who I spoke to on the phone. I said I didn't know but it was a man. He said he was the only person there with a tone that implied I must be mistaken because I never spoke to him. He checked the other takeout orders (he said three in total) and said none matched our order. The restaurant was empty so clearly not a busy night. He asked if we wanted to order food now, and we said no. He was incredibly unhelpful and made no effort to correct the problem and was treating us like we made the mistake and not him.   An hour later I get a phone call from him asking if we were coming to pickup our food! He blamed us and said we gave him the wrong phone number. Obviously not, since he called us. And with only three takeout orders, it should not have been that hard to figure out which was ours either way. Again no apologies, because it was \"our fault\".   There are plenty of other Thai places in the neighbourhood. This one is nothing special and not worth the hassle"}
{"text":"I finally came here the other day after ordering from this restaurant several time (by several I literally mean 3-5 times a month)  Anyways, the service was good the place was clean and the tables were set. I got the Malaysian curry and it was totally amazing!! The best thing was that they are very flexible with the menu, so it wasn't a problem that I'm vegetarian, the chef instead of using meat used tofu and it was incredible. We also ordered the oodles noodles (veggie obvi) and were great as well, I love this thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Just when I was about to give up on finding decent Thai cuisine in Toronto, Thai Spicy House opened its doors. This place is fabulous! The service was excellent and the food was even better. I sampled the Pad Thai, the Ginger Beef, the Coconut Rice and the Spring Rolls. Everything exceeded expectation. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a long standing customer of the restaurant but after this weekend will never go or order from them again.   My boyfriend and I decided to order food with our friends, one of which has a severe allergy to onions. When we were placing out order we made it very clear to them there was a severe allergy. After waiting over an hour for our food, we sat down to eat to find onions in our food. Our friends called back to complain and after having a hard time with the girl answering the phone, the manager said he would send our order again without onions. We waited about 45 minutes and no food arrived. Extremely hungry and frustrated, our friend once again called back. The manager told him they he tried to call him back (he didn't. No missed calls on any of our phones) to tell us there was no order coming out since he talked to his chef and there were no onions and we were all liars.   After about 20 minutes on the phone with the manager continuously calling everyone ridiculous and liars we asked for our money back and reluctantly he agreed. Needless to say,despite the appetizing food, the customer service and manager have totally ruined their restaurant for 4 very regular customers. Not only was it unprofessional but there could have been a very serious medical problem due to their lack of proper communication and managerial skills."}
{"text":"Maybe the food is good but I can't confirm because I never got to try it.  I placed an order online at 7:25 p.m.  Online confirmation said it was to arrive at 8:15 p.m. and I called at 8:31 p.m. inquiring on the order as I didn't receive it (keep in mind I am 1 block away from this place).  The guy asked if I placed my order online and I say yes, he doesn't ask anything else and simply says all online orders have been sent out and rushes me off the phone.  I gave up another 30 minutes later and call again at 9:16 p.m. and this time he decides to take my order confirmation number and then comes back to me saying there were technical, WiFi related issues that prevented him from getting my order.  He offered to send the order out at that time and I declined obviously because my 2 guests that were expecting dinner left to go eat.  To be in the food delivery business, customer service should be a priority but in this case Thai Spicy House ruined my night.  I hope they learn from this experience."}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonable prices. Friendly staff as well.  Never had any issues here.  Although the new cook isn't as good as the last one. Coconut mango chicken is my favourite dish to order here."}
{"text":"So we ordered some delivery for New Year's Eve. The delivery guy hands me the food and then takes my debit card to process payment.  As I'm entering my PIN he breaks wind. No excuse me.  No nothing. Geeeez!!!"}
{"text":"Got my meal delivered through just eat.   It was late for more than half an hour and by the time the food got here they were cold already. ( One of the item supposed to be crispy turned out to be very soggy)  Crispy beef is too salty and sweet.  2.5/5, sorry but just a bit below the ordinary."}
{"text":"When a Thai restaurant screws up a pad thai, it really makes you question the authenticity. The noodles were hard, and probably under cooked. We had a chicken and shrimp pad thai, and there were two pieces of each in the dish. Taste wise, it tasted like a bottle of ketchup was dumped on. It was absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Only had takeout from this place so can only speak to that experience . Great takeout place, as they handled a big order well and on time.  I had the curry chicken pad thai and it was flavouful but not too spicy.  It comes with a large quantity of food, although mostly noodles. Had the leftovers the next day and it was still good.   Based on the reactions from around the room,  the other dishes were great also. Plans were made to visit the restaurant in person soon!!"}
{"text":"Just-Eat has a deal where certain restaurants offer free delivery if you spend at least $15 and Thai Spicy House was on that list, so it was a no-brainer in terms of deciding to place an order.  They've got a pretty extensive menu, but the Thai Spicy Chicken Devil (\"Lightly stir fried chicken with mushroom, onions and vegetables in spicy sauce\") caught my eye because how could it not with that name?  The food arrived impressively quickly and I'll admit my first reaction was disappointment since the dish does not come with rice. (Now I know for future reference, at least.) But the first bite of the food allayed any concerns I might have had. This was a seriously tasty dish. The chicken pieces were all edible (which is no small feat in itself) and the sauce was addictively sweet and spicy. I happily ate the enormous portion that was provided, and even used a spoon to get all the sauce that was left (sauce that would've been *amazing* on rice to be sure).  Thai Spicy House will definitely be a part of my regular ordering-in rotation from now on, that much is obvious."}
{"text":"Pretty good!! This place is quite nice inside, their food is good too the owners can be a bit iffy sometimes but its okay."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Cute family run place, very friendly, clean and fast.  Ginger beef, spicy garlic green beans, green curry chicken and crispy cashew chicken all exceptional.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We have eaten here multiple times as well as ordered take out. The quality of the Thai food and its portions are great. Sometimes we noticed they were understaffed as we would walk in and the only person serving would be on the phone taking an order."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai place for our family . I normally take spicy fried rice and Malay curry this both are best spicy food for me thx ."}
{"text":"Having never been at this restaurant I wanted to give it a try. It's close and it got 4 stars. When we arrived, I was originally unimpressed. There were no real customers but it was slow to get seated and we ended up sitting ourselves. The service was a bit slow, but it looked like the owner was on the phone taking orders constantly. In the end I'm glad I stayed. The food was really, very tasty. My favorite was the Coconut mango chicken.  The Pad Thai portion was a bit small but we made it up by ordering extra steamed rice. I would definitely come back, but even more likely, I'm going to order take out."}
{"text":"The best Chicken Pad Thai EVER! !!! Highly recommend everybody  to try. The owner the nicest person, always Super polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Another restaurant that does not understand customer service.  Ordered take out. Dish did not arrive as advertised. I called to confirm and they told me the menu has changed but is still wrong online. I said OK well this isn't what I ordered. *awkward silence*. The guy on phone then says what do you want us to do about it. *more awkward silence* uh..this where anyone with any customer service says something like...1. We can bring you the dish you did order or 2. We can offer a discount on your next purchase. *something*...you say something to try to fix the problem. Instead I was told why the menu changed (guess what...I don't care!!) I asked to return the dish and only then did they offer to bring the missing sauce. It was a weird awkward experience and I shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable when I did nothing wrong."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here last night, so I can't speak to the cleanliness or service of the restaurant itself, but we received our food quite quickly. We were told it would be forty five minutes, but it only took half an hour, so everything was still nice and warm.  To share we ordered the spring rolls, coconut rice, and regular (chicken and shrimp) pad thai. The spring rolls were delicious and of moderate size, with fresh and well-cooked veggies to compliment the perfectly crispy exterior. The sauce was a bit on the sweet size, but considering the restrained savoury nature of the roll itself, I think it worked. I would have ordered more, though, as the serving size of two wasn't enough for four people to share. The coconut rice was good; nothing special, but always a classic, and this place knew how to do it right. Sticky, moderately flavoured, and perfect for picking up sauce. The pad thai was good as well - a little on the eggy side, so keep that in mind, but it was well spiced and well cooked. I would order it again, surely, though perhaps not to share. It was a large dish, and considering the size of all of our entrees we were barely able to make a dent in it.  For mains we tried the veggie curry, chicken Malaysian curry, red curry beef, and basil lamb. Right off the bat, I loved the veggie curry. Lots of coconut, creamy sauce, good mix of vegetables, perfect pairing for the rice - it was absolutely fantastic. I can't recommend it enough. Similarly, the chicken Malaysian curry was incredible. I have to stress that this dish is VERY RICH, and you may not be able to eat much, but it was great nonetheless. It was seasoned expertly with a touch of spice, and the eggplant was great with the sauce. On the other hand, I wasn't as impressed by the beef. I thought it was bland and a touch dry for a red curry, and I've certainly had better. The meat itself did have potential, but maybe stick to another type of beef dish. I wasn't huge on the basil lamb either, but hey. Lamb really isn't really my thing, and the others rather liked it. So though I wouldn't get it, I also may not be the best to ask about that one.  Overall, it was a good pick for a Saturday night in. I wasn't wowed by it, but it's certainly a place that I would order from again."}
{"text":"Tony the owner or manager contacted me after I had a disappointing experience through JustEat. I have been unable to edit my review there and so would like to say here that he offered a complimentary meal to make up for the disappointing one, and the food was indeed much better the second time. Good food and above average customer service means we will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"After working a long weekend at the Toronto Vegfest, I was zooming up Mt. Pleasant, hoping to spot a food spot. Loving Thai food in general I spotted ThaiSpicyHouse's sign and did a quick U-turn. Pulled up front and went inside around 10 PM to see if I could get some take- out for me and Heather (who was wanting take out as she has to still drive on to Ajax).   Lovely 20s Indonesian guy took my order and made a couple of recommendations after I asked him as to what was fresh, flavourful and slightly spicy. Ended up with veggie rice paper rolls that where delicious displayed on a bed of lettuce with julienned carrots and a tasty dipping sauce, a green mango salad that had plenty of delectable mango, red onion and red pepper - yum - next time I would add a touch more spice. The basil chicken that was full of veggeis, sweet basil leaves, garlic and chilli pepper and garnished with citrus slices.  Next time I'm back through Toronto I would hit this spot again. Most items ranged around  $10 - $14. Portion sizes are decent. And the food was just want I wanted.  The only downfall (and this applies to the majority of restaurants in Toronto) is the unfriendly packaging used i.e styrofoam and plastic utensils. I once saw someone bring in their own takeout containers - kudos to her."}
{"text":"Tried there lunch special in fact three of the lunch specials with Charles ingalls found it very sweet. Will come?"}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout twice from them, so that's my reference point.  I was both pleased and disappointed. Basil Chicken and Singapore Vermicelli are my favourite dishes on the menu. Both are full of flavour and portion size is good for takeout containers. I would highly recommend both.  Chicken Wings and Shrimp Fresh Roll were a major disappointment. It says on the website that their wings are marinated in their own Thai secret sauce. I think they misused the word \"marinate\", which implies actually marinating meat in sauce either overnight or for several hours so that the meat can absorb all the flavours of the marinade. What I got was an abomination. The wings had no flavour. There was no hint of marinade whatsoever. They were dry on the inside and I disliked the breading. I was expecting St Louis-style sticky wings in sauce and instead, I got something very different and not tasty. Shrimp Fresh Rolls were equally disappointing. How greedy can you be so as to allocate one tiny shrimp sliced into tiny slices per roll? I mean, really?? Even shrimp rolls from Whole Foods are better and they are not a restaurant. I was seriously disappointed in Shrimp Fresh Rolls from Thai Spicy House.  As to their staff, I have only positive things to say about them. They're all super nice and friendly. 10/10 all around in terms of service and friendliness.  One thing that concerns me more and more these days is what kind chicken, meat, and pork do these restaurants use. Very few use organic animal products and I find it concerning. There's more scientific evidence emerging on the connecting between weight gain and consumption of animal products that contain antibiotics that are either part of animal feed or directly injected. I would like to see more restaurants be transparent about whether they use conventional animal products in the kitchen or organic ones."}
{"text":"I'd like to give it 4.5 stars but there isn't an option for that unfortunately. We were looking for a restaurant that was open for lunch on Jan 1st, and this seemed to be the only one aorund the area.  The neon board gives the wrong impression... the ambience inside is slightly more well laid out and less casual. The Malaysian curry with shrimp was spicy and delicious! The usual thai curry was good too. The fried rice was average, which is why I have taken away a star. Overall, enjoyable food"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch at a great price."}
{"text":"Large and tasty portions(all at a reasonable price) plus a nice enough ambient makes for a great place for casual lunch and dinners."}
{"text":"DELIVERY takes over an hour! RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. Not as good as the former Friendly Thai that used to be down the road but definitely very very close. Waiter was also so friendly."}
