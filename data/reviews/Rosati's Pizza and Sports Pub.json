{"text":"Took a chance after seeing the 3 star review and think it is way under-rated!! The bartender April was the bomb and the food was quality food.  Had the spicy garlic wings and two different types of thin crust pizza.  Only reason it doesn't get the 5 star is price but I will pay for quality food, service (April) and atmosphere in Avondale which is lacking in all of these!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the lack of service while sitting at the bar in a 1/2 full restaurant. 
Wasn't asked about drink refills nor did we get plates or utensils until after pizza was served. Our bartender seemed to be more interested in chatting  with the other workers in the corner. As far as the pizzia. I would not go back. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti and meatballs. Wow was it sour. At least the portion was good but I've had way better"}
{"text":"I've been to Rosatis several times now. Being from Chicago, I have high standards for deep dish pizza. This place hits the nail on the head. I can get a hot piece and a drink in a great atmosphere. Monica, Jen and Denzel are always happy to see me! I will definitely come here whenever I am in Avondale."}
{"text":"Every week we go to Rosati's to enjoy great pizza & cold beer. Danielle is our regular server and both the customer service & meal never disapppints!!"}
{"text":"their wings are the best. they are huge and the sauce is great. took the family and we had the thin crust white pizza and the double dough pizza with pepperoni. both were very good. looking forward to trying the deep dish next time. i have since gone back for lunch and had the italian beef (cheef) sandwich. fantastic. great to see a new family restaurant in the area. give it a try."}
{"text":"Great service, watch the game, eat and drink! 
Came on a Friday about 6ishpm, was busy but still seating. Check in on Yelp and get free Dough Nuggets. Restaurant Across from Sprouts."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a two star. Pizza was good, but everything else lacked. We used a coupon for $18.99 2 topping 16\" pizza with garlic bread and cheese and a two liter Pepsi product, which we ordered a diet Mountain Dew. We did get a 16\" pizza, what we assumed to be an order of garlic bread with cheese and a 20 oz regular Mountain Dew. When we sat down to eat, the \"garlic\" bread was a loaf of white bread with a lot of cheese, NO garlic. The 2 liter was obviously wrong. The pizza had some mushrooms and pepperoni, but expected more from a promotion. Overall, good pizza but really disappointing experience for delivery. 

UPDATE:
Had a much better experience dining in. Danielle was our server and she was very pleasant and not over bearing. The orders all came out correct and hot out of the oven, tasting very fresh. We were going to get a pizza again but the picture of the lasagna convinced us otherwise. Also ordered the Rosati's Dough and a side salad. My boyfriend and I walked away stomachs full and satisfied. Glad we gave it a second chance!!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago, so yes we know Chicago pizza and enjoy it very much. The first time we came to this location we pre-ordered so our Chicago style pizza would be ready. When we got there we waited a short while and out came a steaming hot pizza just the way we like it. The crust was crispy as it should be. The waitress was nice. Today we once again pre-ordered our deep dish Chicago style pizza and we waited a short time but this time it was luke warm, not hot nor was the crust crispy. We did not complain to the waitress because it's not her responsibility to cook the pizza. We did still enjoy it and we always order a large so we can have left-overs to take home. This young lady was same waitress we had previously and she was friendly but I think she may have been a bit preoccupied. One improvement might be the toppings should be a little more plentiful, second if you're a \"sports\" bar, have baseball on too if it's baseball season, third since we had a Groupon the check did not reflect the proper amount of tip and would hate her to be cheated out of the correct amount. My daughters are in the service industry and I know the importance of tipping. I always try to tip 20% unless service is bad."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out and have been wanting to for a while. We ordered hot wings and the classic combo pizza. The wings my boys ate really fast! However, we were not fans of the pizza. The toppings all fell off the pizza. We waited for it to cool, then just chunks of the pizza toppings fell off. They did have some neat stuff on their TVs until natural disasters and bombings in the Middle East were being displayed. Along with the deaths of children.  Wasn't the best environment for the other families with kids in the restaurant . So our experience was eh."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with the pizza my husband and I ordered for take out. A few months back, we ordered a deep dish pizza for takeout from one of the other locations, which was about 40 minute drive from our house. So when we finally got home and ate it, it was very soggy. But I assumed that was because it sat awhile. Well, the Pizza that we recently ordered from the Avondale location had the same problem. And it's only a 3 minute drive to our house. I guess their pizza is just soggy. The sauce seems to have so much water and moisture, that it just soaks right in to the crust. It's a shame, because we used to order Chicago style deep dish pizza from them years ago when they were located on litchfield and McDowell by the target. I was excited when they moved to Avondale again. But I will probably not be ordering another pizza from them."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday, the 23rd of September.It was around 6-7 and it was not busy at all. I order the \"Cheef\" sandwich. It was really good and very filling. The fries were okay. I think I will get my food as take out next time. The whole time, there was a lady that worked there (blonde, wearing a blue and white baseball style shirt, possibly dodgers) yelling at everybody talking about how much she hates the Diamondbacks. Not in a playful way either. She actually told a guy at the bar- \"you shouldn't have said anything, but you started it by cheering for the diamondbacks.\" He looked uncomfortable, as did the staff around her. She just kept going. If you are going to make money by being a sports bar, learn your demographic. Insulting customers and walking around with a scowl on your face does not make me feel welcome. If I see that lady working again, I'll definitely do take out."}
{"text":"While driving around ready to eat on Mother's Day we passed through the parking lot where Rosatis is located. I saw the coming soon sign some
Time ago while grocery shopping. I decided that today would be the day we'd give it a try! First of all they have a great yelp check in offer for the dough nuggets. They are DELICIOUS! They are like mini fluffy, airy, buttery, garlic knots, served with marinara sauce. I recommend you try them when you're in.  They have a great craft beer selection on tap. We had a pound of the boneless wings, Half garlic Parmesan , half honey bbq. Both were good, with a generous amount of sauce, which I like. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. He was great. We ordered a deep dish pizza, half extra cheese, half meat ball. By this time we were so stuffed already but the pizza was outstanding with great tasting sauce and a perfectly lovely amount of cheese. Afterwards, I was informed that because it was Mother's Day I was to have a slice of their tiramisu cake. I decline because I was so stuffed but our waiter insisted and who am I to go around declining tasty cake? I'm glad he insisted. It was great. My kids and I shared it and we all enjoyed it. All in all a wonderful first time experience. I'm glad we decided to give rosatis a try We will definitely be back. They also sell pizza by the slice during the day. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"This place let me down a little bit. They had my full attention and did not deliver. The atmosphere is great, the aroma is on par for a real italian restaurant, but the food/flavor was lacking. I got a calzone and it was 90% dough and 10% toppings and cheese, not a good ratio. Maybe its just the calzone but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, and great selection. We sat in the patio and the only thing it need to make it a perfect 10 is music outside or something of entertainment. However wow it is pricey and don't ask for a calzone. You'll spend bue que buck for it."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grub Hub they ignored my order. I tried calling no answer.  This is a Chicago chain makes me upset of the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Welcome back Rosati's but this time, you have a much better location and can sit, relax, enjoy the game(s) on the large screens, have a drink and oh yeah .. enjoy the great pizza!  We have enjoyed the pizza and the pasta so far and customer service has been very good as well!"}
{"text":"Closest pizza to Chicagoland in the west valley. Friendly atmosphere with attentive servers."}
{"text":"Just like all the Rosati's back home in Chicago. Good pizza and full menu too. Plenty of TV's and a large bar to sit at. Outdoor patio as well for when it's cooler out."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so this pizza is as close to home as it gets.. but when you consistently get pizza delivered at work and home and the cheese is always sliding to one side of the pizza box tells you that they are consistent in making the same mistake over and over.. I work at a car dealer and we stopped ordering from them on Saturdays bc on a few occasions we got almost 10 or more pizzas delivered the same way I got my pizza delivered last night.. funny thing is I'm sitting at the bar having some beers while my wife and kids were at home when I got this pic. Bar service is always nice. April is awesome.. I just hate paying $30 for a thin crust and getting it delivered this way continuously ..."}
{"text":"First time eating here and was very impressed with \"The Cheef\" sandwich, great flavor. Friends said the pizza was really good too."}
{"text":"Who needs pizza when they make the bruschetta so good. I have been looking for an Italian restaurant that will toast the bread in olive oil nice and crispy. Here you go. The topping was very tasty too. Pizza hasn't come out yet but I am sure it will be as good as it was in the past, if not I will let you know."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a most wonderful Rosati's pizza called the Monster. I was a little skeptical of the bacon on it but it worked out perfect along with the other meat and vegetable toppings. And the crust is great. Not a crumb was left. If you have not tried it, I do highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our food was great and service was excellent.  We will definitely be going back! Their dough nuggets are amazing! We were there at 6pm on a Saturday and it was busy. Our server was extremely attentive though!"}
{"text":"Have had delivery from this location several times - always amazing! The pizza and calzones are hot and delicious each time. Highly recommend the pizza dough bites - they are so good!! A little pricier than the usual pizza delivery guys but well worth it in my opinion. Delivery sometimes takes a while, but it has always been within the time frame given (sometimes sooner) when we order, and I expect that from a place like this for the quality of food. Have yet to eat at the location but if the delivery is such an easy experience I expect eating there should be similar."}
{"text":"Great Chicago deep dish and the dough nuggets are addicting. Cory is a great bartender and the lady that was behind the bar and took our order was awesome. Such a neighborhood feel to this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! Wings! And service. The waitress, told us 30 to 45 minutes for the pie, we got it in 25. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, can't deny that. However if I'm gonna spend close to $30 on a pizza the service better be on point. It was not.

When we walked in we asked what was  available and the hostess said the bar. We asked how long the wait was, or what she could do for us as far as seating goes. She replies, \"nothing\" I can't do anything. No wait time, just nothing.

We go to the bar. We ask the bar tender what he has on tap. He replies by saying \" well it's right there if you look\" pointing at the taps.

Finally I go back over to the hostess and confront her on her poor reply and lack of service. She denied saying that she couldn't do anything, but did get us a table. The waitress was nice but not very attentive. They don't even serve you the first slice. Anyone from Chicago knows the waitress always serves you the first slice for the table. Overall good food but poor service for what you pay in this place."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite pizza to have since we are from Chicago. So glad they opened up this location so we can enjoy more often!!"}
{"text":"very un-impressed.  I ordered online - set the delivery time at 1 in the after noon.  at 1:30, I called to find out where the order was.  the person answering the phone tells me - I'll call the delivery guy and call you back.  nothing.  6 mins later he does arrive and makes a point to say ' still very hot'  your opinion and mine differ greatly on that.  When I must warm just delivered food first - NOT HOT.  the mushroom ap's -stone cold.  I wish I could tell you about the jalapeno poppers I ordered but since those didn't get delivered - I can't.  Food was tasty.  not bad but considering the crappy service.....don't expect my return order anytime too soon"}
{"text":"This delivered a pizza to with all the cheese over one one side. When I called to complain the owner was very very rude . I will never go there or buy anything again.
Sent money back"}
{"text":"The best Chicago style pizza in town! Being from the east coast, that should say a lot"}
{"text":"Hits the spot when I am craving Chicago thin crust pizza. The pizza and wings are fantastic, I haven't had anything else. The customer service at this location sucks though, every time I call in an order I wonder if I am going to get it and if it will be right."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Went with the Chicago style which has a unique taste. Wings were good and the Cannoli were great. Service was good at first and then we didn't see much of the waitress when we needed her.  That's the only reason for a 4Star."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 hot beef sandwiches with fries and a side salad. Said it would be 45-60 minutes for the order. It's a Friday so I understand must be busy. I get there 45 minutes later and it's half empty, wonder if there was a rush before, I got my food and left. Got home and realized they forgot my salad, called them and told them, they went and checked and said \"oh yeah it's here, if you want it you can come get it.\" I don't live very far fortunately but they didn't even offer to drop it off or anything. I get things happen sometimes, I didn't get an apology until I was leaving with my salad, terrible service.

Updating a previous experience, Dennis the owner reached out and wanted to give me another shot at my bad experience. I got the order for pick up again and got the hot beef sandwiches. Order was ready right on time, the young lady who was helping me out was very nice, my order was correct and the food was not only hot but really good! Have to add the sweet peppers on the hot beef!"}
{"text":"We usually love Rosatti's . Tonight was the first time grabbing it by our house. They tried to charge us $32 for an 18 inch with hardly any toppings. Besides the fact the place was hard to find since their sign light was out. When my husband went back to complain the owner said it's 18 inches. \"Want me to go get a ruler?\" When my husband said I just want a refund. the owner said \"Give him his money and get him out of here.\" So obviously ownership leaves a lot to be desired. Never again. I mean seriously don't come here it's a waste of time."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  I managed to get there for reverse happy hour where you get free dough bites and discounted draft beer.  I didn't take advantage of the beer but he dough bites were tasty.  The bartender April was fun to talk to and engaging."}
{"text":"This is it for a chicken parmigiana sandwich!?!!! Round on a hamburger bun!?!! A FEW fries....very disappointed.........9 bucks for this!!! Will not be back...tailgaters or brothers.....mushroom appetizer needs flavor also....beer was cold...food was hot but bland and weird...pay for our meals and I'll try again only falling for this once!"}
{"text":"Let's start with good food great wings and cold beer ,, be back next time with the family .. they told me that they have the best pizza in The Valley , so I'm gonna check it out soon



2nd time here ... wings and beer great ,, I order de Italian sausage and I got a piece of meat deep fried !!! Guysss your killing the flavor of it , no flavor taste like plastic come on , put it on the grill or the flat top but don't deep fried it !!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Man do we love trivia night! We come here all of the time and LOVE THE FOOD! We have watched numerous restaurants close here and have always hoped this one would make it but based on their service we aren't so sure! We went on trivia night a few weeks ago, there wasn't an open seat in the place! However with all of those customers there was only 1 server. We waited over 15 minutes for a soda refill and more beer. We also waited over 20 minutes for our bill, when we finally got the bartenders attention we mentioned to her how long it took to get the bill and she argued with us saying we didn't even ask...we had tried to get her attention for a long time! My husband took my soda to the bar for a refill and stood there for 10 minutes before she finally noticed him. We aren't too sure if we will back which sucks because we love it here!"}
{"text":"If you pay attention to what you truly enjoy from an Italian restaurant then you will definitely enjoy the taste-filled food from Rosati's."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location 3 times. The first time they forgot part of my order when I called and informed them they said they would send it right away. Never showed up never called back. The second time all of my cheese and toppings had slid to one side of the pizza I assume during delivery. The third time I ordered my pizza to be delivered at a specific time and the driver did not leave the establishment until after the prescribed time and was 25 minutes late. I was so excited when they moved to my area and it's been nothing but disappointment. The food is great but the staff sucks bad! Just for reference this is my only review of an establishment that's how dissatisfied I am."}
{"text":"Very poor experience from service to food.  Order came out incorrect server tried to fix same error.  Manager sat at bar whole time.  Got new place really bad experience"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good Would've gave them 4stars but do to quality of service in restaurant i give 3stars. They seem not to have a full waiting staff. Waiting staff seems to be overwhelmed. Also long hold time on pick up. Sometimes you're on hold so long the system hangs up on you then you call back just to be asked to be placed on hold again..not good hope they get it together they do have potential."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here.  I went with a group of moms and their kids for lunch and we had a blast.  Love that the pizza was cut in squares especially since my son never eats the crust (best part in my opinion).  Not a noisey place, prompt service, and plenty of seating for large crowds (booths, bar, and outdoor seating too!).  For dessert we had the pizza dough bites with warm nutella on the side. (literally had to fight the kiddos off).  I reccomend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza and pub in Az, hands down the best friendly service in town. I highly recommend this spot over Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and pasta for take out. Pizza was good, but they missed 2 ingredients. The pasta had good flavor, but was very mushy/overcooked. We called and spoke to manager, we have a free pizza at our next visit."}
{"text":"Just realized even after the many times I've been here I never wrote any reviews. So first off if you're going to order anything make sure you get some dessert because the zeppole is to die for it's so good and you get a ton of it so theres plenty to take home afterwards. (Warms up great in a toaster oven just add more sugar) their pizza is really tasty, it has a ton of cheese which I love, their sandwiches are a good size for the pricing and their pasta is great definitely worth the wait. I dont think I've encountered any foods that I dont like here."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever experienced. The first meal order came out before the appetizer. All meals delivered one at a time. Beverages not reordered when requested. Last meal delivered after all others were finished eating. Checks were wrong. After 45 minutes and three attempts to correct, we paid for drinks we never got. The food was good, but not worth the hassle of awful service."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12' pizza with mushrooms and three cheese baked penne pasta. The pizza was good scarce on the mushrooms. Side note it's $1.50 per topping on the build your own. The pasta I won't order again it was a thin layer of pasta and massive cheese overload. The supposed garlic bread was half of a French hoagie with just butter didn't look toasted just melted butter and lots of it light flavor of garlic, another thing I'll never order again."}
{"text":"Delivery guy was nice. That was the highlight. Pizza is overpriced, and it was nothing special- will keep looking to find a favorite in Goodyear"}
{"text":"After my initial review, I heard from the manager. He asked me questions about our experience and then offered us a voucher so we would try Rosatis again. The extra effort on his part was genuinely appreciated. However, I got the voucher in my email yesterday and was a little disappointed. It was for $10 (not much on the menu for $10 and I was figuring a voucher for a pizza) and it expired 11 days after I received it. This felt insulting and did nothing to inspire a return visit. My husband and I agreed to delete the email and save our pizza outings for somewhere else. Really and truly, the best place for pizza to go is the Papa Murphy's in the same parking lot. 

The pizza was good. It was crisp and hot. It was also a bit overpriced and the extra $2 for the \"double dough\" was ridiculous. The overpriced salad was not good. The dressing made the salad inedible, and I said as much to the server. She did not take the salad off our bill. Overall, we enjoyed the pizza, but we won't make it a point to return. The sports bar thing is a turnoff and the consistent negative reviews about delivery means we won't be doing that."}
{"text":"I got hooked on the place for a minute then got a pizza that was cold as ice when delivered. Now I'm done."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have Rosati's back in Avondale.  We eat in frequently and also order for pickup.  Last night we tried delivery for the first time and were so disappointed.  The pizza arrived cold on the outside of crust and the middle cheese part was just barely warm.  My husband contacted Rosaties to let them know the pizza was barely warm.   The person who answered, said \"oh I see what the driver did\"   my husband asked if the driver just had too many pizzas to deliver and if we were the last on the route.   She said thanks and she would let the manager know and speak to the driver.    No offer for discount on future pizza or to replace pizza.  We were exhausted from long day of travel and just ate our cold pizza.   Lesson learned do not have them deliver pizza.  For a hot pizza will call Papa John's.   Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"As a brand of pizza, I've defended Rosati's to the moon and back. For the last few years I've enjoyed them just as much if not more than all the GiorMalnati's East imports receiving disproportionate attention. I love their sauce. I love the crust so thick and heavy it may have its own gravitational pull that keeps drawing me in.

But most of my experiences with this brand have just been picking up to-go orders. Now it came time to give it a try in a full-service sports bar. Some of my favorite pizza while watching a Cards game sounds amazing, after all. 

But it really turned out to be a big fail here. I mean seriously, has management ever run a sports bar before? Here's what disliked. 

-No TV out on the patio, something virtually every sports bar should have. What a bummer considering the *perfect* Fall weather. 

-Sound was waaaay too quiet. I struggled to hear it from my table. When the game is on and most people are there to watch it, it NEEDS to be the center of attention. 

-Food was meeeeh. Like, all the right ingredients were there, but I truly feel as though my pizza was undercooked. Was much better after taking it home and heating it up so that it wasn't all watery on the outside and doughy on the inside. 

I mean, don't get me wrong...booze prices were SOLID. Service was cool. I'd maybe order a pizza from here to-go. But to hang out? eh...to catch the game? MEEEEEHHH, I have so many better options."}
{"text":"I never post reviews, usually because nothing is ever that great or that bad but I feel I owe it to other consumers to report this. Rosati's messes up my order, fries instead of the salad I ordered, no \"special \" hot giardinera for my sandwich, wife's burger had no condiments although she ordered 3 and it was all cold. Delivery took 90 minutes when it was \" confirmed \" for 45. Restaurant can't help me because their system is down and can't refund my money because I ordered through eat24 . Eat24 won't even respond to my inquiry. Bottom line avoid Rosati's and eat24 at all costs. Buyer beware !"}
{"text":"Took my daughter in on a Monday to order food to go from the bar. Great service from the bartender. 3rd time here and we've had a really good experience every time. Pizza's great, the Cheef sandwich is my favorite.

P.S. It's hard to start any business, and I read the negative reviews from their first few months. I recommend Rosati's to everyone!"}
{"text":"Very great place to have a great dinner. The food came out fast and was hot and very delightful, server has a great opinion on the food. She was helpful with my decision on dinner. Great service. Danielle was our waitress she is outstanding and super fast..great attitude."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Rosatti's on Baseline for years so. I was so excited to see they finally have one in Avondale! Sadly, I called in a order for delivery and the customer service on the phone was terrible but I figured the food would be wonderful and again I was wrong. The pizza was overcooked and the spaghetti is extremely soggy. I hope in time the service and food can improve. Can't say I will try this location again."}
{"text":"I only ordered Zeppoles from this place but they are not any zeppoles I have every seen. There's no fried brown crusted balls with powdered sugar instead I got triangle shaped pieces of what tasted like bread with powdered sugar on them. Be sure of what your ordering"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've ever had in my life,   amazing craft beer selection.  Service was amazing as well.  thank you Rosa, you were amazin we will be back again and again and again.   my husband loved the sauce so much he said he would get an iv drip of it if he could and my daughter called it magic pizza."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite local pizza place. We used to spend our money at Oregano's and Barro's. We always order pizza and wings. The wait time at Oregano's both before you get a table and after you order are a huge turn off. Barro's is good, but just ok. The wings here are absolutely the best and biggest you will find and they offer several different sauces, all of them fantastic. The pizza is always delicious and well topped. As for price, it may be a bit more than you pay a some other pizza places, but the product is superior and worth every penny! I would love to see a wing ding special, perhaps 8 wings, with an order of fries! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"N.Y. Guy grew up in a neighborhood that had pizzerias every few blocks.N.Y. style pizza is great but I have discovered Chicago deep dish pizza here in the desert.Rosati's pizza is great.Good sauce,cheese and great crust.Will be my go-to from here on in."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try. It was pretty busy when we arrived which is always a good sign. We sat at the bar and had really good service. I ordered a cider and it wasn't very cold so I switched to beer. We ordered one of the deep dish pizzas and really enjoyed it. The crust was delicious and very flaky. We agreed that this was one of the best deep dish pizzas we have had locally. I am sure we will go back at some point and really wish it was closer to us."}
{"text":"Had the worst restaurant experience in my life this evening. Unfortunately I'm unable to leave zero stars, but one will have to work. The wife and I didn't feel like driving downtown for our usual deep dish pizza fix at Lou Malnatis, so we called ahead and requested they start baking the pizza so we didn't have to wait for 35-40 minutes. Upon arrival, we were seated and had drinks served. The pizza was served minutes later. Perfect timing or so I thought. The temperature of the food was luke warm. How could that be if it just came out of oven?  We called the waitress over to discuss our displeasure. Her initial response was,  \"what would you like me to do about it\"? I suggested she put it back in the oven for five more minutes, but the was not acceptable since it was already cut into slices. She then became argumentative about it informing us that there is no way it could be cold since it just came out of the oven. She lifted up the pan and said she could feel that it was still warm. We decided that we no longer cared to eat at this establishment when things went from bad to worse. Our check was brought to us and I did not want to pay for a dinner that wasn't eaten. We walked out and was followed out by two gentlemen. The first who was identified as the kitchen manager threatening that he was calling the police since we were \"stealing\". I told him to do so now when the second gentleman approached my car to discuss this mess. I even told them that I was going to write a negative review in YELP, but he said he didn't give a damn.  The second man identified himself as the manager and heard my side of the story. He was quite nice and apologized for the behavior of his employees. He even offered we take home the pizza at no cost, but it was too little, too late. I would never step foot inside this establishment again and would warm others about their wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"First timers!  We purchased the \"local flavor\" coupon online to give it a try.  Boneless wings, thin crust pizza & cannoli's.  All of the food was very good and the service was excellent!  We will totally be back.  The only complaint that I have is that there was a guy at the bar who obviously had too much to drink (you could tell he was a regular) and was getting loud and using foul language.  Yelling out the \"F\" word a few times.  I do not have virgin ears and it doesnt bother me personally, but there were some small children at a booth not that far away.  I get that its a \"bar\" but its also a restaurant and families are trying to enjoy themselves also."}
{"text":"I was mailed a couple coupons for Rosati's and my wife is from Chicago and couldn't wait to try a \"Chicago Style\" pizza place only a hop skip and a jump away from our home. We often visit other \"Chicago Pizza\" places in the area and we had hoped to add Rosati's to our list of favorites. Unfortunately never again!

On 08/22/2017 at exactly 5:05pm I placed an order with the Avondale Rosati's Pizza location for delivery. We used our coupon, \"Big 18\" for an 18\" cheese, 18 wings, and a 2L of Pepsi. AFTER coupon, tax and del chrg the total was $35.63 before tip.

The young lady who took the order was very pleasant and quoted me \"within the hour.\"

We wait the hour and at exactly 6:11pm (hour and 6 minutes) I called back and asked what the status was. Same young lady answered the phone and was again very pleasant and said that the order was out for delivery. GREAT! No problem. According to google maps I live .8 miles from this location so I didn't suspect that it would take 30 minutes to deliver.

Well we waited another 28 minutes exactly before calling back at 6:29pm to get the status again. The same nice gal on the phone let me know that the order left the shop and was out for delivery at 5:30pm. So at that point I started to ask questions as no one wants a thin crust pizza thats been in a bag in the backseat of a car for over an hour. 
The gal said that she would reach out to the driver and find out where he was. 

We waited another 10 minutes and the driver finally showed up at exactly 6:39pm. I got the food inside and called the family over. We opened the box and the pizza looked exactly like you would imagine an hour old pizza sitting in a hot bag to look like. 

I made my 4th call to the restaurant at 6:42pm. The same girl that had been answering the phone all night went and got me a manager. The \"manager\" was anything but. After explaining the situation her response was, \"hum, thats weird. What would you like me to do?\" I told her that I would like my food remade as I had ordered it and brought out to me in an edible state. She stated that they could either remake the food and it would be another 45 mins to an hour before I got the order, or they could put a credit on file. 

At this point it was 10 minutes shy of a 2 hour experience and I asked for the credit. She started gathering my information and said that she would be willing to leave me a $15 credit for next time...... $15!!! As my order was $40 and garbage I didn't feel that was acceptable. She was having a side conversation with a man in the building as I could hear them going back and forth while I was talking. I was placed on hold for a short while before the \"manager\" came back on. She stated that, \"Sir you have two options, you can either get a $20 credit or we can remake the order and redeliver it.\" 

At this point my wife was already on her way out the door to go get something else to eat and the food we had was absolute garbage so I opted for the remade order. Before hanging up this woman had the audacity to inform me that they would require the whole order back!!! 
Wow she really knows her customer service!

I boxed and bagged everything back up and the wait continued. At EXACTLY 7:16pm (2 hours and 11 minutes after I placed my order) we got an edible \"18 pizza and 18 medium wings. 

All in all I can tell you that if we ever order from you again, it won't be for a long time. 
Easily the worst experience I've ever had ordering delivery pizza. 
I also wish that I would have just ran over to Costco because for a $10 pizza from them is about 100 times better than what we ended up getting. 

Also looking over other reviews it appears that others are having the same issues. Whats even better is that they only seem to respond to 5 star reviews and could care less about feedback."}
{"text":"We had the bone in wings mild and a deep dish pizza. Sooooo good! The server was very nice and friendly. We will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"This pizza place is LEGIT! They do not skimp on toppings. I ordered thru uber eats and it was just simply delicious! Glad I found them!"}
