{"text":"Never again will I order from this place again! I called to order and asked about a dish and was told to \"go online and look at it\" because they're \"too busy\" to tell me over the phone.  (1st red flag)  I then went online...looked up my order & called back only to the same guy who was very rude from the get-go. FYI to the owners...Sometimes it not what you say but how you say it. So then I hang up & remember I want to pay with my debit card and called back was given attitude again about not giving it to them the first time. From then I decided I will not be giving my hard earned money to a restaurant that doesn't care about how they treat their customers.   I usually don't have to leave bad reviews but I will be telling everyone I know about my experience with Rainbow Garden in Urbana! I will stick  to Lai Lai's from now on.  Get a nicer person to answer your phones!"}
{"text":"The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible."}
{"text":"I have to say, from the outside, I was scared to go in.  I quickly learned not to judge a book by its cover, because the inside was really well decorated.  It is decorated in a modern-traditional style and is light handed on stereotypical Chinese restaurant decor.  It felt very cozy and welcoming, which is a great feature.  The food was very good!  It was presented attractively and the portions are enough to feed you for dinner and again for lunch tomorrow.  I ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection.  I tried a bite of my roomate's fried rice, which was a bit oily for my liking, but still tasted quite good.      I will warn you against ordering the egg rolls, because they are the frozen kind.  They taste just like the ones at Panda Express.  I think I would give this restaurant 5 stars if their egg rolls were bigger and homemade.  Over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and I will definetly go back!"}
{"text":"I recently got this for delivery which was very quick. Most of the food was good but I was not a fan of the amount of breading on the Orange Chicken. That just means I will order something different as the Shimp dish that my hubby got was really good. I have had other things from here previously that I also really enjoyed. The prices are reasonable and the delivery charge is understandable. Also the fact that they have Online Ordering now is a big plus. I will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Super slow on delivery - over an hour and 15 minutes!!!  The food is ok, a little too greasy for my taste. If you're going to eat from Rainbow Garden, go to the restaurant. They can't seem to get the order right for delivery or take out.   I much prefer Green Jade (on Windsor), but they don't deliver."}
{"text":"We work on campus and typically have lunch at Rainbow Garden once a week .... Tuesday is Rainbow Day!  Over the past 3-4 years there has been some variation in the quality of the food, from only modest to very, very good.  For the past year, though, very good to excellent has been the rule, with good portions. Strongly recommend as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area, as do most of the reviewers.  Don't believe some of the whiney reviewers on this site ... It's a Chinese restaurant for God's sake! You were expecting gourmet dining?"}
{"text":"Went with white coworkers for lunch a few times. Each time the server gave everyone silverware except me - I got chopsticks because I was Asian. Food was greasy as hell. How do you mess up a fried rice? I ate it with my chopsticks."}
{"text":"I would have ordered from this place again if the driver hadn't of scammed me for an extra dollar.  Look at your receipt!"}
{"text":"Really great lunch menu!  I had the orange chicken and it was very good. I love their fried rice (rice, egg, carrots, and peas). Their crab rangoons actually contained crab (or krab...not sure but there was real protein in them). The lunch menu is really filling and reasonably priced ($5.95 for orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and an egg roll).   The decor is really pretty and the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice for lunch. You'll be in and out quickly and the food is affordable and consistently good."}
{"text":"its the typical unhealthy Chinese food that everyone loves. prices arent bad but it coulb be a tad bit cheaper"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Chinese places around the Champaign-Urbana area and this is by far the best one I have tried.  Rainbow Garden is great for dining in or taking out.  The service is excellent and the food is always fantastic.  I've tried a few different things from the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each of them.    The prices are about the same as any other Chinese restaurant in the area as are the portions (unless you have a large appetite, one dish can usually provide two meals).  My only complaint is that while dining in they do not provide enough rice with their meals.  This isn't a problem, though, as they are happy to give you more upon request."}
{"text":"~WORST RESTAURANT EVER~ The hours for this restaurant goes till 9:30pm on week days. However, after an hour passed, I called them 9:21pm to double check whether delivery is coming or not. They said \"its on the way\". Waited one more hour (total 2 hour passed) NOBODY came. So I checked with the Eat street (their delivery contractor), they said \"there was no delivery went through their record\". In conclusion, they just made brainless work on doing SINGLE delivery and forgot to place on delivery (but surprisingly they remembered taking my money) and just closed the restaurant for the day. Therefore, I waited 2 hours and eventually ordered from different restaurant. ALERT: DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!   Another incident was, I ordered food that comes with the sauce (sweet and sour pork). But guess what?? THEY FORGOT THE SAUCE ! (the most important ones). Re-delivery took them another hour, as a result all the food was literally frozen.   Again, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT.   I am going to call this restaurant tomorrow to get my money back. Since they act ignorantly, I am going to their restaurant to watch whether they are making refund transaction or playing 'mahjong' !"}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious food. Okay to mid-range prices. The manager is unfortunately a very rude and not attentive person. I've experienced this at their other location in Champaign as well,"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and well prepared food. Big servings, too. My favorite is the fish fillet with vegetables. Light and very flavorful. Nice spot for lunch as well. Their beef broccoli does not skimp on the meat or the veggies."}
{"text":"Nice place have been back multiple times.  Unpretentious on the outside, nice on the inside."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place to get lunch in Champaign!  Tasty, fresh tasting dishes with good sauces - and I'm a sucker for a good sauce! :)    Their affordable lunch dishes come with cup of soup, egg roll, and well proportioned meal.   I also really appreciate their service.  The owner is very friendly, and the waiter will usually remember what we ordered and ask if we would like it again. Great place!"}
{"text":"My card information was copied by someone in this restaurant and used in India. Later I heard several similar cases from friends and classmates. I don't know exactly who did it, but be careful!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. I swear they have gotten even better recently. I got Chicken Eggplant last time I went and it was amazing. Service was very fast even though we ate there on a Saturday evening when they were very busy. Food took no time to get to us. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from Rainbow Garden for ten years. Their food is delicious, it's always hot, and delivery is fast! My husband loves the crab rangoon, and I don't think I've ever had a dish I didn't like.  Rainbow Garden is also a great spot for lunch. They have the usual lunch special: soup, spring roll and entree with rice for $6-$8.  The lunch specials are a great value, however they only include the common/popular Chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso's, princess, garlic sauce, etc.  If you want something different, you have to order off of the full menu.  But the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous. I had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when I was leaving the restaurant!!! I had actually tipped him fairly well and I think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise! He did not seem to care that I was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and I have decided never to visit the place again."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time (first time was over a year ago). I got the garlic battered shrimp with cashews which was good - 3.5/5. It would've been better if there was some veggies on it like broccoli or cabbage.  My boyfriend got the tofu stir fry with mushrooms and it was disappointing. I would say a 2/5. It was somewhat bland and had ginger pieces that my boyfriend had to pick out. I would be back for the walnut shrimp or the garlic shrimp. I'm not sure how much it costs at other restaurants but the walnut shrimp was $16 and the garlic shrimp was $15. The tofu stir fry was $11."}
{"text":"Extremely fast delivery! Great crab rangoons."}
{"text":"I don't get Chinese food often, however, when I do, I get it to feed a lot of people. I placed my order for carry out. The woman taking my order over the phone was very friendly. She reviewed my order and let me know total amount on phone. She gave me a 15 minute wait time. It was ready when I got there. The food was so delicious!! Everyone was happy with all. Our favorite dish was the crab rangoon appetizer. We will definitely use this rainbow garden next time we want Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Rainbow Garden Urbana a number of times and had a better than average experience. But my most recent visit for dinner on Oct. 24 or 25 will be my last. For two persons, we ordered three dishes (a bit too much but takeaway leftovers are usually good). The hot boiled fish with tofu was OK, but not as good as in the past. It had little flavor or spice (rate a generous 3 out of 5). The green vegetable, a baby bok choi, was the best part of the meal (rate as 4). I made the mistake of ordering Peking Duck, and it was awful. The pancakes were dried out and tough. Obviously they don't sell much of this dish, the pancakes go stale, but they use them stale anyway. The duck itself was served already in the pancake, with a stale plum sauce on fairly dry duck. Not juicy or fresh at all (rate a 1). It was a waste of money. I should have sent it back but just wanted to get out of there. Rainbow Garden would do itself a favor by not putting the duck on the menu. All in all, a decidedly sub-par experience and not worth nearly the price. Food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"We first had carry out from Rainbow Garden many years ago as a gift from a friend. That gift resulted in our spending hundreds of dollars over the years ordering food from Rainbow Garden, which became our go-to Chinese Restaurant. Tonight's order consisted of General's Chicken, Moo Shu Pork and Mongolian Beef. Although the quality of this establishment's food is usually quite good, I was disappointed that tonight's dishes were merely average. The Mongolian Beef was not as hot as it should have been and had too much beef and not enough scallions. The General's Chicken seemed to have poorer quality chicken then usual. The Moo Shu Pork was okay, but also just did not seem to be up to the usual standard of excellence.  Perhaps this was just an off night. I just hope that nothing has changed to make us rethink our preferences for Chinese food in C-U."}
{"text":"I ordered (Jjamppong) and  (Jjajangmyun). Both noodles were flavorful. The broth for Jjamppong was very authentic, just like I am used to at home. I the oil for Jjajangmyun was drained very thoroughly. (the other store on University Ave. has much oil remaining in the bowl) I would have given it 5 stars if Jjajangmyun came with a side of red pepper flakes. Service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive to our table which I haven't really experienced in asian restaurants. Atmosphere was relaxing and decor was nice.  Overall very satisfied with my visit. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is interested in Korean style Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This food is legit. I have always ordered delivery from here. I usually never have anything to complain about  because Rainbow Garden is great. BUT, their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason. This is not the way to handle customer service, people! You can't yell at someone if they don't like the food they ordered! On the plus side of that situation, they gave me something else w/o charge.   Braised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good. Same with the lo mein ..I've had way more things there but I can't remember but it's great. Try anything. But the weird tofu thing it tastes like hard compressed dough that was uncooked and super dry ..."}
{"text":"Quite unauthentic. Food is just not of quality. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, just hope they can spend as much energy on the food."}
{"text":"I ordered General Tso's Chicken, Moo Shu Chicken, and Chinese spinach online.  Afterwards I got a call saying they were out of the Chinese spinach so I had them substitute for regular spinach, but they didn't even offer to just refund my order or refund the difference between the two dishes.  When I went to pick up the food, I didn't bother to check my order because the receipt had everything correct on it.  However, when I got home I didn't have any General Tso's Chicken, but had green beans instead.  So disappointed. Won't be ordering from there again or eating there if they can't get my food right."}
{"text":"They consistently take more than hour to deliver and their food is definitely overrated. They also never give cutlery regardless of where you ordered from. The one time when I called them and complained about this, they sent cutlery but I was again disappointed as they gave only 2 forks and a spoon for 3 people. Very poor experience so far. Definitely not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and received it in 40ish minutes. Everything we ordered that was fried was pretty much soggy mush. Might be better if we dined in, but stay away if you plan to order delivery."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of Rainbow Garden on Neil Street, although I haven't been there in some time.  Decided to try the Urbana location which is closer to me.  The ambiance was clean, quiet, and open.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The menu was extensive.  I don't know what constitutes authentic Chinese food but this is certainly delicious.  The Scallion Pancake was different than what I remember at Neil Street but still very good.  The chicken dish I had was excellent and ample.  Enough to share.  Will definitely be back again and again to try other dishes.  One thing I always wonder about is the tea.  Chinese restaurant tea is like movie popcorn: delicious but defies reproducing at home.  Also, my waiter was a magician.  I had left half my entree and most of my fried rice and asked for a box.  He returned with my food in the typical Chinese take-out white box but such a tiny one.  \"Is that everything?\"  \"Yes\"  Disbelief on my part, but when I dumped it later onto a plate at home, sure enough everything was there.  Magic!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but one of the waiter was terrible.  The man couldn't see the menu clear enough to know what we wanted to order.  Furthermore, we couldn't talk to him because he doesn't know enough English.  The experience would be ok, but he later brought the wrong order and even spilled water on us."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Rainbow Garden for the first time and wished I discovered it sooner! As one of the few Chinese restaurants south of Green Street, it is worth a visit over China King.  I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch special that came with a small eggroll and your choice of hot and sour or egg drop soup.  - The chicken was battered just right and not too oily, and the sweet and sour sauce came with white onions, green peppers and carrots. I also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken. - The eggroll is small but one of the most flavorful I've had among the Chinese restaurants in the area. - The fried rice was among the best I've had with ample vegetables and scrambled egg - The hot and sour soup needed more vinegar, but I still liked that among the Chinese restaurants I've visited for lunch, they offered soup.  Rainbow Garden's ambiance also makes it a nice date spout with booths and red wood themes. The restaurant is actually much bigger than you would perceive from the outside.  My only complaint is it's hard to park in their lot given the giant billboard in the middle of it."}
{"text":"great food great service all around nice restaurant. Both locations in Champaign and Urbana are equal"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not very authentic in my opinion and somewhat pricey. The items on their menu don't vary as much as golden harbor. However, the atmosphere there is very nice. They have comfortable booths and big tables."}
{"text":"Let me save you the trouble of coming here. Rainbow Garden is basically all talk and no walk. They invested considerably in the beautiful decor of their restaurant, but the food is rather bland and washy, and the waiters are difficult to talk to, are stuck-up and cop an \"I'm superior than you\" attitude.  We were trying to ask the waiter if he could make the Mongolian Beef *non-sweet* and with straw mushrooms (rather than the ones that come with the dish) but he had so much trouble with the request that after a few minutes, he had to bring the manager to our table, where they both stood by our table with their arms crossed, looking down at us ominously, when the manager plainly said \"what is it?\"  It turned out that they could not fulfill our request as customers, and they were pretty upset about us asking if this mushroom-swap was possible, so they made the rest of our stay hostile and cold, as the waiter stared at us from the corner of his eye while hiding behind some plants.   Go to Peking Garden instead. These guys at Rainbow Garden need to lighten up!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and was waiting to meet someone.  When I arrived I wasn't greeted for a good 5 minutes in a mostly empty dining room.  I had to wonder around until someone attended to me.  After telling them that I'd like a table for 2 they sit me at a big table with 5 places as opposed to a booth.     After my friend arrived our order was taken promptly and our waitress was nice. The food was lukewarm and could have been seasoned better although the meat on my dish was cooked tender and came in a good portion size although there were a TON of onions I'm contrast to the meat portion.  The rice was bland and boring as well.    The decor looked great and very classy and the staff was overall friendly.  The price was fair for the portion size and I'd be willing to give this place another go, but I hope for better food and someone at the door to greet me right away."}
{"text":"The food is okay, though not exceptional.   Here I'm also reviewing my experience about their delivery service. In short, the delivery person is rude. After having arrived at the entrance of my apartment building, he kept ringing my door bell, even I had already opened the door from the inside. Eventually he delivered the food to me, but it seems that he was so annoyed, as he didn't understand how the entrance system worked, even I tried to explain to him. At last, he just dropped some f* words to me and left, which couldn't be more unpleasant."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good - My advice? GO THERE . It's a much more enjoyable experience than typical mid-west delivery 'chinese' food. If you dine in the service is generally super-friendly, portions are great with carefully plated dishes, well-seasoned food and excellent prices."}
{"text":"Food is really good and delivery is always fast. I tried ordering online this time and you can't make any changes. Apparently everything comes with white rice and there's an up charge for fried rice. Most expensive Chinese order I've ever had."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I came here for lunch. The server was attentive, but he just seemed like he didn't care we were there. He'd come to the table to do refills or take away dishes, but he'd rush away before we could even say anything. Not that we had anything to say, but still.   We ordered the crabmeat rangoon as an appetizer. The shell was very crunchy. I liked it, but my boyfriend didn't like the crunchiness. We try rangoon at a lot of places. We thought this rangoon was too sweet. We know that most places make sweet rangoon, but this was a little more sweet than most places. Also, other than the sweetness there wasn't much flavor otherwise. I make rangoon at home and I'm used to making a savory kind. So, we're kind of picky on the sweet ones.   Our lunches came with a choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup. My boyfriend had the egg drop and it tasted like a normal egg drop. I had hot & sour and I found that the mushrooms were a bit chewy. The soup base was good though.   Our entrées were sweet and sour chicken and combination lo mein. The sweet and sour chicken was soggy as my boyfriend is used to having crispier chicken tossed in the sauce. The fried rice was dry and had no flavor whatsoever. My lo mein tasted ok, but the shrimp and chicken just didn't taste good to me. I liked the pork that was in my meal, but ended up just having them box up the rest of my noodles and none of the meat because I had picked the meat out and put it to the side. I ate all the pork out of it.   It's inexpensive, but I think you can get better choices at the \"fast food\" Chinese places around town."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. I ordered the beef with broccoli. The prices are affordable. I was expecting more flavor9 maybe this is because I am used to eating greasy, salty Chinese food from other places0. My food was delivered to me in a brown bag with a handle--making this easy to carry the left overs in. The food was packed well. Napkins and and sauces were wrapped separately from my food. And I got two fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Great for lunch or dinner, we opt for takeout often and enjoy the vegetarian lettuce wraps, orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Friendly service and always fresh tasting."}
{"text":"+ves Nice Ambience  Service Reasonably Priced -ves Oily food  Overall ok food. We found it good when we don't try new items and stick to what we like."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, great atmosphere when eating in. The chicken lo-mein is scary in that I know it's not great for me but, it tastes sooo good I can't stop eating it."}
{"text":"Now this is Chinese food. Rainbow Garden is definitely on the upscale end of Asian restaurants (think P.F. Chang's) with beautiful, modern decor and genuinely well-cooked food. The prices are definitely reflective of this, however they are definitely comparable with other restaurants of its caliber ($9-15 for entrées).  I choose the Honey Chicken with Roasted Cashews and Garlic, and it was by far one of the tastiest Chinese dishes I've ever eaten. The fried chicken pieces were large and perfectly crispy, and the sauce was a delicious mix of sweet and savory. I opted for the fried rice instead of white (extra $1.50) and it was an excellent addition, though I wish the portion was bigger to match the large size of the entrée: it was easily enough for two people or generous left-overs. My girlfriend got the Beef and Broccoli and was also very pleased with her meal; she especially liked the broccoli, which I can affirm was perfectly prepared.  The servers were also excellent, as they were both friendly and attentive. I went to Rainbow Garden for lunch not expecting the upscale atmosphere; it is definitely better suited for dinner with a date or group. I would highly recommend it to lovers of Americanized Chinese food and great dining."}
{"text":"Overall it was just OK.  I got the BBQ Pork, pan fried pork dumplings, and crab rangoon.  The BBQ pork was just fried pork (all in all good) but there was no sauce and is not what anyone would expect from BBQ pork.  The dumplings filling was good, not the best I have every had but good, but the covering was way too thick for them to be really good.  The rangoon was nice a crispy but there was so little flavoring that I am not even sure that there was any filling at all.  For what you get the price is way too high.  Not bad food but for the price it was not worth it."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to try this restaurant, as I had heard great reviews.  I did not have similar results.  I expected more food considering the price I paid.  I ordered the empress chicken with fried rice and a side of egg rolls.  The chicken was fragile with lots of batter.  It only included broccoli and carrots as vegetables, even though I asked for water chestnuts to be added.  The sauce was sweet, but scarce.  At least, the fried rice was spot on.  The egg rolls were small and rather bland, I would not order them again."}
{"text":"Rainbow Garden is solid and authentic. It's a quieter, cleaner, and slightly classier alternative to the Chinese restaurants on Green Street. You can tell that they care about presentation with regards to their dishes.   Their menu is pretty unique and the house specials are delicious. I like Rainbow Garden's fried tofu, sole fillet, deep fried pork, salt & pepper squid, seafood bird's nest, and pan fried noodles. I'm also a fan of their Korean Chinese fusion foods, something that's pretty common in the Chicago area.   Overall, it's great to escape from the hustle and bustle of inner campus once in a while and enjoy a scrumptious meal at Rainbow Garden."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good but the beef in the Mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture. I know this is always a 50/50 chance when trying a new Chinese restaurant. The rest of the food was very good! Their noodles are really good and the fried rice."}
{"text":"The white sauce is gluten-free, and there are plenty of vegan/vegetarian options.  That being said, the food here is just alright. My husband and I came here on our wedding anniversary, mostly because Golden Harbor up the street was closed. Our server was very nice and helpful, and the decor was clean and well done, so our dining experience was pleasant. It was the actual food that just wasn't so great.  1. Buddha's Delight: the brown sauce didn't taste brown. It looked brown, but it was flavorless. I ended up soaking the entire dish in soy sauce just so I could taste something. The tofu was cooked just fine, and the rainbow array of vegetables were perfectly tender. Buddha was no doubt delighted by the veggies in this dish, but certainly formed no attachment to the sauce.  2. General Tso Tofu: the sauce was nice and thick; it stuck to the tofu well. But again I found myself longing for flavor. I wanted it to be sweeter and way more bold. There were green peppers and onions in this dish in addition to the tofu. I liked that.  3. Spring Rolls (veg): good size appetizer for the price. $1.45 per roll. But yet again I found myself disappointed by the overall taste. The inside of the roll was mushy, and tasted like mush too. Maybe add some pepper? That might help, but I think the ingredients are just generally over-cooked and bland to begin with. The exterior was nice and crispy though.  The sauce on the table, that is supposedly sweet and sour sauce, tastes like wax. Our server noticed that I didn't like it and kindly offered to get the warm sweet and sour sauce for me. It was marginally better, with a deeper red color and more sweetness to it. I just feel like this place needs to use more vinegar in the things that require vinegar, more sugar in the things that require sugar, more pepper in the things that require pepper, etc... stop skimping on the spices!"}
{"text":"i was in town visiting some friends and we had some take out from rainbow garden.  the only thing that i am certain of is that this place has the most def tastiest (if that's a word) crab rangoon. it's crispy and chewy and filled with yummy cheese.  next time i'm in town i will be sure to stop in and eat eat eat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here the other day for the first time. Over all real good, wait. service could not be better. The menu typical chinese fair. The food was very good, the stand out for me was the fried rice. Everything was fresh and hot.I will be going back to get more information,and update this review"}
{"text":"I saw that Rainbow Garden offered Korean-Chinese food so I thought I would give them a shot.  I ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout.    Prices were comparable to what I would pay back home near Chicago.  The portions were pretty decent as well.  Taste-wise the jajangmyeon was good, but not as good as back home.  There were lots of pieces of seafood and meat in the sauce, although it was a bit greasy.  Another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in, they seemed to omit this with my takeout order.  Not a deal breaker or anything, but little details like this which would gain them another star.  The tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy.  The sauce was a great balance of sweet and sour and overall it was a solid dish.  I'll be coming back to Rainbow Garden in the future when I'm craving Korean-Chinese food."}
{"text":"We had originally planned on eating at Golden Harbor even though we weren't exactly satisfied with our food our first trip there.  They were packed, and lucky for me, my husband agreed to try this place rather than a Chinese Buffet (blech!).  We soooo over ordered.  We started with Sechuan Wontons which were tasty and inexpensive.  I ordered Basil Chicken, labeled spicy, and loved it although there was no heat.  My husband ordered General Shrimp which was the best General anything Chinese I've had.  He also had Beef Lo Mein that was pretty tasty.  The prices seem high, but when you see the portions, they are quite fair.  We have at least two meals each to take home with us.  I'm very pleased with the friendly service and the fact that $42.66 bought us 6 meals total.  So good!"}
{"text":"Went with daughter to try out their Korean/Chinese offerings.  Had champong and cha jang mein.  Both below the offerings found in Chicagoland (Lawrence joints, Chef Ping and Yu's).  Was good attempt, but not fully there.  For one the noodles appear to be packaged and we're too chewy.  Champ pong was also more oily and the seafood tasted like it was packaged and way too chewy like the noodles.  This rating is based purely on those two items from Urbana location."}
{"text":"This place is reasonable. I just like to get take out if I happen to be in the area and need a bite to eat. I like the Cashew Beef. The food is nothing special, but it's good and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The food is decent but the second time I went I got food poisoning... what else is there to say."}
{"text":"I have been in to eat once, and ordered delivery a few times (once from Rainbow Garden directly, and most times through eatcu.com. On that note, I cannot say that I have encountered any problems with ordering through eatcu.com, other than the last time my credit card number did not show up for them for some reason, and the person from RG had to take it over the phone).  The time I went to eat there with a friend, I had a lunch portion of beef and broccoli. Not surprisingly, it wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever tasted, but it certainly wasn't bad. And, that is kind of what one deserves for ordering such an item anyway. Since then, my husband and I tend to order the pan fried noodles with chicken (you can ask them to hold the sauce if you prefer your noodles crunchier), steamed vegetables with chicken, steamed vegetables with shrimp, and perhaps moo shu vegetables once or twice.  All in all, I am always quite satisfied with my food! One star withheld because they often do not read or follow special note requests."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and Americanized. Delivery took (as advertised) 45 minutes. The food was warm on arrival but the spring roll nested inside the lunch special box had become a sad, soft bastardization of what it could have been. Egg drop soup was too greasy to eat. The spicy beef was also greasy and not very spicy. Fried rice was, you guessed it, greasy. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"How can someone rate this place with anything other than 1 star unless they are rating the atmosphere rather than their food, or they don't know how to cook, or rather have not ate at a better Chinese restaurant. Their food is soggy, vegetables over cooked, their sauce has no taste, chicken taste like dumplings. Terrible. Better go and buy from carry out and pay 60% less for your food than eating from this place."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise in Urbana Champaign! My fiance and I were visiting his dad who lives in Urbana Champaign and we came to Rainbow Garden to eat dinner. I didn't have much of an appetite when we came into the restaurant but that quickly changed once the food came out.   I ordered the jajang myun, which is the black bean noodles. It came with a loads of seafood, beef, and vegetables. We also got the sweet fried beef, which was also very tasty. I was very pleased with those dishes, especially my black bean noodles.   The portions are generous and the food is tasty. Next time we're in Urbana Champaign, I definitely will be back for the black bean noodles or maybe change things up and try something new!"}
{"text":"I was torn on 3 stars vs. 4 stars but went with 4, because the dine-in experience can be lovely.   I didn't realize how hit or miss the food was, however. I have had their lunch combos delivered and eaten there and gotten a generous portion for a reasonable price.   I called in a dinner order for pickup last night and went with the sesame chicken, thinking it would be similar to other chicken dishes but less spicy and with sesame seeds. For one entree and two spring rolls, I paid almost $16.   I got home and the sesame chicken was cut into flattened strips with more sesame seeds on it than there was chicken. It was extremely syrupy and chewy, like calamari. It was inedible and after two bites, I threw it away. The spring rolls were flavorful and hot, no complaints.   Too pricey for dinner and inconsistent but they have some good dishes."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the man taking my order got really exasperated with me because I had to keep changing my order-I was ordering delivery for a group of people and the restaurant did not have a dish that they wanted.  Not great on customer service but food is ok"}
{"text":"I've ordered food for take out and I've dined in here multiple times, the food has never disappointed. The serving sizes are great and the prices are average. The servers are nice and efficient. Their hot n sour soup is the best I've ever had so would highly recommend it! The interior gives it a good chinese restaurant feel. If you're on the hunt for good chinese food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried so far (Shrimp w/Garlic Sauce, Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Empress Chicken, Beef w/Chicken and Vegetables, and Veggie Fried Rice) has been delicious, except for the Buddha's Delight, which was...meh (I'm not a squishy-tofu fan--ya gotta firm that shit up!).    1 point was deducted for the fact that EatCU.com says you can order from them online, but Rainbow Garden says you cannot.  ....?!  So, don't try that--you'll probably never get your food.  The delivery of the food was also kind of ridiculous (that is, the delivery guy told me to come meet him on the street instead of coming up to where I'm located, and when I did, I found out he'd come upstairs instead), and one of the dishes was missing.    In sum: Sketchy service, but it's made up for by the tasty, tasty food."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has the same owners as the restaurant already located on South Neil in Champaign with the same name."}
{"text":"I have dined here 3-4 times now, the decor is so nice but each time my experience has been average to awful. The first time or two I went, I was hoping it was just a \"bad day\" for them.  But its official now, they really don't want me there. The waitstaff seems to feel customers are an inconvenience. Honestly, you can get average-tasting Chinese food anywhere, why go somewhere that oozes disdain at your mere presence?"}
{"text":"I ate it because I was hungry.  I got the spicy eggplant in black bean sauce and mixed vegetables with noodles.  There was hardly any flavor.  In the eggplant dish, they used Japanese eggplant, which is usually really yummy but the way it was cooked here, ti was mushy and just looked gross.  Like really gross.   The other dish had no flavor really.  I am not sure what it was missing (well...flavor) but it was just not that good.  The crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy.  I dont know. The rest of the dishes that people got looked okay--no one was really raving about how good the food was.  It was reasonably priced.  Like I said, I was hungry.  Hungry enough for it again when I am in Champaign? Probably not."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in CU.  Inexpensive/plentiful lunch options and relatively quick delivery time make this an excellent choice.  I typically stick the chicken dishes, but the Mooshu (sp?) plates are amazing.  Once my girlfriend and I went to RG for dinner, and about 20 minutes after ordering the waiter came out and apologized for the delay.  The kitchen had lost our order.  To apologize, the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree.  On top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal.  RG really cares about its customers."}
{"text":"Ordered here after reading some good reviews.  Ordered for delivery, but delivery came after 2 hours.  Chinese food was pretty good, but I prefer Cravings.  Was super greasy and was completely filled up after half my dish (some beef stir fry with rice), and the Crab Rangoons were awful."}
{"text":"I've been to Rainbow Garden for lunch several times. Each time I've left full and happy. They offer a very affordable lunch menu. Their portions aren't giant sized either, so I don't have to worry about taking home a smelly box of Chinese food.   The staff can be a bit aloof at times, but they're usually really busy around the lunch hour. The atmosphere has gotten better over time as they've opened up more of the floor plan and made it more accommodating for the larger crowds that come around the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Nuts and bolts: My boyfriend was in the mood for some hot and sour soup so I searched online for options in the city that served it.  We went for a quick lunch.  Order: Hot and sour soup (for the boyfriend), crab rangoons (for me), garlic chicken (to share).  Pros: Good portion size.  Hot and sour soup and crab rangoons were pretty good.  Cons: We didn't enjoy the garlic chicken too much. We actually brought it home thinking that we would possibly eat it later. We ended up tossing it. Didn't compare at all to what we can get a home.  Take home: I'll be trying out a new Chinese place next time."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them a few times before but today was different. I waited almost an hour and a half for my food. When I got it they forgot to give me utensils and white rice. When I called them to ask about it I was given a rude response and basically told that they can't do anything about it. The food is ok but the service is TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend got a take out here. We got the Orange Beef and the dumplings, it used to be okay, but this was HORRIBLE, and I mean it was just the grosses thing ever. We both have stomachaches now. Will not go back here ever again."}
{"text":"Again, caveat lector, I don't like Chinese food very much or very often. After my last excursion for Chinese, I've become a brand loyalist to Golden Harbor Unfortunately for me, G.H. was packed like sardines tonight.  Thus, it was Rainbow Garden, and perhaps we should chalk it up to my perpetually low expectations for Chinese, but I actually enjoyed this place. It's fairly reasonably priced, the decor is nice (i.e. not a whole in the wall) and unlike G.H., it's more of a traditional restaurant service experience.   Where Rainbow Garden is scoring most of its points is that, as some of the other reviews have noted, the service was fantastic. By that I mean, we had food within 10 minutes of ordering it and glasses that never really got empty.  The food was good, I suppose. I liked it enough. I'd come back. I wish they gave me some more rice though. I like a lot of rice."}
{"text":"Large portions, and a very tentative staff.  Food was good, and we will come back soon."}
{"text":"I'm with a another reviewer.  This place has great Chinese food.  If I lived in the area I would eat here more often.  In fact this place has become the Chinese food I compare all others to now.  Everything I have ordered has been delish.  I especially enjoyed their Moo Shoo Veggie dish.  Yum.    They have very reasonable lunch specials.  Their take out is quick and hot!  The last time I ate there for lunch the servers were a bit \"off\", but I can see beyond that because the food is so good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions but today was a bad one. I'm not sure if I'll be back. I know this can happen at any restaurant but I found a hair in my fried rice. She was very apologetic and didn't charge me for the meal. Only the drink. It's very difficult for me to give a restaurant a second chance after something like this. As a youth, I worked at Formosa Gardens as a dishwasher in Lebanon Indiana. I saw a lot of things go on while I was there. It took years for me to eat at a Chinese restaurant again. This just brings all those memories back. As any place that serves food, you never know what goes on in preparation."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place in the past. However, I enjoyed my first dining experience couple days ago.   I am surprised to enter a clean and quiet place. Rainbow Garden had a nice oriental ambiance. I'm not referring to the tacky and excess Asian imageries on many walls of Asian restaurants in general. The interior space had a beautiful red wall with red/black elements and simple oriental decor complementing the space. You don't see many places like that at Asian restaurants.   Enough with the wall color and such....  The lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $5-$6. It consist of the type of meat/veg, your choice of fried or white rice, 1 egg roll, and your choice of sweet/sour soup or egg drop soup. The lunch portion is very nice and I think $5-$6 for lunch is very reasonable. However, their regular entrees after lunch might be a little pricey for a hungry, poor college kid.    My boyfriend and I have grown to have bigger appetite over the month. We shared a Mongolian lunch special with two jja jang myuns (black bean noodle with shrimp, meat, and assorted veggies) which was a little too much. The jja jang myun was very tasty and I would recommend people to try it, and they serve you pickled yellow raddish on the side. More importantly, I would highly recommend people to stop ordering delivery for once, get off their lazy butts, get out, and experience their dining service for once. :)  Don't get me wrong, their delivery service is fast and good also."}
{"text":"Great place for take out! The food is solid and you can't really go wrong. The fried rice is really good, the chicken is pretty good too. The orange chicken genuinely tasted citrus-y so points for that! Coming from Miami, a lot of the Chinese food joints are either inexplicable expensive or too bland. Rainbow Garden is a decent takeout experience. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sad to see that so many people had a negative experience at Rainbow Garden because I liked this place!  My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a weekday and the place was basically empty (maybe that's why we had a more positive experience?). We ended up ordering the Seafood Noodle Soup and the Pork with Garlic Sauce. We order the same pork dish at every Chinese restaurant to taste and compare. Rainbow Garden's was pretty good! The flavor was there and the portions were reasonable. Not the best in town but not the worst. The star of our dinner was the noodle soup. My boyfriend liked it so much he drank all the broth!   All in all, I liked Rainbow Garden! If you have a car, it's worth the trip off campus to enjoy a peaceful and tasty Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"So we have always enjoyed Rainbow Garden but with each visit it seemed to get worse. Today was the lowest of lows . I think we were the first ones in there this time and the food came out cold. They weren't quick to change that. But after some persistence they brought out fresh.  I think Golden Harbor is more worth the money."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese in Champaign and Urbana. Their Generals Chicken is the freshest most flavorful I've ever had. I also really like the spicy sole filet- the fish is extremely flavorful(not fishy) and tender. Really good egg drop and won ton soup. Love Rainbow Garden"}
{"text":"I like the place for the atmosphere and of course the food. I always order sizzler beef which it's good. They use different shapes of boxes for different dish for delivery which makes sure you have a larger container for soup."}
{"text":"Firstly, the young man answering the phone was very rude. He kept shouting at me and was very impatient. I wanted to give the restaurant a chance though so I ordered hot and sour seafood soup. It was hot but tasted old and poor quality. I had a few bites and couldn't eat anymore. Really disgusting.  I really wanted to like this place :/"}
{"text":"Love their food and was a regular but I had to stop eating there because the food is soooooooo oily. I asked them several time to cook my food with the least amount of oil but that didn't work! If you don't mind the oil dripping from your food, then this is a great place, nice relaxed atmosphere, owner operated and very nice. They also deliver with min order of 10 or 20 depending on location."}
{"text":"This isn't really my thing, I've never left a review on any restaurant, ever, good or bad, but I felt like my experience warranted a review. I've been a dine-in customer once before, and the food was pretty good. Service was great. However, last night I ordered delivery and it was overall pretty unsatisfactory. The food took forever, much longer than the estimated time. As a result, the food was very cold. Could have been the fault of the GrubHub driver, though, I'm not sure. The General's chicken was mushy. The texture was so awful I could barely eat it (and I'm not a picky eater, I eat bad Taco Bell and McDonalds all the time). The sauce was tasty, though. I ordered vegetable stir fry noodles, but instead received pan fried noodles, which I really dislike. At that point, I didn't try to fix the order because it had taken so long and I just wanted to be done with the experience. I also ordered an egg roll, which was pitifully small, mushy, and tasteless. I won't be ordering delivery or takeout from this restaurant again, but the food for dine-in is enjoyable."}
{"text":"A good Chinese restaurant in Champaign. Went there about five times. But I am pretty sure it's not the most orthodox Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"As many other reviewers have already mentioned, this restaurant is operated by the same owners who manage the Rainbow Garden on Neil Street.  While the Neil Street location was fairly classy on the inside, this new venue is even more elegant and refined.  The servers wear starched white dress shirts and the furniture is made of heavy, dark wood.  I would definitely recommend it for serious business lunches during the day and romantic dates in the evening.  There is also a bar area that is probably supposed to serve as a cocktail lounge (with a TV), but I'm having a hard time imagining people coming to this place just for drinks.  If you're looking for something fairly exotic or \"authentic,\" this would likely not be your place.  No baby squid or duck tongue on the menu.  Instead, you'll find the standard Americanized fare: sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice, and egg rolls.  To compare the food to your average greasy take-out place is not a fair characterization, however.  All of the dishes are cooked with what tastes like better-quality ingredients.  Vegetables are cut and prepared artfully.  The sauces are a bit more nuanced in their flavor.  The skill in preparation and presentation is also reflected in their prices, as you can expect to pay around $8+ for most dishes (the upper range is around $15 for seafood).    For vegetarians, I would recommend the eggplant in garlic sauce.  The sauce is slightly spicy, slightly sweet and delicious by itself with some steamed rice.  The chicken and green beans is simple and tasty, the vegetables still slightly crisp.  It's also covered in garlic--yum!  All of the pork dishes are made with Chinese barbecue pork, which is a combination of sweet and smoky, and usually somewhat chewy.    Like the old location, the new Rainbow Garden offers lunch specials that are served until 2:30.  I still argue that this is the best lunch special in town, with each meal costing around $6 to $8.  The specials come with rice, soup, and an egg roll.  As with dinner, the quality of the food is above average compared to takeout places.  No slimy sauces and wilted vegetables.  To summarize, this restaurant is for people who love Chinese food for its salty, sweet, and sticky sauces, but also want to eat this food in a more refined setting."}
{"text":"During weekdays, I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn't fast food.  For around $5 to $6, you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree, rice, soup, and an eggroll.  My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans, barbecue pork and snow peas, and cashew shrimp.  Some dishes I've tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily (the Szechuan vegetables come to mind), but I've enjoyed most of the dishes I've ordered.  Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign-Urbana area, I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date.  The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy, but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere, with white tablecloths and dark red walls.  By American standards, the wait staff might seem rude at times, but their \"cold\" disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture.  A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders.  However, I have previously asked the owners about special items, and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests.    Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year, though from what I've heard, they might not be repeating this menu in the future (still, I think it's worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties)."}
{"text":"Good environment. A more classy Chinese food place. mORE Expensive but better service. Has authentic stuff and americanized stuff like orange chicken too.."}
{"text":"We order from here on a regular basis.  There are not many places that will deliver to W. Champaign, but that has never been an issue for Rainbow Garden.  I first started ordering delivery from them 13 years ago when I first moved to town and lived in a different location.   Sometimes we have the same delivery guy I had back then, and he remembers us too.  My wife's favorite appetizer is the Pot Stickers, but the other appetizers are pretty standard fare.  We always order the General's Chicken and Barbecued Pork Fried Rice.   I have recently been ordering the Singapore Style Rice Noodles, and they have been very good.  We've tried many of their dishes and all of them have been pretty good.  I'm a big fan of their hot-&-sour soup, over other similar places in the area.   Delivery is always very quick.  I've also eaten in the restaurant for lunch a few times over the years, and that is also a pleasant experience.  This is our \"go-to\" place for Chinese delivery (partially for lack of many other options)."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 5PM.  I was the only one in the restaurant, and there was only one hostess that had to juggle answering the phone, serving me, and helping people picking up take out orders.  It went smooth enough though, and my order came fast, within minutes. I ordered the chicken with green beans, one of my favorite Chinese dishes back home.  Unfortunately... it's hard to believe I'm saying this, but the dish was completely tasteless . In fact, the only thing I could taste was the oil, and oil does not taste too good...   The dish just seemed to be poorly cut chicken and old green beans tossed in some cooking oil and stir fried.  There was a little soy sauce, but it did nothing to add to the flavor, and only added to the color.  All and all, the place is nice inside, and for only one waiter, the service was good.  Unfortunately, the food was extremely bland, and I will not be going here again. I probably could have done better at home."}
{"text":"There are way to many Chinese and Tex-Mex places in the twin cities that are just mediocre or worse.  This place however always hits the spot for me.  The dinning area is not that big, and the tables are kind of close together.  Though I think the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming.  Everything here is very clean as well.  Quick service that is very friendly.  A large menu, and all is very well made and prepared.  Fresh and tasty food.  Lots of lunch and dinner specials as well.  I always love the dumplings (how can anybody not love them).  The different types of pork, chicken, and beef are all excellent.  From sweet n sour to BBQ or stir fry.  A small beer and wine menu.  I think the newer location in Urbana has a full bar, but here it is pretty bare bones.  Though the Gekkeikan Plum Wine is amazing.    I am not usually a huge fan of Chinese restaurants, but this is a great place cause everything is true to form, fresh, and well made.  In the States anyway, especially small college towns, there are to many crappy Chinese places that would make the health department go crazy.  If all were of this quality, I would go for Chinese more often."}
{"text":"The food is good and is reasonably priced.  I DO wish they had a good shrimp egg roll (but they don't), or some Chinese donuts to order for dessert.  (They don't have that, either.)    However, it is a good, family friendly place to eat a good meal, and the staff are wonderful!  If you haven't tried it -- you should!"}
{"text":"So like most Chinese sit down restaurants, all orders are generally meant to be shared so bring a friend. The entrees are relatively expensive and each of them can be shared by two people since they don't give you too much food. I thought that the fried rice was good, but the only reason it was good was due to the portentous amount of soy sauce that was blanketed over it.   I also found it odd that employees were in the restaurant working on their establishment's balance sheets as well as folding napkins. Water is on my top 5 of favorite beverages and I have to say that the water here was absolutely filthy.   Perhaps the worst aspect I experienced here was the server only speaking in Chinese despite knowing that there were English-speaking people at the table. He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it."}
{"text":"Order delivery through eatstreet.com. The delivery speed is pretty fast, around 25 minutes. I ordered Wonton Soup, Seafood Corn Soup, and Noodles with Vegetables for a friend of mine who was in serious sickness. She's pretty happy with both the quality and the quantity of the food. The Wonton, according to her, was specially delicious."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Champaign, but not as great as in the suburbs of Chicago.  I order the vegetable fried rice, vegetable spring roll, and the vegetable soup.  The service is quick and the food is consistent.  I wish they did not have a minimum delivery charge...it is difficult for one person to order $10 worth of food."}
{"text":"We love Rainbow Garden! The food is a bit high-priced but it is worth it. We usually order for delivery and it's always quick and less than the time they tell you. The food isn't greasy at all and the flavor is excellent.  Worth a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"A very cozy Chinese place with a warm and comfortable atmosphere.   I had the spicy chicken with basil, which was very good.  It was the first time that I have ever had basil on a dish that was not Italian, which turned out to be a wonderful experience.  I was expecting a bit more vegetables with the dish, but it was still awesome.   I also had the crab ragoons since others had mentioned them, and yes they were very good.  I was a bit apprehensive about getting 6 per order.  However, they are a bit smaller than you average place, so it worked out well. Many mentioned the portions were large here.  Well I guess I'm a big eater, because I found the portions to be just right. I'm giving this place 5 stars.  The only down side is that I don't get to Champaign often enough.  But if I do, I will stop by again for sure."}
{"text":"Food was edible but nothing to rave about. \"Ants climbing tree\" was drenched in sauce making it more soup like than an entree."}
{"text":"My wife and I both love Chinese food, and we have to agree this may be the finest Asian cuisine we've eaten in Champaign-Urbana. We went on a Saturday night with a large group and had a phenomenal dining experience - so much so, we returned as a couple the following Thursday.   What a horrible disappointment! The food remained superior, but the fine service we enjoyed in the group was nonexistent. We were seated in a booth along the wall farthest from the kitchen, the only diners in that section (as a mixed couple, we're sensitive to such things), and it was as if the server forgot we existed.   I had to ask three times before I could get a drink from the bar; when I finally got to order and pointed to the cocktail on their drink menu, his immediate response was, \"I don't think we have that.\" To our server Brian's credit, he didn't fling our entrees on the table; however, he served our dishes so quickly that we could barely slow him down before he vanished again. At one point I actually yelled \"STOP!\" at him so I could ask for chopsticks. Correct or not, we got the distinct impression they didn't want to serve us.   Perhaps we arrived too late (about 7:50) to receive their peak attention span (we couldn't find their hours of operation in the restaurant or online), but at one point we were the LAST DINERS in the building and my wife STILL had to walk to the kitchen and hunt down our waiter to get our check. I hate having a love-hate affair with a restaurant, but Rainbow Garden has left me no choice. Maybe the moral is, only go there with a large group. For now I have to decide if the quality of the food is worth the insulting, outrageously bad service."}
{"text":"There comes a day in your life when you crave for Chinese food, well it comes in my life once in a while. Thought of trying some new restaurant, and chose rainbow garden. Had passed by it many times while traveling. I ordered veg stir fried rice noodles and shrimp garlic sau to go. I was so hungry that I immediately sat down to eat after reaching home. Took few bites from both the dishes and only one thing I could taste.. OIL. It was like oil stir fried rice noodles and shrimp oil sau. I couldn't eat more than few bites. My throat was coated with oil. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"The food quality is ok. Kinda pricey though. The price is never a problem for me to be honest.  The biggest problem is their SERVICE. The staff there are rude and impolite. They constantly asked for better tips (15% seemed a bit low to them?) and complained about trivial things. I will never go to this place anymore."}
{"text":"Superb. Great staff, great food, and large servings."}
{"text":"Of the many Chinese spots in CU, Rainbow Garden is definitely one of the nicer places for a good dine-in experience since it's decorated better than most and the staff is on point. The food is also pretty good and the portions are on the larger side. To this day, if I ever get a cold, I get a craving for their egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"This is really a great addition to the Champaign / Urbana area. While the cooking is not as great as Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, the dishes here are still prepared well with fresh ingredients. The best thing about the restaurant is that it is really the nicest Chinese restaurant around with Tang Dynasty also being comparable.  The first thing that will stand out to anyone is the decor. It is comfortable, traditional, and hip at the same time. Next, the silverware is for fine dining and everything from the plates to the cups and teapot all bear the restaurant name. This is pretty unique for Chinese restaurants and gives the restaurant a bit of an upscale feeling. The service is also pretty good and we were able to order in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese all in the same meal.  As for the food, they cooked common dishes like General Chicken and Sole Fillet with Chinese Greens well. Since a lot of restaurants around Champaign are in Mandarin or Szechuan style, it was nice to enjoy some dishes prepared Cantonese style. The noodles soups were light and enjoyable as well. The rice was a bit fluffier and most than most other local restaurants, suggesting that it wasn't prepared in enormous quantities.  The prices were pretty good so I'm sure I'll return again soon."}
