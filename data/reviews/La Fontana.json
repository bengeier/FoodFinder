{"text":"My family and I found the service lacking. It took over OVER 45 minutes for us to receive our food. Not ideal being that we had children at our table. Please note, we were sharing the whole restaurant with only 2 other tables. I'm not quite sure why it took so long to get our food!! When we finally received our food, each dish came out in increments. One of the kids' pizzas came out and it was at least another 15 minutes until all of the other entrees came out. Slow customer service was painful!! Our pasta was mushy and over cooked. We found that most of the entrees we ordered needed seasoning and were quite tasteless. Sadly would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner Saturday night.  From the bruschetta to the entrees, everything was wonderful.  The icing on the cake is their BYOB policy with a $5 corkage fee.
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat , food it's great  Very family oriented and they got a bar so much happy after dinning here"}
{"text":"I had the lasagna and my wife had the veal parm. Excellent!  Don't pass up this local mom n pop restaurant.  If you are in the mood for Italian you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I was looking for homemade pasta and found this secret. Best pasta I have had in the valley. I will go back often!!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely excellent. This is a true Italian restaurant with a great European feel. Wasn't the fastest service but they just opened. 
The owners/staff are friendly and welcoming. 

Just go, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing. After dining with 6 people who all ordered different things off the menu I was impressed every dish was perfect!  Each of the six people I came to lunch with had food envy as we looked at each dish. The next time I came back the waiter remembered me and I was greeted with a smile. Real Italian food, remarkable service and the comfortable atmosphere will keep me coming for more!! I love this place! Check it out"}
{"text":"It has been a long while since I have written a review.  I can't think of a better way to get back in the game than to give a glowing recommendation for this awesome little Italian restaurant.  We had driven by many times since the opening, and as previous yelpers have stated, it doesn't show very well from the street.  Still, I was intrigued by the stellar reviews so we had to give it a try.  So glad we did, this is some of the best Italian ever!   I had the Chicken Marsala.  It was not only the best Marsala I've ever eaten, it may have been the best chicken dish I have ever had period.  GF had the shrimp scampi, very well done also.  The chefs choice of side pasta was right on point and surprised me with the quality of the perfect al dente home made pasta.  Friendly attentive  service, great ambiance and the price is very reasonable.  It will not be long before this place is packed on a nightly basis so get in while you still can, I know we will."}
{"text":"I sat on their 2nd floor terrace yesterday afternoon (half sun, half shade, some smokers) eating a special type of banana split made with three scoops of different flavoured homemade gelato ice cream, topped with fresh blueberries, fresh strawberries, and sliced bananas. Very good! Price: $12 + taxes + tips.  Out of pocket $17. I didn't give a perfect score because of the price and that the waitress automatically took a $1.20 tip for herself when I paid at the cashier station. I chose to give a $2 tip to the host who greeted me at the door & served me my banana split and glass of water."}
{"text":"Real ITALIAN !!  Loved everything.  Waiting for liquor so BYOB. But worth it"}
{"text":"This restaurant is authentic Italian cuisine.  The owner Marco cooks all of the food fresh and it is very delicious.  The fried calamari is so tasty.  The penne  Alla putanesca and the chicken pollo parmigiana is to die for.  Enjoy with some wine.  Be sure to have some cannolis and enjoy a glass of sambuca at the end. I can't say enough.  This place has delicious authentic Italian food.  If you are ever in Scottsdale stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"First I am going  to start off by saying that we were told by the Reese the owner that if we didnt like the food for whatever reason we didn't have  to pay and with that being said we paid!
The food was delish and the service impeccable. .the young  man that waited on us continually checked on us making sure we had all and what we needed he was the only one waiting tables and there  other people in there, not to crazy but we never felt neglected....
It's nice to  have a beautiful restraunt  that's cozy and very very homey in the neighborhood we will definately be back! 
And what a bonus the are serving breakfast now.
L.M."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for them just to bring the bread to the table, got no service from the waitresses. The food took 1h45 minutes to arrive and was cold."}
{"text":"Waited 1:30 hours to get to the main dish.  Service was erratic at best.  The food was OK (dried due to the lack of service and probably standing under the hot lights for a while) and the ambience was noisy. 

Server used the same cloth to clean 30 table without ever cleaning it, the place is dirty, the service is a touch and go.  The prices are well overprice, most gelato have a crust on them and they still serve it the way it is.  

Overall a 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Fantastic fresh food. Great prices. Friendly staff. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Best lasagna in town!! Ask for the dipping oil with the bread, the evoo is so light and flavorful. We are definitely going back to try the lunch."}
{"text":"The food is bad. It is cafeteria quality.

I'm trying to get to the point sooner in my reviews. This is an extremely bad restaurant with low quality food.

We were there on a weekend, waited about ten minutes just to get water, food took maybe 40 minutes from time of ordering.

The pizza was junk. Reviewer Trisha M. said exactly was I thinking: Peter Piper. Since this is billed as a Trattoria-Pizzeria, you would think their pizza would be good, maybe even awesome, along the lines of Humble Pie, Cibo, Bianco, Piazza al Forno, etc. It's not in the same universe as those places. It's not even at the level of Crust or Sauce. It falls short of Papa John's. This was cafeteria pizza, Peter Piper with too much cheese, the lowest quality and most tasteless ingredients you'll see in an American dining setting.

The bread they brought to the table was also cheap and tasteless, again, cafeteria quality. They don't even provide actual butter. Instead, they give these cheap packets of fake butter like we're in the Army or something. Bruschetta was also bad, using cheap bread, probably the same bread, and flavorless, unripe tomatoes.

You'll get much higher quality bread and bruschetta from Carrabba's or Romano's Macaroni Grill. Those are actually pretty good restaurants in retrospect, much more serious than La Fontana. This is a very confusing place, vastly overpriced for about the worst food you'll find anywhere."}
{"text":"Chose to visit La Fontana based on Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed!  Started with the Calamari -'lightly breaded and served with freshly made marinara - wow!  My family enjoyed chicken parm, lasagna, and the chicken piccata.  All of the dishes were so fresh and delicious.

We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"What a joke. We went in for takeout and to have a glass of wine while waiting. We were the only ones there. The guy skyping at the bar while watching law and order turned out to be the \"chef.\" Wine was drug store grade. After $35 total for 2 glasses of crappy wine and 1 takeout order of \"Pollo Cello Chef\", including $5 tip, I got home to find a tiny piece of chicken and some pasta that tasted like a microwaved grocery store meal, only a smaller portion. I called to see if there was a mistake but the lady who answered said that's what we ordered. Price of that tiny average meal was 14.95. We almost ordered Oregano's but thought, no, let's get some authentic Italian. Oreganos blows that dump out of the water. Hopefully when it goes out of business someone will put in a good Mexican joint. I've been to some mom and pop Italian places that serve good food, this is not one. Sucked"}
{"text":"A new favorite for sure. So glad it is so convenient to where I live.

THE PLACE: Quaint and adorable, definitely a trattoria. Has a fountain outside facing Thomas Road, where they also have some outdoor seating. I'm sure it is quite lovely in the evening and for a little date night.  Inside is nice and cozy.  Heard how it gets packed so my hubby and I went there on a  Friday at 5:30 pm for an impromptu date afternoon.  By 6:30 a large group of folks have arrived for their reservation. At least 10 folks.  So the place can accommodate small groups. Plenty of parking surrounding the place.

THE SERVICE: Family-owned. The Italian gentleman (shocked to find out he was 74. So wish I would look as good as he does when I get to that age), was warm and welcoming. He actually lives on the 2nd floor of the place. We knew our way around the menu as we have previously ordered to go, but he was so helpful in answering any question we may have. From the serious to the silly; like who is that guy on the wall? Photos of the chef are everywhere, clearly he has had extensive experience in the culinary art and serving celebrities and the famous.

THE FOOD: 3 visits in 1 week.  Yes, shameful but that means it was good. Love the Capellini Alla Checca, Gnocchi was to die for in my opinion (and I'm picky about it; even had an italian make it for me before, and I found it to be so so). Pizza's were really good too, but I recommend eating it there. It's good to go, but not as good when eaten super fresh.

This is a definite favorite."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, though not open on Sundays. I have lived nearby for a year now and try to come in once a month for either take-out or dine-in. Very quiet and cozy on weeknights. This is a true Italian restaurant, as I can hardly pronounce half the menu. I've never had a bad meal. My standing favorite item is still the pizza capricciosa."}
{"text":"What is there to say about the new Italian restaurant, La Fontana, in Scottsdale? Both the waiter and the chef are Italian. That is supposed to be enough, right? We started off with some very tasty calamari and a caprese salad. The portions of pasta are very abundant and everything is so fresh and light.  You don't have that heavy feeling after your meal. You may bring your own alcoholic beverages since they have yet to get a liquor license.  We ate on a cute patio in the back that is really nice and cozy with a fountain that makes the meal very relaxing. My wife and I went with another couple and they were astonished by all the royal treatment the staff gave to us.  It's that personal touch that really tops it off.  At the end of the meal were free cannolis and tiramisu. What more could you ask for? Alberto."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting Italian food.  I've eaten there 3 times and have enjoyed everything I've tried.  The sauce was great, but different.  My girlfriend couldn't quite put her finger on it so we asked Marco, the owner and chef.  Marco said it's homemade from tomatoes and olive oil.  Not from a can, no tomato paste, no sugar and definitely doesn't taste like chain restaurant sauce."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high ratings for this place. The ambiance is cute and cozy but where do I begin. The place was empty except for another table and a staff member sitting at a table with his apron on and doing paperwork and being on a tablet. After we were served, we see our chef go out and sit on the patio drinking a beer. The meatballs were rubbery and gray and you could barely cut into it with a fork...obviously not fresh, probably microwaved. My pasta with clams had a funny flavor; I was a little worried that they were not entirely fresh. There was way too much pasta on the plate and it was dry, gummy, overcooked and lacking salt, which is unbelievable since clam sauce is usually very briny and buttery. The old guy as our server was cute and nice and all, but he works way too slow and would be totally overburdened if there were more than 2 full tables at this restaurant. Also, you can look into their kitchen as there is a window in front and you will notice no fresh produce in sight or fresh pasta being made anywhere, only cans and a big plastic vat of sauce. The yelpers that gave this place 5 stars probably have never had good Italian, much less have been to Italy to know what really excellent Italian food tastes like."}
{"text":"OMG..... For $12, the amount of food you get is WAY beyond my expectations.  What's event greater is the quality of the food..... It is authentic... Kudos to the  chef!  Probably one of the  best lasagnas I've ever had.  My coworker got linguini clams in red sauce..... Superb!!  What's funny is we were out of town doing laundry next door.  Thought it was just gonna be a pizza joint.  Nope!!  Some of the best Italian food we've ever had.  Go there!  You will not be disappointed!  There's a yelp sign in their door window for a reason.  It is that good!!  Thank you La Fontana!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in all of Scottsdale. Homemade and fresh just for the customer. Chef straight from Italy."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Amazing food and service.  We had the lasagna, pasta all'amatriciana, chicken picatta, Caesar salad and tiramisu. Truly authentic dishes.  The waiter was friendly and warm.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We visited La Fontana last night. I've seen it many times as I drive Thomas Road, but it is a little off the beaten path at about 100 yards east of Hayden. The cheesy fountain in the front of this former laundromat is the giveaway. Parking is in the back and it is adequate.

Franco greeted us ate the door. What a great host. Dapper, courteous, accomodating, and quite the gentleman. His meal suggestions were spot on. He even had the house make me an off-the-menu anchovies and peppers appetizer.

The lasagna was great, the gnocchi is off the charts. My seafood pasta was to die for. Absolutely top flight ingredients and preparation.

And, the price was absolutely reasonable.

Oh yeah--the wine is terrific. We had too many bottles of Chiant.

Then, Chef Marco came out and opened a bottle of Sambuca and the visiting and partying kept on going. Really a very special night.

I highly recommend you make this your local italian joint. I know I will."}
{"text":"Delicious,  homemade, authentic Italian.  The best Italian I've had in years. Service was great, our waitress was attentive and generous. My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"This is owned by a very nice man but unfortunately he's going to lose this business. Service was nonexistent and I had some food-related tummy problems later that night."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in our visit. It took a very long time for our food to be served. The calamari was bland and our pasta was way over cooked and falling apart. For the amount of time we waited I was hoping for a better result. Unfortunately we won't return."}
{"text":"Grew up eating east coast Italian
My wife is full Italian and a great cook
The Marsala here is almost as good as hers"}
{"text":"Pizza was not cooked long enough and there was too much cheese.  We also spent $10 on soda as we were never told that there are no free refills.  Authentic Italian does not mean charging through the roof for drinks like they do in Europe. Service was good minus the drink issue and incredibly burnt bread. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Nice, clean restaurant.  Took my mom here when she was in town, and could not have been made to feel more welcome!  I had the gnocchi - it was fantastic!  Mom had the tagliatelle; she loved it and I devoured her leftovers the next day.  Portions are easily 2 meals.  Check this gem out.  They have earned and deserve the awesome ratings!"}
{"text":"I left here knowing we probably would never make our way back. The restaurant is quaint and the owner as the reviews mentioned is amazing - he definitely has an old world charm to him but not enough to make up for what the place lacked - a good wait staff and flavor. Pasta was under cooked, oily and tasteless."}
{"text":"This is a very unpretentious yet excellent Italian restaurant.  The food was incredibly good and well presented. Service was fast yet friendly. A great price tops off the reason for the strong rating. The location is a bit odd and the entrance is in the back, but I didn't come for the architecture. Definitely a place to frequent when in town. Can't wait to bring Denise"}
{"text":"Here again for the second time in less than a month. Im usually all for adventure in finding new places to eat at, however this has been the exception. I have had the pizza and a pasta entree and they were well above my expectations. So today I am going for a whole new entree, the pollo marsala. Definitely looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, vibrant food. Fiance and I simply fell head over heels with this hidden GEM.
\"You want fast food, go somewhere else... my food is made in the moment\" He was so right...
Thank you for the great food"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. We had several dishes that were great! Highly recommended. Prices reasonable"}
{"text":"Ok I will admit it, I love Italian food.  I could eat pasta every night of the week. But when we go out to eat, it's rarely at an Italian restaurant. You see, my grandmother was from Italy and cooked like you wouldn't believe. And because if that I'm a little (lot) picky about the quality of my Italian food. Leaving a hole in my dining out repertoire. Until now!!!

If my grandmother was alive, even she would love the food at La Fontana!  Took the whole family in on a Thursday for, regrettably, a quick bite. Oh how I wish I had two hours to sit and eat 5 courses of this fresh, authentic Italian cuisine!! We made it fast but it was amazing. First off the ambiance is classic, loads of family pictures on the walls and I'm pretty sure \"The Godfather\" score was playing in the background. We were greeted by Franco, the realist deal around. So warm and friendly, he made the entire experience feel more like eating at a beloved friends house than a restaurant. We had pasta and meatballs for the kids; pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was as good as Grandmas. And that's a BIG deal in my family. I didn't get to taste a meatball before they gobbled them up, but I heard they were tender and tasty. Husband had chicken parm; chicken breast lightly breaded, covered with sauce and melted mozz, a side of rigatoni- cooked to perfection. I had the Penne Alla Puttanesca. It comes with capers and olives, they had no problem adding peas at my request. It was DIVINE. Again with the perfectly cooked pasta in a sauce that had nice deep flavor without being too spicy like some puttanesca. 
We didn't have time for dessert but I know I will go back and get my hands on their Tiramisu. 

Final verdict: YOU! Yes, you. Go now. Go tonight. Eat at La Fontana every chance you get. I know I will!!! Grandma would be proud! Ciao!"}
{"text":"Ok new place in town (originally from Chicago), about two months still getting the place organized but man it was awesome. Marco the chef came out and introduced himself. Lunch portions are large enough to for a grown man. 9\" lunch pizza was amazing, the sausage and meatballs were delicious. I will be a regular customer every time I am on this side of town."}
{"text":"What a surprise I got when I found out that La Fontana wasn't on Yelp yet! 
This small business opened a few years ago in Quartier Dix 30, and I have been a fan of their gelatos since then. I swear. They are homemade, they are fresh, they are tasty, they are.. everything that someone could ask for! Their sweets are what brought me in first, but I found out that everything that they offer on the menu is just as delightful. Small confession: I am slightly addicted to their Penne Alla Gigi. Nothing serious. 

Their menu includes salads, pasta, paninis and many more!

This is definitely a place that I would recommend trying out if you happen to be in the neighbourhood! And if you do decide to give it a try, make sure that you take a glimpse at their dessert counter (or, as I would call it, Heaven)."}
{"text":"We visited La Fontana recently for dinner and were surprised to have found a very decent Italian restaurant in Scottsdale, Az. The food and service were very good and our server offered may suggestions for our dining pleasure. It's a small, cozy place serving quality Italian fare. We started with a caprese salad followed by Chicken Marsala and Chicken Parm. Both were accompanied with a side of pasta. The wine suggestions were good and enhanced our meals. The portions were sizeable and reasonably priced. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out based on being in the area & yelp reviews. We were the only people here but it is a very traditional Italian restsurant & comfortable place to grab dinner. I was disappointed they didn't have pizza like the pics I saw on yelp... They are changing out their ovens so they should be installed in 2 weeks.

I ordered chicken Vesuvio which was really good. I'm not a huge eater & I was able to eat it all! Delish cream sauce with garlic served with penne. There is serf room for dessert or an app if you have an appetite.

I will go back again and check out the pizza."}
{"text":"Authentic, quality Italian. Loved it! Restaurant is quaint, owner is very friendly and warm, chef is also very friendly and inviting.

What we've had: 
Caesar salad, homemade dressing which is hard to find and very good!
Lasagna, outstanding, pasta is light, sauce like my grandma from Italy made.
Gnocchi, feather light with an exquisite Alfredo sauce.
Chicken piccata, chicken is so moist and pounded thin, finished to perfection with a fresh lemon caper sauce, and served with wonderful oven roasted rosemary potatoes.
Chicken Parmesan, also pounded thin, best I've had.

We've had take-out and then sat on the patio tonight with my husband and daughter. Love this place!

They don't have a liquor license yet, so it's byob, and you can pay a small corkage fee.

Go here, seriously."}
{"text":"Always drove by and today we finally tried it.
Outstanding Italian food everything was freshly made and It was amazingly delicious.
The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is as real as it gets, grew up in Chicago eating home made Italian food and never thought I would taste that taste again here in AZ! But I have found a new home away from home! The sauces are the real deal and the Polo Chicken is too die for, wake up Phoenix and get your self to La Fontana! NOW"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after reading the reviews, and we were thrilled. We have driven by this place for years and never stopped before; we've been missing out! I had the ravioli because I have been trying to find the white sauce that I've had in Italy, and I finally did tonight! It was delicious us.The owner came out and talked with us and was delightful. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful - as authentic as you can get this side of the Atlantic. The atmosphere is charming and comfortable. And the service feels more like stopping in at a good friend's house for a meal, very warm and inviting. Exceptional restaurant with excellent Italian food, at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Bought 4 pizzas for a business luncheon, absolutely delicious, authentic Italian cooking. Thank you for making rad pizza."}
{"text":"Don't let the location (next to a laundromat) fool you.  This is a cute little place with gracious hosts.  We called ahead to make a reservation for 7 and they said \"we will be waiting for you\".  It was like an invitation you'd hear from a kind relative.  The food was was very good.  Very fresh, homemade pasta.  I ordered the angel hair pasta and though I liked it very much, I couldn't keep my hands off my son's lasagna.  It was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted.  Others had the veal special and loved it and the pizza was really tasty as well.  The prices are very reasonable.  If ever in Arizona again, I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Very friendly great service food was good not great . Love the mom and pop atmosphere"}
{"text":"They know how to make a darn good pizza pie, and the place has a great vibe. This joint is good for a quiet, more intimate date, or if you're just looking for some tasty Italian cuisine in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this little place forever and finally decided to give it a go.  I placed a take-out order for the tagliatelle bolognese and the pollo parmigiana. The gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and called me back a few minutes after I placed my order to inform me that they were almost out of tagliatelle and would I mind if fettuccine noodles were used to make up the difference (I said I did not mind at all). The restaurant is very nice inside and we had high hopes for the food. Once we got it home though we were immediately disappointed. There was hardly any sauce, especially for the bolognese. Honestly, it was about a tablespoon of sauce which barely covered the pasta and the worst part is that it was very bland. The chicken on the pollo parmigiana dish was fatty and not seasoned well. 

The reason I am giving La Fontana two stars instead of one is for the mini cannollis which were delicious. Sadly I don't think I will give the food another try for a while. I hope they are able to improve the quality of the food soon as the service was terrific. I'll keep an eye on the reviews."}
{"text":"Small, intimate and great ambiance. Great, friendly staff that are always spot on with recommendations. Food is amazing. Never eaten on the patio as it faces Thomas Rd. and can be loud."}
{"text":"The pizza is bomb!! My number one choice of all time here (: 
when you order anything else, i like to add salt and pepper because the food isnt flavorful as is."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has the reviews it has or is still in business. \"The diet coke's good, that's about it\" is the quote of the night. This is by far the most terrible food and worst service (despite being the ONLY people in the restaurant) I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Parmesan which was huge. It came with pasta and I could barely finish the meal. The prices at this restaurant is reasonable. The service we had was abysmal.

Food - The Chicken Parmesan was okay but not spectacular. The other couple that we dined with loved the food, although they didn't have Chicken Parmesan. My wife didn't think it was the greatest. So to balance out the sample size of diners I'll give this place a 4 for the food.

Service - We had a rookie. Basic mistakes such as giving us a bottled coke and having us pour it into the wine glass. She had trouble taking orders and couldn't explain the menu. On the other hand, the owner was very gracious and was able to explain the menu. I'll give this place a 2 for service.

Ambiance - This is what takes my overall Yelp rating up from 3 to 4 stars. You are not rushed. It's like going to a relative's house and talking for hours after the meal. I believe we were there for 2 1/2 hours. Although the dinning room is small, the tables are adequately spaced out from your fellow diners. So Ambiance is definitely a 5."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I was just driving by and it caught my eye. First time visit. Host was very nice and food was delivered to my table fairly quick. The meatball that was on the pizza was delicious and I am dying to go back and try some stand alone meatballs. Would highly recommend giving La Fontana a shot."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this small, pleasant unpretentious spot. The food was fantastic. I was impressed with the pizza sauce. My mouth is watering thinking about it. The staff was very nice. Portions are the right size. Quality food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Practically no sauce on the overly cheesy mushroom pizza, soggy salad, and extremely greasy/buttery chicken Marsala which came with only one thin chicken breast and a large portion of noodles. The staff was very friendly and welcoming but unfortunately none of the food tasted good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went the first week they opened.  I lived in Italy for 4 years and so I knew when I saw \"trattoria-pizzeria\" I was dealing with either the real deal or total shmo's.  These guys were the REAL DEAL.   In-house made pasta, fresh shrimp and did I mention the prices? Fantastic.  We started the meal off with the bruschetta.  Holy wow. Then, I got the Shrimp Alfredo and my wife got the Chicken Alfredo.  Pasta was perfect Al Dente. We felt very special that the cook/owner would come out and talk with us and walk us through their story, and the menu.  Such a great Italian family atmosphere.  We will be returning again and again and again. We can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"Staying in Old Town Scottsdale and we were looking for a place for dinner so we checked out Yelp.  We came across La Fontana Trattoria. What a find!  Everything was wonderful.  Everything was very fresh and spot on. Franco, the front of the house and Chef Marco were very friendly.  They knew each other from LA and have reconnected in Scottsdale. Each of Franco's suggestions were perfect.  Calamari was perfect, house made pasts and Chicken Piccata were excellent. And the price was stunning, in a very good way,

La Fontana is a jewel.  We'd  love to have this restaurant in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Chicken piccata was great. The pasta is made in house and perfect. Alfredo made at the time of order. Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch......the home-style Italian dressing calls my name , it's so delicious ! Can't wait to bring my wife back here for dinner.......gracious , hospitable owners in the Old World tradition !"}
{"text":"Good \"mom and pop\" type restaurant. Very friendly team working the room with an elegant but not \"stuffy\" atmosphere. Pizza oven isn't typically operated during the summer but the pasta is worth coming for. This is a great place to come have a nice dinner at a very reasonable cost and you won't walk away disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to La Fontana for dinner on a Friday night. The kitchen is a little slow, but the service was friendly and the food was good.  The dining room has a nice, home like feel. The only negative thing I have to say is that you don't get a dinner salad with your entree."}
{"text":"Great little italian place. Great fresh italian pasta! Great service by Maria and everyone else!!  Had their special spinach ravioli with their house merlot and fresh bread.  Even my boyfriend loved the ravioli with the white sauce and a great chocolate dessert to top it off!!  Amore!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Completely loved the stuffed marshala chicken! Excellent new management!"}
{"text":"We were excited to check this place out since it has such a high rating, but were quite disappointed!  The wine was harsh tasting, the calamari was especially salty, the carbonara pasta didn't taste the least bit authentic, and the pizza tasted like a poor Peter Piper replicate.  The pizza crust looked and tasted like it was from a package, and the toppings were very cheap and canned tasting.  The service was extremely slow, but friendly.  Authentic Italian from Rome?  I don't think so.   This was not the hidden gem we were hoping for!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried about the five star rating with only 10 reviews but I have to say they were spot on. It's much better than sals and for a better price. I got the caprese and my wife and I split the chicken piccata. She is very picky with Italian and recommended I write a review because we both though this was the best in the area and haven't had a very good experience looking for Italian in Scottsdale. The lemon sauce with capers was perfect, and we had the small vegetable side instead of pasta because we've been eating a little heavy lately. I didn't know what to expect and was frankly a little worried but it was a mix of chopped mushrooms and spinach perfectly cooked together. The restaurant is also really well put together, and the outside patio seems like a nice place for a dinner. I always thought the exterior wouldn't lend itself well to an Italian restaurant of that caliber but the owners did a great job with the interior and small patio area. The server is a nice old Italian man and the cook came out to wish me well on the meal. It was surprisingly authentic and the ingredients weren't cheap like some of the places around. I don't know if they make it, but they sell extra virgin olive oil just inside. This place is definitely worth a try if you're looking for Italian in south scottsdale that beats the others in both taste and price."}
{"text":"Was a bit thrown off, looks like a closed business, drove around the back and saw the restaurant. Ordered the Alfredo, pepperoni pizza, chicken Parmesan and canolies. Everything is made in house from pasta to pizza dough. Very impressed with the quality of the food. Staff was very nice and attentive. Will be back."}
{"text":"I do not reccomend this place!  It did not have pizza as the pizza oven costs too much money to run (from an employee) the lasagna was runni and did not taste good. I got a side of bread that was not the same bread each piece and a Caesar salad that was stale???? Truely it was."}
{"text":"I have driven by La Fontana so many times and while moving my parents to South Scottsdale we decided to call here for some takeout.    When I picked up the chef came out to say hello and explained that he makes the pasta in house.   The food was delicious and the portions were good size.  
A week later when my moms birthday came we decided to return and dine at the restaurant.  My parents aren't pretentious people and they are not comfortable at super expensive places so where to go can be tough since we don't want to go to a chain restaurant for this occasion.   
La Fontana has a nice outdoor patio so we enjoyed it.   We ordered a bottle of wine since the selection is good and not too pricey for a bottle so why not!   We all ordered and my parents ordered the same thing....chicken Marsala so the chef decided to give them different pastas so they'd feel special plus he came out again to say hello.   That's a nice touch that doesn't happen often anymore.   
Then something else great happened....the waiter offered dessert and when mom had to decline because she is diabetic they still wanted to do something nice so they brought her flowers and some even gave her a hug!   This is a really nice local place.    They should be much busier!   If you want homemade Italian (not from a franchise order) this is the place!!!!"}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting the opening of La Fontana Trattoria.  My review mostly tonight is for the owner and staff.  What a welcome from the owner and the rest of the team.  When I want Italian, this is exactly what I want!  Italian owned and you feel like family when you walk in the door.  This seems like a great place to sit, relax on the patio, enjoy your company, enjoy a bottle of wine and great food when you're not in a rush....when you have time to really enjoy your evening and a great meal. I believe that they are waiting for their liquor license so you are currently able to b.y.o.b. for a minimal corkage fee. There is a party store right next door but  their wine selection is minimal (CVS across the street actually has a fairly decent selection if you forget to plan ahead.)

I ordered a pizza tonight (although their menu has some amazing dishes, I went with quick take home food)  When I go back and dine in, I will have to try one of their pasta dishes.  Based on the delicious sauce on the pizza, I have to think the rest of their menu will be great!

I support local businesses and  La Fontana seems to have made a choice to be a local, neighborhood restaurant and therefore they do not have the luxury of hungry tourists just walking by and seeing their menu like other restaurants just 2 miles away in Old town. That is exactly why I was anxiously awaiting their opening.  So glad I stopped in and gave them a try.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy canoli!!!! (No but really, the canoli's are delicious). This place truly is a hidden gem because the food is amazing but even more so for the service. We decided to give this place a try for my dad's birthday as I'd seen the great yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. For entrees we had gnocchi, veal, and lasagna. All large portions and all delicious, including the salads!! What I really loved was how friendly the staff was and that the chef came to our table to ask how our meal was. Great service goes a long way and more than the authentic food, I will absolutely be back for the fantastic people that made our meal special! Thank you for coming out and singing happy birthday to my dad !!! It was totally unexpected and very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quaint spot with great service you have found it. They recently changed management and obtained their liquors license. The owner, Louis was super hospitable and nice the whole evening. The food tasted great! It was super rich so be prepared :). They just started a happy hour and I can't wait to go for that! Overall it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"We went again last night and it was as good as the first time. The veal Marsala was hands down the best we've ever tasted. It's no longer byob as they got their liquor license. Kind of a bummer as I love byob's but drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First of all, I am italian. Not fake italian either. 1st generation italian. Both parents were born and raised in Italy. Most of my family lives in Italy, and I still speak it fluently.

With that being said I know real italian food, so don't come at with that olive garden crap...

This place is legit! The food quality and taste is amazing. The owner speaks italian and is a nice guy. I really like this place. Price is not bad either. Most places in Scottsdale ate slightly priced but this place is not. Fair priced for what they have. 

If you want authentic Italian food, go here, you will not be disappointed! #nomnom"}
{"text":"First time at this little hole in the wall of sorts - next to a laundromat, but the entrance to the laundromat is in a completely different place - so no cross-traffic.  Staff very friendly and the entrees are reasonably priced.  I ordered a house salad (delicious and arguably a meal by itself), the Pollo Marsala and a glass of wine and paid $30 including tip !!

The entree was huge and very tasty with just the right amount of sauce and veggies.  I was offered as much bread as I wanted and they give you plenty of butter (one of my pet peeves with most restaurants).  :-)   I did not realize until I left they had a small bar with a TV for watching sports or whatever - but it is separated from the dining area, which is nice.  

It was my first visit and I am coming back !!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's right down the street from my house so my husband and I go here all time. The picatta and marsala are some of my favorite dishes. Inexpensive and I love the casual and relaxed atmosphere. If you're in the area and looking for Italian food I would definitely recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"After hearing from my friends in the neighborhood about this great little Italian restaurant, we finally made it there last night.  Of course, great April evenings started our experience at La Fontana perfectly on the patio.  The owners and wait staff made us and our children feel so welcome.  Bringing our own bottle for our meal (w/a small corkage fee) was even better.
Then we got to the food.  From the bread, to the fresh side salad (which looked like a meal) to the dinners we each chose (there were 11 of us) we were one satisfied group.  My husband and friend had chicken piccatta, which was dreamy.  The chicken was pounded thin and very tender with not too many or too little capers on top.  The accompanying pasta was creamy and not too salty.  I had the bolognese pasta with wide noodles.....so good.  The calamari appetizer was also amazing.  
We will be back, if only so we can try some of the other items on the menu.  The prices were great and all of us had leftovers to take home.
These owners are hard-working people and I do really hope they succeed.  We like having a great tasting, fare priced, authentic restaurant in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This new little place is a gem in the rough of south Scottsdale. Family owned and operated which shows in their recipes and high quality Italian dishes. Bravissimo!"}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent service! I ordered food to go, it was waiting for me when I showed up to pick it up 10 minutes later! This place is a gem! Must try! Classic Italian food, done right!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping I would not like La Fontana because I live 40 minutes away but I loved it.  It is so worth the drive.  The tiny family run authentic Italian menu was outstanding.  We had calamari and meatballs as an appetizer.  I could have made a meal on the appetizer.  Our entrees were superb.  We got to know the owner and had a lot of fun.  An added bonus was bringing our own wine which we wanted to drink for a minimal surcharge fee.  This is a new restaurant and I am afraid when more people hear about this place it will be hard to get in.  Right now it is a hidden secret, so I am going to make the drive quite often.  Thanks Franco for a great evening and when I come back I am going to order Paglia Fieno,"}
{"text":"Prompt service, good wine selection and homemade pasta...were definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I have no idea what everyone is loving about this place, maybe it recently came under new management. We were looking for a new pizza place to try and went here based on the Yelp reviews. It was a Friday night, dinner rush hours, and the place was only half full at best, that should have tipped us off. Ambiance was gorgeous, so I had high hopes. But service was slow, only 2 waitresses for the dinner shift (on a Saturday?) and it took a while to get just the drinks and bread.  The Chardonnay was the worst I've ever had, I could only muster a few sips to justify the $6 cost of a glass. The bread was nothing special, very basic thick slices of wheat with cold, pre-packaged butter. I have a big issue with any restaurant that uses pre-packaged butter, but the least you can do is leave it at room temp so it'll be easier to spread. 

We had bruschetta for the appetizer (it was okay, nothing special), it arrived before we could even place our dinner order. Mind you, that's not because the kitchen was exceptionally fast, but because the waitstaff was exceptionally slow.  We ordered a pizza and the veal saltimboca.  It took a very long time, we actually opted to have them package our food to-go, I wasn't feeling terribly well and it was taking so long we figured we should just eat at home.  Once we got to eat it, we were at a loss.  It was your average, Americanized Italian food, the pizza was no better than any other small chain pizza restaurant. The bill was astronomically high considering the mediocrity of the food and the lag in the service time.  I can't imagine we're the only ones to be disappointed considering the other glowing Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, wonderful food, wonderful ambience and first-class service! Good friends introduced us to La Fontana last evening (he has dined there five times in the two weeks it's been open) and we can't wait to take other friends there too! We were greeted very graciously by the owner, who also served us with first-class expertise and hospitality. The four of us enjoyed a superb dinner and can't wait to go back. It may take some time, but I plan to eventually try everything on the menu :) 

We enjoyed hot bread and garlic dipping sauce with our wine (byob currently, so get there asap!) while we perused the menu.  My husband and I started with very fresh, delicious caprese salads (half of which we each took home), then on our friend's recommendation, ordered the lasagna, which we all agreed was the best we've ever had. Again, the portions were so generous we weren't able to finish it, and took half home. After a leisurely, very enjoyable dinner, my husband and I managed to share a delicious tiramisu accompanied by wonderful coffee from Italy. Oh--and we also ordered a pizza to take home for this evening! 

Many thanks to our friends for introducing us to La Fontana, and congratulations to Franco on this gem of a place. I recommend you get there soon, especially since you can bring your own wine temporarily while the liquor license is being processed. However, when that happens, I have a feeling Franco will offer some great wines at reasonable prices to go with the great, reasonably priced cuisine at La Fontana. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian served with a warm side of H&M hospitality. Everything from the arancia to the shrimp scampi tasted of classic Italian cuisine. Our favorite was the fresh homemade tagliatelle in red sauce, followed by sweet bite size cannoli. We highly recommend this little slice of Italy."}
{"text":"We go about once a week, and absolutely love the food and the quite atmosphere.  We are always pleased with our meal and service."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian Food, Pleasant Atmosphere and Friendly Service

I had a taste for a nice Italian lunch last week, and was specifically longing for Chicken Marsala. I didn't want to go into Old Town because parking can be a problem. I found La Fontana and some ratings on the internet and decided to try it. I stopped not expecting very much, and had my socks knocked completely off!

When I walked in I grew a little concerned that there was only one table of diners (not generally a good sign), but whatever was cooking smelled wonderful. I was seated at a pleasant sunny table by the a window, and immediately brought cold water with lemon. 

It only took me a moment to locate Pollo (Chicken) Marsala on the menu. I struggled for a minute not to be distracted by other great dishes on the menu, but then stuck with my original strategy and ordered Chicken Marsala with extra garlic. 

After I ordered, Maria (my server) brought me fresh crusty bread, along with butter, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. As I settled in to read my book and enjoy the ambiance of my window seat, I indicated to Maria that a glass of chianti would be nice too.

Now, I am not an expert on Italian food, but I've eaten enough to have a respectable opinion of what's good. The Chicken Marsala, served with rigatoni pasta was to die for! The Marsala sauce with the extra garlic I had requested was spot on, with a bit but not too much richness, and lots of fresh mushrooms. The chicken breast had been nicely seasoned and was flavorful and moist. My pasta was nicely cooked, and everything was piping hot. I ate as much as I could, and then happily took the rest home with me for later.

All in all, my lunch was perfect, and I hope always to get a seat by the windows. I think the Veal Piccata is next, and then I think Linguine Alla Pescatora (Calamari, Clams & Shrimp in red sauce).

Their web site isn't very helpful, but Maria indicated that they will be working on that.

Some other details: As I understand it, pizza isn't always available, so if you are planning to go for pizza I suggest calling ahead. They now have a bar. They do not serve lunch on Monday or Saturday, and they close between lunch and dinner. The parking lot is behind the building, and the entrance is from the rear."}
{"text":"Unpretentious and as truly Italian as you will find in Arizona. I wasn't real hungry, so I chose the steamed clams with white wine sauce. It was outstanding. Great service with reasonable prices. 

It is a little difficult  to find your way to the parking lot, but it is well worth the effort."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing meal today....I ordered the calamari hands down the best calamari I have ever had,I also had the gnocchi amazingly delicious big portions.The new owners Luis and Flor are very welcoming.I highly recommend this restaurant.Excellent food very fresh and to top it off they are dog friendly in their beautiful patio.Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & amazing staff! Our server, Franco, used to be a private chef for parties of Frank Sinatra (photos to prove it!) and several other celebrities. Upon finding out I was Italian and my mom makes the best lasagna, he served us a free and delicious serving of the house lasagna.  The first ever that is as good as moms. He also then served us complimentary Tiramisu and amaretto. 

We had caesar salads, Chicken piccata, another chicken-pasta dish and a spicy pasta dish. All were fabulous. They also now have their full liquor license. It's a quaint and authentic Italian restaurant with no crowds!"}
