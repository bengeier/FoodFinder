{"text":"I was surprised that it was open after midnight on valentines day. I order myself a carne asada burrito, adobada taco, and a large horchata. The burrito was decent, the taco was fantastic no wonder they call it happy taco, and the horchata was my least favorite it seem to sweet! The service was fast and the food was well done so I give it a 4*"}
{"text":"No, the food is not good. It tastes bland. Nothing exciting about this place. The appearance is bad; falling apart, unkempt, dirty. And the exterior is just as bad.   It's popular for some reason. You'll see plenty of traffic during meal time. And you may see some horses tied to the hitching post on the weekend. I can't see what other people see in this place.   If you like Mexican food (and I mean tasty, flavorful Mexican food) then this is not the place you want to try. If you need a quick bite and any old thing will do, this will get you by."}
{"text":"Food is great! I had the chorizo burrito, which wasn't anything special but still good. I had a bite of my husbands chicken tacos and it was delicious! The taco was crispy and flavorful. We also had the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was amazing! The inside was clean and well lit. Tables and booths were all spotless. Definitely my new favorite authentic Taco shop!"}
{"text":"Ummm... the name of this place is mispelled. It's Feliz! As in Happy Taco! If you're from the South side this is what you'll call Taco Feliz...  Happy Taco has been around for quite sometime and has been the best part of my late night excusions. My favorite dishes here is the Chorizo, egg & potato burrito. Also the rolled tacos are awesome! as are the regular tacos with rice & beans combination.   They have HUGE sodas and very decent prices. During \"normal\" hours, they will always have an english speaking attendant - they may have a crazy thick accent, but they understand what you're saying. But sometimes in the middle of the night many things can get lost in translation. I love this place and their menudo is KILLER!"}
{"text":"This tiny place is right near my house, and has fair to middling quality Mexican food. Curiously I have gone here two times now, and only once have they been open. The portions are of decent size, and the food is fairly priced for the amount of food and the quality of the food itself. I have only tried the burritos on the menu, but the red sauce has plenty of spice. The carne asada is of not bad and their chicken is pretty good. Come here for late night fare and decent prices. They have a drive thru and accept credit cards."}
{"text":"The taco logo looks like it has a stomach ache.  I only like the quesadilla everything else is not worth it.  It's not all that great.  But...then again what do you except for cheap drive thru food.  It's ok but honestly not worth it for me.  Just go to any carnicer√≠a and buy carne asada instead."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, however the last time I was here, the girl behind the counter thought it was necessary to be playing heavy metal music at the volume level of 12.... VERY unprofessional of her, but the food is"}
{"text":"I'm drawn to the hole in the wall Mexican places across town that produce delicious, authentic Mexican food. With all the options available, I'll probably try another one before coming back here.  The good: the salsa bar, and especially their green sauce (yum!), are solid. The lightly fried tortilla on the taco was delightful.   The not so good: the taco was 75% iceberg lettuce. The red sauce must be tomato sauce from a can with some spices added (ew). The menu doesn't say what meat is in the taco, and I wasn't asked what I wanted on my taco. After eating it, I'm still not sure what the meat was..."}
{"text":"Stepped into Taco Feliz for football playoff dinner to go. I arrived around five on a Saturday night and it was empty. The inside was pretty bleak but at least it was clean.   I ordered a Carne Asada Chimichanga, Carne Asada Burrito , two Taco plates and a Taco and enchilada plate. So four meals. No substitutions or special requests.   The cashier got the order wrong three times but fortunately read it back to me so I was able to correct her. Her young daughter was pestering her while taking the order and she was clearly distracted.   The order came out about eight mins later. It was correct in every way, which was surprising.   My Chimichanga was very good. Very big, plenty of beef, good spice level, crunchy exterior and big flavor all around. The beans and rice were good as well, especially the beans.   I heard everyone else making yummy sounds.   Good food, pretty awful service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best fast Mexican food place in the valley!  1000x better then filly-b's or any other place.  I love their breakfast burritos and their quesadilla can't be beat!  I wish they would advertise more because they could probably use the business!"}
{"text":"Well, have been here a few times and thought was decent.  Went by today to pick up a few breakfast burritos to give Grandson before school.  asked for egg and bacon and potato....the egg and bacon was 4.25 (which I think is pricey for a breakfast burro) and then to 'add' the potatoes if would be 5.60!  So for a few potatoes a 1.35 extra???  really??  that means less bacon and egg in it right?  Potatoes are cheaper than eggs or bacon.  I told them, nevermind, I will go home and make my own.  And it did....made 6 of them for about 3.00.  so I will not be going back...I also recall these burritos used to be alot alot less...they are by no means gourmet and the bacon is fatty but none the less were easy to pick up occasionally."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tried a couple of times but food lacking in flavor and restaurant is a bit sketchy. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Looks pretty sketchy on the outside but it's good as fuck. Get the shredded beef taco. Best taco I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and we have tried Taco Feliz twice so far. The food is Very Good!  Carnitas Tacos, Chili Rellano,, Carnitas Burrito! Yummy!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for a few years but only recently gave Taco Feliz a try. Food allergies are a concern in our family, so we don't often take risks on a new restaurant. Glad we did on this one though! Great food, and you can tell that they put a little extra effort into it than the larger chains. The refried beans are excellent, and we did not have any problems with allergen contamination (gluten). Only detractor is the aesthetics, but that is secondary to good quality food!"}
{"text":"Peep this;   I reviewed Taco Feliz as the best taco store almost 6 years ago and you know what has changed since then?    Fucking nothing.   This place is on top of the taco game like nobody's business and burritos?  Whoooo!      This isn't trendy hipster braised jackfruit vegan whole grain artisan tacos served by some white guy with square glasses, a neatly trimmed beard and a spongebob tattoo on his bicep,   we're talking blue collar real tacos.    Now leave me alone I have a burrito to slaughter."}
{"text":"Don't be frightened by the outside, or the dining room. This place has authentic Mexican food, the chicken tacos are great! The hot sauce is even better! I haven't had food like this since I was in Mexico. The staff is super friendly, and eager to serve! We will be back!   If they clean up the place a bit I would  have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I tried a chicken taco, beef taco, and beef burrito and each of them were wonderful. As other reviewers have pointed out, the restaurant itself is pretty run down. The building looks like it should have been condemned years ago. If not for the other reviews of this place and the recommendations of a few locals, I probably would not have dared to try this place if going purely by its looks alone. However, I decided to give it a shot and the food turned out to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent little joint, nothing spectacular. Daily special and open 24hrs. Try the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Restaurants that are open 24 hours play an important role for certain kinds of people - ones that work odd hours, people who like to eat at non-standard times of day, and, of course, people who are out late partying and want to put something in their stomach at 3 am. Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 24 hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through.   My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-5 different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts.   The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only 2 chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks."}
{"text":"Tacos were awful they literally put more lettuce than meat the diet soda tasted like pinesol and they only use one mini miceowave tortilla + expensive"}
{"text":"Hmmm...  I don't know how they got such good reviews. Tacos were scarcely filled with the good stuff, the shells were also under fried. The beans were too runny as well.  I was so stoked to find a place near me, with good reviews. Guess I'll have to keep driving to Tempe for Taco Tuesday. I still think Fillibees on Broadway and Priest is where it's at.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Me and the kids stopped here after camp. We had three beef tacos and one had a horchata. Place was clean and tacos and horchata were good."}
