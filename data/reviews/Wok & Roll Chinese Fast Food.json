{"text":"Best orange chicken in the city and I've tried oodles of different restaurants.  Everyone I've taken to eat there has really liked their food too.   It's family run and the owners are super nice.  She would know who I was over the phone even before I ordered the food.  I moved 30 minutes away and still go there occasionally."}
{"text":"I dont know if this restaurant is still open. They still have a sign up and still on the internet but we called the other day and had no answer."}
{"text":"Very friendly Mom & Pop joint. Best Sesame Shrimp I've ever had. Quick Service. Everyone I have taken here has loved it."}
{"text":"Yes, Wok and Roll is still open serving mediocre chinese food without a lot of flavor. We sometimes go there when we're too lazy to go somewhere else."}
