{"text":"This place is delicious. Priced in par with all good Caribbean take out joints but with a dining room. The jerk chicken was bomb, good portions, rice and peas also great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've only been once so far, but I definitely plan on working my way through the menu.  First things first, this is a Caribbean restaurant you actually want to stay and dine-in. Yes, most places, even if they have a dine-in option, aren't very welcoming, this place is. Dine-in, it's lovely. Decor is really nice. It's very spacious and clean and modern. And our server was super sweet and friendly.   I ordered the jerk pork sliders and fresh-cut fries and it was so yummy. The fries were right up my alley. The best kind of chip truck fries. I am so addicted to these now. The jerk pork sliders were two sandwiches on soft white hamburger buns. They came topped with a bit of coleslaw and they were so good.   Next time I want to try their jerk chicken, their jerk chicken spring rolls, their chicken wings, and their fried chicken. I shall definitely be back here again.  If you like Caribbean, but you don't like the look of sketchy Caribbean take-out places or rude, unwelcoming staff, come here. You will be so glad you did."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant and the food was incredible. May be the best West Indian food I've had next to my own family. Great vibe great staff and a family business. Must be why it's so good.   My lady and I loved it. Try the coconut shrimp, the same name burger and the oxtail."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and was skeptical but it was my husband's birthday and I was willing to go out in a limb. Thank goodness I did. I was pleasantly surprise by the urbane and modern decor, courteously greeted and served by the infamous Marlon, impressed by the professional order taking and attention to customers, dazzled by the presentation and wowed by the taste and portions of the food, given the reasonable pricing. My husband is a hard sell but he ate his curry goat, rice and peas with mac salad, dived in to my plate of Jerk Chicken pasta and still order an oxtail dinner to go. From the delightful coconut shrimp and festival starters to the mains, this meal and service were executed flawlessly. We will be back and you should not let this culinary gem pass you by. Thank you for making my day and my husband's birthday Xaymaca!"}
{"text":"Best plantain hands down- not too mushy, used perfectly ripe ones.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the jerk Alfredo was surprisingly excellent!  Jerk chicken was tasty, salad fresh, macaroni salad was yum.  Next time will try the Ap platter.  Wish there were some Johnny cakes and coleslaw though.  Will be back for sure when in the area."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The service was impeccable. I came here for the first time with my friend. I had the jerk wings and it was well seasoned. I will definitely be back. Oh and the music was just as nice."}
{"text":"You know, I've always wondered why there's exceptionally few Jamaican-fusion restaurants and fewer (or non-existent) Jamaican restaurants which incorporate a dine-in experience.  Enter Xaymaca which describes itself as an \"upscale Caribbean restaurant and Bar\". 'Xaymaca' by they way, is the original native (Taino) name for Jamaica. It is certainly upscale when compared to most other Caribbean restaurants; but people shouldn't think upscale in terms of being formal with chandeliers and an expensive menu. In fact, most items on the menu are right around the $10-$15 range.  It's a nice open layout and recently renovated. I think 'sports bar' is probably the best way to describe it and they have a number of big screen tv's, as well as a bar area.  The menu features a number of Jamaican favourites, such as: jerk chicken, fried chicken, jerk pork, and various fish specials. There's also a big fusion element on the menu with sandwiches, appetizers (including wings), fries, burgers and pasta.  I've only been in once, but I ordered the pulled jerk pork sandwich. Jerk pork is not as readily available as say the chicken at many places, so I wanted to take advantage. When it's good...it's good. I also had to see how they pulled off the fusion aspect. The sandwich was terrific and the pork was full of flavour (not fatty), and tender. It was served with lots of sauce and coleslaw. The fries really exceeded my expectations and were fresh cut and done perfectly.  It's only my first experience and one item off the menu, but it's more than enough to warrant return visits and recommend anyone to check them out. I'll be sure to come too for wings on a game night."}
{"text":"Walked in and was impressed by the d√©cor and lighting. Not a lot of Jamaican places like this. We ordered jerk chicken, pulled jerk pork and mango chicken wings. Good prices and A+ flavour, service was also great. Will be going back"}
{"text":"The customer service was A1, our guy was very polite and very much respectful. This is key  The food was OK, will I necessarily crave this food nope, but when i am in the area and I'm hungry ye i will go there. But it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican restaurant in brampton, I love coming here. They play the best music, serve the best food, provide you with amazing service and did I mention the food is extremely tasty? :D"}
{"text":"Passed by this place a million times and just never thought about going in, but amazing food and service!! One of the nicest waiters in town, always left satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Went to Xaymaca for lunch while working in Brampton, I have to say this is the best Jerk Chicken I have eaten within the GTA. Aside from the awesome food, this is probably the first Jerk chicken place I have been to that actually offers an inviting atmosphere to enjoy your food in. My server Marlon actually made me want to stay and eat my lunch in their establishment (great music too) I ordered the double leg jerk chicken meal with rice and peas and WOW IS THERE A LOT OF FOOD FOR $13.55!!! 10/10 would go back again, probably tomorrow... Or tonight for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance. Great servers. I tried the Caribbean spring rolls which were light and delicious. The jerk chicken had a subtle smoky flavour to it. Juicy, not dry. Albiet I would've liked it with some heat. For jerk it was surprisingly mild. The goat curry on the other hand was down right exceptional. That was so utterly well done it brought a tear.   With the negatives, the rice was horribly overdone and lacked anything remote to flavour. You could almost taste the . Second the service took a very very long time in a restaurant that was almost empty barring one more table besides ours. That was almost a deal breaker. Lastly the Jamaican ginger  was served cool with ice and not chilled proper. Took away from the flavor"}
{"text":"This place is great. The atmosphere  is very clean and newly renovated. The chicken wings were amazing. The jerk pork was tender and the jerk chicken was juicy. Would definitely  recommend staff is friendly! The only complaint is the rice was a little dry"}
{"text":"Very good service and nice stuff but the food was oily. I have eaten better Caribbean"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having lunch here. The food was great as was the server Marlon he did a great job.  We ordered the fried chicken with jerk chicken, and also a jerk poutine with Barbfry chicken. Nice restaurant. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Polite knowledgeable staff is very important.. Food good..  Reasonable price... The jerk could be better little dry.. Well run establishment.."}
{"text":"I Stopped by Xaymaca for a quick lunch with a friend. Service was quick & friendly. I ordered Jerk chicken it was pretty flavourful nothing really stood out differently as the other places I've been but I'm willing to go back and check out some different menu items in the future."}
{"text":"We were in the mood of looking a Carribean restaurant near our hotel and we found this place in yelp. This is a fairly new business.  We went there Sunday night so it's not busy at all. The restaurant is clean and has a good vibes. The owner greeted us and and asked for our orders. He's really friendly. We had jerk chicken and pork. We did not wait too long for our order. It was really really good and the price is really affordable. Will definitely visit again if we are around the area!"}
{"text":"I flew in for the day to have lunch with my mom and was not disappointed with the  food and service. I suggest you start with the 'Apps Platter for 2' with your chose of 4 items. It gives you an opportunity to taste and sample various items from the menu.  I appreciated the variety of Fusion options while remaining true to the many spices and flavors of the Jamaican culture and palate. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Brampton has a good number of Jamaican restaurants, but most are little more than take out counters with a few tables added for good measure.  This place is a step up, with a menu that includes the favourites but also ventures into much more creative sit down dinner fair. Think of it as Jamaican restaurant meets fusion Gastro pub. The atmosphere is modern, though perhaps a little sparse. Staff are nice and attentive, food came with reasonable efficiency, and they apparently have live music occasionally throughout the month.  I was in the mood for a burger, so I went for the house special which is topped with a jerk pulled pork. Both the burger and the pork was delicious and the Sandwedge required no additional toppings to provide a balanced flavour profile. The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced rustic style. There is an optional jerk poutine, which I would love to try when I'm a little hungrier.   Reasonable selection of bottled beer. I went with some reliable red stripe. Would be nice to perhaps see some beers on tap, but they do sell larger quantities have a discount for parties larger than just myself.  I will definitely be back."}
