{"text":"This was a perfect meal. Beautiful room, excellent service. The oysters were the best I have had in my life- the waiter said they had just arrived today at noon and I could taste that it was true. They were so good I could barely believe it.  The bison was excellent, with beautifully prepared vegetables- mushroom sauce and carrots, potatoes and asparagus.  I almost never eat dessert, but I trusted the waiter and his suggestion of the flourless chocolate cake was worth making an exception for. I lingered over it for half an hour reading and was left in blissful quiet to enjoy.  The people clearly take pride in the food and this meal made me sad I have to leave Montreal tomorrow. It also made me promise myself that I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderfully warm atmosphere and high quality basic ingredients made my meal for 1 very enjoyable.  I have to admit, I definitely splurged on this dinner (oops expense report)... did the 5 course menu with supplement of foie gras selection. I could have ended the meal after the foie gras on a high note, but there was one additional course of braised beef cheek served on a bed of sage mashed potatoes and topped with pickled beets. The acidity of the beets mixed with the richness of the beef was heaven.  As far as I am concerned, the chef can do no wrong.  Only regret is I didn't have a companion to taste their selection!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a bit of whim and did not regret it one bit. When my dinner companion and I arrived, the friendly server let us know that the restaurant was a BYOB. He told us they'd hold our table while we walked around the corner to SAQ to buy our wine. Dinner was lovely! It's a small place with an open kitchen and the menu is changed seasonally. Win. Win. Win.   My dinner companion had gazpacho followed by the bison/roasted potatoes and the flourless chocolate cake. I had what I would call sweetbreads (rilles de veau) and then duck confit for my main. The duck was served with perfectly prepared lentils de puy. Delicious! I was too full for dessert but seriously considered the cr√®me brulee.    This restaurant doesn't have many ratings out here yet, but trust me, it's worth a visit. Just remember to take your wine. :-)"}
