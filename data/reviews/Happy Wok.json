{"text":"Went to Happy Wok for lunch today.  Didn't think much of the food.  I got Szechuan Shrimp as a lunch entree, which means fried rice accompanied the main dish.  The fried rice was pretty bad:  zero flavor, nothing but rice (no peas, carrots, onioins, pork, etc) as you usually see in fried rice.  Also, the rice was the consistancy of Mexican style rice.  I have never seen that type of short grain rice at a Chinese restaurant before.
The main entree was equally bland, especially when you consider Szechuan usually designates a \"spicy\" dish.   The shrimp were big and plentiful but overall it was pretty bad for typical Chinese takeout fare.
On the bright side, the workers were friendly and the place was very clean.  Maybe someone else has ordered something better?"}
{"text":"This is a standard chinese takeout place.  We had a wanton soup, sesame tofu, and chicken with string beans.  It was all pretty lousy.  I can't say that either of us was surprised.  Our experience with Madison chinese takeout places is basically very bad.  

The only good part was that the lady taking our order was nice and chatty, and we both liked her."}
{"text":"Good food, consistent taste. Typical Chinese restaurant with some authentic choices. People are very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was fresh & hot when delivered. The pork fried rice was to die for and a very generous portion. General Tso's was nice and spicy. Chicken egg rolls and crab rangoon were not greasy at all. Great meal!!"}
{"text":"Happy wok did not make me happy it actually ruined my day..... I waited 30 mins for the food and when it got to me totally tasted like the way a pet shop smells I wouldn't give a bum this food ..... Even the fortune cookie smelled like play-doh ..... Waste of money, time and food had to throw the whole thing away"}
{"text":"Went once after they changed from Cheng's and it was not good! Even though it's close to the house we will be going to China One from now on..."}
{"text":"Just happened to drive by,...  saw the Grand Opening sign.  We were greeted by a very strong gaseous odor once in the door.  The wor wonton soup was decent, and the restauranteur happily served us.  We ordered the hot and spicy garlic shrimp.  It arrived promptly, the garlic aroma was enticing, but the flavor and small shrimp failed to deliver on our expectations.  Additionally, brown rice is NOT an option to order.  The hot tea was more like Luke warm water, so paying the bill was a bit of a bitter pill to swallow.  We won't be back,...."}
{"text":"I've had worse, but I don't recommend it. If wasn't that fast and didn't taste that good. The orange chicken wasn't terrible, but I did not like the fried rice. My search for good Chinese food in Madison continues."}
{"text":"Disgusting.... I'm from chicago and this was the worst food I have ever eaten. The Mongolian beef was sweet with a strong starchy / Pasty taste. I was horrible. The egg fu young was basically a omelette on top of gravy. The chicken was over cooked there were 4 super dry. They had the appearance of being very dehydrated. We spent $88.00 on garbage. BE WARE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY"}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly,  and Delicious food at a great price. Happy Wok makes me(and my tummy) very Happy! :) Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Nice size portions  - exceeded my expectations by miles. Some of the best fried rice I've ever had. Will definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat at. It was great service. Ordered honey walnut shrimp and sweet and sour pork. Both were delious. We got free soup and on a cold day that was perfect. Not from Vegas but if I come back I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for the price. Combo fried rice, combo lo mein and the beef egg rolls are my faves. Lunch combos are great if you're eating on a budget. Includes an egg roll, soup, soda and multiple entrees to choice from.  Staff is nice. I've gotten take out and delivery from here before. This is my first time eating inside. Will be in or ordering from again soon"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars.  The food was enedible.  First, all of our food was the same ugly color brown.  Second, the General Tso's chicken was waaaaay too spicy.  My husband who loves spicy food couldn't even eat it.  The Sesame chicken was so sour that no one wanted to eat it.  The lo mein had no taste.  The fried rice was so dry i had to take a drink mid chew to be able to get it down my throat. The crab rangoon was so greasy that it left a coating in our mouths. It was all a waste since we just threw it out and ordered a pizza.  never again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Stumbled on it. Very reasonable price, friendly service and GREAT food! Try the spicy honey chicken!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I, have been here many times and are never disappointed! The food and the service are great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place I have been here a 1000 times and always the same service. I live about 5 miles away. Here where I lived are several Chinese places but non of them cook as these guys. I love this restaurant. I have been a loyal costumer for 10 years and probably be there for 10 more."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience this evening with Happy Wok!  I had to organize a team dinner for our 13 player hockey team and their families who were all staying at a local hotel while at a tournament. Happy Wok delivered hot, delicious food, on time and didn't miss a single thing on any of the orders. They labeled all of the food with jersey numbers so there were no mix ups. Great prices and something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great service and fast 

Always buy dinner B and always get something free like a drink or some more eggrolls etc 
only once i went in and they had a cook that made the food taste like bland like no seasoning was added to the fried rice and that time my eggrolls were under cooked but they fixed them next time."}
{"text":"Happy wok has wonderful food! Their steamed dumplings are great, all hand made! We've also had crab rangoon, beef and broccoli, general tsos, and chicken lo mein! Everything has been great! Small family place, quick and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Tasteless shrimp in the fried rice. Hot and sour soup looked and tasted like egg drop soup with some vinegar, couple mushroom pieces and a couple bamboo shoots thrown in. No heat, just a vinegar taste in a bland chicken soup colored broth. I can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had. The egg foo young was amazing. The beef egg rolls were out of this world. We have found our new Chinese spot. Looking forward to trying more menu items in the near future."}
{"text":"Over an hour to get the food delivered. The fried rice was horribly dry. Then on top of it we couldn't understand each other which made for a frustrating conversation."}
{"text":"We ordered house fried rice, now full disclosure- we special order our fried rice everywhere we go, and here was no exception, the fried rice was moist and flavorful. They got it right the first time! Which is a huge surprise.  We also ordered Mongolian beef, now the bell peppers weren't sliced as thin as most places but I'm good with that, and the flavor was great. Lastly we ordered 4 beef egg rolls and honestly they are what prompted me to write this review, they were outstanding and they are huge!!!! I will go back just for the beef egg rolls."}
{"text":"We are from out town we were in the area and wanted to try something different. Arrived at this location, bad customer service no form of acknowledgment had to grab the menus and sit down. After 5 mins of sitting down and not being approached we stood up and left. I wouldnt recommend thua place to anyone.."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Dish in Town, But Otherwise, Only Slightly Above Average Chinese Restaurant.

I've had Happy Wok's Double Cooked Chicken lunch dish at least 40 times in the past few years and hand down, it is the best Chinese dish in Madison.  It has extremely fresh green peppers, onions and carrots to go with lean, never grisly white meat chicken, all in a sweet, tangy, garlicy sauce that is terrific. 

After falling hard for this excellent dish, the several other items I've had on their menu have been a bit of a letdown.  They are pretty good, but not great, pretty standard Chinese fare.  I've had the Hot Spicy Chicken,  the Kung Pao Chicken, and the Szechuan Chicken and they are pretty good, but not real distinct, with just average sauces.

The staff are very friendly.  The setting is sort of pleasant cafeteria, with hard plastic tables and chairs.  It's bright with a lot of windows, they have a decent HDTV, and it's always clean.  They have a drive through and their kitchen is quite quick - they'll have your meal ready in just a few minutes.  

Overall, I recommend this restaurant and next time I may explore the menu a bit more and if I encounter anything that changes my mind, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. The cashier was friendly enough but the food is definitely nothing to brag about. No flavor to the food, soup, or even the sauces. The fried rice was mushy and no taste to that either. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The food overall was very good. The meal arrived in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, the hotel here would not allow them to deliver it to the room.  I was on a conference call and could not go down to the desk. The driver left but did not give a copy of the receipt."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! The previous owners had a great menu and you could taste the love in everything they did. I was upset to know Happy Wok took over. This place is an embarrassment compared to the previous concept and owners! I asked for scallion pancakes and the cashier lady pushed me to try a moshu pancake, I said ok let me try. I took home and opened flour tortillas. Wonton soup had no flavor fried rice had no flavor. I can keep going just do not go to this place it's horrible and very McDonald's like Chinese food. I will never be go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in to order a lunch to go. The service for take out was fine.
The decor is the same as it was with Chengs.
The soup was egg drop it was very pale and had no taste.
The pepper steak was ok, not much on flavor..
The egg roll was inedible. It was so oil soaked. 
I do not think I will return."}
{"text":"I just wasted $20....... 

Lets talk about what went well first:

Delivery was timely and the driver was very nice. No issues there.

The Chicken Chop Suey was okay- nothing spectacular but I did appreciate the good ratio of meat to fresh veggies, and that the white rice was included instead of extra.

What needs improvement:

Wonton Soup. I've had good wonton soup before. This tasted like sweat and smelled like urine. I'm still trying to figure out why I even tried it. The meat in the wonton tasted like sawdust.

Steamed Dumplings. Too much dough. Inside was okay. Maybe I'm just really picky, but there was enough dumpling dough to roll out into a large pizza crust.

Bummed. Won't have again."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter stopped in for lunch. Service was extremely fast and the food was delicious. Very fresh and presented nicely. Definitely recommend for a quick stop."}
{"text":"It's your typical Americanized Chinese food-- slightly more \"meh\" than some others in the area for most things. 

Happy Wok earns a better review from me, however, for having the convenience of a drive thru (aka its fast) and for having egg rolls with actual flavor. 

The beef egg roll is the main reason I order anything and I've definitely considered ordering 4 and calling it a meal. So good."}
{"text":"Great service! Food decent. Workers understood english and communicated well. Had the Mongolian beef, a bit different than what Im generally accustomed to but ok. My daughter really enjoyed their orange chicken. I enjoyed their Good service . Do stop."}
{"text":"Standard  chinese fare. Delivery was fast. No complaints. I caved and ordered sesame chicken. It was sweet where im more a fan of spicy, but it wasnt bad. The rangoon and eggroll had a pretty thick wrapper on it, but fried food is good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to \"fast food\" Chinese!  Their prices are fair and they make everything to order; so, you know it is fresh.  I love that I can modify what veggies are in my mei fun (my favorite dish).  I also am a big fan of their Empress Pork.  Mmm mmm good!

Their delivery service is super speedy, too!  When we order online, they usually offer an estimation of at least 30 minutes and it usually arrives within 20.  This would usually make me skeptical about the quality of the food, but it is the same as when we order in the drive thru.

My only gripe is that their shrimp are super over-battered.  It's like a treasure hunt to find your shrimp in there.  As much as I love carbs, I prefer a more balanced breading-to-shrimp ratio.

Make sure to check their website for \"freebies\" when you order.  They often have free crab rangoon, free soda, or other items for free depending on the amount of your order."}
{"text":"Meh, very mediocre food.  Nothing special at all.  The rice is dried out and not fresh (this was at 1:00 pm).  The staff is unbearably rude and acts like your a burden for coming in the place.  The cups and plasticware are thew lowest grade possible.   I asked for a couple packets of spicy mustard; I think it was sitting around since they opened.  It had the consistency of paste and tasted horrible.  I will not give them a second chance, regardless of how cheap it is.  You definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving a bad review, but this was some of the least flavorful, bland food I've had. The rice has nothing in it. It's like steamed white rice with a little soy sauce that you can't taste. The \"hot spicy chicken\" was not spicy in the least and it was so bland. Tasted like the only seasoning this place knows is moderate amounts of soy sauce. That's the only flavor that barely came through. 

The drive thru is nice, and the guy who took my order was very helpful and friendly. Their crab rangoon was really good and flavorful! But the hot spicy chicken and fried rice were really bad."}
{"text":"My daughter got Shrimp Lo Mein all I got say 5 shrimps I basically pd for noodles ?. I ordered General Tso Chicken it's really good but I didn't know it comes with white rice . My first time coming if there is an option the cashier could I said it since I mention it was my first time there. Overall it was some good and not so good things."}
{"text":"Always fast and always good! The owners are very friendly. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only done carry out. They always get my order correct and I'm always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good price 6.99 for large portion of food with spring roll and egg drop soup"}
{"text":"I've given this Happy Wok several try's hoping that I might like something on the menu since this restaurant is close to my house and the only Chinese food drive thru that I know of ...the food here is not good to me, it does not taste fresh at all I feel like I can smell and taste refrigerator burn as I eat it..most of their dishes taste the same to me and always have enormous amounts of celery probably to hide the little meat in the dishes. We ordered the beef and pork and I honestly can't tell the difference as the sauce tastes the same and both have the same chewy taste"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at! Cheap, quick and superb customer service! If you are into big portion meal at reasonable price, you can't go wrong with Happy wok! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cheap American-Style Chinese food. It's not gourmet, it's not the best in town, but it does hit a good price point, you get a good amount of food, and it tastes alright Good for lunch during the workday. 

Get the steamed rice though, the fried rice is.... not that good."}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible, but just wasn't that great.  At least for me personally, the flavor wasn't appealing.  I just had the lunch special with general tso's chicken and chow mein, came with soup and egg roll tho I don't ever care about those items anyways.  Noodles weren't overloaded with veggies (I'm not a fan of a ton of veggies in it) but flavor was just kinda weird. Cooked well though, texture wise.  Chicken was decent. Overall good price.  I attached a photo to show the portion size (good portion) as well as pics of the menu for pricing.  They were friendly and quick.  Maybe the taste just wasn't my style, hopefully others like it. :/"}
{"text":"Never again. They delivered ROTTED chicken wings to me. Seriously. So rotted not even frying them could cover that taste."}
{"text":"Better than how generic they were before. their fried rice is actually not from a pre-made box at this location. Really really good price!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to order my food to go. They said they understood what I wanted and it would be 30 minutes. When I went to pick up my order was wrong so they remade the order. Not telling me that I also was supposed to get a drink with my order too. I was over charged and got home only to find out my order was AGAIN wrong!!! I called and they said there was no manager available and wouldn't be able to refund my money and they had no idea when one would be available. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food. Fast, fresh, reasonable prices and very large portions. One order is enough for 2 people, or be ready to take leftovers.  My husband and I liked this place so much, we ate here twice while in Madison."}
{"text":"I ordered some food here for the first time over the weekend to go and was blown away by the amount of food they give you. One order of beef and broccoli was enough for two full servings. Today my brother wanted Chinese food so I told him about this place. This time we dined in. The service was the best I have ever received. I am not sure if our server was the owner but wow. He was amazing. He gave us all free soup and the kids really enjoyed it. I will deff be coming back to this place. We were even allowed to use the coupons on the to go menu. I am so glad I found this place on yelp."}
{"text":"We called for delivery for the first time and though it took awhile, the food was excellent and portions were plentiful. The crab Rangoon did not travel well, but everything else was delicious! Happy Wok even called to discuss part of the order that was not clear. Four stars! We will definitely order from the Happy Wok again!"}
{"text":"To be honest was not expecting much....but always believe in giving everything and anything open mind the first time. I was in the mood for some Chinese lunch special that day plus it close to my house so been on the radar. It gives me something to review! lol! The first impression is interesting the interior. The counter area that looks more like deli then Chinese restaurant. Outside of the counter area is nice got aquarium, couple artwork along the walls, one wide screen tv, and overall pleasant atmosphere dine in. 

The menu is pretty straight forward I feel with typical Chinese menu nothing really exotic or out of the box. The lunch specials is normal you get egg roll, egg drop soup, drink, and choice of entree. Fried rice or white rice. All for bargain under ten dollars. I ended up going with the Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. I really enjoyed!! There was nice amount of chicken and the best part is tons of vegetables all cooked perfect al dente plus nice mixture. There been times had other Chinese lunch specials that mixed vegetables only one or two different ones. Here you get wide range from bell peppers, carrots, celery, and more. The sauce is solid. Overall nice portion even the rice not small perfect little scoop but full one. Not sure about the rest of the menu if the Chicken with Vegetables is any indication there lot more of the menu on my radar...

The service was excellent. They were very attentive the whole time. Friendly. 

Happy Wok is definitely up there with my Chinese lunch special go to spots!! Look forward to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Exactly what I think of when I want some Chinese take-out. Huge portions, really cheap. The egg rolls were great, and an especially good crab Rangoon. Despite being close to china town, up until now I couldn't find a good spot, but now I'm set! Online ordering and delivery available! Wor wonton is nuts- never thought I'd hope for LESS good stuff in my soup! The broth is so good I want to drink up!"}
{"text":"So I never went to the place that used to be here even though I live right down the street manly due to the fact I always do a quick Yelp search before I try something. I went over to order something from Pizzalicious but they had closed early.  I noticed that the Chinese food place had a new name \"Happy Wok\", did another Yelp search, and it had overall positive reviews so i decided to give it a try. 

Ordered food to go for my boyfriend an I. Prices were very reasonable. Each entree came with the choice of fried rice or while rice. Picked the Mongolian Beef and Tomato Beef plus a large order of the Egg Drop Soup. Took about 15 minutes to complete the order, so not too long of a wait. Went home and had one of the best experiences with Chinese take-out. The Tomato Beef was in a puree of tomato with lots of cut pieces of tomato. As a tomato lover, I was impressed. Mongolian Beef was nothing short of a nice spicy kick! You can tell that the chef really cares about his food, which is something you don't really see in Chinese take-out at all. Oh, and the fried rice portions are off the charts! We still haven't finished a complete box. 

Overall great experience and delicious cheap to go food.

We went about a week later and tried different menu items: Wor Wonton Soup, Curry Beef and Honey Walnut Shrimp. All items were delicious again."}
{"text":"food was ok.  Didn't like the idea about charging for every single thing, such as sauce for an entree that they make.   I'll never go back again"}
{"text":"This place deserves 4 stars for sure, based on my meal.  For Chinese fast food, I was really impressed.  The portions were very generous, and they gave me a ton of free rice (it was white rice--wish they had a brown rice option) along with the dishes I ordered.  For a vegetarian or vegan, they had decent options, and they were very generous with the amount of tofu in the dishes!  I ordered the sesame tofu, the tofu with mixed vegetables, and the tofu lo mein.  The tofu was well-cooked, the sauces taste good, and they give you a lot of food.  The only thing was the lo mein was a little too garlicky, but it still tasted good.  I was pleased, and my discerning vegan boyfriend really liked it."}
{"text":"I think they have the best prices for Chinese food in side of town. 

The service would be expected from Asian people.  

They still make the best food as Chinese food.

It's better if you have it to go so you don't have to be with them when you eat your food."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and threw away most of my order after sampling each item. The won-ton soup broth was extremely salty, but they did use fresh broccoli, which I appreciated. It was also still hot when I brought it home, which was nice. The fried dumplings were like none I've ever had. They were puffy and sort of fried. Microwaved frozen dumplings are better than these. The spring and egg rolls were fine. The people at the restaurant were very friendly, which is why this is a two (not one) star review."}
{"text":"Good basic Chinese and you get a lot of food.  Their crab Rangoon is soooooo good!!  Very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Never again! Lo Mein so soy saucey that it's inedible, egg rolls are full of ground mush, generals is, just, not generals chicken as I hope for. The sweet and sour chicken is okay, but that's the only part of my $30 order that I enjoyed. 
Super dissatisfied with this. Never ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I order delivery at least once a month from this place mainly because they're SO FAST! They always tell me 30-45 minutes but they come in 20-30 minutes! They always give me free rangoons with my order, which I love! I like their Mongolian shrimp and their chicken rice soup is tasty! 
My kids are easy and like their sweet and sour pork and beef broccoli. 
Very fast and very nice people:)"}
{"text":"Great food ordered Mongolian beef asked them if they could make it spicy man did they hottest food in awhile nice friendly staff quiet place to enjoy your lunch definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Always very good and the price is right!  The staff are friendly. The place is clean. The portions are huge and flavorful. They have a tv and it's never crowded."}
{"text":"Super fast and hot delivery on a super cold night. Got the Beef and Veggie, General Tso's Chicken and the Szechuan Chicken - all amazingly yummy! Not very spicy but full of flavor (from someone who likes medium level salsa). New favorite place!"}
{"text":"If you like finding hair in your food then look no further.  

I'm pretty grossed out as the hair was long and intertwined throughout my order of General Tso's."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area and they have a pretty wide delivery range.  They are always super friendly.  Food has never been anything less than piping hot. The restaurant is super clean and you can see into the back clean, well organized kitchen.  They also have a drive thru. 
I love that you can order a lunch portion even though it's dinner time.  They always have deals going on to get free add on's with your order.  
I gladly drive past a dozen other Chinese restaurants to come to this one."}
{"text":"Mid-grade food but brutal service. They don't take your order at the table, and we weren't provided napkins or silverware! Food wasn't atrocious but then we sat around with nobody in sight to bring our bill or bring boxes for our food. Where was our waiter, you ask? Playing a frigging video game on his laptop in the corner! Are you shitting me?! With customers in the restaurant?! Left and he didn't even say goodbye. 

F this place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Happy Wok is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Madison area. In comparison to many places on campus, they offer infinitely better service and food. I typically get the General Tso's Chicken, and I've yet to be disappointed!

Their menu is pretty standard, and they offer a nice selection of healthier items for those interested. The rice is always fresh and the vegetables as well.

If you are looking for an affordable, easy Chinese food experience in Madison, I'd recommend the Happy Wok."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.. I went inside one night to just use the restroom and right when I entered it smelled like sewer. I had to hold my breath for a bit & literally run out. I will never order from this place all because of how the restaurant itself smells..."}
{"text":"Happy wok is by far one of the best Chinese restaurants in Madison! The costomer service is amazing, delivers food within 15 minutes and the food is just FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Prices, food, and service were great! The takeout order option through Yelp is also really awesome. We got our food in less than 15 minutes, super hot and delicious. There restaurant also has a drivethru. If you're expecting \"cheap\" Chinese food, this is it - but the food is also excellent!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service have signs on window stateing lunch specials they Dont even have on there menu on tops the short Asian guy is a prick when you ask him about it and start yelling at me about it last time I will go there"}
{"text":"So we placed our order and they accidentally gave it out to soneone else on accident. Cool. They tried to make us wait till the people came back to give us our order. I said NO. Made them make us a fresh order....seriously wtf"}
{"text":"I paid $9.50 for appetizers, which were shit!! Horrible service  and cold food. The family was huddled  around behind the soda machine while I was the only other person in the building.  No questions were asked about how I like it or if I was pleased.  I eat maybe 10% of the food order because it was so terrible. DO NOT order any BBQ pork because of how bad it is."}
{"text":"Ordered beef and broccoli, hot garlic shrimp, and teriyaki chicken with wor won ton soup Soo yummy, they delivered very quick and it was reasonably priced! Thank you will order again!!"}
{"text":"Fast, Good, full of American Family Employees. :) That is how I would sum up Happy Wok. I have been there twice, once with my hubby and once with a co-worker. 

At first, it is hard to know the exact protocol for ordering and acquiring your food. Do you order and sit? Do you order and wait? You do order and wait, but wait at the pick up area located on the left side of the restaurant. 

Their lunch specials are always a GREAT deal and include a side and a drink. Those are the way to go if you like the special. 

Both times I left full and satisfied with my \"greasy spoon\" Chinese experience"}
{"text":"Happy Wok lied about having food with vegan options. End of review. I would give zero stars if I could. Stop lying, liars."}
{"text":"This place was decent for neighborhood Chinese/Asian food. 
I ordered sesame chicken and it was pretty bland and over sauced. Crab rangoons were okay, not as crispy as I like them.
Giving 4 stars based on the spicy garlic beef dish we ordered, it was delicious and had the right amount of kick. 
Overall we may give it another shot since they're so close and deliver."}
{"text":"I love this place.  House special fried rice...yummm.  House special lo mein...yummm.  Beef egg rolls...yummm.  Very quick, very tasty, very affordable and I especially like they have red chili pepper oil"}
{"text":"Waited a short while for our take out because it was made to order. Smelled great. Substitution allowed on soup with family dinner. Very good. Good deal."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken with black bean sauce, beijing beef, and eggplant with ground pork.  The chicken with black bean sauce tasted good, but I thought there was entirely too much bell peppers.  The eggplant with ground pork was very tasty, but you'd be hard pressed to find any ground pork.  The beijing beef was ok, the sauce is way too sweet for me.  All in all, a descent place.  If the chicken had way less bell peppers and if there was actually a descent amount of ground pork, I'd have given this place 4 stars.  The food was tasty, but it was hard to overlook these obvious flaws."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant.  The food here is cheap AND delicious.  I see a lot of reviews here in regards to the service, but as with any Chinese restaurant you can't really expect much service anyways.  When I came here this past weekend (on Saturday), the old man working (and the only person that I saw working) was very kind and happily took my order.

You basically order at the cash register first, and take a seat and wait for the food to come out.  My girlfriend and I both got the lunch special, which is probably one of their best deals.  For $7.99 you get an entree with rice or chow mein, an egg roll (vegetable), egg drop soup, what seems to be wonton chips and a sweet red dipping sauce, and a drink.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef and the food was delicious.  The beef was tender and carried so much flavor, the chow mein tasted amazing.  I love how the chow mein was all noodles and not a mixture of veggies and noodles. 
 This isn't your typical Chinese restaurant where food is sitting around and you just order and grab the food.  The food comes out fast, and fresh.  Best of all, the portion is large and fills you up rather quickly. 

This place was an amazing recommendation by my girlfriend, and I would come back here again (and many more times after that)!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special of sesame chicken, which included plain low mein, egg roll, and an egg drop soup. 
Food was on the poor side. Chicken was coated in the cough syrup type sauce and the other side dishes was flavorless.
I had gotten the pork fried rice before however and it was legit. So there is a tip, stay far away from the lunch combos and just get the fried rice and skedaddle."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting to much from this place. But its a good place. Service is great. The food is on point. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Bad dinner: RAW pork fried rice....disgusting! I ordered egg drop soup that tasted like the plastic container it was in, infused into the soup from it being so hot so that tasted gross. And then had ordered pork fried rice, and it's a good thing I looked twice at the food because my pork was looking some barely brown, pink and red colored. My friggin pork was RAW! How you gonna serve raw food?!?! I'm 39 weeks pregnant, I hope I don't sick for the tiny bite I took of the rice part and sip of the nasty soup....it wouldn't let me do 0 stars, but this is NEGATIVE ZERO STARS rating for the happy wok!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the food was atrocious. I'm perfectly fine with \"Americanized\" Chinese food, but this wasn't even up to that low bar. I was looking forward to a nice glutton like meal. I was famished. Unfortunately, as I type this review up, I can still see my un-eatable food just sitting there

First thing I ordered was their BBQ Pork: Pork was tough and flavorless and drenched in some kind of honey sauce. I could only stomach less than half; I gave the rest to my dog who seemed to enjoy it. Hooray for him

Moving onto their Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles: Oversalted, no flavor, and NOTHING like the actual HK style sauce. They vegetables that are traditionally found in the HK style noodles weren't even there. Abhorrent dish, they should be ashamed.

Lastly, I ordered the Beef Chow Fun. Flavorless. Period.

Extremely disappointed. The owners should be ashamed to call this Chinese food and the cooks either need to learn how to cook Chinese food (HINT: It's about the flavors, NOT drenching things in Soy Sauce or Salt) or get their taste buds examined.

This is unfortunate because they're a nice mom & pop shop, but still; with so many Chinese restaurants all around the valley, avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This is an ok place to get fast Chinese food, not the best but it is reasonably priced and simple. I really liked coming here for the convenience of it. They have a big selection, which is really nice; from meat eater to vegetarian you can find something that you like. I tried the vegetable lo mein the first time that I came here, I also tried a tofu dish. Both dishes were really hard to eat as they were oil filled and my lips were dripping from the oil in the dishes. I decided to try something a bit simpler the next time I went here. I got the vegetable fried rice with veggie spring rolls. I got home and the rice was mediocre, it was a bit crunchy and flavorless. I think a lot of their food is just reheated at the time you place your order. I think if you were to go here around dinner time when their good turn over is a lot you can get some pretty good food. 

I have only ever gone through the drive thru at this location and I have never had any issues with that. The parking lot is usually really full so that makes me think that this is a pretty popular restaurant. The staff is pretty friendly, so that is the main reason I keep coming back here for easy, fast food. I think that I will continue to try different things here as their prices are pretty reasonable and the food is ok."}
{"text":"I've had worse Chinese food, so I don't wanna totally bash the place. I had a lunch special, sweet & sour chicken and fried rice. The egg drop soup was so watered down I couldn't eat it. My soda was flat and my fried rice was old and burnt tasting. I do like that they use white meat for the chicken. An old man was our waiter and he was very nice. I tipped well despite the sucky food, the old man was pretty old."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, friendly & cheap. What else is there to say?!...oh yeah. I placed my take-out order via YELP, which made it even easier. I was in & out with my order in less than two minutes...in the middle of the lunch rush. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place may not look like much from the outside, but if you want good, simple Chinese take out, this is a great choice! Everything seems to be fresh, and has always been delicious and- this is key- NOT GREASY. I can't stand certain Chinese places (Chang Jiang on the East side is one) that serve you a cup of oil with your entree. No thanks! Anyway, this is great for simple dishes, and the service has always been good and quick. Super cheap as well."}
{"text":"Great value lunch special. $6.99 complete lunch include soup, egg roll, and 16oz soda. Place looks clean although the interior is a bit outdated."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Delivery driver couldn't find our house and in wrong neighborhood. Order came over an hour late and cold. Called and manager wouldn't do anything about it. Said they would be able to find the house next time. Not the first time this has happened with Happy Wok. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place always smells like someone died here. If you call for pickup, allow them an extra 15 minutes to make your food. Don't order the honey walnut shrimp either...unless you have no standards. From an Asian, avoid this place at all costs. You can do better at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Wasn't that happy with my first time trying this place ... got delivered \" salt n pepper chicken wings and orange chicken\". Everything was soggy and messy... $20 down the drain. Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is way better now that it's changed owners/names. I stopped going to the previous one( I think it was chengs?,) but decided to give the new one a shot and I'm glad I did. Great lunch specials, better food, and even the lady behind the counter was better than the previous place, my new go to lunch place when I'm in the mood for chinese."}
{"text":"No frills American Chinese food. The lunch special is a great deal. Entree with soup, egg roll, choice of rice or noodles and a drink for $6.99

The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews!! Every thing I order is amazing. One special highlight...the hot and sour soup!!! It is so amazing it will ruin you for anyone else's hot and sour soup forever!!!"}
{"text":"Glad this exists so close to my house. Plain lo mein + general tso chicken is my go to and have never been disappointed. Good hours and good food. Always happy with the food here."}
{"text":"We were staying at the comfort inn and wanted chinese.  I called and they delivered.  We ordered our food which came quickly was a lot for the price and very good.  The next time I was in Madison at the hotel I ordered from them again.  The food was good, the prices where very reasonable and the amount was very generous.  If I were to get there again I would order from them.  I forget what we ordered but it was good.  I know my son got a sweet and sour and I had something else.  They were good and they provided paper plates and forks and soy packets and napkins.  I was very happy with them."}
{"text":"Food here is okay, I ordered many times for food delivery and every time was different mistakes, Maybe you will wonder why i keep ordering to them, the reason is every time after delivery was made i called them and informed them what went wrong with the delivery, and they will apologize and tell you it wont happen again, like all the food sauce on my order was all over the plastic bag and no more sauce left, my food was cold because the food delivery guy didn't follow instructions on directions and do his way, im working in a restaurant and I am not perfect that is why i tried to give them chance to correct their mistakes, but just right now i called in for another delivery and omg! The guy who answered the phone for delivery hangs up the phone first before i did and didn't even bother to ask or confirm my address and how i want to pay my orders and seems like didn't want to make sales! Whats wrong with this people???"}
{"text":"Amazing service if I was basing this review off of that it would be 5 stars. The veggie fried rice was great. Chicken fingers not so much and there was a black hair in our chip strip things that came with the soup. Very oily"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to get Chinese. This location makes a mean General Tso's and chicken fried rice. Portions are pretty good. If you eat inside the place is always clean. Thought the drive up window was stupid at first, but it is nice to have. If you are looking for \"fast food\" Chinese, this would be the place. Just wished I still lived on this side of town."}
{"text":"If someone asked me how I feel about Chinese food, I'd do that thing with my hand where I put it flat at thigh level and say \"Typical take-out chinese food is like down here\" and then I'd put my hand over my head and say \"Sassy Sam's Chinese Food Emporium is wayyy up here!\" and THEN I'd put my hand at neck level and say \"But right here is Happy Wok and we get delivery from them like 8 times a week plus it's cheaper and we don't have to drive for North Carolina and book a week in advance like at Sassy Sam's.\"

So yeah. Good stuff and it comes fast as heck, though we do live close. We often get chicken fried rice, shrimp fried rice, chicken skewers, crab rangoon and steamed dumplings. All good stuff. 

We always order through EatStreet (phone app) and they have specials like free Crab Rangoon with $15 order. This deal might actually be on the takeout menu they give you but I've never read it and I have 30 of them in the junk drawer."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here about once a week, and we like how fresh it is... Customer service is unbelievably friendly these days,  they have gotten much better... However, there is still confusion regarding which sauces and dishes are vegetarian and/or vegan... After being a customer for several years, I still don't trust the kitchen or order taking staff to tell me the truth about fish oil in the sauce. They tend to say oh ok, and not take it seriously. So, do your own research, like I started doing. Now I will tell them soy sauce only.... Concerning. However, the staff is quite pleasant. And they recognize regulars. I will continue eating here, with extra caution, and will update this review after a few visits and see if the allergy/special diet awareness has improved or not..."}
{"text":"Happy Wok has gone downhill and after 10 years of bringing friends and family to this restaurant since they were just starting out, I WILL.NEVER RETURN. 

I called in at 930 and the\"husband\" answers the phone. He always changes the qualifications for sel"}
{"text":"Just had the Mongolian beef and the general tso lunch specials this week and they were both great! Fast delivery and the food is amazing. I definitely will be eating here a lot more. The wifey loves it too!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch.  They got our order wrong and argued with us blaming us that we ordered it and said yes when she rattled our order back to us with a HEAVY accent.   No apology no replacement no sorry just you order it I tell you order you say yes.  Never again."}
{"text":"Love their veg fried rice. Very friendly staff and quick in getting the order. Been my go to lunch place for the last two years."}
{"text":"Exploring the immediate area. Took a chance on this place because the reviews were so-so. Noone else inside except some takeout customers, good sign. Except there was just one other party besides us, who commented on the lack of music (it was weird because it was quiet). It was raining and cold.

Hubby did not like it. The food was lacking flavor. No seasoning. I added some hot sauce on the table and it was fine for me (in the beginning, thought it was ok). Hubby added lots of salt to make it palatable. After we finished, I thought, \"I miss Great Wall.\" Life's too short for lackluster food. 

There was a big aquarium, that was nice. There were white planter pedestals. Kind of mish-mash decor, didn't make any sense. Tile floor, I think the drapes were sheer or had some weird print on it, was it polka dot or striping, I can't recall. 

The kicker was that hubby witnessed our server leaving the bathroom, and could clearly hear the flushing (remember, no music, nothing) but was out the door (before the flushing finished). He didn't wash his hands! Gross."}
{"text":"I used to order here all the time. Until Friday night when my date and I decided to grab some takeout. Within 10 min of eating our meals we both felt super bloated and felt the shits coming. Fast forward, 2 days later and both of us are still sick! Not coming back here anymore. ?"}
{"text":"You know, apparently it's a lot harder to find Chinese delivery in my area than I thought. 

After an exhaustive search, we found \"Happy Wok\" aka the Chinese restaurant formerly known as 'Cheng's Express' and ordered the family dinner. 

The order arrived in pretty speedy fashion and was maybe slightly over what you'd hope to pay for standard Chinese. We got Sesame chicken (solid), Mongolian beef (average, could use more beef), wonton soup (average) and fried rice (average).

Overall, it's not bad, it's not great, but if you're looking to satisfy your Chinese urge in this area, and you're too lazy to visit the deliciousness that is Panda Express, this place is alright.

Three ***."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and they never disappoint. They are easily the cheapest Chinese place in town and continue to produce quality food. The dining area atmosphere is more of a fast food style but the price and speed make up for that. The family that run the place are very nice and will make a dish however you ask."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch here, & had to return for dinner.  Shrimp & snow peas, and chicken with vegetable medley.  Fresh. Delicious, & inexpensive.  Staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This review is for carry out. The service was very fast and friendly. They had a cool fish tank and the decor was very clean and attractive. 

We ordered egg drop soup, chicken lo mein, and cashew chicken. The egg drop soup was very good. It didn't taste oily like some restaurants. The lo mein was my favorite. It had lots of chicken and flavor! The cashew chicken had a brown sauce that I'm not used to coming from the east coast, I think it was sweeter or something. I would order everything again except the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Oh hello to the happy staff! 

The steamed dumplings are to die for.  House fried rice..  Yeah add that to the 'things id eat every day if I would collapse and die from a heart attack'..  and the crab ragoon keep doing what youre doing for those tasty nuggets. 

Prices are a bit expensive for the area but the amount of food you receive helps off set that a bit. 

Great little quick spot when youre craving something oriental."}
{"text":"There is nothing positive I could say about this food. I have never had such low quality Chinese food. Everything tasted the same and sauce was greasy and slimy. Today I regret eating this garbage and wasting the calories."}
{"text":"This was by far the worse Chinese food I have had in Las Vegas.  The Kung pao had zero flavor the water chestnuts and celery pulled any and all flavor out of the dish, it had zero heat there were red chili but I think they were just put in there for show.  The walnut shrimp tasted like old flour, the sauce was just mayo, super gross.  Lesson learned will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive thru and no one answered, so I went in to order. The guy taking orders felt so bad that he did my single order in front of the big group of construction workers he was waiting on. It was very considerate, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this place to pick up some egg flower soup for a patient in the hospital across the street. The problem that I had was that the staff wouldn't acknowledge me when I walked through the doors. There were no customers and two of the staff hanging out in a booth talking/joking with each other, one person behind the counter playing bejewled on his phone with headphones on and 1 more staff directly in front of me filling up a water cup. The door has bells on it so hearing me come in shouldn't have been a problem. I stood there in front of them for 5 mins and saying \"hello\" to get their attention (which they could hear me since I saw them looking over their shoulder) And kept ignoring me. I finally left and drove down the street to panda express. Egg flower soup is $6 at this place and $1.50 at pandas. I'll just go there instead since its cheaper and the service better. Hopefully this place will go out of business and they can put a different restaurant that deserves business"}
{"text":"I liked it! Our server was friendly and had great recommendations. This place isn't what some would call authentic Chinese food but for Americanized Chinese food, I think they did a great job. Our waiter recommended the Beijing Beef and garlic sauce green beans we're glad that he did. The Beijing beef was crispy and had a great sweet and spicy sauce. The green beans were perfectly cooked and that garlic sauce was on point. My fiancé absolutely loved both dishes. I  love eggplant so I also ordered the eggplant and ground pork dish. Tons of fresh bell pepper, onions and eggplant. Loved the flavor, reminded me of something my dad would cook. We also got free chicken skewers using their Togo menu coupon and their waiter also brought us some egg rolls. Super nice of them. 

Oh and they have quite an extensive menu, love the options. Can't wait to go back and try their sesame chicken (my go to Americanized Chinese dish) and x.o. Sauce green beans."}
{"text":"Large portions of good food for not a lot of money.  Friendly Staff.  They have a lunch special every day that includes a drink, egg roll/crab rangoon, and a lunch plate for around $7."}
{"text":"This was your standard chineese take out, which is what I wanted. The fried rice was good, not dry like previous reviews stated. The fried dumplings were deep fried not pan fried like I was expecting but the dipping sauce was good. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This review is about the Happy Wok in Monona, WI.
Ordered steamed dumplings, to my amazement they were stale and just heated up. I regularly order from the Happy Wok in East Madison, so I know how the Happy Wok dumpling looks like. I went back to the store and politely asked are these really fresh, I was told this are made here locally, but didn't get a straight answer on were they prepared same day! I showed them what the dumplings are looking like, I was told to try one!!! I left, tried one, and promptly had to spit out and dump the whole lot in garbage!!!

It could be one item was bad, but despite clearly looking (actually smelling too), they are trying to defend, amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty close to my place, reasonably priced and so far liked almost everything I have had, including all soups, dumplings, fried rice combos. One of the best Chinese in Sun Prairie!!"}
{"text":"Food's good. Fast too. Ive ordered delivery a couple times before foods always been good. Not as greasy and soggy as other Chinese places. The Eshang is my favorite here. 
Dine-in: restaurant is really clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a great value.  Fantastic food for the price.  Don't come in here expecting gourmet food, its Chinese, man! For what it is, it's delicious"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch mostly for the soup and it is good! I really dig having a hot option on cool, fall days - plus online ordering makes for very convenient pick-up. The people here are generally friendly and everything is always hot and ready when I get there. I definitely recommend the crab rangoons here too - little pieces of perfection! Yum. Generally speaking a pint of soup runs about $2 and if I chose to splurge on crab rangoons (4 pieces) then that will up the bill to an even $5. Not too shabby...not at all...."}
{"text":"Happy wok is great! The delivery person was fast and personable. The crab Rangoon is spot on. Egg rolls have some weird random meat Inside-wouldn't recommend. We tried the Happy Family which has delicious flavorful mushrooms. Crispy chicken is also flavorful. The portions are perfect size especially for the price. Definitely recommend for a comfy night in!"}
{"text":"Man took my order and repeated it back to me. My order came out and it wasn't what I had asked for. Turns out they were some how out to this product and he didn't know??? Offered me a free item and I must say the food was not great. Total waste of money..."}
{"text":"Always receive my delivery orders much quicker than they estimate. Food is always delicious. No complaints."}
{"text":"Oh no. I got food poisoning. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken (didn't look or taste fresh) and the combination fried rice (seafood,beef, chicken mixed) .. I had to call out to work. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great for your basic fast, greasy, vegetables and meat or seafood, with rice. Notable, they are very, very fast at putting your order together, and having it ready on time for pick up."}
{"text":"Free crab Rangoon with order - probably the best I have ever had. Really good orange chicken and good bourbon chicken. I prefer non breaded bourbon chicken but it was delish. Very quick delivery and generous portions. Heard good things at work and wanted Chinese tonight. Will order again."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place!  We've only done delivery but that has always been timely and the food hot.  My husband will get chicken fried rice.  I switch it up to try different things.  You get free items when spending X amount."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people!!!  Super nice family owned restaurant.  We had the sampler appetizer and everything was great!!  My husband loved the beef egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"First I have to say I'm super picky when it comes to \"American Chinese restaurants\". My family owned one when I was growing up and that is my standard. I've lived in Vegas for over 5 years and have searched far and wide for a decent place. I was beginning to think one did not exist. So I stumbled upon this place. For starters, the customer service was outstanding! They were so nice and even offered to help me to my car. The food was very good. Fried rice was excellent, egg rolls were great and the other dishes were excellent as well. This is now my go to spot. Prices were reasonable. If you're looking for good Chinese food, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch combo. Service was polite and food came out faster than expected. The food itself will not win any awards, but it's perfectly adequate for what it is: A fast food option better than the McDonald's around the corner."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Hot, fast and delicious!!  We will always order from them!!  Great delivery service!!"}
{"text":"I really like Happy Wok.

We order delivery from here all the time.

We received a menu in the mail after they changed owners/managers from the last incarnation (Chengs) that included some coupons for free eggrolls, crab rangoons, etc.

All of my roommates and I feel that the quality of the food is really good for Vegas.  Its hard to find decent Chinese food here in town.

Some of my favorites:
The Mongolian Delight:  Shrimp, beef, and chicken with veggies in a delicious brown sauce, with a small bit of heat to it.  Really amazing.
The salted fish and chicken fried rice:  sounds gross, tastes great.  Little tiny bites of a salty fish mixed with chicken fried rice...I don't even need soy sauce on this rice, it is that good. 
The Crab Rangoons:  amazing.  Just as good as when it was Chengs.  Not quite as awesome as Kung Fu Thai, but REALLY good.  Creamy, with noticeable pieces of crab.
Wonton Soup:  YUM.  Rich broth, yummy wontons...this is all I crave when I don't feel well.  
The Beef egg roll:  Strangely better than the chicken egg rolls, and these reheat beautifully. 

Service was very polite, and their delivery is always within the time they quote or earlier for us.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Staying in a nearby hotel... Ordered delivery and it arrived in 22 minutes!  Where I'm from in Southern California, you're lucky to have your food after an hour.  Yummy vegetarian options."}
{"text":"It's pretty good! Really quick delivery, nice service.  The reason not 5 stars is because the sesame chicken I ordered was pretty soggy (but still tasted good), and they didn't bring any sauces for my egg roll or my crab Rangoon, so it was dry. Btw, crab rangoon was probably the best I've had in town so far."}
{"text":"Don't judge it by the outside... Or the inside for that matter. Looks like most quick lame tasting Chinese restaurants... But the food is really good! I got the triple delight, which had large shrimp, lots of chicken and good flavor and ample quantity (enough i couldnt eat it all!) The hot and sour soup is really how I judge a Chinese restaurant, and there's had a great flavor."}
{"text":"Whenever we want Chinese food in our house, we order delivery from here. The lady who always answers the phone is SO friendly and helpful. Delivery is fast and always arrives before quoted time. We usually get the sweet & sour chicken and fried rice, both of which are great. We also get the crab rangoons which are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've ordered twice now with my co-workers for their lunch special. Lot's of food plus 2 sides and a drink for less than $10 which you can't beat! Their orange chicken and beef & broccoli with chow mien is very good. So are their egg rolls. I love egg drop soup but Im not a fan since it really bland. Other than that the place is pretty decent. Id like to try their almond chicken next. Their delivery takes about 45 minutes but pick up is much faster about 10-15 minutes when you place the order - just an fyi."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing fancy. Good food. The guy even fixed my left-over box with extra fried rice which I thought was cool.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Happy Wok is a quick grab for dinner when I'm heading to the parents.  I have had good service from everyone at the restaurant.  I never eat in but the staff is quick to fix a problem if I catch it before I leave or if I come back.

I do like the mei fun and the sesame chicken the best here.  I think they do a brisk business during lunch due to a couple of specials.  It's good and it's fast.  What more is needed?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never had a bad experience here. Food is always amazing. Always fast and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Just got take out. Honestly, it's some of the worst sesame chicken I've ever had. Way too much sauce and the chicken was super slimy. In fact it was mostly slimy breading and hardly any chicken. Staff was super friendly, and portion was generous for the price, but the food was just really bad. The wonton soup I got was better but not by much. Maybe the other menu items are better."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting to help us decide our take-out dinner: Mei-fun noodles (not greasy), double-cooked pork (spicy hot, delicious), egg drop soup, chicken rice soup, chicken fried rice. If you don't use the soy sauce or sweet & sour packets, kindly give them back so they are not wasted."}
{"text":"I come to happy wok quite often since the location is pretty close to my house. Their food is pretty decent. I usually get the orange chicken with rice and egg drop soup on the side. With my visit today I got sweet and sour chicken which wasn't anything special. They did give us free eggrolls with our order! The service is usually pretty good! They also give you wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce to snack on while you wait for your order. Their portions are also pretty big, so you do get a lot for your money. Totally worth coming for their lunch special."}
{"text":"I am happy that I found a decent Chinese restaurant close to my workplace. The food is good, not the most authentic but will do the job! The Wor wonton soup is tasty, orange chicken is yummy. The egg rolls not so much. The portions are big enough to feed two. Considering its a family owned business, I will return time and time again. I have vowed to help small businesses because I own a small business myself and we need to stick together!! The reason to why I knocked a star off is because of the out dated interior. Also, there is a water leak in the women's sink that makes the place smell humid."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was just slightly sad that my order was not exactly what I was craving and hoping to get. So I'd say depending on the dish you get, you may have better luck to like it more than I did with my order of shrimp & lobster sauce dish. 

So my boyfriend and I have ordered from Happy Wok a few times, usually for take out since it's an additionally $3 surcharge for delivery (not including tips). This time we ordered online through EatStreet and then drove through the drive through to pick up our order.

The service at the counter was fairly nice, one of the servers noticed it was snowing outside (light snow flakes fluttering earlier today), and there was a light exchange of pleasant chit chat. 

My shrimp dish had about three shrimps give or take one or two that I might not have found under the swarm of mushrooms. The dish itself wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I expected of a lobster sauce to be. It was more of a light sauce with eggs. So I barely ate any, and the rice also didn't seem the freshest.

I'd say that the sesame chicken was slightly better and the portions in that was quite generous. Thus, we'd most likely come back for more food in the future, but I'd probably stay clear of the shrimp in lobster sauce."}
{"text":"Be Careful! They'll rip you off!
I tried to order 3 items off the menu for delivery. With delivery charge and with tax, my order should have come to no more than $19.25. The person on the phone immediately stated that my order would be $22.01. ?? $22.01, I said? That's wrong. He seemed annoyed. I then quoted the individual prices for the items that I ordered and he said \"Well, the delivery charge is $2.\". I then asked him why the delivery charge on the flyer that they send out says delivery is $1? Oh, ok, he says. He then quotes me a price of $21.01. ?? Where are these prices coming from? I quote him the prices on the flyer again for the items that I ordered and he then says \"Ok, well $20.!!\" Are you even adding this stuff up? If so, why are you constantly going down in price? BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF ORIGINALLY WHEN YOU QUOTED YOUR FIRST INFLATED PRICE!! I finally just tell him to forget the order and hang up. Do you think your customers are stupid? That is really a scandalous practice of attempting to overcharge your customers. This was beyond a simple mistake. This was pure greed. I will NEVER order from them again"}
{"text":"Singapore rice noodles are delicious! Haven't had a dish this good since my dads cooking! 
Will come back"}
{"text":"You order no mushrooms-they send it as a fungus among us. You order it with hot mustard. You get nothing. You order extra spicy it's like the poured honey on it. They don't include it. Lousy service for a sub par order. Despicable. If they can't fill your order they should close up shop. Idiots!!!  Lousy.   Can't fill a basic order without multiple errors. Don't order from this place!"}
{"text":"I've never been here. This review is based on my experience ordering delivery through Yelp Eat24. That said, from the pics posted here, it looks like a typical, can't-throw-a-dead-cat, strip mall Chinese place. The menu is standard, typical and beige.

BUT

Everything I ordered was cooked fresh, seasoned perfectly, with none of those gunky, gooey sauces one usually associates with strip mall Chinese places. I will make tentative judgement that, among the Chinese delivery restaurants available from Eat24, this one comes in first! And the cost is very reasonable, the portions generous.

Out of all that I ordered, I think I enjoyed the wonton soup the most. The wontons were light, not chewy, and the filling was perfectly proportioned and not heavy at all. But it was the broth, a lovely, clear and golden broth that was fragranced rather than flavored. Really a delight!

I enjoyed the lo mein as well. It was the reason I chose this restaurant tonight. I'm not a fan if chow mein or chow fun, for one reason or another, and Happy Wok is the only place I could find it. The lo mein here was a touch greasy, but not annoyingly so, and while it didn't reek of it, the garlic came through very nicely. A tad short on the chicken, perhaps.

Chicken with snow peas, mixed vegetables, and chicken fried rice were also on our buffet table, all executed with skill. I usually find fried rice bland and have to add a ton of soy, but that wasn't the case here (okay, I added a touch, but not, like, a whole package.) the chicken was white meat, generous chunks, tender and not dry. The snow peas were still al dente, and there was a very nice assortment of veggies in the mixed.

I'm sure that there is better, more \"authentic\" Chinese food to be found at the many establishments that line Spring Mountain Ave, and some really good, but pricey, Chinese food on the Strip, but for delivery, I can heartily recommend Happy Wok! 

Oh, and in China, they just call it \"food!\""}
{"text":"I like this place for a quick Americanized Chinese food fix. You can either pick-up, eat in or they deliver. The menu is huge and I really like the  Egg Fu Yung. Things come in several sizes depending how hungry you are or if you are feeding a family. The people I have dealt with are very nice and personable and my food is always ready when I call ahead for pickup. Price is good too."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but the customer service is abysmal at best. Just had lunch there and the guy that rang me up when I ordered comes out and knocks on my car window saying I didn't pay for my meal. I told him
he was the one that rang me up and he said no he did not a lady took my order at the table and I need to come back and pay. After another exchange of the same thing and being accused of dining and dashing, I showed him my receipt that I had in my pocket. He goes \"This is yours?\" like he refused to accept I was telling the truth. No dumb dumb, I found it on the ground and put it in my pocket. Oh by the way thanks for calling me a liar and accusing me of stealing. I will never give that place another cent and I hope no one else does either"}
{"text":"thank you i order 15 minutes ago and the food is on my table all the sauce food is hot wow I love back Chinese delivery in Las Vegas thank you Happy WoK # 7023682888"}
{"text":"OOPS. I wrote a review of this Happy Wok when I meant to write it for the east side Happy Wok. My bad. 

Fortunately, I have ordered from this Happy Wok several times when I lived over on that side of town, so I will just *edit* my review to fit this location :) 

Delivery was always super fast here. One time we called for delivery when weather was less than ideal (Wisconsin Winter!) and we were so surprised at how quickly they were still able to get us our food. We made sure to tip the driver well! 

The food here is consistently really good. It never waivers. You know what your're getting each time, no surprises. I like that a lot. 

Some of my favorites on the menu include: 
-Egg Drop Soup
-Chicken Fried Rice, extra egg and extra peas (important!)
-Steamed Dumplings
-Snow Pea with Chicken
-Chicken Mei Fun

The folks in the restaurant are always friendly and efficient. I've never had to wait long for an order to be ready, that's great when you're in a hurry! 

This is a great Happy Wok. All the Happy Woks are great in Madison, though! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Okay, first of all - this is take out Chinese ya'll. Let's keep that in mind. We all know what we are getting. Delicious, sodium-packed containers of comfort food. And I wouldn't have it any other way!! :) NOM NOM.

Now, that being said, Happy Wok does fast-food take out Chinese very well! I have never had a bad order from this location, not once. 

Some of my favorites on the menu include: 
-Egg Drop Soup
-Chicken Fried Rice, extra egg and extra peas (important!)
-Steamed Dumplings
-Snow Pea with Chicken
-Chicken Mei Fun

We order from this location all the time at work and it is definitely a favorite among the office. And the are super fast with delivery! (Granted, we are super close to their location). Even over the busy lunch hour, we never have to wait long. 

They also have daily specials/discounts which is a nice added bonus and gives more bang for your buck! 

I am a big fan of Happy Wok."}
{"text":"I just walked in as I was really hungry and my son's school is down the street. The ambience was very \"fast food\" like. The egg drop soup tasted like cardboard, the chow mein was blander than what I'm used to, but the garlic pork was good."}
{"text":"Just got done with delivery.

Hot & Sour Soup: Rockin - but FYI has shrimp in it for those allergic to shellfish.

Fried Dumplings: Pretty good. Dipping sauce doesn't have enough ginger or sesame. 

Spicy Happy Family: Meh. Not spicy, even after requesting spicy, and just not very flavorful. 

Singapore Me Fun: Meh. Bland but for chili flake.

All in all, doubtful we will order again, unless just for soup, and make my own dipping sauce, or tweak theirs for the dumplings."}
