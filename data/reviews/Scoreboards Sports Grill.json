{"text":"This place is very friendly, food is good, Saturday nights are great, a game of pool and good food, will do recommend ."}
{"text":"This Bar is pretty cool its very big and lots of fun.  You actually have 3 bars in one.  One side has nothing but pool tables and a bar, you can even play cornhole inside. Then you have the regular bar side with a dance floor,  There is also a outside patio with a bar which is very nice.  Of course its only really open in the summer.  

Food is very good never had a bad meal.
I would say its a younger crowd but if you are in the area stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place for Browns games and my husband loves it because they have so many TVs he can follow a lot of his fantasy players.  The beer is always cheap, the bartenders are super friendly and on top of it and will remember you week to week, and the food specials are pretty quality too."}
{"text":"Was in a bad mood when I went to restaurant. Staff greeted me and my boyfriend. They were very nice,suggested items on the menu,we didn't know what to get so she helped us choose. We got the burgers at some bombs. All 3 of the bartenders checked on us periodically and made sure we was ok.The food was excellent,however the restroom could be better. Overall,this is a great place and we will be returning"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with the animals I work with and everyone enjoyed what they ordered including me so hey...
Yum!!!"}
{"text":"First of all.... I don't really care that you got busy. There's a reason people call in orders, it's because they want their food at a certain time. Second, the order was wrong. One person who ordered the skins actually received the potato cakes, they were not happy because it is NOT WHAT THEY ORDERED!!!! Luckily one of their friends offered them some of the skins they ordered. And third, the food was not hot anymore because it took so long to get it all together and ready to go. If you know that someone is going to be there to pick up the order at a certain time, you should have it ready to go!! 
Believe me, I will not be stopping in, calling in or anything else at this establishment any time soon. And i don't really care if that doesn't bother you. If you keep treating your customers like this, you won't have any! 
If I could give a minus for the rating, it would be a minus 5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay little spot lots of activities, ive been here probably 30+ times and everytime no matter what i order the food sucks!!!! Even the wings!!! Ive learned the safest beat is the caesar wrap , altho probably every other time the chicken is horribly dry in it. Pretty pricey foodwise for a bar ..."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service.  Saving grace is this place is insanely cheep.  1 dollar domestic drafts when i was there and $7 for a burger and fries."}
