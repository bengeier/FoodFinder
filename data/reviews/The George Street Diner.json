{"text":"This place rocks! A quaint little diner that makes the perfect greasy spoon breakfast, a mean Cuppa Joe, and Irish Soda Bread that my Irish grandma-in-law approves of. 

There are a handful of tables/booths so be selective about the time you arrive or you might be waiting in line for a little while. Good food and friendly service make it well worth the wait.

Oh, and I adore the Elvgren pinup menus."}
{"text":"I would like to say right off the bat, I am a fan of this place...BUT! today when we visited this establishment we were treated BADLY...I'm 45 years old, spent most of my late teens and early 20ties at night clubs, listening to LOUD music.. but never thought I would be subjected to LOUD MUSIC at a breakfast restaurant, even if it's at 2:00 in the afternoon, needless to say, we asked if the music could be lowered a little, NOT turned off, I wasn't being unreasonable.. TO which I was told \"I don't think I can,the cooks like it loud\" !!!  I mean REALLY? I'm only going to be in the place for the most 45 min's, you mean you can't lower the volume of the music for 45 min's? So I can enjoy a meal I'm Paying for!!  So let's finish the story, they lowered it a TINY bit, for 4 min's then a song one of the waiters liked came on, and he proceeded to turn the music back up, So again I asked if they would be so kind as to lower it, to which they turned it down soooo slightly that it made no difference at all..and after about 5 more min's it was back to it's original volume..at that point I was pissed beyond belief so I rushed ate my food and as soon as the last fork full was past my lips I left the restaurant and walked out the door, and my husband who was also bothered by the LOUD music didn't not leave a tip.. I won't be back to the George st dinner for a while now..maybe even never again..."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! I ordered the croque monsieur which was a french toast sandwich with ham ane cheese, it was delivicious! Had a nice salad and baked beans with it too. Definitely comfort food Service is friendly and I will def be back for this again!"}
{"text":"My far, my favorite breakfast place in Toronto!  If you're looking for a good, solid breakfast with friendly staff, look no further. The homemade jam is delicious, and I have no idea what they do to their eggs that make them taste so good!"}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to write a review for The George Street diner because I didn't want to let anyone in on my secret brunch place. I guess that the cat is out the bag so I will let you in on my secret. We've only been for weekend brunch so I'm only going to review that. 

The George Street Diner looks like a cool diner from the 50s from the outside. Inside, it is lined with booths on the right and the long counter on the left.

So many brunch places have too many choices that lead to slow service and substandard food. Not the George Street, they have a streamlined menu and I can vouch for the poached eggs on Irish bread with tomato and basil sauce. It will keep your motor running for the rest of the day. 

The service is prompt, nice & attentive. Every server that I've had has been Irish and friendly. 

The restaurant is clean including the bathrooms. 

good food + great service + clean restaurant + great atmosphere = 5 stars in my book

**Go early for weekend brunch. If there is a lineup, it's worth the wait.** 

shhhhhhh don't tell anyone else!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great atmosphere. 
Everything is open concept. Booths and sit-down bar you can see the kitchen from where your sitting. Usually when its busy I can over hear some customers asking where their food is, chill out cause you can totally see that the chef is busy. Soda bread is tasty, different. Banana chocolate pancakes are nice and fluffy. Portions are large for a good price. Servers are always welcoming !"}
{"text":"I've always been fond of this place. Though the prices are a bit higher than a typical diner the food has its own unique Irish- Canadian taste. The service however tends to be friendlier during the week... Servers seem a little stressed out when there is a rush."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this diner whilst looking for a food truck in the area -- loved the atmosphere and food was decent. I ordered the soup and sandwich special which was a spicy butternut squash soup with a veggie sandwich. The sandwich was particularly tasty with butter on the bread, toasted, with mayo, lettuce, tomato and cucumber. The wait was long, however, but otherwise a good place to go for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am scared this review will cause the brunch line up to grow around the block, but I can't hold back my excitement about this place, their people and their soda bread.

I've been eating brunch here for almost 2 years and this place never fails to deliver a perfect diner experience, complete with squishy, personal space invading booths, stools by the counter and bottomless cups of coffee. Their irish breakfast with a side of avocado is my go-to choice, although to be honest, I would eat an entire plate of irish soda bread and skip the healthy bacon and eggs. Order the marmalade and  your butter soaked soda bread will provide you with a serving of fruit too. Marmalade is fruit, right?  

The waitresses are super friendly and the combination of their attitude and irish accents put a smile on my face every time I visit. The bread will feel like an instant weight gain, but it will keep your tummy warm for a week, I promise."}
{"text":"Traveling by car from Oak Park, il, I needed a good homecooked meal. This diner is fantastic. Friendly waiters and great food. Try the Irish breakfast with the soda bread. You will feel charged up to do the typical tourist stuff."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst service I have ever experienced. They had a veggie burger on the menu, but I was told (after ordering it) that they couldn't make it. I asked what other vegetarian options they had, and was told that they had lots of egg-related options. I don't eat eggs, so when I asked if they had a salad and they said no, I asked what they had that a vegetarian could eat. The response from the server? \"Why don't you eat meat?\". I said \"I just don't\", to which he replied \"why?\" I found the questioning more than a bit trying, and just ordered some fries and a ginger ale. It took 30 minutes and two requests to finally get the ginger ale from the server. Needless to say I will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here at the George Street Diner. 

I was searching for a diner downtown that  I could meet up with a friend at for noon.  Found this online and though I'd give it a try. 

I waited only five minutes for a booth.  The building looks great from the outside, and has a classic diner look insider.  Great rock music played the entire time.

The cook saw me waiting and asked how many I was waiting for.  He passed the message onto the server.  I was seated and served quite quickly after that.  Multiple servers came by and asked if I was being taken care of while I waited for my friend to show up.

We each ordered the Irish breakfast, and I was completely pleased.  Having a hangover from the night before, this was exactly the type of food that I was seeking out.   The dish at first didn't look to be a huge portion, but I left feeling extremely full.

Scrambled eggs, 'Canadian Bacon', Irish Soda Bread (was looking to try this, and loved it), potatoes, beans, and a tomato.  All was cooked nicely.  Some jam came for the Irish bread, which was delicious.  When one of the older Irish ladies who works them came by (she wasn't even our server) and saw us eating the jam, she asked if we wanted to try their marmalades too and ran to grab it for us.  

They made us feel like regulars, and I'd like to be one if I lived in the area.  Great service, good and cheap food, and a beautiful diner appearance."}
{"text":"Roll out of bed, walk downstairs and grab a huge breakfast before work?  I'm in.  

Great people, great portion (who doesn't love a huge breakfast), and the coffee is surprisingly good.  

Will miss this gem when I move out of the city."}
{"text":"OMG Comfort food at its best! This is the place I drag my butt to after a tough exam. Soda bread is awesome, not quite as good as grandma used to make but a close second :P Its a super cute diner and I love the casual, student friendly atmosphere. The staff are always friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"This is a small diner run by Irish Women.  The decor is diner-ish and interesting.  Given the small size of the place storage is at a minimum and in the open.  The staff is always very friendly.

Parking is available on the street but it's limited.  the Diner gets very busy on the weekend so if you do go on the weekend, come early (before 10:00) otherwise expect to wait in line.

I've only been here for brunch so i can't comment on the other menu items.  i usually order the Canadian Breakfast which includes 2 eggs, bacon, baked beans, home fries, and choice of toasts.  i love the baked beans.  in fact main reason for coming here.  Price is a tad high at about $15 but won't stop me from coming back.

this is a nice place for brunch with a friend.  i recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has really changed...for the worse.  Horrid service. Rushed & rude. Short & snappy. Food and coffee was terrible. How can you ruin scrambled eggs and home fries? Apparently it's possible. And when I ask for extra crispy bacon, please bring me at least partially crisp bacon.  As you can probably guess, from my lonely star review, we will not be back. It is certainly not the diner it was when I lived in the 'hood a couple of years ago.  Shame.  Onward."}
{"text":"sweet waitress- great food - we got refered to it by a guy at a  Diner that was closed-very pleasant - a little pricey for what it is compared to Chicago which now seems cheap - great fries and club sandwhich- my son had a great omlet- walked in they were playing the Ramones- walked out they were playing Dean Martin- my kind of people"}
{"text":"This is as close as I've gotten to a genuine full-Irish breakfast in the 12 months I've been in Toronto. That's pretty much the best compliment I can give any restaurant! If the sausages didn't taste a bit like popcorn, I'd be fooled into thinking I was sitting at home in my local Irish-breakfast-fry-up-place in inner-city Dublin! You can't blame the restaurant for the sausages either; true Irish sausages can't really be replicated anywhere else. And this place does a better job at replicating them than any place I've ever dined in outside of Ireland.
 
Everything about my breakfast was yummy! And they serve Barry's tea!!! And soda bread!!
 
I admit I didn't look too extensively at the menu, as I knew what I wanted before I went in - a huge, unhealthy, deliciously tasty full-Irish breakfast. However, a quick glance at the menu showed that there's something here to satisfy most breakfast/brunch palettes, for those not willing to try Irish fare.
 
The interior is cool, resembling an American diner, with long, comfy sofa booth seats.  
 
Service was very friendly.
 
The kitchen looked a tad grimy and messy, this slight turn off prevents me from giving the George Diner five stars, but it's very close. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Great lunch experience. Greasy spoon food, old school tunes, and friendly and fast service. There was a line waiting for a table, but it moved along quickly. Don't be deterred. No complaints to be had."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today as I live around the corner. 

The interior is great, has that definite oldschool diner feel. The booths are tight, so if you're tall like my mum is, you're gonna be knocking knees. The stools at the counter are nice and short, though, so your feet are comfortably on the ground, unlike most diners.  

I ordered the grilled cheese with fries and my mum had the \"GSD burger\" with fries. The waitress was a little curt and the service was on the slow side. I'm sure that was the kitchen rather than the wait staff's fault, though. When we got our food, my grilled cheese was burnt on one side. I mean, black. There's no way they could've missed that. I was too hungry to bother complaining, so I scraped off the black with my knife. My mum said her burger seemed pretty overcooked. The fries were good, but certainly nothing to write home about. 

Overall, I was pretty disappointed. I'll probably give this one another shot and hopefully it's better."}
{"text":"Lil red Irish diner in the hood. How can you not pay a visit? Been here twice now on the weekends and have never encountered a wait. That generally means it's a). a terrible brunch spot, b). still relatively unknown and Yelpers haven't jumped on it, or c). they focus on food and people get in and get out. I'd say it's definitely not (a) and most probably (b). Lucky for me that people wouldn't think of Richmond St East for a lil brunch.

The food is a no-BS, fill-you-up and make-you-breathe-a-sigh-of-satiated, comfort, content-relief kind of food. They have specials of the day, which they may run out of if you show up late. This past weekend, they had an omelette on special with portobello mushroom, leeks and havarti and it was exactly what brunch should taste like. Plus, I did something I don't normally do - we ordered dessert! Neither my gf and I are big dessert/sweets people, but we love us some good apple pie/crumble. So, she convinced us to try their apple crumble with ice cream. Huge portion, but I wish it were a bit more crumble crust!! It is a nice change to see a resto making dessert in house - and they make it obvious that they do. The desserts sit out on the counter in big bowls and plates right by the front/cash register to seduce every person who walks by. What temptresses.

Service is friendly, homey, and just... genuine. None of this over-the-top service industry hospitality, but just real folks with real Irish accents being themselves. Will defo return for more brunch dates!

Atmosphere - 4/5
Service - 4/5

Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"Great little diner with good food and a friendly staff! Got the vegetarian omelette off the Specials menu and it was excellent. Hubs got the chorizo frittata and also enjoyed it."}
{"text":"FROM REGULARS TO NEVER COMING BACK. - and never bringing our friends here either.

My partner and I used to be regulars; but after terrible treatment, we are not coming back. We received terrible treatment from an older blond woman, who seemed to possibly be the manager/owner of the place. 
On Jan. 3, 2016 we wanted to introduce 3 friends to this place; eat together to bond and catch up before the holidays ended. All tables were full when we arrived for brunch (no problem). The older blond woman said we could sit at the bar and I politely said we don't mind waiting for a table. She rudely remarked with, \"it's the same food wherever you sit.\"  (I guess she didn't understand that we also came for the social experience of enjoying food and being able to talk with friends and face each other at the same time.) 
Now a group of 6 people entered and they are waiting behind us. They also did not want to sit at the bar.

The blond woman's rude attitude had put a damper on our spirits so we decided to leave. The worst part was, as we were leaving and the door closing behind me, I heard the same older blonde woman say, \"Well that worked out!\" (She meant it worked out for the new group of 6, but it also made my friends and I feel very unwelcomed. She was happy that we had left her diner.) How rude! We are never coming back, nor will we be recommending the place or introducing any more friends here."}
{"text":"I work close by to this diner. I have tried different dishes atleast on three different days. I didnt like the food. Quality was quite bad. I dont know how they manage to get that many customers during lunch. 

The chicken roll i tried was ok.  Their beef burger was terrible."}
{"text":"I used to live around the corner and frequented this adorable diner quite often. Definitely worth checking out if you live in the area!

The food is classic diner food - tasty, greasy and great for the morning after a big night. 

It's a quaint, narrow restaurant. Primarily old-school booths and stools filled with solo customers drinking coffee and reading the paper. There's not lot of space so don't show up with any more than 2-4 people, especially for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"over priced and weird combinations for breakfast. similar layout as the breakfast dinner fashioned on dupont and bathurst but not priced affordably. if looking for an all day breakfast.. go to eggsmart or cora's. breakfast should be priced at $5 bucks as other breakfast places such as sunrise etc"}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of my favourite diners in Toronto! It's quaint, small 
and serves awesome food! I go for brunch whenever I'm craving a good breakfast.

The bacon, eggs and toast fill me right up and they have quite a bit of variety on the menu. It's a small place, so Sunday mornings there's often a line up out the door, but the service is quick and usually the wait is short. 

The prices are good too, you pay for the food you get. I live two blocks away from this place and I always think of going here when I want a good brunch. I bring my family and friends here all the time!"}
{"text":"Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 7/10 
Service: 6.5/10
Overall experience: 7/10

There is not much to say about this place. In both a good and a bad way. 

I went for brunch. The food is standard, the service is standard diner (a bit rushed, a bit rude, but more in a \"this person has been doing this for way too long but isn't a bad person\" kind of way), and the cleanliness is what you would expect in an older diner. 

The bottom line: standard, nothing special."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon, rough around the edges kind of diner. The food was great, but the servers are kind of assertive and in-your-face. When a baby started crying, our server was all like, \"oh boy, don't do this to me\" and signed in frustration. The cooks looked like they were having a great time though! I love it when I see chefs having fun. I enjoyed my breakfast, finished every last bit. The place is kind of dirty, so if you don't mind the gross-ness and unkempt feeling of this diner, go for it...just don't expect a spotless, renovated place. It's got charm and age."}
{"text":"It's very clean, the eggs are organic, that says a lot about a place, the breakfast are large and really good, delicious marmalade, there was a little bit of a wait, but, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! I had the pulled pork benny and my friend had the rancheros; both were amazing. Staff were very friendly and it felt very authentic and southern."}
{"text":"The food is just alright. Nothing is amazing . The price is a bit high in terms of the food quality . I'd rather go to the Senator."}
{"text":"We'd been driving by this place for years, so finally decided to check it out.  We like old diners, greasy spoons and breakfast!

We both had the Canadian Breakfast, mine without bacon, my wife's with.  It included 2 Omega-3 eggs, home fries, baked beans, toast and fair trade coffee (except the decaf).

The food was average...nothing to rave about, and the service, though friendly, was slow.  (Not the servers fault.)

The breakfasts came to 16 bucks and change, all in.

Go for the cool feel to the authentic 60's diner (counter, stools, torn vinyl booths),  but if you want better food, scoot over to The Senator, a short 1 km away."}
{"text":"Love the diner vibe at this joint. The energy is so upbeat and the service is super friendly. The servers are so eclectic that you completely forget where you are.

For ambience and service it's a great place to dine and I'd definitely return for that. However I wish I loved the food more, which is the reason for my 4 stars.

I had the Irish breakfast combo with 2 eggs, sausages,  baked beans, home fries and Irish soda bread. Mostly fine but the home fries lacked seasoning and crispness, and the soda bread was just kind of dense and soggy. Next time I'd probably just get regular toast or the bread.

Overall definitely a cool joint to check out. They always have a short line.

Oh P. S. Be forewarned that dining space is super tight. There are booths that seat four but with ZERO elbow space and people's limbs literally have to hang outta the booth into the walkway."}
{"text":"Real people. Real place. 
and for a \"greasy spoon\" those eggs are quality and golden yolks like I've never seen, and you can tell the meat is legit and not your grocery store bacon. I enjoy the old school atmosphere... Did I mention the house made soda bread?! Irish breakfast every time!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner experience.

Food is good, service is great.

Can get hot inside

Coffee is good"}
{"text":"If I had an Irish aunt, I suspect this would be like coming to her house for breakfast. Friendly and welcoming atmosphere, sunny but a tight fit for seating, and tempting take home treats. Came on a Sunday morning, and a minute after we were seated there was a lineup. 

Food:
- Irish breakfast: definitely a must have if you've never had Irish breakfast before. 2 eggs, ham or sausage (or another egg), home fries, beans, and Irish soda bread. I'm not even sure what the soda bread is made from but I'd have it again. Their home fries are well seasoned and cooked right. 

Service:
- everyone was super welcoming, you could tell that this place was important to them. One of the waitresses was really good with the kid behind us."}
{"text":"Fun and quirky! This place is hoppin, but we were seated right away and served very quickly. I had the croque monsieur and it was so so good. A really good selection of food, solid staples and some more adventurous items."}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast and amazing breads. We had very friendly service and it was a very cozy atmosphere. Great deals and location."}
{"text":"I have been dropping by The George St. Diner for 14 years, back when it was called \"The Florida Tea Room\", and each owner has maintained a high level of quality in what they serve. 

This is a straight up 50's style diner that hasn't changed much since it was built. It's clean, has the standard counter with stools, as well as booth's, it's sadly not to big so on weekends you often have to wait for a seat. The wait is always worth it. They mainly are open for Breakfast and Lunch, Open Early, close early type place. 

Their breakfasts are amazing, the home fries are soooo good :)
The have a lot of speciality items that they make in house too such as Irish Soda bread and amazing frittata's. This is one of my favourite places on earth for breakfast, great atmosphere, great food and service. Very consistent. 

I love coming here :)"}
{"text":"End of an era. This used to be my favorite breakfast place but now it's just overpriced and underwhelming.  Don't bother getting the $12 pancakes, they give you a sliver of butter and 2oz of syrup for a stack of 3 pancakes, if you want more it's $2 for another 2oz of syrup."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place for brunch by a friend. 
The decor is your typical american diner with comfortable booths and bar seats. There was no line for a table and the staff were attentive. 
I ordered the pulled pork Benedict and my fiance ordered the Huevos Rancheros. We didn't have to wait long and the meals were tasty - more gourmet than you would expect from your average american diner. 
My only qualm with The George Street Diner is the prices. I felt it was slighly over-priced for what you got, although we did order some of the more expensive items on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved the Lunch Counter Retro Styling. Just not hipster enough for me. There were a few beards, but no discernible ennui or cooler- than- you bullshit.
We actually popped in because we needed a very quick breakfast and they delivered. Eggs were lovely with bright orange yolks and the bacon was delicious. Not so sure about the Mango in their omelette special, but I'm not taking off a star for something I didn't order. Maybe it's good.
Service was fast and efficient. I love that it's not a chain and the people there feel real.
Solid Brekky."}
{"text":"If you're going to make a deal with the devil, this is the place to do it. I mean that in the best possible way. It has the humorous laissez-faire attitude you'd find in a diner setting in a Neil Gaiman novel. We happened to wake up early, so we were the first ones in this morning. The Kinks were playing on the stereo, and there were tongue-in-cheek bits of memorabilia collected around the place that you wouldn't notice at first - a Virgin Mary night light, a \"zombies inside\" sign on a boarded up door, an old marquee from another bar. There are big booths along a wall of windows and a classic counter with comfortable yellow stools. 

The wait staff welcomed us in by cracking snarky jokes and singing songs. They all knew their stuff. For each table, if anyone needed changes or substitutions, they already knew what they wanted and then would one-up you. Challah toast? Let me bring you home made jam. No potatoes? I'll give you extra beans. Vegetarian? I'll add in extra veggies in place of the ham. Once the place filled up, almost everyone seemed to be regulars. They greeted each of them by name and asked about their lives. And if a curious stranger wandered in or someone happened to be eating alone, they made them feel completely at home. 

The fare on the menu is standard breakfast and lunch, but the real gems are what they make day to day. The preserves I had were homemade blueberry, and the challah bread was fresh baked like I make at home. They use real butter, real cream and real maple syrup. Home fries are big soft baked chunks of seasoned potato.  Pancakes came with a blackberry apple compote that was divine, and the fruit in it changes day to day. I had an omelet (today's special) with arugula, asiago, figs and garlic (they voluntary subbed mushrooms in for prosciutto for me). I spotted a deep dish pie on the counter, but was too stuffed to eat anymore. I may come back for it and a coffee after dinner. The coffee, by the way, was smokey and delicious. 

We've tried a lot of diners and brunch spots in Toronto, but this one immediately became my favorite. We'll be back again, with or without a deal to hash out."}
{"text":"I live down the street from the George Street Diner and have started getting weekly weekend cravings for their Irish Breakfast (including Irish soda bread, yum). Love the authentic retro feel (and their pin-up menus) too!"}
{"text":"They are famous for their breakfasts and brunches. Friends and I went to see a Zombie play there at night. Dinner was included in the package. GREAT food! GREAT desserts! Now I'm going to go back to try out their brunches! The servers are great as well."}
{"text":"The place is small and has limited seating but we went for a late brunch so we easily found a booth. This place is an Irish diner so if you're looking for some Irish Soda bread - you've come to the right place. It was my first time trying the type of bread and found it very soft (it's worth a try for sure). I ordered the omelette breakfast served with daily ingredients - tomato, basil, spinach and cheese. It was delicious which came with homefries and rye bread. My boyfriend ordered the Irish Breakfast which he said was pretty good as well. 

This place isn't like other brunch spots that provide you with a ton of food. It's just enough so you don't overeat/feel sick. The prices are very reasonable as well. 

Verdict: definitely worth a try and may go back at some point"}
{"text":"hmmm there must be a reason why just about everyone is putting this place as a 3 star, well i live across the street so its 4 star to me, -1 for the long line ups and no dinner service, small quaint place, good food and consistent, long line ups at brunch are expected because of the quality of food and service, ambience is meh but I guess its expected with its open kitchen concept"}
{"text":"This is not food destination.  The food is truly sloppy and greasy.  Not sure why so many people flock to this place but I was really disappointed.  I understand the nostalgia feeling but chipped mugs and plates are not sanitary.  Coffee and tea tasted like watered down brown stuff.  I really wanted to love this place as it is a block away from me but alas it is as I suspected a relic that is good to view from outside but don't bother spending money inside."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and finally an opportunity came up to brunch in the area so we picked this one.

Kind of a random experience.  The place is super cute and old school, which is likely both on purpose and presumably because it's actually old.  They were serving breakfast at the time but if we held out for about 20 more minutes, we could order off the lunch menu.

One of us opted for a regular breakfast which to be honest came out as nothing special.  I opted for the special of homemade chicken fingers, which were excellent.

A few odd service related things happened while we were there.  The male servers were either super attentive or noticeably absent from seeing how we were doing.  Our waters were never filled up once, except when they delivered the bill (a little late by now).  And any request we had was usually met with confusion or surprise despite not being all that surprising (such as sauce to dip the chicken fingers in??).

Pretty random experience.  Breakfast is definitely a no-go in the future here but maybe if a lunch special looks good, I'd come back.  Won't be running back for repeat business anytime soon however."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to come here for ages and finally dipped in today with a pal. The music was great (lots of 70's soul), the atmosphere was very friendly and the staff managed to upsell me from a simple chocolate chip cookie to an improvised ice cream sandwich (two cookies with a load of vanilla in the middle, on a plate with some small bits of strawberry).

I'm not a guy who generally lets himself be upsold on anything, anywhere, so this alone impressed me!

I felt neither chased nor under-attended and the only reason I'm not giving them a five star review is because I don't feel comfortable doing that for a place whose menu I still every much need to investigate - something I absolutely plan to return and do."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite place to eat last year, I am so heart broken to see how the quality has run down A LOT over these months.

The service was in your face as usual, however except for the dish washer nobody wore appropriate attire to be handling food.

I came in an hour before closing, hoping it would be alright, i immediately ordered my favourite meatloaf with mash potatoes salad and gravy, I heard them saying they didnt have any gravy left.

When i got my dish i was ASTOUNDED by what I recieved, there was absolutely no gravy, I had enough gravy to maybe eat a quarter of meat loaf, it was thick pasty and pretty much the buttom of the pot, the meat loaf was difficult to eat I caught multiple DISGUSTING pieces of meat which almost made me vomit, the salad dressing was NOT stirred or shaken enough and all i had was oil on pieces of green. and while i was eatten horrible burnt smell lingered everywhere, their cooking counter top was burning from left over food but the chef continued to cook ontop of it. 

I loved this place so much, and I have so many fond memories from here, but this experience was by far the worst. I really do hope they improve, I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"George Street Diner is a classic diner. The diner is outfitted with a retro and old school vibe.  When you step into the diner, it feels like you have stepped back in time - to the 50s. In fact, the F-Word was filmed at this diner. 

The prices are reasonable. The service is attentive. The food is surprisingly high quality. The diner uses high quality, local and organic ingredients.  I got the Irish Breakfast which comes with two organic eggs, sausage, a seared tomato, beans, slightly spicy home fries and Irish soda bread. The portions were generous. It hit the spot. 

For a throw back to simpler times, I would recommend George Street Diner."}
{"text":"Fluffy pancakes and great (dark) rye toast. We loved the homemade touches: a miniature smoothie came with the omelet, and house made blackberry jam with the toast."}
{"text":"This diner deserves a better average rating than its current one to say the least. Now perhaps it is my Irish roots and love for Ireland but it has that Irish pub energy right in the heart of Toronto that makes you want to eat there multiple times a week. My veggie quiche was perfect (great consistency which is hard to find in a quiche), great service and an Irish soda bread to compete with what you would find in Ireland. Can't wait to visit again when next in Toronto! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The Irish breakfast is a must! the service is brilliant!! And the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The orange juice is a bit expensive though."}
{"text":"Most Saturday mornings, my boyfriend and I wake up around 10:30a and start contemplating where we're going to go for brunch. This particular Saturday morning we were up even earlier because he had to go into work on the weekend. Being too out of it, I let him 'call the shots'. Next thing I know I'm at the corner of Richmond and George. In front of me is a bright red bricked diner, which serves all day brunch. Um, hello? How have I not heard of this place. I'm walking around calling myself a 'brunch whore' and I missed this corner hugging gem?

I'm a sucker for diners. The row of booths, open kitchen, straight talking staff and greasy food. George Street has all this but is a bit different. Owned by an Irish Family, they've brought a little more class to the word diner and at the same time, made it their own by adding Irish touches to their dishes. There was a lot of warmth pouring in from the windows, which covered the right wall. I could have definitely emulated one of those people who sit in diners all day reading a newspaper. 

What I loved: The staff were Irish, they make their own Irish Whole Wheat Soda Bread and their own marmalades! They also sell it at the front if you didn't quite get enough. They bring both marmalades to the table when you order toast for free.

The menu was fairly straight forward, offering your typical classics with an Irish spin, and some special omelets and french toast of the day. The also have a lunch menu with sandwiches, salads and other lunch delectables'. I ordered the Poached Eggs in a Tomato Basil sauce. The eggs were huge and cooked perfectly. I wasn't blown away by the sauce and also found the bread got too soggy too quickly. I also felt the basil couldn't breakthrough the tomato sauce.  Me likey my basil. 

I enjoyed my experience at George Street but I don't think I'll be heading back this Saturday or Sunday...too many brunch places and only one mouth to feed."}
{"text":"I want to love this place....I really do...but I can't. Great atmosphere; quaint, small town and charming. Great service. Really feels like a diner. But the food is bland and it's overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Cons: None

Pros: A typical diner style breakfast with a cozy nostalgic atmosphere. If you are looking for a decent, reasonably priced breakfast, this place is a good option.  Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review -
\"The frittata was thick with an almost spongy texture. We both enjoyed it, however the serving was size was a bit overwhelming.\""}
{"text":"Homemade jam. House cured bacon and ham and good coffee. We usually get their lattes.  They also make their own Irish soda bread which is very good. Combine that with a welcoming casual diner atmosphere and you have a great Saturday morning breakfast spot.   The neighbourhood certainly knows about it!"}
{"text":"While enjoying a long weekend getaway in this party of the city, I couldn't help but notice this traditional style diner across the street from the condo I was staying in. Intrigued by its natural look and flare, I decided I had to try it. 
I went in at about 1:30ish, and waited about 10 minutes to get a booth (no worries). Sitting inside, I loved the feel of the diner....it had everything you'd expect to experience!  Still deciding on what food to order, the friendly waitress asked what drinks we'd like to start with, and I couldn't resist trying their fresh squeezed lemonade.  She brought a nice tall glass, and also brought a tiny squeeze bottle with sugar water to sweeten however I like.....veeryyy cool imo! :)
I ended up ordering their French Toast and was not disappointed in the slightest in regards to its taste! Had to wait a little bit for it to be cooked, but perhaps hat was because there was only one cook and quute a number of customers. They served me 6 half pieces of French toast.... I dont think you can get that mich food for the price I paid anywhere else!! It tasted fabulous,  and tge waitress came by mid meal just to check in and ensure all was good. 
I loved my experience at George street diner, if you're looking for a traditional diner experience,  I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Live around the corner from this place and always a joy to grab brunch or breakfast here. 

- atmosphere and staff are awesome. Busy, fun, energetic with a hint of nostalgia. Staff are authentic, friendly and personable.
- good is really good and consistent
- soda bread!! Delicious!
- line ups are pretty standard but move quickly

negatives:
- a tiny bit pricey for a diner but not out of market. 


Recommendation: poached eggs in tomato basil sauce on soda bread."}
{"text":"A welcome place for breakfast or lunch.  A major plus in my book is that they serve Barry's Tea from Cork!  The owners Irish imprint on the place is evident.
Customer service here is an art.  The staff are eclectic and amazing!  A true destination diner!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely greasy! So gross, no salt no flavor, ambiance was alright, employees were polite but not very welcoming. Overall my experience was no good."}
{"text":"It's good. It really is, but it's not perfect. There are several places in the city that offer similar quality for better prices and with more room.

It's very busy on weekends and it only sits about 50. It took 45 minutes from being seated to food on table when I went. The staff was friendly, but a bit disorganized. The food was hardy and well prepared.

I had a veggie omelette and quite enjoyed it. Had baked beans as a side and loved those (but I'm a sucker for baked beans). My g/f had a Irish breakfast -- her comment was the eggs were well prepared. We both enjoyed the meal, but will probably not return because of the bad experience on wait time and price. We paid $37 (tip in) total. You can get as good a breakfast for about $15 cheaper in Toronto."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been in this dinner (although I dig the appearance), but my work did order meals for overtime working employees a few weeks back. I had the fish & chips and it was very good. It was a big piece of fish instead of just a minnow swimming in deep fried batter, and it also came with a very unique tartar sauce. My best guess was that it was some kind of home made horse radish and lemon blend. 

Give it a shot if you are in the neighbourhood.

{"text":"Worst service. Food was okay , small portions but didnt taste bad but this one irish server and his boss (lady) treated us very badly and I am never going back again. She told us to leave as soon as we finished our brnch and I heard the irish man say we are pissing him off behind the counter when I went to pay.. very disappointing."}
{"text":"You'll notice George Street Diner from its neon-red sign at the corner of Richmond and George Sts.  Come for a retro diner experience: the decor, the staff and the music point to a different time.  The food, however, is less remarkable.  The food is decent, but I was disappointed by their coffee, which I found pretty bland tasteless and bland.  When I came, I had the Western Omelette (I believe).  It wasn't anything special, but it was disastrous either."}
{"text":"A hearty, plentiful and tasty breakfast awaits in this no-frills diner.  The Irish Breakfast is a signature dish and rightfully so -it was really good.  The pear and brie omelet was a hit with my dining companions.  Fresh orange juice. I expect no matter what you tried here, you'd leave satisfied from the large portions, to good food cooked here and especially for the friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"I don't know when I'll be in this part of town next but I'm glad I gave it a try.

The layout is like a throwback to the 50's or 60's minus the jukebox but you have the thick cushioned red shiny padded booths and large counter facing the kitchen, plates and cutlery.

The menu contains your standard diner fare ranging from comfort foods, burgers, sandwiches and some all-day breakfast plates. It's also limited to one-page which I'd prefer from a local diner over the pages and pages of items you'd find all those franchise family restaurants that lose focus by offering way too many options. 

The prices of each dish are quite reasonable where the majority of entrees range from $9 to $13. I had the meat loaf on mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy with a side salad and my cousin had a burger with fresh cut fries. You could tell the food was homemade.

If you have the expectation of a gourmet meal, go elsewhere, but if you want a good diner meal and you're in the area, you can't go wrong with this place.

Oh yeah, the service was pretty good with each of the wait staff helping each other out with respect to order taking, bringing out the food and fetching your bill. It's not the type of place where the wait staff put on a show and try to be rude to their customers."}
{"text":"I have personally eaten at The George Street Diner many times and three things are always consistent!

1. The service is generally always friendly, slow, but friendly
2. The food and service is consistent
3. The food is always FABULOUS 

Without doubt, a wonderful place to eat and a restaurant I always enjoy returning too!  I hope you enjoy and have as good a meal and experience as I do."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the George St. Diner for a few years.  Great ambience (a real 'diner' in the heart of downtown) - but will not be going back after an experience I had yesterday.  My partner and I arrived around noon only to be faced with the rudest person I've ever dealt with in a restaurant setting.  The female server, about 35-40 years old, ponytail, glasses - was ridiculously wrong for the job.  She was rude to people in line, rude to people at tables.  When we were offered two seats at the bar and we said \"We'd rather take a table, thanks\", she literally said \"Well go stand in line again then.\"  When the party in front of us had 3 of their 5 party there, she said \"No way, we aren't doing that\", (meaning, they can't get seated until the rest of their party arrives.  That in itself is fine, but how about \"Sorry, we can't seat you until your entire party arrives, to make this fair to other customers\".  Then, when a table became available, she honestly did a \"c'mon, hurry up\" hand gesture to \"move us along\" to our table.  I hope the owner of this place reads these reviews because I'm telling you - the other waitstaff were apologizing on this server's behalf and other customers were talking about how rude she was.  The owner lost us as customers yesterday."}
{"text":"Crazy busy lil' place.  Not bad food.  Fun-loving staff there.  Would love to see a jukebox there to add to the nostalgia!"}
{"text":"For breakfast, quite enjoyable. Tip, look for bar seats, definitely best seats in house to see them do their thing.

The soda bread is delicious. I love the design of this place, has that diner look if you love it, and I do.

Looks like they've shoot some movies here as well, I can tell why. The only thing that doesn't work here cause of the bar stools is you gotta place your jacket at the back.

Otherwise, food is delicious."}
{"text":"I got the Irish Breakfast, it was great! I never tried Soda Bread before, it was good but it's not for me. The pricing was on point too!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch for the first time earlier today. The food was average for a greasy spoon. The worst part was the service. Our server was an older blonde woman who was incredibly rude. We asked a simple question when ordering and were scolded by her for no reason - it was very embarrassing. Despite living down the street, I will never go back. Save yourself the humiliation and go to the Senator instead."}
{"text":"My goal is to hit as many of Toronto`s diners as I can. Now I can cross this one off!

This awesome joint is just east of Jarvis and as I would say, a place to go just for the experience. 

Run by a genuine Irish family, you will find fresh, brown Irish Soda being served.  I had expected the white toast version of this classic.  Instead, I had a chance to try another popular Irish version of creating this bread. It`s tasty. Reminds me of muffins because of the buttermilk used to make it.

Now the breakfast was not spectacular but filling for a modest price.

Besides the atmosphere the reason to go is the customers service. Fast and friendly.  We  were impressed!  Despite the food, I could come back here just because I felt so welcome to come in and try their wares."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for brunch, but would only say it's got average food. Not sure why there's always huge line ups for this place. The atmosphere is definitely great though, has a very classic diner vibe and feels movie-esque. Would recommend sticking to their basic breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I ended up at the George Street Diner by accident this morning for brunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The space is quite small so it is easy to see what other people are eating. I saw high fritattas and quiches coming out, beautifully french toast and massive stacks of pancakes. I had the light breakfast, two eggs, grilled tomatoes, toast and fruit for $8.95. My eggs were poached and the right amount of runniness to scoop up with dark rye toast. The fruit was so-so but overall, yum. My brunch date got the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Each pancake was the size of the plate. Huge portion and a fruit cup was served on the side. The service was excellent/very attentive. They had a decent matcha green Japanese tea and the coffee is fair trade organic. This might be my new fav, low key, quick breakfast joint downtown. I would totally drive downtown to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I am visiting this week from the States and fortunately staying right next door.  The first thing we did was google the menu for carry out --- as we have a canine traveling companion,  The young man who answered the phone was extremely courteous and helpful despite my many American (possibly clueless) questions.

Our order was prepared and ready within 10-15 minutes.  I ordered the mushroom bisque, egg salad sandwich on rye, fresh squeezed orange juice, and a chocolate chip cookie.  The mushroom bisque, itself, earns 5 stars as far as I'm concerned - deliciously thick broth with chunky pieces of mushrooms.  Both the soup and the sandwich were delicately seasoned and an addition of salt and pepper would have been a travesty.

Let me just say this:  we picked up our lunch from this diner every day this week --- despite the fact that downtown Toronto has a plethora of trendy restaurants that offer carry out.  If you enjoy home style cooking at its best - this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and the food is pretty good, nothing amazing, though I do like their Irish soda bread. My main issue was with the service we received on our last (attempted) visit. It was a late lunch and I was waiting for a table for two and was told it wouldn't be long, and it wasn't. A few minutes later a table opened up and when the guy came to seat me, he asked if the person I had come with was with me. I told him he was just parking the car, and would be in in a minute. The guys reply was \"well he's not really here then\" and he then gave the table to the couple who had just walked in behind me. I've never had this happen before, and he was really rude about it, so we left and won't be returning. There are many other options in the area and I'd rather not be treated like that at any restaurant, especially one that's supposed to be a friendly little diner."}
{"text":"Had a great hardy breakfast here. You can tell that the food here is fresh and homemade . I recommend the Poached Eggs In Tomato Basil Sauce. The eggs are served on Irish Soda bread ! 
My family had the blueberry pancakes , they were very light and fluffy ."}
{"text":"Hygiene is an issue here, food sitting without a cover and wait staff coughing in their hands while serving."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food with excellent portions.  Was pleasantly surprised and would definitely go back. Approx. $40 for 2 ppl. Small quaint diner with limited seating."}
{"text":"Somewhat Friendly staff but less then accommodating. As a gluten intolerant person toast is not an option 4me as well as a $3 item if ordered on its own. I explained to young lady that I was gluten intolerant and asked if I could have the beans a $3.50 item if substituted and happy to pay the difference. She barely listen to me and in offhanded way as she walked away after taking our order said its additional cost item. We got the expresso coffee which was lukewarm and then in timely fashion  the breakfast items arrived. Mine w/o toast and a side of beans. I again asked the delivering waitress if that was an additional charge as I could not eat the toast and she looked at me as if from outer space and with a certain amount of blankness in her face and replied \"addition charge.\" I told her to keep the tiny bowl of beans and set about to eat my western omelet which was ok. Bit bland but palatable. 

These people were busy and it's a small place however I don't think I am the only wheat intolerant person in the village and these people were not at all accommodating. Only too happy to charge substantially more on an already costly item. I think the omelet was like $12.50 plus $3:50 or $17 for 3 eggs and a spoonful of beans and hash browns. Not a very good experience. These people are living in a bygone era if they think they can ignore the health needs and wishes of their customers.  Better go to a place that is better trained and willing to accommodate the needs of its clients."}
{"text":"We were meant to do an early brunch (I know, that's called breakfast) on our last day in Toronto, but we got to our first choice a bit late - they open at 9 - and everyone has just been seated so we knew it would be awhile. Some locals started off somewhere else, clearly awares of the surroundings, and we tagged along with a \"where you going?\" They decided to hit George Street Dinner instead of stand in the street so we followed. 

This is a great diner. Seriously. They specialize in Irish soda bread so two of us focused in on those dishes. There was a club sandwich, the tomato basil eggs over soda bread, trad' Irish, and croque monsieur. Everything was fantastic; coffee is good; service is great; soul music soundtrack was a great surprise. About CAN$60 without tip. Great place."}
{"text":"A wee bit disappointed. First off, the atmosphere is truly vintage 50's and currently decorated for Christmas which I loved. I fully expected Jimmy Stewart (It's a Wonderful Life movie) or Santa himself to come through the door. Had ham and over easy eggs, beans, home fries, fried tomato and toast. The toast which was Irish soda bread was fantastic. The beans were from a can which I saw but that's OK, the eggs were very much over easy and lacked any kind of substance,  The ham was kind of a shaved Mapleleaf sandwich ham slices. So needless to say I was disappointed with the breakfast. I need to try it again."}
{"text":"BEWARE!

I went there for lunch and got a dirty glass filled with orange juice reside from the last customer. I noticed at the end of my meal and when I tried confronting the staff they didn't care.

AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot.  All their food is homemade, the service is always pleasant.  Love their homemade bread and soups.  Love the to go bread kits.  Lovely and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Even though I am only giving this 3 stars I sorta love this place.  I like the feel of the place, I like the owner and the food tends to be okay.  It's also close to my office, and they have great booths.

But, the food is just okay (consistently),and  the waitress seems to get overwhelmed easily and can be a bit curt.  I'm not sure why I frequent this place as much as I do - it must be because they have fries, grilled cheese, and beer.

The baked goods on the other hand, now those are dynamite!"}
{"text":"Great place for a greasy breakfast like mom would make! It is a typical dinner atmosphere. Staff is extremely friendly and will make you feel at ease right away. The food itself is very good and comes in generous portions. Service is fast and efficient therefore, it's an ideal place to have breakfast if you only have 30 minutes to do so. The prices match the quality of the meal. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I live nearby and grab brunch at The George Street Diner almost every Saturday. The lines are never too bad, unlike Le Petit Dejeuner on King. I almost don't want to write a good review because it's such a neighborhood gem. Friendly service, tasty food, great atmosphere. I'm always happy when there's a benny option on the Specials menu/chalkboard. Go for that if you get the chance. One little thing I've noticed is that some of their cooks make home fries/potatoes a lot better than others. But that's only something you'd notice after eating there for years :)"}
{"text":"Fine, I'll let you Yelpers in on one of my brunch secrets.  The George Street Diner is this really hip and cool brunch place that looks like it's operating out of a trailer.  Farm fresh eggs, like the real farm fresh eggs where you can tell it's straight from the farm because the yolk is dark orange - that's just one thing that sets this place apart from your usual breakfast place.  The other things that sets it apart include freshly squeezed orange juice, the real stuff from real oranges and not that Tropicana BS that gives you acid reflux; and the amazing baked soda bread.  My favourite breakfast dish is the huevos rancheros, which is a Mexican style breakfast that comes with a tortilla, beans and guacamole.  It's huge and I can't finish it.

There's not a lot of seating in this place, as it has those old style booths and little stools at the counter.  It wouldn't be ideal to come here with a group larger than 4.  Surprisingly I don't see line-ups out the door, but the restaurant is usually quite full."}
{"text":"We came in at the right time because we were seated immediately, and a large rush came in right after. This diner is delicious. They even made me a Poutine which wasn't on the menu. The service was quick, and very friendly. I feel it was well worth the price for the experience. I'll stop here again next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe and the staff, but not the food. It was, overall, bland and uninspired.  I got the tomato basil poached eggs...  The eggs were organic, with deep yellow yolks and poached to perfection.  The Irish soda bread was nice, but it was cold. So my hot eggs were ladled onto cold bread.  The baked beans were typical canned, sugary beans.  The tomato sauce was okay, but had no discernible flavour.  The potatoes were bland.  The food took a long time to arrive. I was disappointed that almost every menu option had pork/meat in it.  There was no basic eggs/toast/spuds option.  I liked that there's no teevee.  I liked that my order is going to result in a meal for a homeless person.  How cool!  Bottom line: I really wanted to like this place, and like the vibe and the workers, but just couldn't go back after that meal."}
{"text":"They served me coffee in an epicly large mug and the club sandwich with avocado is quite incredible. Ray D gives this place 4 Ray Ds up!"}
{"text":"cool interior..looks like i walked into a pulp fiction film. samuel jackson was about to come in and whoop some serious ass. tried the turkey breast foccacoia bread wit avocado. not bad..wish they toasted it. i also had buddy try out some garlic bread wanna be. irish soda bread..wtf is this? seriously? fn thing sucks!! hahahaha anyways cool interior foods aight not bad"}
{"text":"VIBE 
A down-home diner is a nice staple in this nabe filled with condo dwellers and George Brown College students. I came here on a Saturday morning. I wouldn't say it's bustling but the staff are definitely busy. Get in your requests while you can! Love all of those cherry red booths lined up beside the window. 

I ATE 
Traditional Irish breakfast (eggs, my choice of sausage, beans, soda bread). I always remembered soda bread lacking flavour but this was punctuated with apple accents. They also had a pear spiced jam and it was delicious! Definitely the highlight of the meal and you'll be satisfied at $10. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Get here early. It was the second time I had to stop by b/c the first time had too much of a wait. And that's the other thing: if you see a stool at the bar, just go. They're not exactly going to come up to you and seat you unless you're in line for a booth. 
Very homey. Me likey."}
{"text":"Ok so yes I have seen this diner in way too many Hollywood movies and the fact it's on the East side and in my neck of the woods I had to go in and give it a try...upon walking in it's definitely smaller and narrower then it appears on the movie screen..there is a sign that says \"economy has tanked prices has gone up but we love you so our prices have stayed the same, so with that in mind we ask you to pay in cash or use debit.\" UM ok cute sign...also the staff is wearing T Shirts which say George Street diner..cute...their walls also have posters of films which were shot at the diner like the F Word and Date with Miss Fortune...both were good movies :-)

First thing I noticed on their menu was organic eggs, second thing I noticed was their house made \"soda bread\" and third was the freshly squeezed OJ/Grape fruit juices..which all earned thumbs up from my end...

But it was their a la cart style menu that put my mood off. My friend ordered 5 pieces of jalapeños with his omelet and was charged $2.50 for the five pieces of peppers... The bill for two people was $40...a bit too steep for a diner...but I guess we were at a \"famous\" diner so it was expected...not worth a while if you're looking for eggs toast n juice for breakfast!"}
{"text":"George Street Diner (GSD) is a George Brown College (GBC) student staple! It's a classic diner, with booths and seats along the bar. The staff, who seem to be mostly Irish, (they serve Irish soda bread, and you can buy the dough to make it at home!) are so friendly, and will go out of their way to accommodate you! 

They have delicious breakfasts, including \"The Canadian Breakfast\" (eggs, bacon, toast, home fries and baked beans) and a lighter option that comes with a fruit cup, toast, and eggs. They also serve delicious grilled cheeses, with home fries and you can add in tomato, bacon, or avocado (or all three!). 

They start lunch around 11:30, and have a daily lunch special of half of a sandwich and soup or salad. I've only been for lunch a few times, but they have a solid menu including sandwiches, burgers, and other diner staples. 

It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love coming to George Street Diner! The atmosphere is lively and fun, the servers and staff have always been great, and the food is wonderful. It feels like home in here, and the food has that home cooked quality one looks for in a diner setting.
The Irish breakfast is to die for and the soda bread is something I crave constantly! Love the Canadian bacon too. 
I will continue to come to this joint for a long time. 
PS it gets pretty hot temperature wise in the summer as it's open kitchen!"}
{"text":"Worth our walk from the hotel in 16 degrees!  We both ordered the Irish Breakfast, based on the Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed. The food was cooked perfectly but the star of the show wast the Irish Soda Bread. This is standard diner fare but the options on the menu are diverse in how it's prepared.  There is definitely a spin towards Irish cooking. The employees were very pleasant and laughing amongst each other the entire time we were there - just having a great time serving all of the customers. It's a very hometown feel in the diner and you can tell it has regulars.  The food was great and we loved the ambience.  Very small so if you have a large party it may not be accommodated - booths and counter seats only.  Don't expect fancy decor but expect a great meal and laughter."}
{"text":"Full points for an authentic diner experience.  I love the feel of this place, it is so welcoming and relaxed.  I first had their irish breakfast to go and my colleagues chastised me for not staying and eating there.  So I went again and I really enjoyed the experience.

The Irish breakfast is a fantastic affair with tasty sausage, eggs done the way you like it, homefry style potatoes, grilled tomatoes, baked beans and two thick slices of their irish soda bread heavily buttered for extra yum.  Their marmalade is the real deal, perfectly balanced sweetness with enough orange peel.  The coffee they serve is freshly brewed and just a delight.

Probably my fave breakfast spot in town."}
{"text":"It seems that there are condos and new buildings going up on every corner in downtown Toronto these days ... well, the iconic red building about the size of one railway car nestled amidst this urban jungle is a slice of greasy spoon goodness amidst it all.  No flash.  Just breakfast and simple lunches.  In fact, closes at 5pm!  Mind you that could be influenced by the crack-heads and riff-raff that roams these streets once the sun goes down ... but hey, you should be only rolling through this part for breakfast anyway.  Enjoy it.  If you're anywhere near the east section ... this is it."}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to make it into the George street diner for breakfast. It was raining pretty badly which meant we didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was very prompt which was great (being pregnant I was starving by the time we got here and I had already picked out what we were ordering ahead of time). 

We both ordered coffee and orange juice (freshly squeezed which was a bonus). My fiancé ordered the huevos rancheros and I got the spinach eggs benedict with a side of French toast and bacon to share. All thought the place was packed the food came out fairly quickly. The portions were a good size and everything was delicious but what really made the food stand out was the Irish soda bread the eggs benny was on. I've never had anything like it! Our bill arrived right after we cleaned our plates which again was great because I needed a nap. 

We will be recurring customers here for sure.  I've got to try some of the deserts, they looked fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Toronto. I should stress that it's great for breakfast, not for brunch since you're bound to see a long wait if you try to come on the weekends. My go-to menu items are the Irish breakfast and the meatloaf. I promise you can't go wrong with either of these. I'm sure there are other things on the menu that are worth having, but I haven't been able to tear myself away from my two favourites. 

I don't recommend stopping by on the weekends since it's almost always too busy. That said, it's totally worth a visit for weekday breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 4/5 because my wife enjoyed her breakfast. Her poached eggs were perfectly cooked, the fruit was fresh, and the rye toast was just the right thickness. I was a little less impressed. I read all the reviews, so I tried the soda bread. I guess it just wasn't for me. It was very dense and not as flavorful as I would have hoped. Being from the states, we also tried a side of peameal bacon, never having heard of it before. Again, not for me. It seemed fattier than ham, and not as good as bacon.

But if you are looking for a true greasy-spoon diner in Toronto, this is the place. The atmosphere is classic diner, with the kitchen visible from the counter seating and all checks handwritten and handed to the cooks. The coffee was good, too."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Everything is so wonderful and delicious. The toasted challah bread is so perfectly toasted, their organic farm fresh eggs are heavenly and orange juice is so fresh as well. Both my husband and daughter were so happy. It was our first time to visit.  Service was excellent. Everyone was so warm and friendly. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose one diner in Toronto that I could call a regular hang out, it would be the George Street Diner.  I remember going there back in the day when It was called the \"Florida Tea Room.\"

Location has something to do with my love of this diner - it is located right across the street from my condo (I could see into the restaurant from my living room, so I knew when a booth is available and there is no line up at the door :). I don't think my renters take similar advantage of that view now!

All of their breakfast options are hearty - eggs, bacon, sausage, baked beans, omelettes, frittatas, etc.  Most come with an option to have Irish Soda bread on the side.  My only real knock against the menu is that they don't offer many low fat, low sugar, low sodium and high protein options.  They do, however, offer fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.

The diner is consistently busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings/early afternoon and there can be a fairly long wait for a booth.  Sitting at the lunch counter can be fun, if you are into that kinda thing.  Oh, and if you are a Leafs fan, they filmed the \"Stand Witness\" video here :)"}
