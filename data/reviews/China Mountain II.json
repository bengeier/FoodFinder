{"text":"They are a cash only restaurant. Good portions and good prices. We used to go to another Chinese restaurant around the corner but this is our new place.  My wife liked that the vegetables were fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Best take-out Chinese around! Huge portions with excellent taste! Friendly staff. It's a hole in the wall place, but I wouldn't go anywhere else! Prompt service and food order is always correct."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going and our orders were wrong. But aside from that my food was good. So for that 4 stars but I'll chalk it up to an off day"}
{"text":"Seems it's getting harder and harder to find consistency in these restaurants as of late.  Because our favorite Chinese joints have changed so much, we thought we'd give this one a try.  Very strange all the good reviews, as our experience was not good.  Yelp says they take credit cards....they don't.  However, they don't mention that on the phone or their menu.  We had to go next door to an ATM machine. Get into the 21st century, please.  Ridiculous!  Egg roll was ok, hot sour soup was neither hot or sour...I find only bland can describe it.  Mongolian beef tasted like some kind of celery sweet stew.  The pork fried rice had pieces of cut up pork chop in it.  That's a first for us.  The pot stickers were okay, but the sauce was like a burnt cough syrup.  The fried rice tasted only of the oil it was fried in and again, totally bland.  Governors chicken was another disappointment.  Sauce was like sugar water.  They lack traditional Chinese American seasoning that is prevalent in most US Chinese restaurants.  I don't know if it's a cutting corners technique or what, but this place gets a \"we'll pass\" from now on from us."}
{"text":"Great food. Big Portions. Great Price. Take out only.

The storefront is small and unkempt. It is too hot in Summer and freezing in winter. If you can get past that you are in for a real treat."}
{"text":"Horrible customer Service. As you might expect from a Chinese restaurant. Biggest disappointment is that they are cash only and they expect you to go next-door and take money out of the ATM at a three dollar fee so they can avoid the credit card charges. Now I know. I don't carry cash. Never again. Chins pagoda around the corner is much better anyway. Should've known better"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese take out in the area. Large selection of menu items, prepared quick. Great portions. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Note: This review is only for Orange Chicken.

China Mountain. I've finally come to try the goods. I figured out a way, although long and circuitous, to exit the highway and approach you from the North end of Willowick so that I may then pass by Mama's Q and come semicircle to my humbe abode.

When I entered your doors I was delighted to find how clean and organized your interior appeared. A promising start. The lady who took my order was very helpful and polite. 

China Mountain. I've heard from two separate sources that your portions are generous and it's true! Lots of Yelpers like your food and have given their thumbs up. But sadly, (Now, for the decrescendo...) I ordered orange chicken, (general chicken's sassy sister) and the chicken was fibrous and chewy. Quality was not good. It caused me mild depression. Sauce was also non-spectacular and needed some brightness.

Granted, this item was not among those recommended to me but the quality of a dish like this is something that determines how far I'm willing to drive from home. My Orange chicken came with fried rice and egg roll which were also under par. 

As it stands, Li Garden currently holds the crown for best fried rice and New Wong narrowly nails best Eggroll. China Sea of CSU reigns supreme for general tso and Peking Chinese (for me) takes the cake for the dish in the Willoughby area.

China Mountain, I might get a chance to give you another try someday, but I don't think it will be anytime soon. 

If you're picky like me, always to remember to ask that the bean thread be held. I always forget this.."}
