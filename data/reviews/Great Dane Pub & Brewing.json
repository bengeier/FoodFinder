{"text":"Three and a half.  A perfectly good place to come hang out after scoring produce at the nearby farmer's market.  I ordered the potato soup (85 degrees outside, yeah...I'm weird), while my sis had the onion soup, a.k.a. cheese monstrosity (pictured).  Cold beer, can't complain."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to the Great Dane at Hilldale on a regular basis since they opened. Although the beer is mediocre, with the exception of Crop Circle Wheat, it's a convenient location. Somewhere to go for a beer and a bite after seeing a movie at Sundance.  However, the last two times that we've gone there have left a bad taste in our mouths, figuratively.  It seems like the current mantra is to make as much money as possible and who cares about the customer.  One meal we had four extra charges: sweet potatoe fries=extra, mayo on our burgers=extra, Imperial IPA=extra, grass-fed beef=extra.  Only two of the extra charges were actually listed on the menu. This afternoon, after having two tastes of beers (one each) and then ordering two 20 oz. beers plus an appetizer, I asked for a taste of another beer because I thought we would split one more beer before going home. The bartender refused saying because it's a guest beer (although on tap) they don't make as much money so they don't let people taste the beer. That seemed ridiculous. Why offer guest beers then? So, it's okay if a customer spends $5 on a beer that they might not like, but the Great Dane can't spend a few cents on a taste?  We're talking about a taste, not a glass. When we called the bartender on it, he said he was being very patient with us by explaining the different beers that we had asked him about as well as explaining about two of the sauces offered for chicken wings. Unbelievable!  Isn't that his job? By the way, there were two other people sitting at the bar, not a big crowd. Anyway, I will not go there again no matter how convenient. There are places with better beer and better customer service where they aren't constantly nickel and dimeing you."}
{"text":"LOVE their Sunday brunch. This is one my kids fave places. Rock solid selection of sandwiches, burgers, fish fry, pulled pork. BUt it's not all standard fare. I like their peanut stew. But more often than not, I get their steak frites. yum."}
{"text":"Fast service- we usually have at least a table of 7.
Friendly, outgoing waiters.
Good food, but sometime it's a little off- like the ciabatta bun on the portabella sandwich being twice the size of the mushroom."}
{"text":"Overall, a very nice place for a meal and drink.  

We were greeted and seated immediately, the staff was very helpful.  Our waiter answered any questions we had, he made some great recommendations to us and we enjoyed the food a great deal.  I had the Macaroni and Cheese with Bratwurst and Broccoli, it was great and the portions were generous, I ate the rest for lunch the next day.  They had TVs available in the bar portion, but also had places available that were relatively quiet where you could easily carry on a conversation.  I was impressed with the food, the staff and I felt comfortable in the restaurant.   I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Poutine.  That's all I need to say.  Experienced it in Canada on business trips & while I know it's a horrible, horrible thing, it's also amazing.  Service was wonderful & knowledgeable,  menu has a bit of something for everyone.  I tend to prefer more intimate spots for dining & was unsure of the immense sprawl of this place but I like it.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane is just as good at Hilldale as it is downtown.  The food is good and the beer is even better.  A good place to meet up with friends or  family, kids are entertained by the darts, pool tables, and shuffleboard."}
{"text":"I have to second (third, fourth, etc.) the comments on the service at this particular Great Dane location - it's just not up to snuff with the other Madison locations. It seemed like our waiter took forever and ever to return to our table after taking our order, leaving to grab drinks, and the like. The food, however, is just as good as all the other Great Dane locations. I love the Great Dane and will revisit, though... just hope the service picks it up in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here when I was first visiting Madison and had a great experience. Good food. Good service. Good beer."}
{"text":"Service was the worst saw the waiter twice. Once to get drinks and once to take our food order. After we finished our meals and all drinks gone and 10 mins passed the waiter showed up. Probably should have went to McDonald's they would have given me better service and better food."}
{"text":"We have gone to this location 4-5 times. The food seems to be getting progressively worse. I ordered the Texarkana burger which I used to think was one of the best burgers in town. They seem to be skimping on this recently (I have tried to give them a chance the last few times since this burger used to be so good) it just has never been the same. Asked for medium and the burger was very well done. My fiancees tomato bisque soup and grilled cheese however was excellent. The service was great which always helps!"}
{"text":"This review applies only to the fish fry, which was awful!  The cod was saturated with and tasted like old cooking oil. The French fries were barely lukewarm with the grainy texture of day old McDonald's fries.  (I complained about the fries before I got into the fish, and they did bring a fresher batch.  I should have done the same for the cod, but ran out of time)  This place is not nearly as good, and it is way more expensive than other fish fries around the area."}
{"text":"I forgot to take pictures! I definitely should have because the atmosphere in this place is great for everyone! There were full families, romantic couples, friends hanging out, and just about any others you can think of. The location is easy to find and very welcoming! The Great Dane Pub Wings were some of the best wings I've ever had! I suggest grabbing a 12-rack and mixing the flavors, Szechaun Honey and Jamaican Jerk were my favorites. The burgers were excellent as well and the fries were perfect, as fresh as they could be. The waitress was beyond friendly, always smiling, and very sweet! My Father and I were very impressed when checking out the Great Dane Pub. You need to do the same!"}
{"text":"Food is consistent and never bad, but if you are coming in to enjoy a big sporting event on one of the many TVs, you will most likely be disappointed. I guess the in-house dj, who sounds like a Spotify Pop Muisc Playlist, is more important than the national championship game between WI and Penn State V-Ball game. When 75% of the bar is in red and here to watch the game, put on the sound. Also had to deal with an altercation between a bartender and my girlfriend when asking to turn on the sound for the 2012 World Series. We were told 'our sound system doesn't allow multiple sound inputs between the bar and dining room'. Then that same bartender complained to a patron about how 'if you wanted to listen to the game, you should have stayed home.' I thought this was an isolated incident. Obviously not. The Great Dane does not care about the customer experience, unless it's inline with what they think is appropriate.   Sorry, your dj sucks and we would rather listen to the sports commentary. iTunes is as good as this guy."}
{"text":"The food was just awful . The beer glasses were dirty. I got a flight and Simone else's lipstick was on my glass!!!!! I wanted tomato soup and grilled cheese I got tomato salt water and sugared onion cheese tomato yuk . No thank you . Never and I mean Never again."}
{"text":"I've visited the Great Dane dozens of times. I've never had a bad experience. 
The restaurant is an inviting, clean environment; 
the staff are patient and efficient; 
the food is made with good quality ingredients; 
the menu offers a wide variety of choices; 
prices are reasonable. 
Once, When a dish came out of the kitchen not-quite as expected, the staff brought out a new plate and adjusted the bill.
The Sunday brunch is fantastic!"}
{"text":"While I have always liked the Great Dane traditionally for decent food and drink, there is a problem with the bar management with regards to simple good business practices.  As one of the managers who plans after-work group outings within our biotech company, the Great Dane is a good option on the near-west side with ample parking and decent beer.  While the service was great from the aspect of the servers, one small, but pointed negative has drawn my attention.  The Dane typically offers free popcorn during happy hour, and basic logic dictates that salty treats = more beer sales.  However, at 5:30pm (30 minutes prior to the end of happy hour), we asked if some more popcorn could be made for our group.  The waiter stated that since it was nearly 6 (really?), they likely wouldn't, but would ask the manager.  He returned to inform us that the manager said no as they didn't want to have to delay in cleaning up the small popcorn popper at the end of happy hour.  Now, I know that this is a small thing, but unfortunately represents the attitude of the management there.  For about $0.25 of popcorn and 10 minutes of additional labor, the Dane could easily have sold an additional $50-70 worth of beer to our group.  Instead, we decided to go over the Hollander, and frankly, they treated us with a bit more value and we spent that money there instead."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is an excellent Madison institution. Consistently good food (though a bit heavy and salty for me), great atmosphere and stellar beers. 

The menu -- better by far than your average \"bar food\" establishment -- is pretty much guaranteed to please everyone in a diverse group. I am not a vegetarian, but as I recall there were many options for those folks as well."}
{"text":"Met up with a bunch of friends here on a Friday night. The place was hopping! One hour wait. I know, the food better be damn good if I'm going to wait an hour. But hey, the drinks were good, and cheap so I was happy while a waited. Had the pan fried walleye. Very good! came with good slaw, a roll and ample, delicious hash browns for $14. The pan fried option is great, not many restaurants do that. Love that I can have a good meal, a vodka buzz then go shopping at the Macy's and Anthropologie."}
{"text":"Kid Disco ROCKS!!! Where else can you bring the little ones to boogie the day away to DJ Nick Nice while the p-units and g-units (grandparents) sip on some pretty awesome beer (Emerald Isle Stout)?!?  One shout-out to Madison parents - keep an eye on your kids!!! This is NOT a babysitting service and your kid is no better behaved than mine! Also, tip your servers to excess, I can only imagine what a nightmare this event must be for them!!!"}
{"text":"If you close your eyes and taste the food, there are too many items that are way too similar to TGIMcBennibees.  I've given it a few tries, and while I've finished my meal every time I'm not overwhelmed.   The best thing it has going for it is location combined with a big parking lot, and it gets bumped up to a third star because the menu does have some variety to it.

It's a perfectly safe choice for lunch when in the area, since the area defined by Whitney, Midvale, Nokoma, and Mineral Point is a bit of a wasteland if you don't have inclination to drive to campus/downtown or to the chains of Middleton.  The beer isn't anything special so you're not missing out that much."}
{"text":"I doubt there is too much I can say about Great Dane that hasn't already been said. We most often end up at the Hilldale location as it's the most convenient for us (and parking is abundant, a major plus!). It can be pretty packed on busy times, like a Saturday night, but the wait's not longer than any other popular pub. Beer selection is obviously good, but there's a full bar too if you're not a fan. As for the food, I've tried many options over the years, and I can't point to one thing that's been disappointing. When I'm really in the mood to indulge, it's definitely the cheese and artichoke dip I go for. If you haven't visited here for their Sunday brunch, you're definitely missing out- the buffet takes up almost an entire room with a mix of standard breakfast fare and lunch fare as well, which is great as you probably aren't going to want to eat again for a day. We've also attended private events here that have been really well organized with helpful staff. Definitely a place we'll continue to visit often!"}
{"text":"This particular GD is terrible!!!. Customer service is terrible.     Very unfriendly staff on numerous times when there.  Terrible bartenders especially in front area of this GD.  Had to have a stair down to get bartenders attention.  After being served a beer, with my meal, I was forgotten about.  WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!.  I hope owner cleans house.  Restaff with people who care and have a positive work ethic."}
{"text":"Fun place to grab a drink or have a quick bite to eat.  Sunday brunch is pricey but is great.  The beer is good."}
{"text":"Hummus plate is outstanding.  Tried the Anniversary Ale in a pint glass.  It is solid."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a big group on a Friday. Back bar area sat us right away. Beer's always good here, and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich was great. Service was slow (2 hour lunch). Server lectured us at the end of the meal that it was really hard on her to run separate debit cards (off one check with group gratuity included), and that if it was more crowded, we wouldn't get away with it, basically. Never heard that at any other restaurant in Madison (or anywhere).

Good chicken sandwich & beer, but will remember it for the lecture, hate to say."}
{"text":"I enjoy Great Dane Pub's in Madison but I will never go back to this one. The service is absolutely horrible and the bartenders are extremely rude. Stay away."}
{"text":"They only get the second star due to the fact that I'm a big fan of the downtown Dane, and the Fitchburg location isn't bad. 

The Hilldale location must be managed by a completely different team. Seems like almost every time I go there, I have to wait forever to get the bartender's attention. And I'm not talking about a busy weekend night. Mid-afternoon. Hardly anyone there. I've been ignored several times and had people come in after me and get served. I try to make eye contact with the bartender, I have money out on the bar. Nothing. Again - this wasn't just once. The last time I finally just walked out after sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes. Looked at the hostess on the way out and shrugged my shoulders. Bye...  (probably forever).

Went to the Dane downtown and got served immediately, with a smile."}
{"text":"i love the environment of the restaurant and the staff was top notch.  the one thing i found extremely odd is why on a saturday afternoon for lunch, they can only serve the late night menu which limited our menu selections.  i have to disagree with other reviews, my waitress was attentative and friendly and was consistently refilling our drinks.

the food was average.  the cheddar mac was good, but could have used chicken and or bacon to spice it up and make it more filling.  the bbq pork was tastey and maybe more sauce could have added more to that as well.  the 3-alarm wings werent exceptionally hot or spicy, but they were well cooked and plump with juicy tender meat.

as a side note, my friend has been here in the past and wasnt 100% satisfied with his experience, but overall, my experience was decent."}
{"text":"I really don't know how I felt about the place. For one, it was in Wisconsin. Already off to a bad start. For seconds, because of the brunch buffet I could only order off a very limited menu. Everyone knows that you can't do brunch with other dudes. It just isn't OK. That is why I was so confused. They had TVs and craft beer and seemed like a place that many people came to watch football on Sunday mornings. So why do you have brunch? Who knows?

As for the food and drink itself. I got the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale which was a very nice selection for the variety though not great by any stretch of the imagination. For food I got the Dane Burger which had Artichoke Dip on it. I also upgraded to the Bison which I ordered Rare. It came out Medium Well and was overall disappointing (though props for having local grass fed beef as an option).

Of the many, many brewpubs that I have been to, this one ranks in the lower 3rd. If I ever happened to be in that not so great state again, I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try Great Dane because our friend recommended it to us (although she's only been to the downtown location).  The first time we went, without going into lots of details, the waiter really didn't seem with it and messed up my husband's order.  He had forgotten about my husband's burger, brought it out later, and it was well done instead of medium-rare.  Later into the meal at about 7:00, the waiter tells us there is a reservation coming in at 7:30 and asks us to move tables.  What?!?  I have NEVER had that happen in a restaurant.  At about 7:15 he asks us to move and said something about a \"2 hour time block\" (at that point we had only been there about 1 hour).  Luckily we were pretty much almost done so we just asked for the check so we could leave.  I couldn't believe it!  Luckily, we got my husband's meal free and the beers free.

The second time we were there, I was less than impressed with the food.  I ordered the veggie burrito.  The insides seemed like they were microwaved - the black beans kinda mushed up and dry and hardly any veggies (they should have called it a Bean and Rice Burrito).

We enjoyed the beer and the overall atmosphere.  I want to give it another shot, but definitely at the downtown location in hopes that it will be better."}
{"text":"I had sent a private message to Great Dane Hilldale approx. Oct 20th but I have received nothing back.  Therefore I will explain our displeasure here.  I will start off explaining that we have gone to the Great Dane many times (mostly the one off Cottage Grove road or downtown) and had great experiences.  This time, on Oct 19th was very different.  It took forever for our waitress to even acknowledge us (and it was only 4:30, far from busy).  Once she took our drink orders it took forever, again, to get our drinks.  Our food also took a bit to come out, and when it did, COLD.  My husband ordered the California turkey club and fries.  It was awful.  Both the sandwich and fries were COLD and sandwich was also dry. The waitress never came back and we did not see her to flag her down.  Only came back to give the checks.  He only ate half and could not eat another bite.  My sandwich (a bean burger) was also far from hot.  One would think if it took extra time to get the food it would be edible.  I even tried the sandwich the next day, thinking heating it up and adding BBQ would help.  NOPE.  I could not take more than 1 bite, in the garbage it went."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the skinny on the GD: best locally owned pub in Madison. They have great beer selection that they make themselves. The decor is really good too, a GREAT place to gather with work friends or to watch a game. Their menu is pretty good, especially their burgers. The Cream Ale (only available in the Summer) is great, and the Velvet Screw beer is a great Winter brew. An excellent place with LOTS of space for all types of people."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful beer flights.  I was impressed with the servers knowledge of the beer offerings.  I was doubly impressed with the chicken on the salad I ate - tender and delicious, and a good compliment to the greens and dressing.  It's a tad loud, but the booths make up for that!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good for brunch! I am a total Sunday Brunch type of person and when I moved to this area was looking for something like this. Great Dane actually exceeded my expectations as far as what is available at the Brunch, anything from traditional foods to roast, ham, mexican, salad, soup, fish etc. So good! And to top it off... sundae bar.... perfect for Sunday, I thought. Unfortunately I do not eat gluten so one time we went I was disappointed the ice cream was cookie dough, but honestly the rest of the selection doesn't let that trump your experience. So good! You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Madison, we always make a point to stop at the Great Dane.  Usually pretty busy,  but worth the wait.  Consistently good food, lots of vegetarian options--this is Madison, after all--and their beer is all really tasty."}
{"text":"I went to the Great Dane as a member of a work get together.  I have to say the food was average.   The real problem was with our server.  She was the worst I have ever experienced. She has no business working in the service industry.  She was totally unfriendly and rude.  I will never be back.  There are too many other places to spend your money where you will be treated better."}
{"text":"Stepping into the Great Dane's Hilldale location, you'll feel like you've been here before. That's because you have. It's got the same giant bar with the beer names engraved in wood, the same mahogany booths, and when you sit down you'll find the same menu. 

And that's fine. When you've got a great thing, keep it going. I love their beer. The Scotch is my favorite, but while trying out the this location I had the Wheat. When I want a burger, the Great Dane is usually the place I think of. However, this last time I tried the Sustain-A-Burger made from all local ingredients, and I was disappointed. My experience with local products is that they're just more flavorful, but nothing on this burger stood out. Next time I'll just go back to the Dane.

So what sets it apart? I've found it easier to get seating at dinner time than the other Great Danes. And, oddly, the patio seating overlooking the Hilldale parking lot and Sundance is a great people watching perch.

The real reason to go here is convenience. If you live on the west side of Madison, this is much easier than driving to Fitchburg and definitely easier to park nearby than downtown."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now for various reasons. From rootbeer during ultimate frisbee season to outings for work, I have tried the brat and bacon pretzel burger, french dip, cheese curds, chicken fried chicken (I don't see it on the online menu but I swear I got that), and smattering of samples from what others have ordered.

This is a nice place to visit if you want a solid place to eat out. It won't blow your mind with a progressive menu but it provides decent food with a wide range of choices."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner at this location recently. She had the protabella mushroom burger and I had the fish tacos. GREAT food!! Can't wait to go back. The tables were comfortable and the atmosphere was warm and exciting."}
{"text":"They are known for their brewery, and with good reason. 17 different homemade brews. I usually order the giant pretzel and pub fries, both of which are excellent. Their salads are big and intricate, with twists on classics like Caesar. The service is okay, but definitely some room for improvement. I really love the dark wood and lighting, both of which play off the other. Recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"3.75/5  Beer Quality Is Going Downhill Lately

This is an update review - I previously wrote the 5-star Best Brewpub in the US review and felt that my experiences at the Great Dane over the past year have changed to the point that my earlier review no longer accurately describes what one receives there nowadays.

The food quality has remained excellent, so everything I wrote about food still is accurate.  However, I have noticed a very significant decline in the quality of the Great Dane's beer over the past year, so this review will address only the beer.

I previously stated that GD's Old Glory APA is the best pale ale I've had and one of my very favorite beers.  That's probably no longer true.  The half dozen Old Glorys I've had in the past year taste different, flatter, more bitter, less citrusy hop flavor, less hint of caramel.  One of them, that I had at the Hilldale location, I actually sent back because it tasted skunked.  The bartender didn't believe me and thought I was some sort of hyper-critical malcontent until he poured himself a taste and then agreed.

The Crop Circle wheat has lost some of its wheat taste that makes it so good.  If I wanted my beer to taste like a bland American beer, I'd buy a six-pack of Bud Lite or MGD and just stay at home.

I had a limited production IPA and it possessed all of the strong characteristics of an IPA without any of the subtle, pleasing ones.

Clearly the Great Dane is doing something differently over the past year and when what you're already doing is superb, change is not likely to be a good thing.  Maybe they have new brewers or they aren't supervising as well and whoever has been cleaning their equipment has been getting a bit sloppy (as a former and hopefully future home brewer, I can tell you that meticulous cleanliness is the single most important factor in making a decent beer and is second in importance only to quality ingredients in making a great beer).  Or maybe they started brewing with an eye more focused on the bottom line and switched some suppliers - I'm on the Tyranena Brewing Company newsletter list and its curmudgeonly owner has complained multiple times of the significantly rising costs of raw materials for brewing in recent years.  If that's the case, please Great Dane, go back to your old suppliers and put a little note on the bottom of your beer menu explaining that materials costs have risen significantly lately, hence the 50 cents increase in beer prices.  We'll understand.

Whatever the reason, I can no longer honestly say that the Great Dane is one of the top-5 beer producers in the country.  It's sitll pretty good beer, better than the beer from any of the Milwaukee brewpubs like Sprecher, Water Street, or Riverside and better than those from about a dozen small-town brewpubs I've tried in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio over the past year months.  However, I'd say that both Ale Asylum and Tyranena have it beat nowadays.

Several years back, the once excellent Capital Brewery in Middleton decided to go more commercial, stopped making their outstanding Klosterweizen (better than GD's Crop Circle, even) and instead pushed a bland American-yellow-beer-in-a-can, Supper Club and bland, very slightly wheatier tasting Supper Club called Island Wheat.  My purchases of Capital beers in recent years have declined by 90% or more compared to 10-15 years ago (a few Octoberfests on tap if a restaurant has nothing more interesting and maybe one 4-pack of their seasonal dopplebocks). I really hope that whoever is in charge of brewing at the Great Dane gets his head out of his arse and rights the ship before the Great Dane goes in the same direction as Capital Brewery."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices! Texarkana burger was really nice, juicy and flavorful. The Sustain-a-Burger, one the other hand, was just OK...really nothing special about it, just a healthy burger!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say the servers are so nice! I wanted to order a cocktail but wasn't sure what to do without a menu. The server was kind enough to ask my preferences and recommend me something that I ended up really enjoying (it was a sea breeze by the way, with coconut rum!). I ordered the cod (can't remember 100%, please correct me if I'm wrong) dish with the brussel sprouts and mashed sweet potatoes which was fantastic! The fish was not dry at all, very tender, and the sauce complemented it very well. Even without sauce the fish tasted great. The mashed sweet potatoes had a hint of curry ish flavor but still delicious and very smooth. The brussel sprouts were crisp and crunchy but cooked very well. I honestly enjoyed every bite, each more flavorful than the next. Would definitely recommend and come again."}
{"text":"I probably go to this restaurant twice a month. The food is so fresh and the flavors and delicious. I usually get the Mayan chicken wrap but the tortellini is also very good. If you're looking for a fun burger, I would recommend the Dane burger, which has artichoke dip on top. 

They also have a wide selection of craft beer and soda. The servers can help you pick a beer that fits your taste."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting good service! Wow, our server tonight was just so subpar I can't understand why they keep her around! She took forever to bring one drink, never asked if anyone wanted water refills and then disappeared. It got so bad that my husband had to go to the bar to order our beers! I informed the hostess but still, our server was MIA and when she materialized at the end of our meal, she never apologized, never noticed that beers she had not brought us were on the table, never comped us anything for our inconvenience. We noticed other people having problems with her, too and as we were leaving, we had other servers apologizing to us for her! She couldn't be bothered, apparently. I don't know where a manager was because no one has name tags or uniforms, so it's impossible to tell who works there and who doesn't. Once we actually did get our food (which was brought by someone else), it was very mediocre- my buffalo burger was obviously a pre-made patty that was dry and almost flavorless. I couldn't use the ketchup on the table, either, because it has high fructose corn syrup in it (it's 2016- why don't you get the organic kind??). The bun it came on was inedible- this hard little square that tasted like cardboard and was obviously frozen previously. The mashed potatoes were ok but came with some kind of \"gravy\" on the side with mine that others did not get with their same order. You can tell everything is highly processed. Also, when I tried to order the \"Sustain-A-Burger\" she told me they were out. I asked what that even meant (or how there could be two different buffalo burgers on the menu) and she didn't explain it to me at all. The only good thing was the beer. But I would not make a special trip for it. Overall, it feels like a dumpy chain and acts like one, too. There are way too many great restaurants in Madison to ever consider going back to this place again."}
{"text":"We love their New London Bridge Fish Fry, pulled pork sandwich,  and prime rib special.

It wad our dining companion's first time here and he asked for a Budweiser, the pretentious server said they only served their own brews."}
{"text":"Never thought I could enjoy \"bar food\" so much! Every time I've ate at the location in Hilldale I've had a great meal and an awesome time. I will travel far and wide for their nachos in particular. Still have yet to find any nachos that are better! I highly recommend their fish tacos as well."}
{"text":"If I have written this review months ago, I'll give them 4 or 5 stars! But, we are on the first day after the changed their menu today, feeling sooooo upset because of their change of my favorite beef brisket with a new dish on the dinner menu! Beef brisket will be no longer served here in Great Dane! So sad, in the beginning of the year, they first took the steak off the menu, and now it's brisket's turn : ( I guess from now on, my only choice would be their burgers which cannot compared with Old Fashioned's! Sighhhhhhh"}
{"text":"What can one say about this place. I have been several times for the cheese curds and burgers. The staff is always awesome and on time. My favorite bar in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"Appears inviting from the outside. This restaurant is conveniently located in a hustling and bustling little series of stores. We chose to eat lunch here, out of pure convenience as it was close to our shopping.

The interior needs a bit of renovating or refurbishing, because many of their booths and tables were very warn. The tables were clean, however, the menus (resemble a newspaper) and the beer menu were grimy. Just commenting on this, because I think it would be an easy fix for the restaurant to replace the menus or at least not circulate dirty ones. 

The service was really great. Both of our servers were nice, and although it was busy they did not push us out.  

We enjoyed a flight of beer, and cheese curds as appetizers. You can't go wrong with beer and cheese in Wisconsin, and both were good. I had a chipotle chicken wrap for my entree and it was alright, but nothing special.

I would have to say the convenience of the location and the service are the peaks of the restaurant. Bottom line is that it's enough to get you through the rest of your shopping."}
{"text":"Went here based off of reviews I n Yelp and it was disappointing.  I am an Amber fan and couldn't get theirs because they rotate beers at their different locations.  I had a flight of 4 and none were inspiring enough to order a pint.  The waitress was not very knowledgeable about their product which doesn't help at a micro brewery.  Even the kettle chips were over cooked and under seasoned.  I would not recommend this location, perhaps others are better."}
{"text":"Ahh Great Dane, I like your cozy vibes on a cold Black Friday at Hilldale. Unfortunately, your fish fry was sub-par. We ordered the perch, served with fries and slaw. The breeding was too much; and the fish itself wasn't very fall-apart fresh. In its defense, it did say it was \"deep-breaded\" and I should have seen this as a warning. 

On a brighter note, the Brown Ale soup was dank! Comes in a crock with golden, crispy Swiss cheese on top. Their take on French onion. It's seriously stellar. Souper! Can you tell I love soup?"}
{"text":"I love going out to Great Dane for lunch,dinner or just for a drink! They have great beer and they are always switching it up. You can stick with the classics or try some of their seasoned beer! It never disappoints. I love their food but beware the chipotle chicken quesadillas are spicy but very delicious! I get it almost every time in there. They also have darts and pool tables incase you just want to go in for a drink with friends. Great atmosphere you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We always have a great meal. Buffalo burgers are to die for. Homemade apple sauce it killer. The pot pie or filibuster plate are amazing. What is not to like about this place? Great beer, some of the best in Dane County. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Love The Great Dane, this one most of all. Great service, atmosphere, and food. I especially love that a) they brew their own beers and b) those beers are always delicious. I've been coming here for years, and I have had many fond experiences. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I would have given the Dane a 4-star rating a year and a half ago, before they raised their prices and changed their menu. Make no mistake, the Dane is a great, comfortable go-to place to catch a game or grab a bite with friends after work. But ever since Cafe Hollander moved in around the corner, prices have gone up, while food quantity and/or quality has not increased commensurately. 

Their beers range from very solid to mediocre. The APA is about as good of a specimen of its kind as I've found in WI."}
{"text":"Great Dane at Hilldale is a pretty gigantic restaurant and brewery. It's not the best of anything, but  the menu is varied, the food is okay, the prices are reasonable, and I'm fond of the scotch ale. They can serve a large group without breaking a sweat. At that scale the emphasis in the kitchen would be efficiency."}
{"text":"Food was horrible! I ordered a burrito and it was blander than calcium pills! Service was annoying! They kept coming to our table every min to ask if everything was alright. AND the straw that broke the camel's back was an issue with the bill.

 Well our bill was $25.17. My husband had cash on him so he decided to pay with cash, he used one twenty dollar bill and five singles instead of six. This was a genuine mistake, but the waiter came harassing us with a nasty look saying we owe him a dollar! I apologized and smiled at him and told him it was a mistake. Took money out of my husband's wallet to give to him. But he did'n even say thank you, he just pouted his lips, snatched the bill and walked away!

Why would we intentionally not pay a dollar and still stay there long enough to be caught? That's dumb!
Well we left with a bland taste in our mouths and feeling very embarrassed.  We shall never return!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a suggestion from my friend who lives in the area. My husband was looking for a place with a variety of options of beer and she suggested we go at the Great Dane. 

The wait wasn't long for a table, which was nice for a late dinner on a Saturday night. We didn't wait too long for the waiter to take our drink order, but we did place an appetizer order which we had to remind him of which came right before our entrees. The nice thing was he didn't charge us for the appetizer, recognizing his mistake.

The food was okay. I had the Saturday 10 ounce prime rib for $16. It wasn't too bad a bit over cooked than I would have liked. There was a table with kids that were super loud, finally someone must have said something and they quieted down."}
{"text":"Slightly overrated.  Menu looked really exciting, but food was only ok."}
{"text":"Typical American bar food. Big portion, fresh and tasty. Sitting outside is the best choice in a wonderful day. Inside is a little noisy."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was mediocre at best. Cheese curds were good. The wrap was not very exciting - I could've made a better one at home nothing to write home about but not bad."}
{"text":"I generally like Great Dane, and I think the cheese curds are the best in Madison by far. The food can be hit or miss, depending on what dishes you pick, but overall it's a fun place to hang out and you won't leave upset at all."}
{"text":"Will never come back here. They dont except discover and the manager was a bit#^. Bartender was great"}
{"text":"2 stars for good beer! Yay!  The rest of the experience was not so great.

I love beer! Yes, I do! So when I heard countless ravings about \"The Great Dane\" and the amazing beer, I was very excited for a visit.

We decided to visit \"The Dane\" on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted and seated right away. After waiting 10 minutes for a server to arrive, we were all ready to order food and tasty beer. Wait, you can't order from the whole menu? Only a limited menu (the backside of the menu) and the brunch buffet? Then why didn't the host inform us of this upon our arrival? Why? O.k.

Our server takes our food and beer order. I decide to order the sampler. She comes back about 10 minutes later stating they were out of 2 of the 4 beers I ordered. O.k. This happens. Do you have any suggestions? Ummm, not really. O.k. So I order a replacement and she sets the beer samples in front of the person sitting next to me and walks away. No explanation of what is what. Really? I get this may not be the greatest job in the world, but at least have some pride in what you do. Or just quit. 

Not going back. Service killed it for me.

P.S This is in response to the person who said samplers are for people that don't know what they like:  Samplers are a great way to know and learn about the great variety of beers a restaurant has to offer. It's that simple. And as far as staff knowing beer, if you are serving beer you should know something about what you are serving. It's not too much to ask for. Good Day!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Great Dane. I just moved to Madison, and we decided to go there on the night I moved here. The food is ok.  I ordered the fried cod and fries and cheese curds. I asked the server about a suggestion, and she had none. She was completely uninterested in our table and serving us. She asked us if we were ok just once. After waiting for 10 minutes, I had to flag down another server to bring me some more water and a box. She came back and said: \"sorry for the wait.\" and then brought back the check. So, she only got a 10% tip from me, which was too much for the service we received.  I like the food here, but the service was really bad. Not to mention that we were the only minorities in the restaurant at the time, and the lack of service and attention did not make us feel good at all."}
{"text":"Don't you dare charge me $2.37 for a club soda which is carbonated water. What the hell!"}
{"text":"Crop circle wheat and cheese curds on the patio are a great backdrop to catching up with dear friends."}
{"text":"It's true it can be hard to get a table here during the weekend, but the wait is worth it! The food is consistently delicious, and their beer selections (all made in house) are fabulous. 

Sunday brunch buffet is a veritable banquet, and while things run out very quickly, staff are never far away with either a new tray of the same food, or a replacement of something equivalent. 

If I'm taking a visitor out for dinner there, I will always recommend that they have the Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger. It's literally \"Wisconsin in a Bun\". A brat patty, with a burger patty (upgrade to the bison, it's worth it!), AND BACON, applewood smoked, all in one handy bundle of soft pretzel deliciousness and complemented with house-made mustard. Perfection! 

Of course you couldn't eat one of these at every visit, so I highly recommend the Sustain-a-burger (all locally sourced ingredients), or the New England fish fry (which is one of the best fish fries I have had).

In the summer outside seating is at a premium, and you'll have to use your hawk-eye to spot the second that someone picks up their keys from their table and looks like they may be about to leave. Ninja tactics are recommended.

It is a pub, and this is pub food. If you're coming here looking for exuisite haute cuisine, you're barking up the wrong tree. If you like a fun, relaxed environment, with good food and good drinks, I highly recommend the Great Dane Hilldale."}
{"text":"Great food and beer! We haven't been to Great Dane for years and wanted to to check out the place again. It was success! We had quesadilla and Mac N cheese and both were delicious. Definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. If you go in with the mindset that you're going to a Pub, this place doesn't disappoint. The food has been very good and they have a good happy hour, lots of beer, and the service is friendly. This actual place is huge too! It keeps going and going, so we've never had to wait for a seat. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite when everywhere else closes around 9pm. It was a pretty regular stop when I used to work PM shifts at the hospital, and wouldn't finish until 1130 -- too lazy to cook, I'd stop in for the late night menu and a drink. 

The menu has changed since the last time I stopped in and ordered off the menu. They've added more to the delicious menu and rearranged a few of my favorite items (Jamie's fish tacos with extra habanero sauce -- SO YUM).

I recently had the smothered and covered chicken. Which I think is newer, and HOLY YUM! 2 pieces of generously breaded chicken with andouille sausage, shrimp, and artichokes in a cream sauce; mashed potatoes with melted cheese; and green beans.  

Depending on the time and type of patrons are around, the music can get a little loud, but the space is definitely big enough to disperse the sound so you don't feel like you're going deaf."}
{"text":"This review is for a take out dinner - and also Sunday brunch. four stars for both.

My sister lives in the townhouse complex bordering the HIlldale Mall, so it was really convenient order take out and also stroll in for sunday brunch.

takeout:
1. Nakoma nachos (no chicken)
2. caesar salad
3. pub wings - 3-alarm sauce
4. gulf shrimp pork belly pasta

1. Nakoma nachos - the folks at Great Dane added a really nice touch by packing these toppings separately from the nachos that were cooked with the cheese and black beans. So the guacamole, jalapenos, black olives, pico, salsa, and sour cream all came in separate 2-oz plastic cups you to customize as you wish. Great Dane uses multi-colored chips (red, gold, purple) that are nice and flaky. It's hard to screw up nachos, but harder to make them delicious. These were delicious. Definitely recommend

2. According to my wife, she really enjoyed the caesar salad. Not to mention it came with anchovies for authenticity.

3. Pub wings - highly recommended by my sister, especially the 3-alarm sauce. I think I would have preferred a sweeter, more bbq flavor, but these weren't bad. The wings were cooked a little longer than I would have liked, but not dried out. Large enough that the meat on the inside of the wings was still tender and juicy.

4. Gulf shrimp pork belly pasta - in a cream sauce with buccatini noodles. Probably the most disappointing dish, simply because it didn't compare as well with the others. Not bad in any way, just relatively one-note. The shrimp was cut into bite size pieces, instead of large whole shrimp. I think the would have changed the look and feel of this dish. The pork belly was also cut into VERY SMALL pieces.  This is the second time I have had a dish where pork belly was served this way. That is not the way pork belly was intended to be eaten - it needs to be large and fatty, not rendered down into mini cubes.(smaller than raisins).

On to the sunday brunch - at $17 a person, us Chicago folks were pleasantly surprised at the price. Maybe that's a bit much for Madison, but judging by the packed out, methinks not.

This list is probably not complete, but I'll do my best to tell you what you can expect during brunch: (with my rating next to the item I ate)

{"text":"Great food (very tasty! wide selection, decent prices), good service, neat place!

Two bros, my bae, and I went here for a Wednesday night dinner. Certainly the beautiful weather and the presence of my favorite people improved my appraisal of the place, but I think it still would have been a 4-star experience in the winter, with mediocre company.

I tasted:
Poutine (appetizer) - Awesome! great seasoning, still pretty crispy for a while after it came out and only the most \"gravy-laden\" fries got mushy by the 15 or 20 minute mark.

Cheese Curds (appetizer)- Solid, can't complain! Only tried 2 curds. 

Calamari (My gf's entree) - The few rings that I snagged were fantastic. The marinara was plentiful too and I even got to steal some of her sauce for my sandwhich

A cajun chicken sandwich with an extra chicken breast and a side of plantains (My entree) - Loved the plantains! Since this was my first experience with roasted plantains, I'm not sure if they were cooked particularly well or if I just love plantains as a food. The chicken was very well seasoned, very tasty, though a bit smaller than the average restaurant's chicken breast. The specially made Great Dane Chipotle Mayo turned out to be a pretty good dipping sauce for my extra chunk'o'chicken.

Good choice! We'll probably bring a party of 13 here over the coming weekend."}
{"text":"While I'm a fan of the Great Dane, this is not my favorite location. It seems to lack the same feel as the downtown or the Fitchburg location.  

We went this visit on a Friday night hoping to grab a quick bite to eat before heading home.  We did get seated right away, but the service was slow.  We were there after the dinner rush, so I would have expected a bit faster turn-around time.

The food was good but the meatloaf came out marginally cold, we were so hungry at this point that I didn't send it back.  Who knows how long it would have taken and we were in desperate need of eating to soak up the beer we were imbibing in.  

Speaking of beer...  we tested out a couple of new beers (new to us) Landmark Lite and Grandpa's Candy (seasonal).  The landmark was a nice light beer with real flavor.  It's what Miller lite or Bud Light aspires to be.  Grandpa's Candy is not a beer you want the kiddies getting into!  It's a strong one at over 11% alcohol!!!  They age it in brandy barrels and while I'm a bad Wisconsinite since I don't care for brandy, I do really like Grandpa's tasty treat!   It's a nice sipping beer with a fruity, lightly sour flavor.  This one should be kept in the line-up!

So back to the food...
Mad City Mama's BBQ Meatloaf- 
U.S.D.A. choice Angus chuck baked with tomato, garlic and herbs then grilled and basted with BBQ sauce. Topped with roasted red peppers, and haystack onions. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and market vegetables.  Even with it being cold, it was delicious.  I loved the haystack onions on the top.  The portion was generous enough to leave leftovers for lunch the next day.

Brown Ale Onion-
A rich chicken and beef broth filled with pretzel croutons and beer-simmered onions, then baked with Wisconsin Swiss cheese until bubbling. Served in a twelve-ounce crock. Came out piping hot and was very good.  The pretzel croutons were a bit charred for my liking.

Any Great Dane is a solid choice but bottom line, if I can choose my location, I will stick to downtown."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a filling meal & great beer. Though they have recently changed the menu and have taken off a few great items ( my personal favorite the Veggie PLT ): - why I unfortunately docked a point ) they still have a great selection of delicious burgers & mouthwatering appetizers. 

Our favorite dish is the poutine appetizer. That alone can feed dinner for the two of us. The poutine is delicious and just what you would expect to be on your plate."}
{"text":"Love The Great Dane! First all I'm not a fan of searching for parking downtown so this location is ideal for me. I've been here a few times and I've had great service everytime. The last meal I had I started off with their beer sampler and pretzels and mustard, very delicious. I had their pulled pork sandwich and stole some of my boyfriends bacon cheeseburger and everything was superb. Everything is reasonably priced and I've never had to wait during lunch time. All in all great experiences at The Great Dane."}
{"text":"ugh. hilldale dane. we are THROUGH. over an HOUR to get a beer? seriously? and then not acknowledging me when i try to get your attention? granted this is always the case... but ugh. enough. 

hilldale dane, i tried sososososososo hard to like you. i love your fish tacos. and your tripepper pils and your delectable scotch ale. but not knowing how to make classic drinks? like a sidecar or a hot toddie? and forgetting what i ordered? and NOT checking in on me to see if need anything? what, utensils? why would i ever need those to eat? or taking 3498753948573984735 hrs to get me my check? and that many more hrs to run my credit card? like... it's not that busy. EVER. also. why can't u keep the same waitstaff??

ugh. we are DONE. it's not me. it's you. i'm getting my dane fix downtown or at fitchburg, where i know i'll have fantastic service and don't have to block aside 5 hrs for one meal. jeez."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  We walked in with a party of eight on a Sunday afternoon and were told they were on a buffet and had a limited menu.  Fine.  Then we were told by the hostess that she couldn't seat a party that big and we should go see the other hostess.  Umm you go see the other hostess!  We should have walked out at this point.  

The waiter seemed uninterested in life and the buffet was sub-par, fruit next to shrimp?  On what planet.  Yuck. We ordered off the limited menu, cheese curds were breaded mozzarella and disappointing to say the least.  Why even ask us how we want our \"grass-fed\" burgers cooked?  They are 1/4 inch frozen hockey pucks which will always come out well done.  I could have gotten a better burger off the grill at Burger King.

Stay away from this place.  To the manager:  Based on the other Yelp reviews, invest in a good staff and maybe you won't have to hand out millions of drink tokens to right the wrongs..."}
{"text":":) Coming to Madison I look forward to eating at this place. The food is always amazing! the ambiance is gorgeous brit pub good happy fun vibe. The service is always fast and the beer keeps rolling. Many good times have been had here with friends drinking and eating and celebrating life. This is my favorite place in all madison!!! so good so good."}
{"text":"Amazing Brat Beef Pretzel burger. Cooked perfectly with a side of plantains. Don't miss the poutine fries which use a dill garlic cheese. Service was peppy with a smile."}
{"text":"I was going to order the Sustain-a-burger but didn't want the sauce and some of the other burgers sounded better.  At the top of the burger part of the menu it says sub a local grass fed patty for $1.  That's really what I wanted.  So, I ordered the regular pub purger with the grass fed patty sub.  As I'm placing my order I can tell that the waitress is totally not paying attention to me.  I repeat it and she's like yep.

So, the order comes and she brought me the sustain a burger.  I told her that I ordered the pub burger, NOT the sustain a burger.  She's like, well it's the same thing.  No, it isn't.  I explained the difference and she blew me off.  It had the wierd gravy and no cheese, lettuce or onions.  Finally, I just asked for onions since they didn't come with the burger I got.  It took her forever to get the onions and seriously brought me about 2 slices.  

We get the bill and she CHARGED me for the freakin onions!  An extra .50 charge on top of the more expensive burger I didn't order!  ARGH!  

The only thing that saved the whole experience was the fact that the manager listened.  I was so annoyed by not being listened to.  Argh.  He did give us free beer tokens, as well, which was really nice."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the cheese curds and artichoke dip.  I tried the Mayan Chicken wrap, and thought it a tasty sandwich.  I'd probably get it again."}
{"text":"We came out of a movie at Sundance at 11:30 pm on NY Eve and thought: \"hmmm, why not walk over to Great Dane and have a drink to celebrate the new year?\"  Sign on the door announced a $10 cover charge just to walk in after 9 pm. Sorry, GD, we'll go home for a nightcap."}
{"text":"I'm noticing a pattern to the reviews here, so I need to chime in. We debated between this location and downtown (Hilldale is much closer to our house). We decided Hilldale because we have two very small children and we thought this would be easier. I must temper my review with this: you cannot go wrong with the beer or the cheese curds. And thankfully this time we had a good server (we've had bad service at this location before). Chad, thank you for being a good server. What I need to complain about is the food. Our meals were inedible. The meat was overcooked and the veggies were cold or very undercooked. My husband is rarely one to complain, but he literally had to stop eating his chicken sandwich because it was so tough he couldn't bite through it. My walleye was rubbery and my daughter's grilled chicken was extra tough, too. I am not giving a lower star review because the manager took the food off our bill and gave us tokens for free beer. We may try again, but perhaps we'll stay in the bar and stick with the beer."}
{"text":"I really loved eating here. The poutine was incredible. Best I've had. Then I got the blackened chicken sandwich special which was also spectacular; very spicy but very good. Also, the sustain-a-burger (a burger with all local ingredients) was great. On top of all of this, they have the friendliest staff of anywhere in Madison and some great beer. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here with the parents while they were visiting from out of town. They said they wanted something you can only get in Wisconsin so I immediately thought...cheese curds. Between us getting here though, my parents were worrying that I was going to freeze through this upcoming winter and decided to get me some coats. Hence how we ended up at this location, but blessing in disguise because it was quaint and wonderful and I love the plaza they are located in. The hostess sat us immediately and the first thing I thought was...aren't these menus a bit wasteful? oh well, their choice, but there were definitely some great options on the menu! 

Now this place I would probably give about 3.5 stars for the overall rating. The food was wonderful, as i'll get into, as well as the venue but the service is pretty sub par. Seems like they're all new or teens working and don't really have much experience. aka, slow drinks, awkward interruptions at the table, doesn't know the beer very well, and forgot to give us a pen with the check which then took us a little while to track her and a pen down after she dropped the check off as one of the other employees we asked said i'll get your server....

Anyways lets get to the food, the cheese curds were great. i was especially happy with the ranch dipping sauce that came on the side, but i'll be honest and say these weren't the absolute best cheese curds i've had, though they were flavorful. The beers were awesome. they only served beers that they made in house so it was cool to try their concoctions...ahem products. My dad had some kind of drenched fried chicken and it was awesome. like super amazing i will come back for that. It had shrimp and the chicken with two sides and this crazy good sauce on top. my mom had the beet salad which had a great mixture of beets, arugala, balsamic, goat cheese, and surprisingly some fruit. I had the salmon sandwich, which was good but i'm not much of a sweet glaze person so it was okay. All in all after the bill came and we had finished our food i was happy and satisfied. i'll be back to have more beer and some appetizers and i think it is a good place to try at least once but it's not really my absolutely favorite place in Madison."}
{"text":"This Great Dane location is one of my favorite hangout places in Madison. It's usually less busy than the others and closer to where I lived.

Of course, this place brews its own drinks, but the food here is decent as well. My go-to items on the menu were the chicken pot pie, the dane burger, the bbq pork sandwich, and best yet, the honey pepper salmon club, which is probably my favorite here. Definitely give the salmon club a shot. 

As to why I deemed this location as one of my favorites is because my friends and I came here often to chill and play pool. Serving a crowd of not all college kids was helpful in that it wasn't as loud and wasn't as busy as the downtown location."}
{"text":"Visited Great Dane for the second time on my third trip to Madison (missed it the first).  Overall, was originally attracted to try it out via the desire to grab some local brews, but the food ended up enticing me back for a second round.

Great Dane sports a wide variety of both staple and specialty brews.  All of them seemed pretty decent to me (my favorite being the Crop Circle Wheat), with the exception of a random or two (hot pepper beer anyone?).

Food is your typical pub fare, but it's well executed.  Greasy as expected...  the calamari and curds were good, as was my jerk pork and my wife's brisket and johhny cakes.

I'll probably make this a recurring to-do for my now annual voyage up north."}
{"text":"This is Wisconsin. Everyone loves a good grilled cheese me included... The Great Dane DELIVERS. Their version the \"Alpine Grilled Cheese\" has Roth Kase and cheddar with leeks,  red onion and beer jam on some of the BEST bread I've ever had."}
{"text":"I cannot actually comment on the food. Where I'm from breweries allow, and even encourage, dogs on the patio. As the patio was locked, though occupied,  we opened the door to ask the hostess for patio seating. Upon seeing my small, well behaved dog, she was quite rude and acted like I must be out of my mind bringing a dog with me. My advice,  don't name your brewery after a dog breed,  have said dog in your logo if you are not dog friendly. Or at least put that on your website which I checked."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork and it tasted as though it'd been reheated from another pork project on the menu and made to be a pulled pork sandwich. Quite filling though!

Subpar service, decent beer."}
{"text":"Right after traveling from Milwaukee, we were starving and found this Pub based on reviews. It was amazing! The best fried cheese curds in Wisconsin (according to me) and my husband and I split a salmon burger with fries that was outstanding and very flavorful. The fries were quite good also. Service was really good and exactly what we needed after a long day of traveling! The only issue here was parking but we found a garage around the corner pretty quickly. Seems like everyone rides bikes in Madison or walks which we quickly learned!!"}
{"text":"I visit Madison every month for work and I've gone to the Dane on practically every visit. As you may have gathered from their name they brew their own beer and it is good stuff. I am especially fond of the Peck's Pils. Give it a whirl. 

I definitely like the fact that the burgers are available with grass-fed beef. On my last visit I had the Texarkana and I definitely wasn't left disappointed (or hungry for that matter)!"}
{"text":"Overrated and consistently bad.

People like to give high reviews but after my last experience there I am confident it was my last attempt for this restaurant. Every time I am there they are understaffed and the servers do not handle pressure well when busy. Another person at our table ordered their promotional drink for the soccer world cup (caipirinha). These drinks should be sweet and filled with limes but instead it tasted like drain cleaner with soda water. I upgraded my order to receive sweet potato fries for $1 and was delivered an order of twelve small fries. I would have simply asked the server for a few more but she did not come back to the table until dropping off our bills and never even returning to ask how the meal was.

On my previous visit, I received food poisoning after having eaten nothing but their food that day. Four other people I was with also received food poisoning, yet the management refused to take responsibility when notified, instead insisting that it must have been something else we all consumed.

As a person who has many years of experience in the service industry I am underwhelmed every time I have been here. The management is poor and needs to hire servers who, unlike them, can handle stress."}
{"text":"This is a brilliant place with many carrots (that is what they have marked on the menu)!!  By that i mean tons of options of vegetarians just as good as the meat options! Amazing local brews. Had the scotch ale and it tasted amazing. The starters are the show stealers with beer battered bread with honey butter and spinach artichoke dip! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Madison, but I came here because a friend of mine recommended it. She said they had good food, beer and chocolates, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't try the chocolates, but I heard they were pretty good.

I ordered the Crop Circle Wheat beer on tap at the Hilldale site. This is good if you like smoother lighter beers without any hop. I ordered the Bavarian Chicken Sandwich, which is a grilled chicken breast topped with melted sharp cheddar cheese, Bavarian ham, apple spiked slaw and pickled red onions. Served on a home baked pretzel roll with a side of Crop Circle cranberry wheat mustard. The sandwich wasn't too bad except for the bun. I thought the bread was as hard as a rock, so I asked for new buns, but they it wasn't that much better than the ones I already had, but I ate it anyway. 

My friend had the Drunken Jerk, which is a tender pork shoulder soaked in spiced rum and our own jerk marinade, slow-cooked and wrapped in banana leaves, then finished with coconut-lime butter and pineapple salsa. Served with steamed vegetables and sweet fried plantains. This meal was way better than mine and if you like plantains they are amazing!

We went on a Sunday afternoon and thought maybe we could catch the KU vs Texas basketball game, but we weren't allowed to change any of the channels because there was a Green Bay game on even though there was one tv in front of us that could have been changed. So as you could imagine, the place was full of fans and it was pretty loud in there. So it was a little difficult to hear normal conversation."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars primarily as a bar. This is a great place to go for watching a game. Wisconsin game? The place will be packed to bursting with cheering fans in red. World Cup? Also fun to watch the game here. This place has the more formal bar near the entrance and the pool hall/sports bar in the back. As always, the Dane has excellent beers to choose from: my personal favorites being Old Glory APA, Emerald Isle stout, and Black Earth porter. Like any good sports bar, the Dane offers a nice array of snack food for their boozing patrons. But as for the dinner menu - that is hit or miss. Occasionally they come up with a real treat like the milk braised pork shoulder. However, the quality of those offerings is inconsistent at best. One time your order will be perfectly cooked and the next it will be dry as a bone. To make matters worse, the Dane just switched menus and eliminated most of my favorite entree options. My advice? Go here to catch the game with a few brews and stick to the appetizers for food."}
{"text":"I'd say the Great Dane is a solid place to eat and grab a beer... it's the kind of place that definitely deserves your business before a chain, but it's not going to blow you away. 

Decent cheese curds, decent burgers, decent beer (though if I'm honest I like the New Glarus offerings better). 

Great ambiance in this location, especially the bar area. It's the kind of place you'd want to have friends meet you where you'd be able to eat, drink, and hang out for an entire night... which I'd certainly do :)"}
{"text":"The plusses: some solid beer, great cheese curds, excellent back garden with plenty of seating.

Minuses: service can be slow, some not-so-great beers.

Overall a nice find in Madison that handled our big group pretty well."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome and beer selection is great. Try the Texarkana burger. You won't be disappointed! What's not to like...cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, chipotle cream cheese AND haystack onions! 

Beer....two words SCOTCH ALE."}
{"text":"I stopped here a week ago for an early dinner slightly before my first day of training at a new job nearby. I was starving, nervous, and looking for something familiar. I frequent the Doty Street location as I live downtown, so I knew that this location would have a similar feel. 

I always get the PLT with sweet potato fries, (It's my favorite!) and was not let down with their friendly and fast service. I sat by myself at the bar and was able to relax and enjoy my meal without feeling awkward or rushed. Now that I will be working in the area I'm sure that I will frequent this location as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick late lunch. The staff was friendly and have good beer recommendations. We had cheese curds and then split the high point harvest bowl. It was so delicious and healthy. Lots of vegetarian friendly options. Was a little over priced."}
{"text":"Our local favorite for dinner any night of the week. Fast service, friendly staff, and reliable delicious food. Their menu is huge and there's something for everyone. We've taken the carnivores and the vegans and the whatevers, and they all loved it. My go to dinner is the turkey burger, always grilled to perfection. My favorite beer is the Peck's Pilsner, although their house pinot grigio and mixed drinks have never steered me wrong. Prices are right and they accommodate all kinds of groups. I always feel welcome here: alone, with little kids, big kids, or on a date."}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty much a waiter's wet dream. We are kind, polite, over tip, and stack our own dishes to make it easier for the server to grab. We have both worked in the service industry so we try to show how much we appreciate their time. We try to be uber patient and understand the kitchen taking a long time does not reflect on the servers performance.

With that being said, our first dining experience at Great Dane was horrid.
They are getting 2 stars because of the outstanding beer we had. If that was merely mundane, 1 star easily.

I went to Sundance movie theater and asked my husband to meet me for a drink and salad afterward. I arrive and immediately I like the looks of the restaurant. The dark wood bar and the placement of the furniture kind of reminded us of an Irish pub. 

He ordered a stout and I tried the orange flavored beer, we both really enjoyed our drinks. We then ordered a panzanella salad and an order of fries as I had not eaten lunch yet and wanted something to munch on.

Thus, begins the waiting game.

I ordered my food right around 3:25 PM, at 4:00 my husband finally calls someone over and says, we've been waiting far too long for a salad and fries.

The kicker? Our order was never put in. Not once did someone ask how we were, if we needed a refill, nothing after taken our initial order.

Service straight up sucked. They comped me my beer, but I still left feeling incredibly disappointed. I loved their beer and wish I had better things to say, but I am in no hurry to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Crop Circle Wheat may be my favorite beer yet!

The Dane Burger is pretty decent with the artichoke dip on it and cheese curds are also wonderful here. I've tried the other appetizers and they are okay. A good place to watch sporting events and have a chill night out."}
{"text":"For the life of me, I couldn't remember if I'd been here before tonight. I think we had plans to meet with people and it didn't work out so we left? Who knows. Anyway!

I was here with a group of people and the service was sub-par. Granted, we might have been an intimidating group (ha, yea right), but various people kept saying \"Where's our server? Where'd he go?\" He may have just let us be to do our thing, but regularly checking on the table would've been nice. It got better as the night went on, though. 

We shared the nachos, which wasn't extraordinary but satisfied my hunger. I ordered the fish tacos and was really excited because I haven't had any for a whiiiiiiile. Unfortunately, it was kind of disappointing. The presentation was fine, but the taste was meh. The seasoning on the fish seemed lacking and I think there was a point where all I could taste was onions. I didn't use the sauces--I wanted to taste the tacos itself without it. It wasn't terrible, but I've had better so I probably wouldn't order this again. The price wasn't bad though--$10 for 3 tacos, and they were a good size. Not those little mini ones. 

Nothing too special, but it wasn't horrible. I'd go with a group of people, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dinner with just myself and my fiancé. Although, I'd like to try the tuna tataki sometime."}
{"text":"The meatloaf with garlic smashed potatoes and onion straws was fab, as well as the fried calamari appetizer with hot peppers...  Sounds like a weird combo? 

Wasn't.  

My date had the 6oz petite steak and gave it a thumbs up...

What more can I say about Great Dane? I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good good. Good times! Always have a good time. Can be busy at times. The beer is now available in cans to take hime. Live the German pilsner and the crop circle wheat!"}
{"text":"The beer is awesome.  We all know that.  They experiment with different kinds of beer and aren't stingy on the tasters (always appreciated.)  Some are incredible and some are so-so.  Crop Circle Wheat, Texas Speedbump IPA, and Scotch Ale are all good picks. 

 I have no idea why someone would complain about their wonderful mac and cheese.  Normally, I would be embarrassed to order mac and cheese at a restaurant, but their mac is so good.  It is a real cheese lovers' mac and cheese for sure.  It comes with a heavenly, soft pretzel stick for total carb overload.  My boyfriend had the chicken pot pie and claimed that the crust was wonderful and the filling high quality.    The grilled cheese is quite tasty with the pesto on it.  The soups are alright but not incredible.  The portobello sandwich was lovely, but messy.  

Thankfully, I've never had a service issue there.  In fact, the service has always been quite good.  

I like to go on Sunday night for free shuffle board and darts."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in Madison brought our group of friends here on a Friday night before a football game.  And we had a great time.  We had some good beers, some good cheese curds, and played pool for a couple hours.  The atmosphere is cool, the staff is friendly, and the prices are good."}
{"text":"I've only been to this Great Dane location for it's Sunday Brunch Buffet, and wowza, their brunch is a doozy. It's $16*, and for that you get an incredibly large spread of all the foods you might want to eat. All of the breakfast classics are here, like your american potatoes, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, bacon, sausage links, fresh fruit, and don't forget the build your own omelet station! The breakfast items are just the tip of the foodberg. There's also a salad bar, a nacho bar, Chocolate Shoppe ice cream (!), and plenty of other goodies. I'm usually weary of the quality of food at buffets, but all of it is delicious, and should satisfy your craving.

* = Most of the time. There's random occasions (i.e Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day) where they increase the price to $24. They claim to add special items on those days, but I personally didn't notice any differences. I find it kind of annoying for the price to increase that much on certain days, which dampens the experience, especially when you don't find out about it until after you ate. This little burden is the only thing stopping the Dane's brunch from being a 5 in my book. Just be sure to check it before you visit and it won't be a problem."}
{"text":"I went to this location after my sister's graduation from UW-Madison.  This was my first time at this location, which had more space than the one by the capital.  

The food is the same as I remember at the capital location - good not great.  I got the Mayan Chicken wrap that was tasty and hit the spot.  The waiter was extremely helpful in recommending options and with the size of our large group coming straight from graduation.  

The beer selection is GREAT!  I love stopping here to get a growler or just a pint whenever I am in Madison.  I love how they have the european pints that bubble out in the middle to grip them better.  If you are in a big group get the 10 beer sampler or larger.  It is a great option to try all the different types."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite spots. WAS. They just rolled out new menus that eliminated my favorite dish, perhaps the best salad in the city (a friend called it the 'crack salad' because it was so amazing.) No more tomato panzenella. I know, it's crazy! I did share my horror with wait staff. Now I need to find a new lunch spot.   (I had the new Mediterranean salad which was mediocre.)"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Our server Sarah was great. We ordered a particular beer that happened to be only served at their other location and she took the initiative to bring us something similar without being asked. She also helped us with our menu selections. We had the Cubano sandwich, the chipotle chicken quesadillas, and jerk pork tacos. Super yummy  Even bought a growler."}
{"text":"The Great Dane has good beer, but the food always leaves me shrugging and say \"meh\".  I've had the nachos, mac and cheese, curds, etc and they are always just OK.  The restaurant itself has average decor/ambience for a brewpub...however, it has that brewery smell which is not very appetizing or inviting.  I'll pop over here for a beer after shopping but would think twice about other options before eating here."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience tonight.  I'm in the neighborhood, and been coming to this location since it opened.  It's always been reliable, if not spectacular.  
Tonight we had not one, not two, but three items that we ordered be out of stock.  
One of which I was told about when I ordered it, the other two which we were told about after our order was in.  Admittedly, this is something of a pet peeves of mine, but being out of two menu items, and one ingredient on a build-your-own item suggests that something is not being managed correctly in the back of the house.
Hopefully this was a one-off occurrence, there are a lot of restaurants now by Hilldale, where this one was the only one for a long time.  If this is their new normal I doubt they'll last long in this area."}
{"text":"Between and 3 and a 4 for me, but gave a four because I like the franchise in general (if you can call it that).  The Hilldale location has a beautiful interior.  Obviously, if you sit outside, not going to be the greatest view looking at the nearby mall.  Have been there a few times, with good food and service.  Most recently went today with my husband for lunch.  He had the Mayan wrap, which a waitress who happened to be eating next to him at the bar at his last trip to the downtown location recommended.  He gave me a bite, and it was fantastic.  Instead of the usual burger I have, I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which is a chicken breast (fried unfortunately) tossed in hot sauce on a jalapeno roll with onion, tomato, lettuce, and a side of blue cheese.  Sandwich was very good.  Roll was a bit too much roll, at the end I just took it off and cut it up with a fork and knife.  Fries were fantastic.  

My main complaint with the Dane today is that they didn't have the Crop Circle Wheat for beer.  I don't even really like beer, but will drink it at the Dane.  Our server explained to us that the Mallards buy a lot of their beer, and that all of the beer the Mallards buy comes from the Hilldale location.  So in the summer they're often out of certain beers.  So I don't get to have the beer I want because you sell it to a third party?  That's not cool.  Make extra, or sell a limited amount.  Don't make your customers suffer (and yes, I know it's not really suffering).  But I think if you advertise you always have a beer on tap (which it says on their menu), you should have it.  I did end up having the Landmark Lite Lager, which was good, but not as good as the Crop Circle Wheat."}
{"text":"Two friends and I stumbled upon The Great Dane on our search for cheese curds and local beers as we made our way through Madison, Wisconsin. We were on day 9 of a 10 day road trip across America from California to Maryland. Being that it was a Sunday evening, the place was pretty empty. Despite this observation, the hostess took some time deliberating on where to seat us. We passed many empty tables and booths before being seated near the back by the restrooms and refill station. I couldn't help but think this was deliberate as my friends and I are minority women. 

Not wanting to let this affect our experience, we chose to remain in the restaurant and were waited on by Matt. I can't say enough about Matt and the excellent service he provided. He was prompt in taking our order and even took the time to ask us about our travels and offered his recommendations on our next stop. We ordered the cheese curds; which were amazing! Each of us greatly enjoyed our meal and enjoyed the flights of beer we had. Would recommend this place to anyone stopping through Madison. Thank you Matt for saving our experience!"}
{"text":"Hmm...
I was super excited to try this place after hearing some great reviews.
Came in at 12:30 on  Sunday and our only options were the all you can eat brunch for $15 or the appetizer/burger menu on the back.

Their other menu was huge, but we couldn't have that until 2pm on a Sunday. Bummer.

The beer list looked awesome and had really great deals (compared to where I live, Chicago) $3.50 for a 12 ounce, that is amazing! And flights of beer....sign me up!

I ordered the boneless buff wings in 3 Alarm. They weren't that hot, but still good. The gorgonzola dip tasted great, but just like blue cheese...so not really sure if it's just me who doesn't know my cheese or what...but whatev.

Service was friendly, mac and cheese pizza was on a pita bread and didn't look that amazing--sadly. I could get better mac n cheese pizza in Chicago--regular crust, too.

Burgers came with choice of friends, apple sauce, or coleslaw. You could substitute for Turkey Burger, Boca, Buffalo for $.50 to $1.00.

I would come back here for dinner if I could and get a different entree and try some beers."}
{"text":"I've been to this Great Dane location a few times, and overall I've been pretty happy with it.  Parking can be an issue, but after that, the same consistent product you'll find at other Great Dane locations.

Most of the time, I end up just there for drinks.  And their beer menu doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time, I ordered the Black and Tan Cheddar Burger, which was pretty good. I wouldn't say amazing, as I've had better burgers, but it definitely filled the craving for a burger and fries. On a recent trip, I got the Cajun Chicken sandwich. It was a good sandwich, with tasty spices and seasoning. However, it was TINY. I was shocked at how small the chicken breast was, and that the lettuce and tomato on the sandwich completely overshadowed the chicken. It was one of those sandwiches that you could finish in just a few bites. I had the sandwich with a side of cheddar grits, which were good, more on the dry side, but still good. 

I would recommend coming here if you are in a rush, or come here for the beer. But there are much better places for good American type food in Madison."}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna Salad for the healthy, Brat Bacon Pretzel Burger for the rest of us! Great beer, Great service."}
{"text":"Food was great but they told us 25-30 minute wait and we actually waited an hour and a half. 

While we were waiting, we decided we'd go down and play some pool until we found out it was 7 or 8 dollars (can't remember) just to play one game!"}
{"text":"I raise them one star for their stance on the micro beer issue.   People are starting to wake up that we have the power to fight back and fight we will.  Great Dane is doing the absolute right thing.  Thank you Great Dane!"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of The Great Dane and living in between two of them has always been a plus for me. I always suggest coming here whenever someone new comes in to town, the people, beer and food have always been up to par. That being said the last two times I visited the Hilldale establishment I have been very embarrassed  at my suggestion and just plain disappointed that the cooks and waitress had the nerve to serve me grease slop. Both times my guest and I ordered cheese curds and they were completely drenched in oil, soggy and gross. This past time not only were they slightly burnt, slopping in oil, but 6  of them didn't even have cheese in the curd which I assume is because it was cooked so long the cheese came out. It seems to me a new breading or curd is being used, please go back to the original. The other food there is great, but I truly love cheese curds and my appetite has been ruined by the choice to serve me and I would assume other customers In The best words \"crap\". Please doing something about this Great Dane, because I love giving you my money, but right now that's not going to happen."}
{"text":"This is definitely the least favorite of mine for their locations. Parking is difficult during their busy hours and with the mall and theater nearby, it makes things even more tricky. I do like that the bar is very central in this pub when you walk through the doors.

As always, the food is great and the beer is decent."}
{"text":"It is a local, within walking distance for me, so I have been more than more.

Overall, it is an enjoyable atmosphere (in the bar area).  Sitting is usually available.

Their beer is good....some great....some okay.  They keep a good variety of beers on tap, both seasonal and the regulars.

Food is good....sometime really good....just depends on what you like.  I have tried a couple of items I did not like....pulled pork sandwich is one, but I have items I really like....their green chili, Reubens and Smothered Chicken to name a few.

I have been very fortunate with good service.  Nice place to watch multiple games too.  I will keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Sunday Brunch today. Even though it didn't end for another 1.5 hours, and they stopped putting out new food, so many options ran out or got old. The breads dried out and the hollandaise sauce separated. The desserts ran out, and so did the chicken wings and eggs benedict. It was as if the restaurant wasn't even trying and didn't care to have customers.
Our waitress didn't clear our dirty plates or refilled our drinks.
For the quality and selection, not worth $15.  
I would not recommend. There are better options!"}
{"text":"I will love the Dane forever, and this is my favorite location.  The food is fantastic--I love substituting for bison burgers.
The burgers are what I order most often, but I also enjoy their \"Inner Warmth\" stew.  There's something for (almost?) everyone on the menu.
The beer is very good--I especially like their Crop Circle Wheat.
This is a great place to watch a game or hang out with friends; lots of seating options, whether you want it loud and rowdy or an intimate booth (two ends of the restaurant make this easy to sit where you're comfortable)."}
{"text":"I love The Great Dane Brewing Co.! I was first introduced by my realtor at the Hilldale location when searching for a home in Madison. Then upon each visit we stopped in just because we new where it was and that the food was good. Now I meet my husband for lunch there and I've taken friends and family. Everything I've had has been delish! The staff has always been friendly and efficient. When I inquired about their IPA beer, the server brought me a sample to taste prior to ordering. The only down side for me was when we went for lunch on a Sunday and were told a flat fee brunch ran until 2p. Only afterward could we order off the menu. But, we will keep going back for sure!"}
{"text":"1 1/2 stars rounded up to 2 only because their location is convenient. 

The food is horrendous.  

I want to like this place.  I really do.  But the food has actually taken a turn for the worse lately.  Its really bad.  

The bar feels like a chain, which isnt necessarily bad.  Its clean and service is decent.  Its just the food...oh yeah, and their beer...

Their beer is pretty gross.  I'm still impressed they have two cask conditioned on tap but unfortunately neither is very good.  Overall their beers are way too sweet.  I leave feeling bloated and on a sugar high.  Syrupy if you will.  

If you want to grab one or two and have a quick app then I understand.  I somehow end up there every once-in-a-while.  Unfortunately it keeps getting worse each time.  

I'll probably still go here and there but I'm not happy about it.  Its one of those places..."}
{"text":"I've been to this GD Location twice now. First with the man and a friend, and we were all slightly disappointed in the food. My salmon sandwich was WAY too smoky and a touch on the oily side(even for an oily fish). The second time it was with a larger group, and we were led alllll the way into the back to be seated. I had NO idea that this place was so big. The atmosphere is nice, for a pub. Plenty of seating, and as Chris said, the outdoor area is nice. 

But, I was STILL disappointed in my food selection. To me, a dish called \"Wisconsin Mac and Cheese\" should showcase cheese...not just a plain bechamel sauce and bread crumbs. Don't get me wrong, it was decent pasta...just not what I consider \"mac and cheese\"... I'd give this place one more shot, I guess."}
{"text":"A brew pub with a local connection, the great badger running back, Ron Dane. Expect huge, football player-sized portions and enough choices that everyone on your big 10 squad could have something different. 

We enjoyed the salmon, Cesar wrap and burgers - all excellent. Service could be a little spiffier butt it seems the restaurant was seating people section by section thus overwhelming the diligent servers who got all their tables at once. 

Will go back for the food, without question."}
{"text":"My favorite location of one of my favorite restaurants! Their food is amazingly delicious. I love every burger I've ever had. The Nakoma Nachos are some of the best I've had and I can never pass up the beer bread and butter. The only thing I've ever gotten from the Dane that I didn't like was calamari, but I got that from the down town location so I don't know if it's different here. I absolutely love the atmosphere. I spent some of my first dates with my boyfriend in a cozy, intimate booth in their front area. He and I come here every year around the time we fell in love with each other. The wait service is always amazing, but I don't usually like their bartenders. My boyfriend and I have gone for pick up last minute which I know isn't the best thing in the world to do, but we always call ahead! The bartender will say it's fine, but when we get there we get turned away even though we get there in time. I haven't been back in about six months because this has happened three times."}
{"text":"*Brunch buffet review only*

Came here for Sunday brunch at around 10:30 A.M. so we missed any potentially big crowds. The service was excellent and we were seated immediately. The buffet fare is extremely varied, including standard breakfast fare (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc) as well as several other stations that had specialty items (like eggs Benedict, chicken and waffles, grits, chowder, Mac N' cheese, taco bar, salad bar, omelet station, roasted meats, pastries, desserts, etc). The vibe was a more upscale buffet on brunch and I enjoyed all of the options. That being said, the food in itself wasn't amazing. While there were plenty of options, nothing stood out, from the fried chicken (wasn't crispy and was a little dry), to quiche to the small smoothie cups there were. It was an overall pleasant atmosphere and experience, but the food in itself did not blow me away. $17 is a decent price for a brunch buffet here, but I couldn't help but feel that I could have paid less for one higher quality brunch instead. I was overall a little disappointed at the quality, though thought the variety of options was decent for a bar/pub-like place."}
{"text":"I really like the Great Dane and it seems that time and location seem to be a factor. We really like to sit Poolside at the Hilldale location because the round booths are super comfy. The past few times Babe and I have been there I've had the Cubano, which I absolutely love! We quite often go for lunch before or after we shop at Metcalfe's depending on the time of year. One of the best reasons to drink here is if you like whiskey, because they tend to be generous with their neat pours. I also really like their pool tables. It does get busy for dinner, but lunch on Saturday is usually an okay bet unless the Badgers are out."}
{"text":"Do not get the Walleye on Friday! Bland, soupy, scary.
Not happy.
Had hoped for better service and review of Friday fish fry, response \"Its the greatest, its my favorite fish fry!\"

Beer...good!"}
{"text":"The wait for the server to take our order and later to get our food was brutal. The cheese curds tasted just like chopped mozzarella sticks. Nothing special overall."}
{"text":"Generic brewpub. I prefer the downtown location but this one is less packed and easier to get to. The menu changes every so often and I like that because variety is the spice of life but some people would rather eat the same thing every time and they would do well to avoid getting attached to anything but the burgers (which nobody should be attached to). Salads are good"}
{"text":"Love the place and it's food.
I like the location because it is big and nicely decorated. I like that they can offer different rooms for private events, all of them different sizes.
The staff is really helpful and nice.

I've tried several things over the time, still am a fan of their mashed potatoes and chicken quesadillas if you like it spicy. Of course their different types of beverages, including the beer offering."}
{"text":"Service: 3.5
Food: 3.5
Environment: 1

I had friends came to spend the weekend in Madison with me and they wanted to grab dinner nearby. We went to the Great Dane knowing there wouldn't be too long of a wait. This location has a lot of seating. We waited 2 minutes. Perfect. 

Server was prompt. Our soups and salads came out first. We put in an appetizer and our server forgot to put it in. He ended up not charging us for it. Our food was great. 

I guess the thing that really made the experience not so pleasant was the environment. There was a wall next to us and on the other side was a large family with a bunch of kids that kept telling. We could barely hear ourselves. No one told them to quiet down until right before they left. It was unbearable. 

I've been to their weekend brunch and it's pretty good if you go earlier when everything is fresh. Pricing is good and therebis a good variety. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Great Dane has to be one of my all time favorite Madison restaurants. The food is good, the beer is better and the service and decor just really make you feel like home. 

First lets talk beer. The scotch ale is phenomenal, I can't rave about it enough. It's a smooth, full caramel flavor that would go with any of their amazing burgers. Another that I tried for the first time last night was their fruity beer called serendipity. It was like a cranapple citrus cocktail. It was so fruity that if someone had blind taste tested me with it I would have never guessed it was beer and not a mix drink of sorts, honestly. This would be a perfect option for converting any girl you know who doesn't drink beer because it didn't taste good or that beer is for men over to the good side.

The food is also awesome, classic pub food but much higher quality. The cheese curds are good to start, but I love their artichoke dip. It's served warm in a bread bowl so you can eat apart the soft doughy serving dish after. Next you simply must try their French onion soup. There is so much caramelized chese on that bad boy you could probably not eat anything else and be stuffed. Next the burger, seven ounces of meat smothered in cheese and sauce. I would suggest you upgrade to the pretzel bun, its worth it and you are already not counting any of the calories in this meal so you might as well do this right. I tried the sweet potato tots with this last night and it was just ok, I'll stick with fries in the future.

To be given this smorgasbord of deliciousness you should expect to wait. There's always a wait on weekends and certainly your food doesn't fly out of the kitchen either. But if tasty food and drink is something you are willing to put some time in for, you definitely should do it here."}
{"text":"Went there for a wedding rehearsal dinner and was very impressed! The server was great and handled such a large and demanding group quickly and efficiently. We had a menu of about eight options to choose from and strategically ordered as many different things as we could between the five of us sitting together, and everyone was very happy with what they got. Personally I had the meatloaf which was outstanding; I heard several guests rave about the salmon. To top it off the handcrafted beers were also great--my favorite was the wheat. I don't live in Madison but I would definitely recommend this place to those there."}
{"text":"The Great Dane gets a solid OK. It's consistently OK. It's also open Sunday night - a plus. You can get the burgers with local beef or bison for an up charge. 

We had the special - a Chicken Cordon Bleu (sort of). The ham and cheese were laid on top of a thinly pounded deep fried chicken breast, smothered in a creamy mushroom sauce. It was tasty - but not really a Chicken Cordon Bleu. 

Also had the Chicken Salad sandwich. It came on a croissant. Companion said it could have used grapes or walnuts. 

One of the best sides is the fried plantains. But there are a number of sides to choose from - green beens, apple sauce, cold veggies, and fries. 

The Great Dane is consistent and you can usually get a table in the seat yourself back bar pretty quickly. There is a more formal dining service up front - both seating areas have the same menu."}
{"text":"I really have no idea where to start, I adore this place! Not only is the food usually amazing (a couple of their dishes are just not quite my taste, tho still well done), but the atmosphere is addicting. I've been going here for a number of years and in all that time I think I've only had one instance of poor service. The regular servers are extremely nice and knowledgeable about both their food and beers, so ask your servers to help match your food and drink! I loooove their in house beers (their Black Earth Porter and Emerald Isle Stout has ruined me for most others)! The darker beers can taste a bit salty but I actually enjoy that saltiness. 

I'm always excited for the seasonal menu update that the Great Dane does. It keeps their food fresh and their establishment interesting. They have cozy booths with wonderfully high backs that gives the place a nice intimate feel for a date and allows you to actually hear what your dining companions are saying.

The downside that pops up is that a lot of other people realize how good this place is. So depending on the time you go, there could be a decent waiting time."}
{"text":"I visited Great Dane with some coworkers when I first came to Madison for training. I enjoyed their brew selection so much I returned the next time I was in the area for training. Each time I visited I was seated quickly and the server arrived to the table promptly. The atmosphere is warm due to the normal earth tones and dark wood seen in many pubs, as well as the fireplaces on the premises. There is also a large pool hall, which I still haven't checked out. 

There is a superb variety of tasty craft brew. I liked everything I sampled, the Oktoberfest, Barleywine, and the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale, so it was difficult to make a decision. But that being said, I was completely happy when I finally did decide. Hopefully, I will get to try their Porters and Stout at a later date. 
As for the food, on my first visit I ordered the German Sausage Plate, and on the subsequent visit I ordered the New London Bridge Fish Fry. The sausage was great, however, the garlic mashed potatoes tasted like no salt was added at all. The fish was succulent and fried nicely, however, it also was missing salt. I ordered an appetizer of cheese curds on each occasion, and each time they were delicious. 

So for me, the brew is the star, as it should be since it is a brewery. Therefore, it is primarily the brew that earned the four stars, in addition to the great service. The food is fair, but I think you will definitely be pleased if you are coming in for just brew and an appetizer. For those who are not into brew, a full bar is also available. Stop by and check them out, the great brew is worth it."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is the Cheesecake Factory of Madison, WI. They try to do everything, and they do it a-ok. A few things are actually pretty good, but they can be tough to find through the massive newspaper that is their menu (seriously, its designed like a newspaper). Their in-house beer is decidedly sub-par, and they don't really offer other options, which is a shame in a state so inundated with excellent breweries. 

If you've got your mind set on the Great Dane, and the weather is permitting, head downtown-- the outdoor beer garden is a game-changer."}
{"text":"Hmm, I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place.  I visit this location every few months and am never dissapointed.  They have one of the best decently priced brunches in the area and the service is usually spot on!  I also love how they are alway mixing up the menu; they is always something new to try.  I think my favorite thing about this place though is that they don't hassle you when you want to substitute side dishes.  I usally try to find a way to add plaintains to my dish and I never receive a snarky response or a ridiculous sub fee.  Love it!"}
{"text":"If you don't like the Sunday brunch here, you probably just don't like brunch buffets. There is something for everyone, some good, some OK, nothing bad. 

Start with the on-premise-brewed beers on which they made their name. Maybe use one as a chaser for their pretty-good Bloodies. My kids like their house sodas. I've sipped them too. They're good.

The fruit and veggies on the salad bar are fresh and offer a nice contrast to the heavy (but delicious) hash brown casserole, the cooked-to-order omelets, the prime rib, the bacon (yes, of course, bacon!), the sausage, the scrambled eggs (why not get an omelet, though?), the eggs Benedict, the biscuits and the gravy and the pancakes and french toast. 

Full yet? Good, because this is only half of what's here: Pasta, beef tips, noodles, steamed veggies, turkey, dressing and mashed potatoes all await you on the other side of the buffet. It's not all steaming hot, but does heat add flavor? Really? 

The desserts and pastries rest in between, but who has room now? The screens are a little small if you're coming in for the NFL action, so you'll have to luck into or wait for a table by a TV that has your game. Do do doot, do do do doot! Go! Pack! Go!"}
{"text":"\"The Great Dane\" is essentially Madison's version of a \"Ruby Tuesdays\" except they make their own beer. Unfortunately, I live and work close by so I end up getting suckered into going there more often then I'd like. 
Pro
--outdoor seating!
--fun for watching sports
--local beer, but I think New Glarus and Capitol are much better
Con:
--pricey bar food
--inconsistent service and quality of food
--Loud(it's a bar!)
--service can be VERY slow if it's even a little busy
--a few uncaring, incompetent servers that can ruin your meal

If you feel that you absolutely MUST do \"The Dane\" experience head over to the downtown location as it's a bit better."}
{"text":"Love this place and all I have to say is two things:  love, love, LOVE their Bloody Mary's, and if you like french onion soup, this is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"While GDP-Hilldale can be considered a scheduling game of \"russian roulette\" after 5pm, the rewards for getting there at the right time are sometimes worthwhile, provided some insight into specific menu items prevents further \"russian roulette\" shenanigans.  The menu is a convoluted and often bizarre combination of items that when viewed as a whole, makes one think of the \"Tower of Babel\" in menu form.  Their signature \"sustain-a-burger\", now heftily priced at over $10 leaves a satisfying taste and mouth feel.  Unless you are under strict dietary supervision, avoid the warmed vegetable side, which is merely naked vegetables which may have been frozen until their presentation on your table.  On other occasions, items have been hit or miss, mainly due to a wide variation of temperatures when served, and on rare occasion, the possibility of a \"reheating\".  With the price points of entrees ranging between $12-$20, such experiments are unwelcome.  Those on a budget can get away with a cup of soup and a side salad with chicken for around $10."}
{"text":"My drink was good. Wasn't hungry so just ordered pub fries. They were given to me within minutes of ordering so basically I got someone's screw up order because they weren't even hot. What a joke will go somewhere just because I didn't have my husband with me. I didn't order enough for them to care"}
{"text":"Typical chainish spot with a few unique items like mac and cheese pizza and pretzel brat/ burger. Just add exercise!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars...
Yelp came through again!!!
Ordered the cheese curds, and they were the best I've ever had! Served with a hatch chile ranch which complemented the tender batter and salty cheese.
For lunch I had the chimmichurrie steak salad. Cool greens balanced the spicy dressing and steak chunks. Avocado, corn, black beans, and tortilla strips all worked well together. The portion was so large I had no room for dessert..
Prices are in line with expectation and ambiance is standard outdoor patio.
This joint makes the list, I'll come back and likely order the same items all over again, but next time save room for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess was a bit rude, waitress was pleasant. Beer is sort of flat. Limited menu on Sundays."}
{"text":"Neat bar/brewpub right by the state Capital building. Really nice beer selection, tons of house brews to sample. Very fun visit!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer. I have never thought twice about coming here during the week.  Have not had the fish fry so I can't comment there. Super menu with so many tasty treats to choose from. Can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by the food. On the other hand, I will admit that the service can lag a little at times."}
{"text":"The service was a little less subservient than I prefer, but can't argue with the potato/leek/bacon soup.  And in WI, it's safe to assume cheddar is included.  Yummy - with some kind of cinnamon vodka drink, served in error with no apology or discount.  Who cares, it was all tasty and the back bar redolent of yesteryear with big leatheresque booths surrounding our chubby cherubic happy selves.  Gotta love smug, fat, happy WI.  Go big red...we know how to eat!"}
{"text":"Great Beer & Great Food. 
The Beer is really good, some of the best beer I've ever had !! \"Jamaican Jerk\" The best wings I had in Madison."}
{"text":"So the place looks awesome from the outside....great selection of beer and the atmosphere is cozy and lively. On the downside, I've had their food several times and to me its just ok, nothing to write home about or even here. It just tastes ok or glorified bar food. It could be what I had to eat. It's not just this one, I've been to another and had the same impression."}
{"text":"I had the Texarkana Burger.  It was meh.  The atmosphere is great here.  It is in a great location near the mall.  The food was above average price and it wasn't that good.  We really have nothing special to say about it.  I was hoping for so much more and we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently visited Madison after 15 years away. I was shocked to see how the city and Hilldale had changed -- for the better, it seems. Back in the day, I remember a lonely Chinese restaurant and a Quiznos as the only food choices at Hilldale. We were there in September. Not sure how all the outdoor activity changes during Madison's frigid months. I'll let the city planners worry about that. The fay were were there, the while place was buzzing with crowds.

I believe Great Dane had opened its first location right before we left Madtown. This was our first visit. The menu provides some humorous nods to Madison culture. We appreciated that.

We were seated at a table by the window for optimal people watching. I ordered a salad and some decadent soup -- potato, bacon and cheese. On the plate was an absolutely lovely pretzel roll, which I devoured. My husband had a couple ales and a sandwich. He was feeling no pain by the time we left. I am not a beer drinker, so I stuck with iced tea, liberally refilled by our waitress.

Overall we had a positive experience. Recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Great Dane! I especially enjoy the Hildale location, although the Fitchburg location is where my husband and I had our first date many years ago. Last night we attended the NYE event at the Hildale location. We had a really lovely time. There was only a five dollar cover charge and the band was fun. My burger was well cooked and very tasty. My favorite new discovery is the 
Stone of the Scone Scottish Ale. Our waiter was friendly but not constantly in our face. It was great to see folks of all ages out having a good time. The Great Dane Hildale put on a great party at a reasonable price. Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Love this place (and it's not all about the beer). 

It might be packed with people, but there are a lot of tables and booths, and hopefully you won't have to wait (we didn't). The menus are super cute--like a small newspaper--and fairly extensive. There were two salads that looked so enticing and a couple of entrees that I wanted, but I eventually ordered the chicken pot pie! 

But first the beer... I usually don't order beer because I have a very limited number of beers that I'll drink (Guinness--ONLY in the U.K., coffee stout--ONLY in Alaska), so I'm picky! Thankfully you could have as many free samples as needed, but after trying the Emerald Isle Stout (along with a porter that I forgot the name), I ordered the 12 ounce Stout. If you like beer or are like me with a limited group of \"likes,\" I'm guessing you can find the right one here!

Back to the food. The chicken pot pie has only the top as pie crust, as the bottom is a pot. Inside the chicken pieces are plentiful, the veggies are good, and the cream sauce is excellent! It came with a pretzel stick, but after a bite, I handed it off to the hubby. It tasted fine, but I didn't need it, as my entree also came with \"applesauce,\" which was really baked apple slices and a little sprinkle of cinnamon. So yummy! I counted that as dessert, so my meal was complete and excellent!

Service was excellent. We actually had two people attending our table, as one was in training, and this was no problem.

Great experience!"}
{"text":"With the space for two bar areas and several dining rooms, this location is a decent option for groups. They also have a pool table, shuffleboard, and darts without a lot of crowding in order to play.

The bars are generally efficient, and the service is adequate though not exceptional. The menu is decent although I'd like to see it expand a bit more. The food is filling and tasty on the higher end of a bar menu. The appetizers and mac and cheese tend to be my favorites.

My only real downfall here is the parking situation. Hilldale has not figured this out, which is unfortunate. If you park in the ramp you cannot leave any vehicles overnight. I find this discouraging as this area now has several bars/restaurants serving alcohol and should be more accommodating for safe options. The other options are risking a ticket in the bank or hardware store lots, or parking back by Sundance Theater or University Bookstore (which is my usual go-to) for less hassle."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for happy hour on your way home from work.  They have a great beer selection, and a nice menu.  We've never been displeased with the food.  The atmosphere is fun - they opened up the back area - which looks REALLY great.  
The service has always been lacking.  The waitstaff don't seem to care - and we've had several rude staff over the years."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for drinks with friends and appetizers. I've been here many times for just that and it would get an extra star if just that.

However, they also have many dishes and a pretty large weekend brunch buffet. The buffet had it's highs and lows, but the one thing that stood out to me, was the ranch dressing.

FYI, if going to brunch, it's great for groups. They have a salad bar, complete with shrimp, fruit/yogurt and a nacho section. They have an omelet station and prime rib. They had pancakes, french toast, ribs, pasta's, mango chicken, cheesy potatoes, vegetables and stuffing. There was variety. Hopefully knowing this helps. Oh.. and we really liked the wings. Especially when paired with the ranch.

Overall, it's not bad, but it's not great. I think it would be ideal for large groups or if you want to have drinks with friends. Most locations have pool tables, dart boards and shuffle boards."}
{"text":"It couldn't get much worse.1t is almost laughable. Server claims that u could not order off regular menu even though we arrived at 10:45. Late might menu kicks in at 11Pm. He gave us water then disappeared for 10 minutes .when we asked to order he told us we could not off regular menu. What an idiot. Where's the manager when u need one??"}
{"text":"Wide variety of food; had one of the new Oktoberfest specials - curry brat over fries with pickled peppers. Balanced flavor. Also it has good booth seating. Game day snacks / specials. Was family friendly or date friendly."}
{"text":"Visited to celebrate Father's Day with my dad, brother and his girlfriend and my son. Our server, Nancy, was outstanding and the food was amazing! Not to mention the excellent beer. Would recommend it to anyone who wants a good drink and some great food."}
{"text":"Checked this place out during a Badgers game. Good atmosphere and not too busy and crowded. The wings were excellent. Tomato soup a bit salty. Fish and chips solid and their seasonal Bavarian chicken sandwich was also solid. They have a good array of drinks on tap. Service was great. Place clean. There's also a quieter area too if you want brewery without loudness from the game. What you expect from a good pub & brewery."}
{"text":"Over priced for mediocre burgers and uninteresting entrees. I would only go here for convenience or to not offend a conservative pallet."}
{"text":"This was my second time in Madison, and my second time at the Great Dane.  I've never been disappointed, and this time remembered to try one of their many beers.  
First the beer-  I went for their wheat, and it was delicious-  just a great flavor without being too hoppy or too heavy.   For my meal, I went for the buffalo mac and cheese-  it came with grilled chicken and a pretzel roll.  It had just the right amount of kick, and the mac and cheese was delicious, just what I expect from Wisconsin!  I also had had a brat, and that too was great.  Add in a friendly and attentive server, and it was a great meal."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Great Dane and I love the large open space of the back bar area.  I was recently there for a Sunday brunch with a group of friends.  They take reservations and the waiter was chill with us arriving and leaving in shifts.  Since the brunch was a buffet style we could get up and get what we needed as we needed.  The waiter was still attentive with our drinks and the fact that we all had separate bills.  I recommend the tables in the back bar area over the booths and the \"loft\" area in the back is great for slightly larger gatherings like birthday gatherings.  Don't forget to arrive in time to park if you are meeting people as street spots are limited as well as the parking lot across the street.  The ramp is usually the fastest and best bet."}
{"text":"We came here last March on our way to Milwaukee after a night in Middleton. As craft beer enthusiasts and fans of the dog breed, it was only proper to stop in and check it out.

There's a handful of Great Danes in the Madison area. As a Chicago suburbanite, Great Dane reminds me of Rock Bottom restaurants, only the Danes have both a larger selection of beer and food, plus Sunday brunches. Oh, and they're cleaner, brighter, and bigger (as least the Hilldale location is). I wish we had Great Danes instead of Rock Bottom!

We tried a handful of beers, including:

Peck's Pilsner (5.36%) - A nice, light Pilsner, this beer is a good one to start with. I stuck with a taste rather than a full pour.

Crop Circle Wheat (4.99%) - This Hefeweizen is a fabulous German brew garnished with a slice of lemon. It definitely hits the spot on an warm, early spring day. This was one of my favorites we tried. 

High Tea (4.5%) - An English Mild Ale. I thought it was just alright; there's some slight roasted flavors that makes this an easy drinker if you don't feel like venturing onto the darker, heavier side of beer.

Kelheim Bock (6.4%) - Malty but smooth. 

Black Earth Porter (5.83%) - This was our favorite beer. The taste of chocolate and coffee is prominent; there's no shortage of flavor here!

As typical with brewery visits, we picked up shirts and a growler. I also bought a pint glass with their logo on it, because you can never have too many pint glasses, and this has a Great Dane on it (and we love Danes!). 

We did not get to try any of the food as we had eaten on the stop previous to this, but their menu is intriguing and I would certainly try some items in the future.

The restaurant is clean and inviting; the bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Parking wasn't too bad on a Sunday morning at around 11 a.m.; we were able to park easily right on Price Place.

We'll definitely be back the next time we do a weekend jaunt in the 608!"}
{"text":"Love the beer.  Love the food.

This is a nice, large location.  I found the service to be very friendly and attentive to our needs.  I've always loved the food Great Dane shells out.  I had the brat/burger thing - it was decadent...  

Of course, the beer is fantastic.  Try 'em all!"}
{"text":"It's the Madison version of your typical local giant pub, it brews its own beers which are fine but not amazing, makes its own sodas, and has a massive menu. There's everything from burgers to random falafel or tandoori chicken. And of course cheese curds. They come with ranch but the waiter had no problem bringing us some bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese with chicken was good, but the sauce was more liquidy than really cheesy. The buffalo sauce in it was good. My friend said the tandoori chicken and falafel are some of his favorites. The burgers are also good. The ginger ale was decent, different from Schweppes or whatever, but not as flavorfufl as I'd like, and a pint was a lot. the root beer was also decent. The service was good, friendly, and quick. There's plenty of parking. As my friend aid, it won't be the best meal you've ever had, but nothing will be bad."}
{"text":"nice place.  came here to celebrate a friends birthday.  they charged us for bringing our own cake.  not nice for a group of med students.  no parties here again"}
{"text":"was at the eastside  place on Jupiter--group of 12-place was empty-had the total upstairs--just walked in from Chicago--had an IPA--not much good, but,like pizza--fresh homemade is never that bad--$5.50 for Imperial pint-- 

Had the tuna salad--weak--thought that peak Wisconsin produce would be killin it--but not there--freezer fries--overall nothing good"}
{"text":"This Great Dane Hilldale location is in my neighborhood.  It is a reliable choice when meeting a group of friends before a movie or just for a few drinks.  The staff is usually spot on professional and friendly.  

My usual order is the James Madison (half sandwich and bowl of soup) with the Cuban and the West African Chicken Peanut Stew.  So flavorful and tasty.  There is nothing better on a cold day then this stew.  They do make great burgers, too.  And I can not complain about their starters.

But one of the best reasons to go is for the Beer.  I enjoy trying all their styles."}
{"text":"I support the Great Dane in large part because of their support for MUFA (Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association).  They give a tremendous amount of resources and space to the thousands of Frisbee players who show up after games all summer long.
I am actually not a fan of their beer...I always get the Scotch Ale which I enjoy...but have left with a major headache when trying more then one in a night.
Their food however is fabulous.  I highly recommend the nachos with chicken or 20 piece chicken wings.  I was also pleasantly surprised by their fish fry."}
{"text":"I'm going to reiterate what other reviewers have said previously. The service is completely lacking here. The servers - while friendly - take an exorbitant amount of time to come to your table. The kitchen - while making incredibly tasty food - is unacceptably slow. And the price you pay for both is just far too much for what you get. 

As for kid/family friendly, I would try somewhere else or get carry out. This place is a brewpub that tries to be good for families, but in the end it's still just a bar.

Tasty food but not enough to make up for the other detractors."}
{"text":"Have great starters to share with friends, and also great beer. Would be even better if they had large screens for sport games.
They have brunch buffet on Sunday mornings. I like their salad bar which has shrimp and salmon. There's also fresh-made omelette which you can choose for your own ingredients."}
{"text":"As a frequent guest at the Great Dane, I'd say that usually I have a good time here.  This past Saturday, I attended post badger game for the Dane's $2 drafts. I started to get hungry and ordered the cheese/artichoke dip. It was absolutely terrible,  the bread bowl it came out in was cold hard bread and the dip might as well been cream of chicken soup with large chunks of artichoke. Not much of a dip. For $10, I expected much better than the top of the bread bowl (which was also hard and cold) and a few sticks of celery/carrots.   No one at my table would even try it, it looked so unappetizing and I couldn't blame them."}
{"text":"So great. Food was hot and delicious, wait staff was prompt and gave recommendations when I was indecisive. Cheese curds we're out of this world. I ordered a grilled cheese and their peanut stew, was savory and had the right amount of oomph to it. Husband ordered the fried fish which was amazing. the fish was fresh and melted in your mouth. Would go again. Pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and love their french onion soup and mac n' cheese.  Also, being a vegetarian, I love the option to change any of their burger patties out with a veggie patty, and their veggie patty is pretty darn good.  They also have delicious bloody mary's and salads as well.  However, it's a tad overpriced for the amount you get.  I'm not that big of a beer drinker, so their extensive/awesome beer selection of their own beers doesn't really appeal to me.  I will definitely continue to go back, just not often so I can save up again during visits ;)"}
{"text":"IT IS OFFICIAL.... I HAVE AN OVER-EATING PROBLEM

Before we get to the light bulb point, let's step back and set the scene.

I'd been recommended this place by some colleagues who have been to Madison a lot for work. We looked it up and found there were a few locations for the group so we picked here as it was closer to Verona where we were staying and we thought we'd be able to park easier than near the capital (we were right there was a free car lot across the street).

We walk in and its packed! Thursday night and we were told it would be a 60min wait for a table for 2! But they said if we could find room at the bar or the high top tables we could just sit. So we hovered and almost left but I was thinking if it's this busy we really have to try it! We got super lucky and found a high top table and were set. We got our hands on the menu which was in the style of an old newspaper (cool!) and the menu was huge! We struggled to pick.... until I saw the fried chicken with shrimp, andoille sausage, artichoke and mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes and jalapenos and seasonal veggies ... with a name like smothered and covered fried chicken it pretty much sums up an almost perfect meal for me.... sold! As I was ordering I was telling myself.. diet start tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow... salad only for the next week!

Food arrives... of course as expected large serve... and it is great. Chicken is crunchy fried and the toppings work well and the jalapeno mashed potatoes are great... a really nice spice that went well with the chicken.

Now to the official fatso moment.... the waitress comes over and sees my empty plate... it must not be a common occurrence as she looks over and audibly says \"wow\" and gives me a HIGH FIVE!... oh the shame... Diet starts tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, dam you America and your delicious food!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars for the tuna tataki off the appetizer menu and the african peanut stew. Favorites off this menu.  Everything else tried here has always been good!  Love their variety of brews but they also have a nice selection of wine.  Pretty crowded before movie time on Friday nights, but you can get a quick bite at the bar or the bar top tables without waiting....if you find a seat."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is always a good choice for dinner! They're meals are tasty, the venue is nice, the service is usually very good and the price is fair. It's always less busy when you come for lunch rather than dinner, but even during dinner hours, during the week you shouldn't have a problem just showing up without a reservation. 
The chicken pot pie is my favorite menu item! It comes with a pretzel bun and a delicious side of cooked cinnamon apples (which I use as dessert!)  All of this is only $10-$11, what a deal!"}
{"text":"This is not the best Dane in the Madison area but the closest, most convenient one for us.

Service is always so-so and the food quality just seems to get worse and worse every time we come. We usually get an order if poutine which is one of my favorite dishes in general. Theirs is ok, nothing special but good enough. They Asian tuna salad is also pretty tasty. The meatloaf also isn't bad or their burgers but like I said quality that we have expected from a Great Dane Restaurant just isn't there anymore.

Their beer is good and we will sometime stop here for just that but every time we pass the Dane now my husband and I just kinda make a face and choose another spot to dine. There are a lot of other choices now for quality American cuisine that the Dane is rarely in our rotation anymore."}
{"text":"Beer is delicious, pretzel is delicious, I haven't had the best experience with entrees. I've tried 2 entrees there and both times they were just okay. The service has always been great though."}
{"text":"We found this place from asking a clerk at the hotel. It was a bit difficult to get to but it was well worth it. The food was very good and they even made substitutions when requested. It was very loud and the drinks weren't refilled very quickly. For those reasons, it didn't get a five. But, if you are in the area, it is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"Great location, atmosphere, and prices.  The food is hit or miss though, depending on what you get.  The most disappointing though is the staff.  Most of the times I've been there I have always felt that I was burden or they were too busy to serve me.  Still, I would recommend based on beer selection."}
{"text":"We sat outside which was very nice. The food  was good. I had a wrap and my friend had chicken salad. Sweet potato fries were yummy and the service was also good."}
{"text":"Food and beer were delicious. Service was friendly and professional. We ate downstairs, very cool environment."}
{"text":"This place can be packed, and you may very well wait 45 minutes for a table some nights. The hosts and hostesses are friendly, and the servers provide good service, in general. Although, I'm not usually \"wow-ed\" when I come to Great Dane. 

The fried fish that goes into the fish tacos is mediocre. The BBQ \"salsa\" for that dish is also a bit odd. The salmon burger is always a winner, though, and the caper aioli is really tasty. I understand this is a place that brews their own beer, but I didn't expect the cocktail menu to be essentially non-existent and for the moscow mule to be just \"eh\" that I took baby sips from the whole meal. The one appetizer that does wow me here is the Mediterranean plate.

I think this place is a staple, both the Hilldale and downtown locations, in Madison because it is always decent and has a good selection. I wouldn't go out of my way necessarily to eat at the Dane, but it's always a convenient option when I'm near Hilldale or seeing a show downtown and wanting to grab food and a drink beforehand.

The parking is a bit weird here too. The spots to the west of the restaurant state that it's reserved for the bank, but that leaves a few street parking spots and the parking garage. I've parked in the lot almost every time and never had any issues with getting a ticket..."}
{"text":"We went out at 12:30 to get lunch and watch the Steelers game.  We were so happily surprised with how great of a deal the brunch buffet was and how good it was!  Kids 4 and under, so all three of my kids, eat the brunch free!  SCORE!  

The kids and I went to the buffet approximately 17 times.  They ate SO much!  Pancakes, french toast, cheesy hash browns, tacos, sausage, bacon, eggs, fruit, yogurt, omelette station, carving station, tacos, waffles, salad bar, and ice cream sundae station.  The food was awesome, extensive beer list selection (their home brewed wheat beer was really good), and quick service.

We were able to get our game on one TV even during the Bears Packers game, and we will definitely be back to try their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Careful going on a Sunday before 2 they only serve the late night  menu and a way too expensive buffet."}
{"text":"This place was packed and looked fun. However, we ended up being disappointed. We asked and were seated outside. The table was not very nice and covered with bird poop. Also, we were sitting right next to all the utilities under the stairs and it smelled / gross. So, we moved up to the bar. The bar was very dirty but we finally got it cleaned. There were 2 ladies running the bar and were very rude. They kept apologizing for their behavior saying that it is busy. As a customer, I would expect good service. We did flights and they were so impatient with us when picking what we wanted. We ate at the bar and waited a very long time. The food was sub par bar food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch, and thoroughly enjoyed our burgers. Everything was flavorful, prepared exactly how I requested. The portions weren't too big, either. I also loved my garlic mashed potatoes. Staff quite friendly, too."}
