{"text":"The first time I went to this place I truly enjoyed it. The server was in his late 30's and very helpful (the best description I can give of him I don't know his name) I ordered the philly steak with half cheddar half mozz with the buttermilk dressing, and green peppers. It was made perfect. The second time I went there Saturday March 18/17 I ordered the same thing however the young server told me \"we don't do half and half-it's one or the other\" he was rude and impatient. Upon paying for my order, I was grossed out to observe his ear buds were right there in the open beside the cash reg, filthy with his ear wax all over them. I was grossed out, and disgusted. I opened my sandwich at home it was dry and hardly had any sauce on it. I don't like my food dripping in sauce but some sauce would have been good. Driest thing I have ever eaten. The sandwich had ONE green pepper on it.It was awful.  I know that if the owner of that store continues to have these terrible unsanitary servers working for him that place will go down quick time geez steak revolting!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. Had the cheese Steak with jalape√±o caramelized onions and mushrooms. Asked for the north heat sauce. Cook recommended adding buttermilk Dill sauce (no extra charge).   Cooked fresh in front of your eyes. It was superb. Boss threw in a complimentary mango juice."}
{"text":"I have tried this place three times now. I tried the 12 inch cheesesteak with mushrooms, jalapenos, green peppers and cheddar (and once I tried mozzarella). I got this with the buttermilk and BBQ sauce. It was well-cooked, made fresh right in front of you and tasted delicious! The staff is extremely friendly and will cater to your preferences.   Get an insider look at this new halal restaurant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zas3rP4gHQA.   Overall, it was great and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Tried this joint and had a 12 inch phillycheese steak with provolone, mushrooms, peppers and onions. To my surprise you get two 6 inch buns. The buns were nice and soft but i found the meat a bit dry and lacked the veggies. There wasn't much cheese in the sandwich which I was really hoping for.  To go along with the sandwich I had the curly fries. These were pretty good and well seasoned.  As for staff they we ok. After telling them it was my first time there they weren't very helpful."}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for something new on ubereats and my God it is amazing. I order it or go in once a week. I love Scarborough for its diverse selection of restaurants but sometimes I just want a good sandwich and I have found my new go-to.    It's a cool little restaurant hidden in a nondescript plaza. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, making suggestions when asked. I usually order steak, cooked medium with extra cheddar, caramelized onions, peppers and buttermilk dill sauce. The buttermilk dill sauce is so good. Not a strong dill flavour (just the right amount) and its nice creamy consistency compliments the cheesesteak perfectly. There's the option to get a single or a double and I recommend getting the double. It's literally two sandwiches so you can eat both or save one for later.  I've been singing their praise to everyone I know and I really hope this place sticks around. The only thing I don't like is when you pay for your meal by debit they skip right past the tip option before handing it over. I guess it's nice for people that feel uncomfortable and forced to leave a tip but I think they definitely deserve a tip and I'd like to give one."}
{"text":"Have been here twice before. Food is pretty good from what I recall so I decided to stop here on my way home from work.   Arrive around 11:12pm. Walk in and there is a group of four and a party of two. I stand by the menu where you order for about 12 minutes, they have one person behind the counter preparing food. At no point does he acknowledge me or anything. He eventually hands the group of four their food and they sit down.   I then make my way to where you pay hoping the worker will take my order. He starts preparing another order without so much as making eye contact with me.   After another 3 or 4 minutes I decide enough of this and walk out.   I won't return after this."}
{"text":"Delicious! Sauces are amazing and the Steak is nicely chopped and juicy!  They make Bread IN-HOUSE!!! Recently started this (4 days ago from this review) - it's awesome. they make it fresh everytime!  Pricing is great too!"}
{"text":"From their Instagram I expected a lot, when my cheesesteak came I was underwhelmed :( The cashier didn't speak English well (had to say my order a few times, didn't know what the word \"half\" meant) and it was very very smokey in a small space without proper ventilation. The cheesesteak wasn't very flavourful and the steak was over chopped, very tiny ground pieces. I could hardly taste the \"caramelized\" onions/green peppers/mushrooms. The bread was chewy and needed to be toasted more. The best thing about this place was how quick it was ready. I chose provolone cheese which was good, the Korean bbq sauce missed the mark. I actually wanted to get different sauces on each half but it was such a struggle to communicate with the cashier I gave up... I really wanted to like this place cause its Halal! I also saw some people ask for tap water and they said they didn't have any cups...   I will upload an accurate picture of how my cheesesteak came..."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese steak!! Steak is fresh and cooked to order, diced up with mushrooms, peppers and onions on the grill. The variety of sauces are unique, buttermilk horseradish, Korean BBQ, honey mustard, hot sauce, and more! all mix and matchable for different taste combinations. A side of onion rings and curly fries, and a pineapple Fanta, where else can you get this? Nowhere! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My friend had to convince me really hard to go over to this place instead of the usually shawarma joint around the same area. I'm glad I got to try something new but I didn't think this place was anything exceptional.   I ordered a 12\" cheesesteak with cheddar and all of the offered toppings along with dill and Thai sauce. I just felt that the sandwich was very sauce heavy and I couldn't taste much else, everything else just felt really damp and soggy. It wasn't bad but for the price point it's hard to justify to myself for eating here again, over any of the other amazing joints on the same street."}
{"text":"Very yummy! My friend bought me take-out one day...good thing is that it is still very tasty the day after! My friend did say that leaving it overnight does not do its justice but I will for sure go try at the store :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this place. I was looking for somewhere to eat last night around 10:30pm, of course almost everywhere was closed, so I decided to settle for subway. I noticed this place right beside subway and thought might as well try something new since they were still open.  The food here is to die for. I got a cheesesteak with grilled onions and honey mustard sauce, and tempura mozzarella sticks on the side. Both were really good. They don't cheap out on the amount of steak they put inside, that's for sure. They also make the food for you on the spot which is a bonus, it tastes fresh.   Pricing is decent. Environment is nice. Staff seem friendly. Not many cheesesteak restaurants in Scarborough, I found my new fav. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times I was served quickly and the food was great. The restaurant is clean, the cheesesteaks I've ordered have always been fresh with the right amount of toppings and sauce. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"2.5 Star   What not to like with Tuesday Specials? $8.99 for 2 (half) cheesesteak sandwich!  What not to like with Everyday Specials? 69 cents wings  It is decent especially at this price.   the -0.5 star is to the filthy washroom.  There was no hand soap and looks like it had not been cleaned for days.  I would just skip the washroom......."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this please out as I am a huge fan of Philly cheese steak. I've done the drive to Philly to get my hands on some authentic sandwiches.   This place is lacking. I asked for steak with onions and green pepper with Cheese Whiz, after about a 15 min wait my sandwich was ready for take out. I looked at the sandwich and barely saw the shrivelled up onions and green pepper. The bread was soft and toasted perfectly but the meat was dry and a bit salty. The meat had that texture of that processed donair meat you get off a spit and not the typical steak style meat I'm so used to having in my cheesesteak. I would not repeat, A lot of food options in the area that offer better quality. I think this place has the same owner as Big Moes as they had flyers sitting on the counter as part of a cross promotion I guess   I would also mention that I believe this place gave me food poisoning, I've been running back and forth to the washroom all night."}
{"text":"I think it is really hard to find cheesesteak in Toronto, there isn't many locations. I tried this cheesesteak joint and I loved it. They cook everything in front of you and you can keep an eye the whole time they make it. The flavours are really good, and they also have a really tasty mini dessert menu, ice cream sandwich with homemade cereal as the bun of the sandwich. I also ordered the curly fries, and it wasn't the same as the picture or the ones from Arby's curly fries. It is thinner and really different, so out of everything that is the only thing I did not like from my friends experience at this place.  Service: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Environment: 4/5  Overall: 3.5/5"}
