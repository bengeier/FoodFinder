{"text":"We love Benihanna but this location has let us down 3 times now. I am giving it 2 stars because our chef, \"Tim\" was the best and the food he cooked was wonderful. My concern and complaint is how this place is run and how slow it is to even get seated and start your meal. I had a 7:00 dinner reservation and arrived on time. At 7:25 I went back and checked what was going on and was told it would be another 10 minutes because they had a party of 18. We were finally seated at 7:35 with 6 other people who had 7:30 dinner reservations. We waited until almost 8:00 to get someone to take our order and offer us drinks. After that it took about 20-25 minutes for the soup and then the salad to come out. Once we received our forks, we were never to see our waitress again. (I wanted a glass of wine.) The chef came out and cooked us a delightful meal but it was after 9:00 when we were eating. Tim was the best! We waited for our ice cream order, I ordered glass of wine and the green tee that we were supposed to get. The check came and I still had not had my tee or wine so I told her to forget about it. The same thing happened last month and we had a 5:30 reservation with my grand-daughter. They must be short staffed, their hours cut, or they overbook but for the amount they charge, I can go a lot of other places."}
{"text":"Well the food was great but the experience was very unprofessional. Our waitress was working hard doing her thang when our fellow table diners decided to give her a hard time. After a discussion with the manager the other diners were able to figure things out. Well I felt that it was very unprofessional that the chef \"Kyle\" I believe was down talking his fellow coworkers to the guests at out table. To me this is very unprofessional especially since the girl was clearly having a bad time with this guest yet he decided to play on the blame game and  bad talk his fellow employee. Not nice won't be going back!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, SLOW service. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because, well, I'm too nice. I rarely, if ever, complain in restaurants, preferring to rant afterwards to my fellow diners. But I just couldn't let it go this time. The second star was earned because the manager acknowledged waiting over an hour to get our food was unacceptable and discounted a portion of the meal. It was a shame the experience sucked because my dad was looking forward to seeing his visiting grandchildren get a kick out of the teppanyaki chef."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. The show the Chef puts on is awesome. It's a little pricey to sit next to strangers. But it's a wonderful experience. To eat, and converse with great people sitting next to you at the hibachi table."}
{"text":"We had another great experience and really appreciated the entire team for making my daughter birthday dinner with her 10 friends a great evening! Great food!, Great Teamwork and Great Evening! Thanks"}
{"text":"Great dinner' the Resturant was clean the staff was very friendly ! The manager was so great with an amazing personality . He sang to some of the tables Disney songs for the kids . Just a great evening with good food and a lot of it."}
{"text":"This place is SO lame! I have been to Benihana in San Francisco and our chef put on a helluva show..so I was excited to find one in Scottsdale. Sadly, this experience was NOTHING like my previous visit. Our waiter never said please or thank you and obviously had something other than work on his mind as he slammed down bowls of soup and salad. Our chef \"Kevin\" came out and was suffering from a lack of enthusiasm and a VERY dirty chefs coat. He didn't put on a show, had no sense of humor and when he did it was forced and not funny.  The \"big\" shrimp were overcooked and the steak was flavorless. The one positive was that the chicken fried rice was delicious! But, overall I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed.  Wasn't worth it. You come for the show, the food is second and both sucked."}
{"text":"Great place! You can find me almost 7 days a week up in beni-hon-hon eating all the won ton! Extra Garlic butter I got Benihana Issues! A++"}
{"text":"This place has to be a front.   It's been in business forever but I don't know anyone that has every been.   And to have only 3 reviews on Yelp proves my point.   Vile, disgusting place."}
{"text":"Starting from the fact that we had to wait 20 twice to be seated, because they wouldn't open table for two of us, to the fact that when I'm paying more then a $100 for my meal I'm expecting to be walked to my table and seated not picked up on the way while walking a group of strangers over and letting us feud for \"good\" seats with others that came later then us. I also would expect my server to speak English. But maybe it's just me.   In addition soups came out cold, food was under salted and tasteless.   On the bright side chief had good sense of humor, but then I was not going to a comedy club.   I'd really suggest taking your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our server and chef were great...that is why I gave 3 stars.  The problem is with management.  The ventilation system at our table was not working properly which resulted in my husband and myself having all the steam, smoke, etc. blowing into our faces throughout the meal.  My husband took the brunt of it and multiple times had to get up from the table to escape the steam, and once had to go to the restroom to wash out his eyes.  Again, the chef and server were very apologetic and they informed their manager.  At the end of the meal the manager came over and offered us 2 coupons for \"free appetizer with entree purchase\" on OUR NEXT VISIT.  Not a penny was deducted from our dinner.  With 6 people in our dinner party our bill was close to $300.  We have always been fans of Benihana, and we all enjoyed our meals.  But I will definitely reconsider giving them my business in the future."}
