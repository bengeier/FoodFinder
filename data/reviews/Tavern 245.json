{"text":"Came here for our stop is Pittsburg on a whim. We needed something decent and quick so we could continue to travel as soon as possible. I ordered the Hawaiian Burger- which was delicious but the fries are even better. Good selection of beers and comfortable atmosphere WITH rooftop access. We ate at the bar, and while the locals were friendly and the bartender was knowledgeable, she was left to take care of too much on her own and was making open comments, clearly annoyed.   The bar was mostly empty, and if it weren't for the kindness of locals I might have been turned off by the bartender. Otherwise good food and worthwhile to stop by, especially if you need a good, quick meal."}
{"text":"Very cool urban dining room. Salads--particularly the Fiesta--are inventive and delicious. The tomato mushroom soup is fabulous and their burgers are great. The hummus and guacamole aren't up to the same standard.  And, I think msg or Accent is used in some foods because the last three times I've been there I had a similar, unpleasant reaction.  One other thing that has formed my opinion of this place: I left my scarf on the floor behind my chair on a recent visit. When I called for it 40 minutes later it was \"gone.\""}
{"text":"I was out for drinks and snacks with 6 women that I work with. Tavern 245 is close to the office, so it seemed like a nice spot to try. When the server took our drink order, one of my co-workers asked if they had any signature martinis. The server said he could make anything we wanted and lemon drop and orange blossom were popular flavors. This would have been a great opportunity to offer us the drink menu, but he did not. He also did not ask if we wanted anything to eat. I found someone in a chef jacket and asked if they served food. He gave us menus. I ordered a reuben with house-made potato chips. When my food came out, there were french fries, so I sent them back. It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to bring back my plate. The sandwich was soggy and the meat tough. Later I discovered a very interesting drink menu that we might have liked to order from. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for Tavern 245 in Pittsburgh and went to try it out for a late dinner. Upon walking in, the door swings open in a way to block the view of what I assume is the main restaurant upstairs. We went into a small lounge area in the downstairs. We asked the bartender to be sure they were still serving food and the bartender was hesitant and said the kitchen was closing in half an hour but if we wanted to order fast we could. He did not offer us menus and it was very awkward so we decided to just get a drink instead and we gave him our debit card to start a tab. While we were there he kicked out 2 of the other patrons in the lounge, why I am not sure, and then after they paid and left he looked at us and said \"I think they paid with a stolen card!\" I'm not sure why he thought that, perhaps he knew their names?, but he then went past us toward the door with a card in hand which looked similar to mine. This is notable because I have a blue Chase debit card and there are no Chase banks in Pennsylvania. I stopped him and said \"wait is that my card!?!\" And he looked at me suspiciously and asked for my ID. It was indeed the card I had just given him 5 minutes prior. He just said oh and went back behind the bar. He did not mention that he had actually just charged their tab to my card!!! We then paid and left because we were so uncomfortable. After looking at my account I had 2 charges from their business. I will never be revisiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Most get blackened taco salad!!!!  And I also had the most amazing drink I've ever tasted literally.   I believe it was called key west punch....   make sure you request it be made with extra lemon juice!!!!! just trust me on that...   it's to die for and the salad was too...   10 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wine was served in a dirty glass, one of the bartenders had a mouth like a sailor (f-bombs), listened to a server give a couple a hard time over whether or not they ordered fries or slaw. Overall a weird atmosphere...save your money!!"}
{"text":"Been looking for new lunch spots and hit the jackpot with T-245. Everything, food, service, and friendly people. Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Went for a 8:00pm dinner on Friday night, 2nd floor seating.   Great food, friendly atmosphere, wonderful people.  American chicken sandwich and bacon popper burger, with bleu cheese chips. All delicious, the chicken was delicious and fresh! The chips were a little salty but the bleu cheese and bacon dressing was perfect.   At the end, the lovely waitstaff provided boxes with the name of dinner and a DATE ORDERED! Really just a nice thing to do for the \"leftovers\" person.   I hope every person's experience is like mine."}
{"text":"I'm giving this five stars because the tavern has never disappointed.  The upstairs bar is a great spot, the bar itself is huge and always seems to have a seat during lunch or happy hours.    The food is good and reasonably priced.  I have had great burgers, steak sandwiches, and salads here.    The rooftop is a great place to have a drink and a bite.  Really happy to see this place open again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a night cap after wandering downtime and ice skating for a while and decided to check out the bar upstairs. Pretty sparse crowd on a Friday night and we were able to sit at the bar pretty easily.  Fairly small selection of beers, both draft and bottles. No cocktail menu in sight. And major impression from the bar itself? Man, was it dirty. Garbage on the floor, plastic lines that look like they hadn't been cleaned in ages, filthy floors, you name it.  Bartenders were fine, but this place really needs some TLC and a fresh coat of paint. We didn't order any food or even look at the menu so I can't speak to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Tavern 245 is a solid addition to downtown.  I went for happy hour on Friday night, I believe it was their first true Friday with a crowd.  It attracts a solid PPG office crowd and is perfectly suited for it. Although, I was a little confused how to get into the restaurant - went into the hobby shop next door, not it, went in their door, didn't think it was it...got all turned around.  A guy on the street grunted in my direction and helped me out.    There is a small bar downstairs, and restaurant and larger bar upstairs.  We headed upstairs with the crowd.  My memory could be hazy - but the downstairs is probably only large enough for one or two groups of people.  We had plenty of drinks, service was attentive to solid (when it got more crowded).    We had a selection of items off the small plates menu.  Others loved the guacamole.  I thought it was heavy handed with the lime and jalape√±o. The homemade chips were great.    The 4th Avenue tacos were great.    I had the Farm, a trio of sliders - pulled pork, fillet, and chicken.  These were by no means sliders - probably 2-3x the size of what you would find at any other restaurant.  (think maybe the size of Mcdonalds hamburger)  HUGE.    The fillet and chicken ones were great - but the real star was the pulled pork.  Their homemade barbecue sauce was the star of the night for me.  It's more of a mustard-tangy sauce.  This was the one I refused the share.  I found myself looking on the menu for other items that include the barbecue sauce.  The french fries were also good.  A friend expected a heavier dose of Parmesan on them...but I thought they were great.    Overall, I'll certainly be back  - definitely for lunch or dinner to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely not. My drink was weak as hell. Tastes like sour lime juice and ice. It's decor is great but whyyyyy is everything over-priced?"}
{"text":"My boyfriends been bugging me to go to Tavern 245 anytime we're wondering where to go.  I finally caved and did it.   The atmosphere is beautiful.  1st floor bar is small and intimate but very well decorated.  Second floor is more open and welcoming and great seating.  We took the first floor seating so we could chat with the bartender. The menu IS small, we both got hamburgers.   Boyfriend opinion: One of the best burgers I've ever had, pittsburgh rare done PERFECTLY.  Fries were a little too salty.  Cannot wait to go back and try the sliders. My opinion: I got a rather plain burger, because none of the ones they had appealed to me.  I thought the burger itself was really tasty and well done.  I got it cooked pretty well, the bartender/waiter said I should try it medium.  He was right, and I will do that next time.  Definately cannot wait to get those sliders in my belly they sound absolutely divine.  The service was a little slow (my burger was cooked well, so that explains a lot).  They make everything fresh, and to have fresh food that tastes good... I'll take a little longer service for that.   For being relatively new, they're doing very well for themselves.  They're a little hidden on the corner but I think once word gets out people will start going.  Seriously... the sliders sound incredible.  I cannot wait to eat them."}
{"text":"This was our last, late night stop. Your options are very limited as the night wears on. Most things near Market Square close around 11 pm. We walked from Butcher and The Rye to here in about 5 minutes.   This is a local type hang out. The cons are smoking is allowed inside. From my part of the country smoking is basically frowned upon EVERYWHERE!  With that being said the ventilation was decent and with no other option we stayed. Also a con, if you are a woman DO NOT go to the bathroom alone. They have a hallway access with the ladies room way down the hall. The bathroom and hallway can be accessed by someone from outside the building without coming into the bar. THAT IS NOT SAFE!   The beer and drink selection is limited for the area but not bad. Prices were very reasonable. We ordered food from a pizza spot a few doors down and brought it in, good option. The bar tender was ok, not very talkative but he did a good job.   If this bar was not open late it would be a two star. Adding in the fact it is one of the only options I give it an extra star. If you are looking for a cool place to hang out this may not be it. If you are looking for a place open late for a couple drinks, it works."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered is excellent. The chef is from the closed Palomino's and offers an excellent menu.  My favorite is their tomato basil soup, the farm slider and white Russian."}
{"text":"Barely ok place.  Great, intimate first floor bar.  I'm sure happy hour there is a blast.  Second floor restaurant is nice.  Menu selection for the location and atmosphere is rather disappointing.  Pretty much local safety food.  Nothing risky.  Reuben, quesadilla, sliders, etc...   I was expecting more as I didn't do my homework before I went.  I took my GF there for her birthday for lunch.  they added the moniker \"steel city\" to the quesadilla's.  not really any different than a traditional tex-mex quesadilla.  tortilla, cheese and sides of sour cream, salsa and guac.  not sure where \"steel city\" comes into play.  same with the \"pittsburgher\" hamburger.  just a burger.  maybe it was the addition of Heinz ketchup, but then wouldnt every burger, everywhere be a \"pittsburgher?\"    Though nice, the service staff weren't too bright when it came to guest respect and were somewhat \"baby huey-ish.\"  In an empty restaurant, we were sat in the corner, which was good but when the server took our order, he asked us if we wanted separate checks. ???  We did walk in holding hands and I did have my arm around her while the hostess was getting menus and the server watched us get seated at his table.  the katy perry song coming from the radio in the kitchen was alright though.  Then the next couple that came in, they were sat right next to us at the closest table... In an empty restaurant.    i ordered the reuben.  it was tasty and had all the ingredients but only a couple slices of reuben.  very thin sandwich.  chips that came with were pretty good.  Though I wasn't making out with the GF, it was her birthday in a semi-intimate setting and I was giving her a kiss and the server interrupted us and asked if everything was going ok.  like i said, baby huey.    i'm a price per portion type of person.  the cost of the food should match what youre getting.  small portions.  $9 for reuben.  fine for a bigger sandwich.  not for here.  Cheque was just the slip of paper face down on the table. No cheque book. Not even one when I paid with my card.  just a few pieces of paper and a pen thrown on the table.  my advice is if you want better food and more quantity for a few bucks less and service that is a little better, primantis is right around the corner."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in here to share celebratory drinks and food with coworkers due to, well, good news at work. I had admittedly been warned by a family member in advance that they hadn't been that impressed with the Tavern, but I figured it was only fair to give them a shot myself. So my group walked in on a quiet Thursday night, took a seat in the upper level of the place, and began looking for food options that could easily be split between multiple people.  Things started out a little slow and \"meh,\" but did at least manage to improve throughout the night. I say this because our initial wait for our first round of drinks was not a short one. It was quite slow, to the point that I started checking my phone to see how many minutes ticked by. But, once that first order of coconut and blackberry margaritas arrived, the impatience was quickly forgiven, because those are two delicious flavors and they make for super tasty happy hour beverages.  Since we were looking to share food amongst ourselves as much as possible, I ended up sampling a number of items from the menu. Feta truffle fries, ice cream sandwiches, and pita and hummus made up our little meal. Quite the healthy spread, I know. And honestly, for the most part the food was good. The ice cream sandwiches were tasty, and those truffle fries were fresh and simply to die for. Alas, the pita bread with hummus disappointed me, due to the pita being burned. Le sigh.  Mostly great food combined with kind of slow service - on a night when the place wasn't anywhere near full - has me remembering my night as \"a-ok\". While not my first choice, I would definitely consider returning for happy hour - especially to enjoy another order of yummy truffle fries. And to find out if the coconut margaritas are sticking around for a while!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Had one of there gourmet burgers, really spectacular. Ask for the burger with a fried egg...still dreaming of it right now."}
{"text":"Tavern 245 may have possibly saved mine and my good friend's life. After arriving late to Pittsburgh due to a flight delay, we asked a snotty cab driver to take us to a fast food drive through for something greasy, we had been traveling for about 13 hours and needed the sustenance he replied he didn't eat fast food.  So we wondered the streets of Pittsburgh at 12:30 at night, going door to door for food and finally made it to Tavern 245, where the coolest bartender gave us directions to get food, which we would not have found because the restaurant was on the second floor. After we ordered the food it was going to take 15 minutes so we ran back to have a beer while we waited, I went with an Ale and a Sam Adams October fest, I believe each were around $5. Then the bartender suggested we have the food delivered there so we did and had the best wings, pizza and beer ever.   Came back the next day for happy hour, same cool ass bartender  was there and he made us a gin and tonic that was so good, so strong, so large, and so cheap ($4) it deserves its own 5 star review."}
{"text":"Eat lunch here often food is always tasty the soups are great andconsidering the location reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I was walking through downtown and ran into this place! I was attracted to their roof sitting. Although i was able to sit outside, the view wasn't necessarily amazing. Unfortunately, there is a parking structure blocking a scenic view. Also, as I was walking up the stairs it smelled like old cigarettes. It was awful. Either way the service was great. I nice gal walked me up and served me a local beer. I would recommend this place to chill and hangout. Happy hour is from 5-7pm! My draft beer was $5."}
{"text":"I went Sept 6, and strangely there wasnt hardly a soul there. The downstairs bar is cute, upstairs dining was really nice. Allot of tables (empty ones) a very nice bar, elevated booth seating as well, would be GREAT to watch sports at this place. Burgers were delish! Had American burger with caramelized onions, feta french fries and buffalo chix dip. Great portions, fair pricing. I would def go back, but they need better advertising, no one was here, but arpund the corner in market square, u couldn't get a seat at the crappiest of places. I get its location...but come on, they are like 200 ft away from Market Square...and would be great for local regulars to hang...they need some marketing help...that and people in Pgh need to walk a minute or two."}
{"text":"I may not understand the rules of hockey, or why the outside of Oreo cookies even exist, but I know one thing - and that thing is salads.  I know the good, the bad and the wilted. And this place does a GOOD salad.    I had the Carribean and mumsie had the Mediterranean.  Hers was alive with plump kalamata olives and mine was, dare I say it, resplendent in a bevy of fresh pineapple, mango and mandarin oranges; accompanied by a mango mint dressing for which I'd likely sell my soul. In short - both were AWESOME.  Until today, I didn't even know Tavern 245 existed, but found the ambiance delightful and the prices reasonable. At $12 for each salad, a teensy bit on the pricier side for my usual lunch, but I'd go for it again in a heartbeat.  Tavern 245 also has flat-screens o'plenty, so bring the crew for a game or your date for a relaxing night out in your best jeans. Either way, Tavern will impress."}
{"text":"So the kitchen wasn't open late enough for me to have any food.  Major bummer and the bar tender looked like he was trying to hurry every one along so that he could close up shop.    I liked the decor of the place and the lay out.  When I went after 10pm the patrons all seemed to know each other and be of the service industry sect. I was amused to listen to their stories of shitty tippers.  I hope to try this place earlier in the day when I can actually have some grub."}
{"text":"Good bar food plus a few surprises on the menu. The specials always deserve consideration.   Good staff, very friendly.  Good music.  Younger crowd.  This is a fun place to stop in with friends.  This place can be loud but in a good way."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed until a group of friends met for a holiday dinner. Second floor is pretty big, and while nice and clean enough, was pretty generic.  First floor is smaller in a cozy way, and pretty nice, but with smoking permitted it's not somewhere I'd spend a lot of time."}
{"text":"Tavern 245 is one of our regular happy hour spots. Modern vibe to it but the chairs/sofas are still pretty comfortable. And as one expects in a Pgh bar, TV's so you can watch sports. Specials are good, the bartenders are friendly and while it gets busy for happy hour, it's not too crowded. It may feel a little hazardous getting down the stairs when you've had one too many but I haven't heard any reports of accidents so it's really not that bad;)  For lunch, I've only been once; got a burger which was pretty good. Prices are very decent for downtown. Make sure to get here a little early for lunch as the service is a little slow once they get busy (a sentiment also confirmed by coworkers who've gone more often). I certainly wouldn't mind coming back for lunch again."}
{"text":"It's okay but only went because that's where the other people I was with wanted to go.  The food is very average, nothing too special.  There are some things on the menu that you think might be good then you get them and are not impressed.  One cool thing about this place is that they have a rooftop deck now.  So if you are just going for drinks and it is a nice day out, that could be a good option."}
{"text":"If you don't care about service, this is your place.   I visited this place once about 6 months ago and twice recently and was underwhelmed all three times.    The first visit was pretty average and dragged the star rating up a half point.  Nothing bad, nothing great.  The second floor bar was pretty empty (a weekend at a weird mid-afternoon time), so we had a couple drinks and headed out for dinner.    Monday Happy Hour last week.  Pretty empty again except for our large group at the bar.  The service at the second floor bar was poor.  The server simply could not do more than one thing at a time and wasn't very good at even that.   We moved to the rooftop bar once the shade came through and most of our group had filtered out.  It wasn't much better up there.  The server was more interested in chatting and having a shot with us than she was at actually getting anything done.  She was nice and all, but not at all professional.    The funniest part of the evening was when she sat a table next to us.  While perusing the menu, they overheard her complaining about her boyfriend to us (a conversation which included some less than appropriate language).  By the time she got back around to them, they had gotten up and left.   She came back to us and surmised that they had left because they were too cheap to pay the menu prices.   ---Pretty sure that wasn't it---  Then a Friday Happy Hour later that week.  This used to be a go-to place for my friends, so they wanted to give it another shot.  Different bartenders, same poor bar service.  Again, the place was not crowded enough to warrant much of a delay, but still we had to flag her down and ask for every drink.  I think they are ready to give up on the place, and I can't say I'm sad about it..."}
{"text":"Were it not for the large vertical sign it might be easy to walk right past this hidden gem of a restaurant!  I decided to go there for lunch yesterday solely because it was close to my friends office building and it was cold outside.  I am so glad we did.  The dining room is upstairs and it's got a \"this was chic and modern in the 1990s\" vibe to it--but in a good way?  It's possible, just trust me.  Our server was nice and it helped that he was totally hot.  guy with the curly haired pony tail?  thanks for keeping lunch sexy!  I ordered the caprese burger which had mozzerella, basil, and a balsamic reduction on it.  It may just be the best burger I have ever had.  It was fantastic, well work the $10.  My friends each had the portobello burger and while one of them said their sandwich was great the other said he found his a bit greasy.  Still, we left happy, and we were not broke when we left either.  Business was brisk when we arrived but we didn't have to wait for a table.  I'm not sure how busy it gets during the dinner hour, but I will find out, because I will def be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for St. Paddy's Day, and we thought it was nicely-appointed decor-wise and that the bartenders were nice, but I thought the corned beef we had was disgusting and too fatty. \"Not much to write home about\" is what I'm thinking."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a while ago with some co-workers.  I thought the food was tasty and the service was prompt and professional.  I'd definitely like to check it out again.  It seems a bit small inside, but we didn't have any problems getting a seat."}
{"text":"Great place.  Been there many times for lunch and cocktails.  Rooftop terrace is really nice.  You have. To check out that awesome bartender Kia she is attentive remembers your name and quick to help take your order and serve.  Every bar should have a Kia!!'n"}
{"text":"Really good food and the price was reasonable, especially for downtown. Had the open-faced turkey, and it was great. Will definitely return. Update: Went back and it was not nearly as good. Plus the oven-faced turkey was off the menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in before a Pirates game to avoid the crowded bars closer to the stadium. Wow, did we pick a good spot for that. The downstairs had a few bar patrons by the time we left but the rooftop deck was all ours! One other table filled as we left. The rooftop has a full bar, attentive servers & large flat screen TV's. This would be a great spot to catch games this fall!   We started with sangria & spiked lemonade that could be infused with blueberry, cherry or raspberry. The red sangria had a rich orange flavor and it wasn't too sweet. The lemonade was too sweet for me but the bartender made an infused version with less simple syrup & it was much better. In fact, it was dangerous because I couldn't taste the liquor!   For an appetiter, our group ordered italian egg rolls. I can't eat gluten so these were out for me. They looked tasty! Italian meats & cheese rolled up and deep fried in a flour wrap, served with a creamy aioli dip.   Everybody at the table ordered a burger with fries and I got the salmon salad. The burgers were quite large! Toppings were plentiful & the portion of fries for each person could have fed half of our table. Prices for burgers & sandwiches ranged from $9-$15  My salmon salad was good but plain & left me wanting more. It included sliced almonds, port infused cranberries and goat cheese. I ordered it without cheese and asked if they had avocado (they don't :( *sniffle*) I like my salads with a plentiful amount of veggies...cucumbers, onion, tomatoes, carrot, etc. For $14, I expected more.   Our waitress was great! Very accomodating & attentive, our service was fast and efficient.   If you're looking for a low key spot to catch a game with decent food & good drinks, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was able to reserve a table for 12 people on a Friday night with little issues. Trying to set reservations from NYC for this many people is usually complicated and the staff was so accommodating! From the moment we walked in we were greeted and out table was waiting for us. The food was amazing! All of my students complimented on how wonderful their food was and asked to come back the next night! Thank you Tavern 245 for being so wonderful with fantastic food! We will not forget our experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a party.  Weather was super hot and humid that day but the A/C didn't seem like it was even on.  We all complained about being really hot so I know it wasn't just me!  Drinks were well overpriced even by Pittsburgh standards (4 draft beers for $28 before tip?!).    Food was decent when it was available since no one paid attention to the buffet. Well, except for the bar employee who tried to stop to take food until another party goer informed them that the food was not theirs. I was informed by another person that they saw a staff member take a piece of pizza and walk into the kitchen. Who is paying for that food?!  Servers were visibly aggravated that we were even there let alone ordered drinks. I got a lovely scowl when ordering a Moscow Mule. My friend was told to \"get the hell out of the way\" by a server she accidentally bumped into.   Final complaint in the list...watching a bartender marrying bottles right in front of everyone! I'm sure this was not the first time either since there's a few milk crates full of handle bottles. That's illegal..."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go have a drink after work on their rooftop patio. I had lunch there 2 weeks ago and got the ribeye sandwich, it was solid, but a little messy. I went back again and got some apps and those were solid, I would recommend this place for hour hour apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I went there for the first time about 2 weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday night.  Service was great, and very nice atmosphere.  There are couches to lounge on as well as tables to eat at.  We all ordered Burgers - which were amazing.  One of those places I can't wait to go back to.  I live about a block from this place and will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Ok, I will get this out of the way now: I was only here one time and that was for a celebratory party for my boyfriend (he quit his shitty job). All we did was get completely and utterly rocked.  Oh, and I should mention that I tried Classy Cab and it failed me just as hard as Yellow Cab. Boo, Pittsburgh taxis; boo!  We ordered round after round of mojitos. By the time I arrived someone had gotten a little sloppy making them and I tasted a whole lotta club soda. Why can't I find a good mojito in Pittsburgh!?!  I don't know how you really review a place that you were only there to get rocked at, but I'll give them this: the bartenders and waitresses were awesome. Our group got way bigger than initially planned (plan: 15-20; arrived: 30 or more), but they handled it like pros. I estimate that we spent at least $1,000, possibly much more. It was a good time, that's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Excellently flavored meat. Perfect buns. Delicious appetizers (fried chicken skins make my mouth water). If you're not into red meat, awesome chicken sandwiches. Soups, salads, and vegetarian options--not to mention a humble and attentive wait staff. Not the best bourbon list to pair, but they have some craft beers, house cocktails, and Yuengling, so no complaints.  If you're on the hunt for the best burgers in Pittsburgh, definitely add this to your list. It's in my top five."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to the 245. I've never done lunch here before but I've always had a good experience during happy hour.  With nine craft beers on tap, you could say that their beer selection is pretty good.  I was greeted within 2 minutes of sitting at the bar.  The bartender/waitress gave me a menu with a smile and ask what I'd like to drink. After learning that they didn't carry Raspberry Ice Tea she offered to make me a sweet tea from the unsweetened tea available. A refreshing change from what I'm used to... simply getting a serving of ice tea and handed a basket of packeted sugar.   I've been getting a lot of burgers lately so I decided to switch things up a bit and go with the Fried Chicken Sandwich. It took less than ten minutes for my sandwich to be placed in front of me and I could tell in an instant that I was in for an artery punishing treat. The chicken had a crispy coating and was topped with lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, bacon and a special sauce. All of this was stuffed in one super fresh bun. It was sinfully delicious! There was a pickle spear on the side and even the fries were better than average.   The total bill came to $14.45 plus tip. Yes, this might be pretty steep for a lunch sandwich with fries and an ice tea but it was sooooo good. I'm struggling with the rating here. Does the 245 Tavern really deserve 5 stars? It's good, real good, perhaps 4.5 star good; very friendly and fast service, delicious food, well stocked bar with a nice variety of beers, but for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, in my heart it falls slightly short of a five star rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to grab something to eat before a penguins game. The service is terrible. We ordered appetizers and food.. And the food was just slammed on the table. Our server was also a bartender who came back to table maybe once. We actually had to get up and go to the bar to ask for our check. The food was okay. Nothing to get excited about for the price. My vodka cranberry was also $8.50.. Which seems a little bit high for the area and tavern itself. I probably wouldn't return here. Although it did appear the manager or owner was trying to walk around and help with the service so that was a positive. Don't waste your time on this place unless the service improves."}
{"text":"Four stars for the burger here, three stars for everything else.  We came here on a weeknight and it was pretty dead, but given its location, I can imagine it being much more hoppin' during lunch hours.  The atmosphere was kind of weird -- it almost felt like a sports bar that was decorated slightly too elegantly to actually be a sports bar -- it's hard to tell what exactly they're going for here.  The music was also supremely uninspired and borderline annoying.  However, the real reason my boyfriend and I came here was for the burgers.  This restaurant's burgers are ranked #2 across all of Pittsburgh's offerings by pitts-burgers.com, beating out Meat & Potatoes' burger (which is the #1 favorite so far for both of us) by a narrow margin.  So, of course, we had to put it to the test!  And it's true... their burgers do not disappoint!  The meat is fresh and delicious--not too dry but not too greasy--and perfectly cooked to order.  But we didn't think they were better than Meat & Potatoes' burgers and it wasn't obvious that they were the second best in the city, either.  That said, if you're a burger enthusiast, don't skip Tavern 245.  They make easily one of the top ten tastiest burgers in the city!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst waitstaff that I have ever encountered. They mixed up food, drinks, weren't charging for checks, and when we actually could get a check, it was messed up.   The one bartender (who seemed heavily inebriated) actually came up to different members of the party and said, \"This drink is on me, tip us well and we will treat you well.\"  Free drinks aside, that is one of the most unprofessional behaviors that I have ever seen in any restaurant establishment."}
{"text":"Went a few week ago for the first time. I thought it was going to be a one floor bar with some tables, but it had a whole upstairs dining room/bar/lounge. Food was great and very good price. I will be trying them for happy hour very soon."}
{"text":"Tavern 245 is one of those kinds of places that has seemingly been around for 6 decades even if it has likely changed hands numerous times in just 1.   Regardless of how long Tavern 245 has been in business, their gourmet takes on pub munchies and sandwiches are worth hanging around Downtown Pittsburgh after hours for. 3 recent trips to this overlooked bar and grill have me convinced that a \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" segment is past due.   An impromptu meetup at Tavern 245 with friends on Light Up Night prior to a concert began a busy evening and yielded some innovative eats offered on a special menu for the yearly local tradition. Gruyere, onion straws, horseradish aioli, and a Brioche bun filled out the Braised Beef Sandwich, a savory, pungent, crispy, milky, nutty tour de force packed with succulent, salty, shredded proteins cooked slowly and for many hours. The precious fries that came with them were oily, fragile staffs of julienned spud properly baptized twice in bubbling peanut oil. Strewn across the plate like an ashtray full of used cigarettes along with packets of Heinz 57, I destroyed the tubers in a few handfuls.   A quick look at the burgers Tavern 245's regular menu lists had Kay and I returning weeks later, the bizarre Strictly Business leaving me too intrigued to merely move on with my life.  What blend is used to comprise the patty is somewhat of a mystery (I tasted chuck and sirloin), but when I requested mine be cooked medium-rare, the rosy, wet, well-seasoned bullseye was hit. However, what made this burger unique was the addition of fried chicken skins, in addition to gruyere, bacon, fried egg, and what was supposed to be a feta truffle aioli. The crunchy texture of the chicharrones would be what truly defined the burger, giving it a Southern flair while the gruyere brought it upmarket and the bacon/egg tandem had it stumbling happily into a diner at 3 on a Sunday morn. My only quibble was with that aioli. It wasn't until I was halfway finished with the burger that I realized it was missing. When I came by again a fortnight later and ordered it once more, the aioli was present but lacked feta/truffle flavors. Was I being snookered? Hey, if it's too pricey to make (truffles don't come easy), I would have settled for the marvelous basil aioli that came with the ingenious Italian Egg Rolls (hell, I shoulda just asked for an extra thimble of it). Featuring layers of garlic-smeared salami, pepperoni, mortadella, and provolone wrapped in flaky dough, the artfully cut appetizer surrounded a tasteful nest of greens. A regular customer at the bar laughed knowingly as I nodded in approval with my first herbed mayo-coated bite of this deconstructed, deep-fried grinder in miniature. \"He knows what's up,\" the man said as he pointed to me and slapped the counter. \"I get them all the time,\" he declared. \"So good. Mmph.\"   Somewhere in the midst of all the turmoil, a dish of phenomenal cole slaw had and it was as perfectly toothsome as such a deli salad could be. Soggy without sacrificing crispness, the slaw carried with it a zesty sweetness that had me a little sad that I was eating it indoors on such a grey day and not at a sunny picnic with barbeque and hot dogs.   Tavern 245's interiors could probably use an interior designer's consultation, but therein lies its lure.  People come here to unwind, to sling their coats over their chairs, to sip on a beer, to socialize. Do you care if your best bud's apartment isn't spotless, that his coffee table has some dings in it, that there's a crack in his ceiling's plaster, that his living room floor has a few scuffs? Nah. You're too comfortable (and perhaps buzzed) to give a darn, especially when he's a ninja in la cocina. So don't be jive, and live a little while you're alive. Swing by the 2-4-5.   P.S. The service each time was without fault."}
{"text":"I just hit up Tavern 245 for the first time, and I'm now a fan. As an added benefit, it's not even all that expensive.   First off, the beer list is great. With an 8-tap primary, they don't have much room for fooling around, and they don't seem to waste any time on bad beer. From Furthermore (Knot Stock) to East End Brewing (Big Hop IPA), they fill the space well and don't seem to lend an inch to uninteresting macro-brews. The bottle list follows a similar trend with about 20 additional options. If you really do want a macro-brew, it looks like they allow that in the downstairs bar--or in a bottle.  The menu follows familiar sections but offers some exciting options. True to tavern form, they offer up some exciting appetizers but some good dinner options as well. I tried a side salad along side dinner and was quite impressed. The staff was even more than willing to switch in a few vegetarian options: my veggie tacos were notably delicious (and mysteriously missing from the menu!).  I'll post some photos and more extensive comments on FoodBurgh in the next few days, but I'll start by saying right here, that they're definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I recently received a promotion and a group of coworkers took me here last Friday for celebratory drinks and dinner. This was actually my second time here (I had honestly forgotten about it because I do not spend much time downtown outside of working hours) but it's a decent spot that I plan to start visiting more often.  There are bars on all three floors. The first floor is small and looked trendy (for lack of a better word), but I have never spent any time there. The second floor is larger and contains the bulk of the restaurant's seating. We spent our time on the third floor, which is a rooftop deck with another bar and a decent amount of seating.  Drinks seemed to be reasonably priced. I stuck to beer on Friday so I can't speak for the mixed drinks. For dinner I had the fried chicken salad, which was delicious! A very generous portion of tasty chicken overtop of a heaping salad. I would definitely get it again. My coworkers tried a few other dishes including the quesadillas, which also looked (and apparently were) delicious.  I definitely recommend Tavern 245 as a nice, casual spot for post-workday dinner and drinks on the rooftop!"}
{"text":"I like Tavern 245 as a happy hour spot.  I don't love it, though.  They have a good draft list though, and they are downtown, so points for that.  I would rather go here than Olive or Twist / Nine on Nine, and other \"swanky\" spots because at least Tavern 245 doesn't feel pretentious.    Drafts are $2 off from 4-8pm.  They also do food \"specials\" for happy hour, though I don't know that they are all that special.  Their guac was way too sour, and their wings are small pieces for $1 each.    It's a nice spot with a good vibe, and I would encourage you to at least stop by to check it out.  While I don't think you will be blow away, I also doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place I've been to in downtown so far. Staff are on top of things and value their customers. Pretty good beer selection. Food's not bad either. Good portions."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Since I work downtown it's a nice spot to meet friends after work. The staff is friendly and drink prices are average. Decent food menu. Nice rooftop deck for summer months."}
{"text":"This place literally just snuck up on me!  I was taking shoes to be repaired across the street and I looked up and noticed a huge sign for Tavern 245.  How have I missed this for an entire year or so!?   I walked in and was immediately impressed.  From the outside it's completely unassuming because it's just a tiny door into this really sleek looking lounge downstairs.  Then you walk upstairs and it's a cute little bar restaurant.  But what made me feel immediately comfortable was the friendly staff (in Pittsburgh Steelers gear, of course).    The menu offerings were cheap cheap cheap for a downtown setting like this.  $5-12 for all lunch offerings.  I chose the Fiesta salad since I knew I would be eating bad later (we'll discuss in a later review!).  My dining partners chose the pierogies, which were incredible by the way, and the grilled cheese.  My salad was overpowered by the strong taste of onions.  I'm not sure if it was too many in the actual salad or the dressing, but it kinda killed the taste of everything else.  A little food jealousy....a little disappointment.   But I absolutely want to visit again for a happy hour!  I think the place is just super adorable and a great setting for some drinks to be had from the extensive looking drink menu!"}
{"text":"A regular on my lunch routine.  My work crew and I all order the same - yes the same :), It's that good.  We get the caprese chicken.  Two thinly sliced grilled pieces of chicken places placed on ciabatta bread which is slather with red bell pepper pesto.  They top this with thick cut tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and a huge piece of basil drizzled with balsamic.  It's to die for.  As a side I normally get the shoestring fries that are topped with a light dusting of Parmesan.  I just love it!!  I've had a few other things there that have been good.  The only issue I have with this place is lack of consistency.  I've gone a few times where the food was off, or the fries were different, or they had run out of ciabatta and used bread that made the sandwich soggy - ie gross.  I've heard their happy hour is good, so hopefully I'll get to try it out soon."}
