{"text":"I have tried the take out only here, never eaten in the actual place. We had the Green Curry Chicken, Spicy Noodles with Pork, Mango Salad and Cold Spring Rolls.  Everything was awesome except for the Pad Thai which I would swear on my deceased dog's ashes was just ketchup & noodles.  Seriously.  Takeout portions are on the small-ish side, so I would recommend at least 4 or 5 dishes for 4 people. This won't leave you with any leftovers but you won't be disgustingly full either. Just right."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been going to Simply Thai for over a decade; WAY before the renos.  This place is bomb.  I highly recommend the house pad thai,  mango salad and the fried OR fresh shrimp rolls.  It doesn't matter if you eat in or get delivery, this place doesn't dissapoint. You may want to ask for chopsticks when ordering delivery."}
{"text":"I really like it here.  It's a wee bit dark inside though. The staff is very attentive and make sure that you are enjoying your meal.  The Pad See Ew (sp?) is my go-to dish and it is delicious.  Take-out is easy too.  Just walk in and place your order. Yay!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off night, but the food I got for take out was really awful.  I had the pumpkin soup which was tasteless and basically reminded me of canned pumpkin.  It was very bland and had no flavour what so ever.  I also ordered the Pad Thai and the shrimp were rubbery, the tofu was dried out and the chicken was barely there.  They put two medium sized shrimp on top to make it look good, but inside the dish were the tiny shrimp and not very many of them.  My bill came to $19 which was way too much for that meal.  Even at a lower price I would never eat there again.  I've eaten at Green Mango and at least their food is full of flavour and fresh.  Also I went there on a Thursday night at around 6:30 and the place was completely deserted.  No wonder."}
{"text":"Delicious. It's great, straight-ahead Thai food. Good-sized portions. The lunch special is a really good deal. The service is quick, friendly, and efficient. I've liked everything I've eaten here. 

The pumpkin soup is to die for. Seriously. It comes with the lunch special and *wow*, it hits the spot on a cold day, especially if you're nursing a cold and want to be revived.

I've never noticed that the interior was dark. I just came away with the impression that it was a peaceful, quiet, tucked-away spot. One that happens to have yummy, yummy food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for over 10-15 years. The ownership has changed as has the decor, but the food quality has remained. Fair heads-up: I've never ordered food to go, always had sit-down meals. 

Over the years I've been coming here, I've brought family and friends, and everyone has always walked away satisfied. 

The place use-to have a much more friendly staff, the current waiters are still friendly, but definitely not what it use to be 5 years ago. 

The sweet and sour tofu is great, as is the yellow curry. Make sure to come for lunch, the specials are superb and you get a soup + spring roll. Most of the choices available can be made vegetarian. I've never been a fan of pad thai (in any Thai place), and no surprise, don't love it here either. 

Definitely a great place to have Thai, that has food on par with (if not better than) may of the other standard Toronto Thai places."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food with a comprehensive takeout menu can be found here. I always mean to try new dishes each time, but since I always end up getting the delicious pad thai as one of my courses, I haven't sampled as much as I would like.

The dining area is a bit dark, since there isn't really a front window (the building used to house the Buduchnist Credit Union before they moved to their current location on the other side of Bloor). So don't feel like you're missing out on ambiance if you get food to go here."}
{"text":"First time ordering - we opted for delivery. While they quoted 45m-1h I was pleasantly surprised to have our order within about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the food didn't provide much satisfaction. Pad Thai was 'dry' lacking sauce so noodles tasted plain and were difficult to pull apart. The shrimp was however cooked well. The chicken satay and beef pad ped also lacked flavor. Hoping this was just an off night for them, however won't be in a hurry to try again."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious in the heart of Bloor West Village.  It's family owned and managed, so the service is decent.  The menu is what you would expect from any North American Thai restaurant.  What makes this place special is that it's consistently good at a decent price.  I've been there with a small party and I've also booked the entire restaurant for a family party and the food was equally tasty.

I would not drive all the way to Bloor West Village just to eat at Simply Thai.  But, it would definitely be on my top 3 choices if I was already in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant. The prices are a teensy bit high if you're thinking of doing takeout (cheaper takeout options around the neighborhood), but dining in is my favorite option with this place anyway. The staff are always fast, sweet and courteous. Dressed in the prettiest Thai outfits, I always feel very well taken care of. It's one of the few restaurants that I'm happy to dine alone in.

My favorite mango chicken in the city, the potato curry is to die for and the appetizer sticky rice with peanut sauce tastes like pure, delicious cake.

Every now and then they'll give you free fried bananas, which always makes my day. Mm, I could go for that now!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh my frickin God- BEST Pad Thai and Green Curry I've ever had. I order way too many dishes way to often because I just can't get enough. Their spring rolls are also on fleek. Apparently their Pad See Ew is amazing too but I can't bring myself to try it because I'm too in love with the other 2. I'm starting to sound like Fat Albert. Order here and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Simply yuck.  This was probably one of the worst Thai food meals I've ever had outside of a food court.  There were few classic Thai spices in the food, little to no taste, very very scant on veggies, and enough grease to make you gag.  Even the pad thai was completely disappointing - one shrimp, grease galore, no cilantro. And, it's expensive.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"We were walking by and decided to go in. 
I have to say I really liked the decor and the ambiance of the place. It was clean, the server was very friendly and prompt service.
Got the pad thai, spring rolls and golden chicken curry. Everything was very tasty and we were stuffed after. 
I think the prices were pretty on par with other Thai places I've been too.
Good job! We will be back! Mmmm!"}
{"text":"this is not a bad Thai restaurant, but i disagree that it's a good bang for your bucks .... it's conveniently located in the heart of BWV and the owner has put some effort in creating a bit of an ambiance but the food is pretty mainstream Thai food which you can find much cheaper on the west end of BWV"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious and the servers are very polite and sweet. I love that they were such a pretty uniform. I've been here 3 or 4 times and taken out once. I came once with a very large group for lunch and they managed us all very well. I've had the Pad Thai, Vegetable Curry and another dish. All were very good. The soup is EXCELLENT as well! YUM!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant in the Bloor West/High Park area. The decor is very nice and we went in at around 5 pm and were the only ones there. I had the Vegetarian Basil Fried Rice and my friend had the spicy Thai noodles with chicken. Both the dishes were really delicious and had just the right amount of flavour and spice."}
{"text":"We order from Simply Thai about 3 x a year. 

The food is always fresh and delicious. 

The restaurant staff is friendly and the pick orders are quick. 

Never disappointed."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

Tom yum soup was salty and my main meal was not flavourful enough..

Waitress was not attentive and not friendly at all ...
Also she was watching her vietnam or philipino video on the phone so loudly.

Loud sound interrupted my meal. 

I could not enjoy classic music of the restaurant.

They need to be improved about waitressing.

Anyways It think I would not go back this one."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Simply Thai Cuisine in Bloor West Village on August 30, 2014. I have to say it's a beautiful restaurant with really nice decor, but the service is not very good. The women who seated us had no smile on her face what so ever. Then when the food came I had to ask for salt and pepper. Going to other restaurants there is always salt and pepper on the table(that really bothers me). As well she never came over to ask us  how our meal was. The restaurant was not crowded there was my sister and I and 4 other people. The food on the other hand was great, but the service was terrible. This women is working with the public she should be very welcoming.. My sister and I will not go back to Simply Thai Cuisine.

J.K."}
{"text":"Glad I discovered this place in my neighbourhood!! Super friendly service, food came quick and was very tasty, loved the lemongrass soup and the spring roll - they have a lunch menu that includes main dish + roll + soup, everything at a good price."}
{"text":"They're so friendly and delightful here, and the fare for lunch specials is good quality, a cut above. The surroundings are dim, but adequate. There is a modest semi-formality to the atmosphere.

You are best to bring a book or a friend and keep your focus inwards or on your friend, as the usual High Park lunch crowd of teachers, idle retirees, and various underemployed 32-year-old crybabies and navel-gazers tend to gab about their phantom problems. This just makes me more efficient. I eat, and run.

I don't have particular favorites though I usually go for something like Peanut Chicken at lunch.

The hidden secret is that dinner is amazing. We won't go out to eat here, the atmosphere isn't worth the trip. But as for the takeout menu: it outdoes most if not all Thai food I've eaten. If you like Thai consider ordering dinner."}
{"text":"It's not going to be old world Thai food.  If that's your expectation, stay clear. 

The food is a little bland, which I suspect is to make it a little more accessible to the widest audience.  

Atmosphere and decor is above average than most other Thai restaurants in Toronto.  Service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Everything I got was very spicy although there was no indication in the menu that those dishes were spicy. I tried my boyfriend's dishes they were not bad. So I'm not satisfied with this place and despite us being the only people in the whole restaurant the service was slow."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch a summer weekend as the only customers. The food was just passable even though we were hungry, had craving for thai food, and ready to find anything delicious.

The curry was too thick (to the point of almost pasty). Vegetables in the curry were in big chunks and not as varied as better Thai restos. Portion was adequate though I was disappointed with the ratio of protein vs veggies. It doesn't break the bank but certainly was a forgettable meal. We left full yet slightly unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time before the renovation and it was my favourite thai place. 

I came here recently and a lot has changed. Thankfully, their lunch menu remains the same. Most items are $10.95 and include a spring roll and soup (choice of pumpkin, hot and sour, and lemon grass vegetable). 

I got the Thai spicy noodle with pumpkin soup. The pumpkin soup is so yummy and creamy, with just the right amount of coconut flavour and spices. The Thai spicy noodle was good, but not as good as I remember. Passable amount of chicken and vegetables, but I felt that the noodles didn't absorb the flavour of the sauce. The sauce itself was good, though. 

The fiancé got lemon grass and vegetable soup with the cashew chicken. The soup was delicious with the perfect amount of spice and tartness you would expect from lemon grass. At first, my fiancé thought the cashew chicken dish smelled a bit funny, but he got into the dish right away and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

All in all, this is a place we would come back to if we were in the west end."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Simply Thai for years, I don't know if it's a new owner, new manager or new chef, or all three, but this place has gone way downhill in the last year. The customer service is awful. Last night, my wife placed the same order she has for years. Pad Thai Mild. This apparently now means put 0 sauce on the Pad Thai in their new parlance.  This is the 2nd time this has happened this year, we had decided to give them another shot. When my wife called to complain, the person on the phone harangued her about how she had ordered. No apology, no offer to fix it. We ended up returning it for our money back. Needless to say, we will not be ordering from Simply Thai anymore, and we would encourage you not to as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We stumbled upon this place after a long day of walking and were looking for pretty much the closest place that had food. I am glad we found this gem.

First of all the decor is super cool and modern. I love the communal table in the middle of restaurant; so trendy looking, even if I didn't actually eat there.

The food itself is delicious and more reasonably priced than I thought it would be based on the way the restaurant presents itself and the quality of the food. I had a season pumpkin curry soup which was so fitting and then a red curry dish with coconut rice. I even had to eat every last grain of rice, which I'm not usually crazy about, because it was so delicious.

I will certainly be back here as I'm excited to try other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was walking along Bloor West with my mom after successfully tiring the kid out at High Park and we wanted to stop somewhere to eat. Since my mom is usually picky AND cheap (killer combo I know) We decided to go into Simply Thai to take advantage of their lunch specials. 

My mom got the pad thai lunch special (yawn) which  came with spring roll and pumpkin soup while I had the chicken salad (double yawn - stupid low carb diet). 

While admittedly her lunch special was pretty affordably priced with all the fixin's, my salad was a big letdown. Now I know you don't go to a Thai resto and order a salad but I was expecting a little finer fare than iceberg lettuce ends, 4 chunks of chicken and a few slivers of carrot for $8. It wasn't even fitting for a side salad. If you're gonna make me pay $8 I pretty much expect there to be so much salad on my plate that I'll be enticed to hide bits of it underneath my sleeping toddler while my mom isn't looking. She IS my mom you know - she still tries to get me to eat my veggies."}
{"text":"Fresh and clean are the 2 words that best describe the Thai food here. Service was great because it was a rainy day and we were the only 2 customers inside haha. It's a smaller place, prolly fits about 20 tables of 2's and 4's and there's a large table all the way in the back for the larger parties. The decor looks simple but pretty, nothing is really rough on the eyes.

There's tons of options especially for vegetarians like myself. I'm a bit too boring and tend to always order pad Thai when it comes to Thai restaurants because I can get noodles anywhere and I'm half Persian so no one can beat the middle eastern rice for me.

The food was good, bit more expensive then other Thai places if I remember correctly but my friend and were satisfied. I got the veggie pad Thai and my friend got the beef teriyaki with jasmine rice. It wasn't the most flavorful but it tasted healthy. You can tell they use fresh ingredients so I rather have it be fresh then covered up in spices, soy sauce and herbs. Each main dish is roughly about $10-15 ish. 

I feel terrible for saying this but I rather get Thai Express from the mall food court. It tastes better, you get a larger portion and it's roughly the same price, if not a bit cheaper if you don't make it a combo with soda and a spring roll LOL"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on a weekday, and was wowed by the gorgeous interior. It's very modern with the geometric lamps and chairs, but every table had fresh flowers. Definitely has the feel of a date place.

That being said, the food was pretty good. I was here with 2 friends, and 2 of us ordered the lunch special, which is an entree with a soup and spring rolls. I ordered the green curry with lemongrass veggie soup, and a friend ordered Thai spicy noodles with lemongrass soup. The food didn't wow me, but it was solid Thai food, and the prices for the lunch special were extremely reasonable. My third friend simply ordered green tea ice cream, and said it was good."}
{"text":"Not been for dinner, but the lunch is GREAT.
Excellent value, and very good food. 
I found the quality to be much better (and less greasy) than Green Mango"}
{"text":"Simply not thai & simply overrated 

Tom yup soup-completely watered down and tasteless. It was a bunch of veggies in slightly sweet water and thats it. Not authenticity, no taste just water. 

Pad thai-it tasted like a ketchup sauce mix with some noodles. Super bad. 

The owner was going on about how this restaurant has been featured on foodnetwork... They really need to concentrate more on the quality of the food. 

A complete waste of a trip. If youre looking for a thai restaurant go further downtown its worth the drive and even traffic."}
{"text":"Really blah food . Worst Tom Yum ever . Waste of money watery no flavor and scant veggies . The only reason I gave 2 stars was fresh rolls quite tasty. Sadly both hubby and I racing for bathroom this morning with serous tummy issues...not sure it was from there but that's the only place he and ate in common yesterday"}
{"text":"Generally concur with Kai's review.  Fairly standard Thai offerings, well prepared and very tasty.  No especially amazing standouts that I remember after several visits, but everything was fresh and good.  Pleasant storefront atmosphere.  You can find Thai places a bit north in The Junction that are a bit cheaper, but if you happen to be hungry for Thai and in the Bloor West area this will satisfy you nicely."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. They had a selection of affordable lunch specials that came with a spring roll and soup. I had the cashew chicken with a lemongrass vegetable soup, and both were fine but a little too sweet. Not a lot of vegetarian options. 

Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"Walked in and was able to get a table.  Very small,  clean and cozy restaurant.  Ordered the Tom Yum Soup, Basil Chicken, Basil Beef, Pad Thai. I really enjoyed the Tom Yum soup...all the other dishes were ok. Service was great."}
{"text":"The best I've ever had. My fiancé is a corporate chef that has worked for very high end restaurants and he agrees- Our fav!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really disappointed in the food and service here. I
 My delivery order was incorrect, I did not receive an entree that I ordered, and instead got a much less expensive soup. (There was plain evidence of the mistake, as I  through JustEat, so the order was there, clear for them to read).

When I called to report the mistake, and asked them to bring the entree, they asked me to GIVE THE SOUP back in exchange for my order. 

Which is disturbing for so many reasons, but, I agreed to make the trade for the entree.

Anyway,when they brought the entree, the delivery man said never mind, keep the soup. 

 Aside from that weirdness, the food was less than mediocre in comparison to almost all other local Thai restaurants. The vegetables were far from fresh, brownish even, and everything tasted watered down and bland, and tasted of MSG.  The flavors and dishes were far from authentic. 

I'll stick with Silk Thai restaurant in the Junction now on, (consistently delicious and never had a bad experience) or any other place except Simply Thai from now on!"}
{"text":"In my search for good thai in the West end, I happened upon here for lunch. The lunch special was only $9.50 so I thought I'd try it out. I wish I hadn't. The spring roll was terrible - very chalky. The soup broth was decent but the frozen vegetables floating in it were quite disgusting. I chose the green curry, it was passable, but not memorable. The highlight of the meal was its speed - 15 minutes round trip from chalky spring roll to green curry."}
{"text":"The food was great, and very reasonably priced. I absolutely love the interior design/decor. Gives the place a very \"fancy\" vibe. Service was a little slow (probably just due to being understaffed), but the server was cheerful and kind nonetheless. Some of their menu items' portions were smaller than what was expected, but the quality was great which makes up for it. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"The lunch special is a great value: 
$10 for a main dish, soup of the day and a spring roll.
- The curry pumpkin soup was AMAZING and I highly recommend it. 
- The green curry was ok... not the worst or the best I've ever had.

Our waitress was super nice but the service  was very slow: 
Our drinks didn't arrive until our main course did and it took 20 minutes to get the bill.

If someone really wanted thai food and I was in the area, I would go again but otherwise it was kind of lacklustre."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant.  It offers consistenly good service and tasty dishes.  You get the best bang for your buck at lunch."}
{"text":"I signed up to Yelp specifically to review Simply Thai because nobody should have to pay for the substandard food this place now subjects its customers to. I have given them chance after chance to get it right because I live in this hood and want to support local businesses, but they don't deserve support if they aren't going to make any effort to provide good food. The spring rolls are GROSS. They are clearly frozen and then thawed, then battered and fried - they are chewy - it's all wrong. The \"fresh\" rolls have rehydrated dried shrimp which are brown and yuck. This despite me asking repeatedly if the shrimp were cooked fresh and being told yes. The curry sauce - green and panang had split and were flavourless somehow. The beef in the salad was rubbery and seemed like left overs. The salad was so disgusting nobody could eat it. The chicken satay was rubbery skewers of old chicken and the sauce was so sweet it was inedible. And this, our last best try at supporting this place, cost us $200. DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is good and it's such an inviting little place. I tried the spicy Thai noodle today and really liked it! The lunch menu is great! I wouldn't hesitate to go back here AGAIN!"}
