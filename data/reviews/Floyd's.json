{"text":"Just left that nasty MF and it was my first time I will NEVER go back !!! My sister warned me when I walked in that it was nasty .the customer service OMG she had a attitude like the customers were bothering her they rushed you to ordered I ordered the chicken dinner dark with Mac and cheese and yams the Mac and cheese was runny the yams taste like they were made with coolade and they gave me some dry ass white meat should of went to Nana's they have excellent customer service there patient and the food is off the meter"}
{"text":"This isn't a the most spic-span place in the world, but should have more reviews. Chicken (baked or fried) are among the best you'll find at a soul food spot. Takes credit cards, to-go orders are probably your best bet!"}
{"text":"Went with my mother in law. She recommended it. I got baked chicken, with greens and green beans. My daughter got a flounder kids meal with Mac and cheese and green beans. The staff was friendly and very helpful in helping decide on our food choices. Overall the in building experience was great. We had our food to go. When we got home the food was decent. My green beans were a bit salty, the chicken was good and the greens were delicious. My daughter is 3 so asking her about food would be useless. I would assume it was OK because she ate most of it.

We also got desert that was very good. I would recommend the lemon pound cake."}
{"text":"Decent soulfood spot has the basic things that you're looking for.  I had the catfish dinner with macaroni and cheese and collard greens which was OK."}
{"text":"The lines was long and very slow. Your not greeted at all when you walk in. Employee were drinking and eating while handling the cook product for the customers. Wasn't very impressed with my food. I had the Mac n Cheese.  Which was room temp. My meatloaf looked like the dog food I give my cocker spaniel. Was very red looking on the inside. My collard greens were ok. I must say I did eat those.  The lady ahead of me asked for a cup for water the cashier charged her 1.85 for tap water. That was crazy to me....only reason they got two stars is because the sweet tea was really good....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the Nations ford location. The food was mediocre at best. I had fried chicken, which was oily. Well seasoned but tasted like oil. My sides were Mac and cheese and candied yams. The yams were the best thing in my plate, nice and sweet. The Mac and cheese wasn't that great, the noodles were too big for my liking and the consistency was loose. The cornbread was okay also, nothing to write home about. Not sure if or when I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is what soul food taste like. Of all of the the places in CLT that serve \"soul food\" Floyds take the title. The fried chicken taste like grandma made it. The greens auntie made them. So good. If you want good great above average soul food, Floyds is your pick."}
{"text":"Sorry had higher expectations...The wings were horrible. Tasted like they were fried in the same oil as the fish! My wife said the yams tasted like they were straight out of the can and overly sweet. We ordered fish and it took over 30 minutes to prepare. I can go on and on...Keep driving!!!  Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Hello friends,

This is the 4th location and they are going to do well here on the edge of Nations Ford RD and I-77. In the old New England Seafood building.

I really just came in to check the place out. A friend of mine ordered i think baked chicken and two sides, and they were good. I will have to go back to get some fried fish.

In the inside nothing has changed from the old to the new. People had to park in the gas station parking lot because the parking lot was like an ant hill (busy). 

Glad they are here, its one of the few locally owned franchises that had been around maybe close to 15 years or so.
 Go try it out!!!

{"text":"stopped in for dinner HUGE mistake. The beef ribs were mostly fat and the sauce was straight out the bottle.  The cheese in the mac and cheese which swimming in oil had coddled.  the cabbage tasted old.  Two dinners with drink was $30.00.  NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"That food was the best food that I've had in Charlotte. I had fried fish, mac&cheese, and collards with cornbread. The food was so good that it altered my state of mind. This is my new business meeting spot. I'm sure to shop again at least twice a week.

{"text":"Skip it!  Craving good soul food, we were directed to Floyd's.  Should have gone elsewhere.  The line was long and slow and the staff couldn't have been more miserable or uncaring.

Asked for cole slaw, \"we're out\".  Fried squash \"nope\".  Mashed?  \"OUT\".  \"We have this.\", as she points to the mush in the cage.  Got the fried dark chicken, juicy but mildly flavored and thin coating of batter.  The beef ribs were hit and miss.  One was good, two were tough and they were swimming in Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.

The sides were bad to okay.  Collard greens were very soupy and wet, but decent.  The dressing was mushy with a kick of heat at the end.  The Mac and cheese was overcooked and a pile of gloppy glue with no cheese flavor.  The best were the yams which were sweet with that nice orange flavor.

The place is a dive inside with barely running and freezing water in the bathroom.  Such a disappointment."}
