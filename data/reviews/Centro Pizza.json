{"text":"50 cent wings are goos haven't tried pizza but heard it's good.  Delivery takes long but prices are good so makes up for the wait.  Don't recommend walking in but for delivery it hits spot."}
{"text":"Moved down the street from this place and wanted to try out.  I called to order chicken wings which are stated on their website to be 50 cents each.  Lady on the phone told me it's 60 cent and website isn't updated and can't honor pricing... such a fail first impression"}
{"text":"I'm giving Centro 1 star based on a few factors - 1 being that I couldn't actually try the food which is in addition to the customer service being non-existent. Also, I would give it a zero but it seems Yelp won't allow it.   To explain, I found a coupon book in my mailbox this evening with one that included a deal for Centro.   By the way, there was no special deal, as the website listed the same prices.   Knowing nothing about this place, I turned to Yelp for some customer reviews as I normally do. The reviews were not awesome but they also were all based on experiences actually visiting the restaurant (slow service, that sort of thing). Given we were looking for delivery, I thought we should give this place a shot and order delivery. Bad idea.  As soon as I called, the person who answered responded \"where do you live, we only deliver to Scarborough.\" Ok, fair enough (if the customer is seeking out a delivery option).   I assumed that delivery would be fine, considering it's not that far and mostly because THEY delivered the flyer to my home (one could only assume if they delivered the flyer here, they would deliver to this area since they mentioned their delivery service).   I explained that and she sounded annoyed. I apologized and she just hung up the phone.   Bottom line, the worst customer service and as a comment to the people in charge of marketing this restaurant....make sure your flyers are actually delivered to the area you intend on delivering to.  Why tell me about delivery it you don't actually deliver to this area? Maybe the food is great but I will never know, nor will I visit based on my experience (also, the in-person reviews don't help)   based on the fact that I couldn't actually try the food which is in addition to the customer service being non-existent.

{"text":"I pass by this place a few times a week on my way to one of my clients, and I kee seeing the sign .50 wings, $5 Medium Pizza,so today I went with a buddy to check it out. It`s a little hole in the wall type of place. Nothing special. A counter to order. a few tables,and maybe 3 TV`s, but hey, I went for the food. The wings are a decent size for the price. They were hot (temperature wise) I tried the Sweet Chile Thai. 12 wings and a 710 ml Coke was $8 Tax included. If your looking for cheep and tasty wings give them a try.  I for sure will be going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give it one star. Don't bother ordering anything 1) well done 2) flat-wings 3) sauce on the side 4) dipping sauce. Oh and by the way - they WILL forget your pizza after repeating it back to you. Get the dumb girl on the phone to repeat it 5 times minimum and if you only get it repeated once she will swear by the grace of god she repeated it back \"3 times\". Super ghetto and unprofessional, 1hr+ delivery time for cold food and a missing pizza. P.S., they ALSO CHARGE for sauce on the side...... BEWARE don't waste time and money - pizza pizza ALL THE WAY."}
{"text":"CRAP food is CRAP Service is CRAP This whole place is CRAP My dog turned his nose up at this CRAP. Wings tasted like old leather chicken pizza was the worst I ever had and I have had some real CRAP but this was the worst."}
{"text":"This place has good wings but I will never order from them again. I placed an order last Friday night for 40 wings at approximately 8 pm. I was given a 1 hour wait time which was fine.  I called back after an hour and a half inquiring about my order. They said the delivery guy came and no one answered however I received no call. Finally the delivery guy showed up at 12am, 3 HOURS LATER! The wings were cold and when asked if there would be a discount. I was told $5 was the most they could do. I told them they could keep the wings -_____-  This place is ridiculous and their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"customer service is important to me & if it's important to you as well, then I recommend that you DO NOT order from this place. However, if you are looking for cheap food, this is probably the best place to order from. Their wings are probably what they're most famous for. I personally love their wings. Their pizza & dipping sauces, on the other hand, are completely trash. If you consider ordering from this place & you're super hungry, then I do not recommend ordering from this place AT ALL. Delivery takes over an hour & Pickup isn't a option I would like to provide for anyone because the atmosphere is surrounded by drunk & loud people. It personally makes me feel uncomfortable. Delivery is truly best option to avoid all of those mishaps.   In the case of customer service, it's literally \"you get what you pay for\". If they mess up your order, they don't do much to compensate for it. So just make sure to always check your order before you pay for it.   * Their cheese and pepperoni pizza cost $6 * Their wings cost 60cent each  * Delivery charge is $2.75 They also have family deals & website specials. If you do order from them, make an online account & use the discount code \"CENTRO6\" while checking out. It saves you 6% on your order. It might not be much, but it's still something lol."}
{"text":"Beer and shots for only 2.50!!!!! Now where else can you get a deal like that????  I suggest the Sweet Chili Thai wings, they always put a little more than needed amount of sauce on the wings which is a good thing.  Pizzas are thin which is good and they taste more like of a realistic pizza than Pizza Pizza makes.  Reason why I left out one star is because it gets over crowded at nights with no places to sit and eat, dominoes being slammed on the table very loudly, and I remember seeing a bug/cockroach crawling behind the NDP Jack Layton sign on the ground at the front of the bar.  But overall, if you can get past all of that, this is a great place to spend weekend nights at by yourself or friends.  Seriously, where else can you find 2.50 for beer/shots?"}
{"text":"We waited almost 2 hours for our pizza and wings. We even called to see where the food was, and they knew what our address was without us telling them anything other than asking where our food was. Half an hour after we called, the food finally showed up. We asked for some sort of discount or half off for such a ridiculous wait time. The driver called his manager, and the only offer presented was $3 off. We personally called the manager and he stuck with that \"discount\". Wait time was blamed on a busy night, yet they knew what order they had kept waiting without us having to give them any information other than we were waiting for awhile.  Pizza Pizza is 40 minutes or it's free! This was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would advise those not to order anything but wings from here. Friends have told me the pizza taste like cardboard. The wings on the other hand are good .50 cents per wing. The do delivery too with a minimum purchase of $10. In highs have this was definitely the wind joint to order from. Though I've heard now a days they have a lot of bugs. Eww, definitely not somewhere I'd want to order from though I haven't seen it with my own eyes. I'd recommend checking the interior out before ordering. Also I know this place offer liquor and has a  jukebox."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant one star because I have called for delivery and I have not received my order. Couldn't even call them back because the restaurant at the time was already closed. This isn't the first time this happened where I did not receive my order. If I had known my order wasn't going to arrive, I would have called pizza pizza because I'm sitting here STILL waiting for my damn pizza when I've ordered it almost an hour an 20 min ago. I understand they say that it would arrive in an hour but I've been waiting for far more than that and I'm sure Im not even going to receive it. AGAIN."}
