{"text":"Meilleur resto de pizza-poutine-patates frites à St-Hyacinthe selon moi. Je prends toujours la poutine - que j'adore surtout pour le fromage de grande qualité, mais l'autre jour j'ai décidé d'essayer leur pizza margherita. Quelle agréable découverte, j'ai même oublié pendant un instant que mangeais du junk food... Les tranches de tomates fraîches avec le basilic, tels que dans la tradition italienne, me faisaient plutôt penser à la pizza d'un vrai restaurant italien! Je recommende donc vivement ce resto pour quiconque recherche du comfort food de qualité!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best curd cheese I've had. I discovered this fromagerie at the St-Hyacinthe annual expo and had to buy more. We ended up ordering a huge bag and the following week paid a visit to the factory which is open to the public and has its own restaurant and dairy bar.

Cheese is made fresh every day, they're open seven days a week along with their restaurant which serves classic Quebec staples like poutine, sandwiches, and pizzas. Their pizza features stuffed crust and instead of mozzarella, they use, you guessed it: curd cheese. 
I found it delicious but a little odd in texture, curd cheese isn't as stretchy as mozzarella and tends to be wet and sweat when heated. I believe this is what caused our crust to be a little soggy, it was also an extremely thin crust. Despite unusual texture, it was still delicious and worth a try if you're ever on the south shore.

If you're just in the market for cheese though, you can get a kilo for 16$ no tax, or 2kilos for 27$, which is a great deal. They also offer a seasoned bbq or herb and garlic flavor.

Family friendly, family owned business producing a quality product- the unmistakeable taste and texture of their squeaky cheese is sure to please."}
