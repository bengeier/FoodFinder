{"text":"Uh, where to start.  This place was heavy on the disappointment and light on any redeeming qualities. I ordered takeout here via Justeat.ca which is always convenient, delivery was prompt and without hassle. From here on little else was positive, the first turd in the punch bowel was almost literal ; A big long black hair wrapped around my Gf's shrimp Pho fixins and beneath that was a second . The spring rolls were chewy and unpalatable. The vermicelli was undercooked and lacking fresh vegetables.    I placed a call to the establishment voicing my concerns and was met with a flat refusal to either refund my money or remake the food and offered kind of a half hearted 'Next time you get 2 for 1 \"...... methinks not."}
{"text":"Great food and always quick! Tidy place and very friendly. I would recommend to all! Ph√≥ lovers"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for 3 years. They've had a change of ownership and management, yet the food and service have stayed great. The food is always fresh and the people who work there are always friendly. It's a great local, close to home spot!!!"}
{"text":"Zero Stars. Dishonest company. They're on skip the dishes under a different name. I ordered a chicken curry and was sent a curry soup with hunks of pork fat and bones, I ordered a beef sate soup and was sent raw meat bleeding on rice noodles. I ordered 2 diet cokes that were completely forgotten. I understand mistakes happen, but when asked to resolve the issue they said the right order was sent INCLUDING THE DRINKS!!!! I paid for drinks they never sent. THEY blatantly lied. AVOID AVOID!! Food isn't good, food safety isn't followed and they are very dishonest."}
{"text":"Ordered through the JustEat app. Food was as described and on time. If you use the app, keep in mind you can't add a tip for the driver, or at least I couldn't. When I called the restaurant to clarify, the person spoke English well and was very polite.  I had the salad rolls which were good as was the dipping sauce. However, the Pho was the star! Had the tripe, tendon, brisket pho and it was really good. Hard to have good takeout pho, but this came with all the basil, lime, spices and sprouts and lots of tendon.  Also ordered the lemongrass shrimp on rice noodle, as you have to have a minimum of $25.00, but haven't tried it yet. Looks good. It will be tomorrow's lunch.  I would order from here again."}
{"text":"We came across this place by coincident and decided to just go in. The lady who served our food was really nice. The pho and spring roll were really good and the prices we fairly cheap. Their subs are also really good!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Chicken fried rice \"with fresh vegetables \" is garbage, filled with frozen peas and carrots. Asked for no dairy in bubble tea due to an allergy...a milkshake arrived. Salad rolls are ok. Very disappointed.  Will not order from here again."}
