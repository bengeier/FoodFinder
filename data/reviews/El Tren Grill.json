{"text":"This place is sooooo good! The service has always been very good and the food is always on point!  The guac station they have going on is where its at! Everything is always fresh and the servers are always friendly.  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican restaurant. The service is very good as well the the food. The table side guacamole is wonderful. We come here frequently fort he  lunch fajita special and were never disappointed!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Much better with new owners- portions & quality back to normal. Try the stuffed jalapeño app it's delish."}
{"text":"We were riding our bikes on the Freedom Trail and stopped here for a drink, not even knowing it was a Mexican restaurant. (side note to the owner, put a sign facing the bike trail too and you will definitely draw in business that way) They have a nice outdoor seating area and we decided to go ahead and get food along with our cold beers . We were very impressed! The tableside guacamole is seriously the best guac we've ever had and we eat a lot of the stuff, including making our own at home. It's a huge portion (2 entire avocados), made right at your table. We are vegetarians and we were very pleased to see that they had a variety of creative veggie options. The potato chimichanga was incredible. It's huge and stuffed with mashed potatoes and spices. Scrumptious! The service was friendly and fast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot especially the tableside guacomole!! It is amazing!  Love the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Friendly staff and excellent food. Everything that we've tried here has been delicious. Even the chips and salsa are above par. I especially like the fajita burrito."}
{"text":"Place was recommended by friends, so we stopped in for lunch recently.  My wife had the Mini Macho Burrito (chicken), i had Chile Verde.  When the dishes hit the table, i thought the waitress had mis-heard when we said 'lunch'.  No, those actually WERE the lunch-size plates.   Wife was quite pleased with her choice, and i was way pleased with mine.  The verde sauce was one of the best i've had, and the meat was so tender, it would crumble if you looked at it hard.  Table salsa was chunky & spicy without being overpowering, and the ?cole-slaw dip was a nice contrast.   The menu is large enough that it'll take me a while to work my way thru it.  Minor complaint: no lengua on the menu, no big deal.  Service was helpful, fast & friendly.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often and order the fajitas and they are delicious! The presentation also is  colorful and appetizing. Service has always been fast and attentive"}
{"text":"I've eaten here when it was a Mexican restaurant but under a different name. That place has since moved to Canton and El Tren has taken over. To be honest, there is very little difference. The inside looks the same. Food is still just as good. Prices about what they were before. Even the plates are the same. The only actual difference I could see is the glassware: they carry the El Tren name but include advertisements for other local businesses. Is this a coming trend? I don't know but was amused at the prospect.  The salsa was not thick, but watery and chunky. Had a nice flavor. Not hot, but tasty. They still do the table-side guacamole. They'll even customize it to your liking (want more garlic in it? Just ask. Need more heat? Tell them.)  I had the three-enchilada dinner ($9.95), choosing one cheese, one pork and one ground beef. The ground beef was good. The cheese/onion acceptable. But the pork was some of the most tender pork I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant. Others at the table offered similar comments about their meals. No complaints from any of the six of us.  The place was not at all busy, surprising for how good the food is. Probably because there were no drink specials on Sunday. So if you want a nice leisurely meal and would like to sit around and talk after your meal, Sunday would be the day to do it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people rate this place so highly. We have been here twice and both times the food and service have not been good. I had the shrimp fajitas one night and they came out half cooked and watery. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended El Tren and I was impressed! The patio is gorgeous and the food is so fresh and tasty! My boyfriend and I split the chorizo cheese dip and steak fajita quesadilla and were quite satisfied! The portions are huge so come hungry and take a doggy bag home if you don't finish!!"}
{"text":"The best Margaritas since I lived in my home of San Antonio. The Jumbo Gold Margi. is the way to go and that with the combo Fajitas and you are doing alright! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The guac is the best guac I've ever had. I personally feel the menu is priced a little high for what it is. If I'm eating mexican food I don't want it to be fancy and expensive. The food is good, but you're going to be shocked when you get your bill. Very clean, and nice service, but a little to pricey for me. Lots of seating and a nice place to eat if you have a large party of people."}
{"text":"The management has changed over the years, but they finally got it right. Always great service and great authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing special. I get a headache from all the table side guacamole. ( continually banging and loud chopping, and clanging, I think they do this so people will notice and order it ). It's a stupid idea in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Love the food, great atmosphere and excellent service by Nicole. I would recommend coming here for taco Tuesday and margaritas"}
{"text":"This is one of my main choices for Mexican cuisine. There food is not  crazy good , but good enough that u want to come back. There bar is very friendly environment to have a couple beers with your pals when the group wants some good tacos."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it in. Sat inside because it was a cool evening, but their outdoor patio looked nice.   We ordered the table guac everyone raved about, and I can definitely see why. Though it was pricy at almost $9, it was made with two avacados and tons of fresh onion and tomato. The waitress who made it didn't seem particularly enthused, not that we wanted a show. But we couldn't hear her when she spoke because she was taking so quiet so we didn't really get the opportunity to add any personal touches to our guac.  Still, we devoured nearly all of it.   We both got burritos and they were humongous, made for great lunch leftovers the following day. Everything tasted hot and fresh. Margaritas were also good, both blended and poured. We also liked how the food didn't come out within 3 minutes like many Mexican restaurants. We had more time to chat and just relax before our meals came, which is half the reason you go out to eat in the first place! I think it's safe to say we'll be returning."}
{"text":"The chipotle chicken burrito I ordered was not very good. Chips and salsa really good! Table side guacamole was very good as well."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and in the mood for some Mexican food, this place is a good choice. The menu offers everything from Burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, and seafood. The servings are generous and the service is prompt!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican spot! Good margaritas and flavorful food! Is it just me or do many Mexican restaurants have the same bland taste? Not this place!   They serve both a regular red salsa and a creamy slaw like salsa with their chips, both were tasty. Never had anything like it before. The house hot sauce is more of a mild green sauce, but tastes of fresh lime, cilantro and jalapeño made it a great compliment to everything on the table.  The Taquitos Rancheros came with shredded beef, it had good flavor to it but was admittedly dry. The ground beef burrito was juicy and well seasoned.  A great place to satisfy that Mexicraving with a little added flare."}
{"text":"1st time here which we found it on Yelp. I had the burrito and a seafood burrito. The refried beans were awesome. Home made not from a can. You know the hard work put into the food prep. I'll definitely will return."}
{"text":"Waited in lobby for 15 minutes for a table for four.  Peeked into dining room and there were 6 or 7 clean empty tables.  I had to find the hostess in the bar to ask why we couldn't be seated. She said they were short servers so they couldnt seat us now. So you leave your customers standing in the lobby  to slow things down?"}
{"text":"I don't know... it just wasn't that great. Everyone tells me they prefer here over El Terreza in Cascades shopping center, but from my experience I would not agree.   The chips were a bit stale, the salsa was bland, the table-side guac was pretty good. I got the seafood enchiladas, and again they were okay. I absolutely love the Seafood enchiladas and burrito at El Terreza, so this did not hold a flame. The service, on the other hand, was much better, but that's about it for me!"}
{"text":"The most fantastic,  authentic  food  you will ever taste!  The salsa is fresh and the waiters staff is spot on. The Arroz con Pollo is out of this world! We travel 25 minutes to get here when we want great food...this place is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Service is spot on, right as we sat down about 1 minute later we had our drinks and tables side guacamole. Amazing everything is so fresh. The frozen margaritas are amazing and don't taste like all mixer. Lots of tequila yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here as I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Our church group wanted to try it. Service was good, we had our own private room which was nice. They didn't have much in the way of customers in the other room which sort of tells you something. I had the quesadilla for lunch with shredded beef. When it came there was rice, salad, and beans also on the plate. The quesadilla was ok, instead of shredded beef it had ground beef (hamburg) that tasted like sloppy Joe. Not bad but strange. Will we be back? With our group maybe, alone no."}
{"text":"Nice service, friendly atmosphere, but food is that dime/dozen Mexican food that you get in the Midwest. No more - no less. Table-side guac was fine, but almost too big of a portion. At least the salsa had a minor kick to it. Wish this place would upgrade and get creative with their menu."}
{"text":"EVER get a STOMACHACHE after eating here?? I worked for this company for about 7 weeks and was HORRIFIED to find out they didn't have working hot water. I had always wondered why the silverware was ice cold and we would have to soak it in hot water from the coffee system. The food is good but when it's on a dirty plate and you're eating with dirty silverware that's no good! Also be careful about ordering pitchers Alex a.k.a. Alejandro  likes to put cleaning supplies in them and use them as a bucket... I witnessed that and had to go to my manager. They are also being investigated by the Department of labor for how they have ripped off the employees mostly the American ones. They play favoritism towards them Mexican employees and that's horrible!! Like the coleslaw all it is is cabbage, tomatoes, pico de gallo ranch and mayonnaise and cilantro... and it's made in a bus tub, and without hot water who knows how clean that could be!! I couldn't make this up if I tried!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite go-to Mexican restaurant! There are a few good ones around the area but this one has a bit more \"class\". It's just nicer; the atmosphere, service, bar area, etc. The food here is outstanding as well!! I have yet to order something I haven't devoured. Most times I can't finish it all due to the portion sizes! My wife and I gave it a try a few months back and now we're regulars. Excellent food, great service, and fair prices! What more do you want?!?!  Oh! And check-in with Yelp for 10% off your food!"}
{"text":"I seriously love the mixed fajitas and rice so very good and the service is top notch Would recommend to all"}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant. The table side guacamole is wonderful!  The foot is always hot and well prepared. The prices are reasonable as well. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Was very good!  Great service and flavorful dishes.  Had chimichangas and enchiladas. Mole sauce was lovely."}
{"text":"Been going here a while, I have never found something that wasn't excellent. Tableside guac is amazing as well. The new fish tacos are AWESOME"}
{"text":"Comfy booths. Spanish music. Very stereotypical.   Bland salsa. Pepsi drinks.   Unusually long wait for our meals. That never happens at most Mexican restaurants.   Entrees are hot and tasty. Large portions.   Not outstanding and not terrible. An average place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few times now even back when it was Nuevo Acapulco. It is located right off of the Tallmadge Circle and has its own paved parking lot.  There is a nice outside seating area for the warmer months. Inside has a modern decor which lends well to their modern Mexican/American menu. You will get the complimentary chips and salsa as per usual. The salsa is very fresh and has a good taste. I tried the Enchiladas Mole once but wasn't very impressed with it. That was the only thing here I have had that I wasn't a fan of. The burritos are pretty good and hefty. The Queso Blanco is very tasty if you are into that but the true star is the table side guacamole station. For about $7 you get fresh guacamole made right at your table. Depending on who you get they will either interact with you or just do their thing and be gone. It is expected that you will tip them and you should because the make some truly incredible guacamole here! You get a lot of guac out of this. It is totally worth it every time. Unless you are allergic or hate guacamole, there is no excuse to not order this.  The service is quick and friendly. I've never had a bad experience in this regard.  I do feel like the prices are a little inflated because of the modern twist they are putting on the menu items to be trendy. This isn't just your standard Mexican fare. I'm not sure how I feel about the added flavor just yet and would probably only give them 3 stars if not for the guacamole.  I'll need to try a few more menu items to be convinced.  Sometimes you just want good old Mexican food without all the fancy modern recipes."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had! I moved out of the area and haven't found another spot as good as this place. I miss this restaurant and when ever I am in the area I try and stop. It is that good! Table side guacamole is a must and the the queso fundido is also amazing! A friend of mine has eaten through most of the menu and hasn't found a thing he hasn't liked. Food is so fresh!"}
{"text":"Love it! Get the Guacamole appetizer. Marrylyn was a wonderful server. I also enjoyed the Pollo con Jalapeño and the flan!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good prompt service all around.  This place seemed so much nicer than other Mexican restaurants in the area.   Very clean too.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is has the best Mexican food I have ever had!!  The patio is so cute. The drinks are awesome and their specials are great!!!"}
{"text":"I asked for a Hacienda Burrito with a little more than what usually comes in the dish. The waitress walked me through my options and suggested another dish that was almost exactly what I was looking for and saved me an up charge. The food was excellent.  I'd suggest trying the frozen sangrita. It is a desert all itself.         The bathroom looked well taken care of and had wonderful smelling pine cones on the sink.   Great restaurant."}
{"text":"I had to be in the Tallmadge area today. I have heard great things about El Tren from friends. Stopped in today for lunch and they were right. I had the chicken fajitas where the salad and it was absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and very attentive. The restaurant itself has a pleasant atmosphere. The whole restaurant was very clean.  I will make sure I stop here again when I'm in the area for lunch or dinner. Next time you're in the Talmage area give El Tren a chance you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"El Tren is a cool little spot on the Summit County Hike and Bike trail. They have some of the old railroad cars out back, which is a nice touch.  The patio is great - spacious with an outdoor bar (though I have never seen it open)  The table side guacamole is really cool. They peel the avacados, mix the garlic, etc etc right at the table for fresh guac.  Good frozen margaritas!!  The food is basic traditional Mexican that you can find at many similar types of restaurants all over the US. Not much changes from place to place. But El Tren does the food well....just nothing unique.  The three stars are due to service. Both times that I have been there, the service has been unapologetically slow. This last time we sat outside for 10 minutes before we even got a drink order. The chips and salsa would never have come. Had we not reminded her.   If you are looking for Mexican in the Tallmadge area and you have plenty of time, the food is well done and the margaritas excellent."}
