{"text":"The previous reviewer is absolutely right.  This restaurant is not the cleanest, nor the most decorative of Chinese options in the Scarborough area.  However, to be perfectly fair to the establishment, and as a long time Scarborough foodie, I can honestly say:  it's cleanliness is somewhere in the 'average for Scarborough (think old school Scarborough) Chinese restaurants.  Let me tell you right now:  do not eat here if you care more about the ambiance, or decor, or the pretense of hygienic practices of the staff than you do about the authenticity and flavour of the cuisine.  For the adventurers and the purists, please do read on.  

This is what I refer to as a hardcore China joint.  If you care about the authenticity of flavours (as authentic as you can get in Toronto, anyway);  you want to feel like you've been transported to China as you eat your meal (the ambiance that matters); you don't mind having to pay in cash; and you understand it's spelled 'Sichuan' and not 'Szechuan'; then this restaurant makes no apologies, stands proud and tall and invites you for your very own Anthony Bourdain-esque culinary journey to China (in Scarborough)!  Yay!!!

To set expectations accurately, let me declare now that this is not high level Chinese cuisine.  You will know this as soon as you walk in and see the modest size of the dining space.  It is rare to see non-Chinese here, and if so, they are usually with a Chinese person who knows the cuisine.  So what's so good about this place, then?  Well, in all my travels to Asia and abroad, I learned one thing very clearly when it comes to food.  Sometimes, the best damn food you can eat comes from the not so comfortable, not so eloquent food joints - like the vendors on the streets who sell noodles, etc.  This is what I call the 'people's food'.  The type of food that brings memories of comfort and warmth.  The type of food you can eat without being evaluated on how you hold your chopsticks or where you discard the fish bones.  The type of food you and your university friends used to go to b/c it was - not only affordable - but so damn delicious.  

Perhaps this is why so many mainland Chinese immigrants are eating here.  It reminds them of the flavours of China.  You will rarely hear English spoken here.  But, do not be dismayed, I do not speak a lick of Chinese and the staff are always able to understand and service me with zero issues.  If they don't understand, they will bring along another wait staff who does.  No worries on communication at all.  I take it as a good thing when Chinese immigrants choose to eat here with their families and friends.  I, myself, was introduced to this place many years ago by a girl from Shanghai.

Sichuan cuisine is spicy.  It's delicious.  And...did I mention spicy?
The classic fish cooked in hot chili oil hotpot is always a favourite of mine.  The pork or beef equivalent to this dish is also delicious.  There is also a cold noodle dish with chili oil that is spectacular.

You don't come to a restaurant like this in the middle of northern Scarborough b/c you want to see nice decor or be dazzled by the accommodating hospitality of the wait staff - having said that, I must admit, the wait staff are quite efficient and amicable, in their uniquely Chinese way.  By \"uniquely\" Chinese, I mean they try to serve you quickly and efficiently without being so interactive that it borders on \"invasive\" (ex. how is everything going?  Can I take that away for you?  You want more water?)  If you need something, raise your hand and someone will come over and get you your water, your extra napkin, your sugary mainland Chinese plum juice in a can...you get the idea.

So, if you like your food authentic, you smile at the fun of trying to communicate with new immigrants and you enjoy tasting beyond the visual, this is absolutely the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Good delivery Sichuan food. Not too spicy. They add $0.5 to each food I ordered and they told me it is because they use special food containers which are better and more expensive than other restaurant. Cash only for delivery. Good for late night or dinner. 
Suggest: 106 sliced beef and OX tongue , 308 spicy twice-cooked pork, 309 pork with onion, 211 spicy deep fried chicken. And my friend said their hot pot fish or beef is also very good. I will try them next time."}

{"text":"I guess Hot Party Restaurant has opening hours like a diva bar.. oh even later than all the watering holes in seedy Scarborough area... Yes you have a HOT Spicy Party here till 5 AM! But seriously, I really wonder how many people can handle all these spicy food that late/early at night/morning! 

For a newly opened restaurant, Hot Party is quite dirty... tables are sticky and those huge up to the ceiling windows looked all gooey and oily... You have to understand the kind of food they serves are like loaded with chili peppers.. with a ratio of one to one... every dishes here are orange and red.. hot and colourful! A lot of the dishes also served as a hot pot! 

Sister restaurant of New Greatime (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/new-greatime-corp-toronto) the menu is identical! Colourful and with photos of ever single dishes... so even if you cannot speak Mandarin, as long as you can point, you get what's you want! 

Don Don Noodles ($5.99) 
- I totally forgot my previous experience at New Greatime so I ended up ordering the same thing... 
- Damn!! It was so spicy! I was sweating..dripping in sweat when I was eating it! My lips just turned red and numb! 

I don't think I will make a special trip to come eat at Hot Party.. as I don't really want to torture my friend with this extreme spicy food. But I would keep Hot Party as my choice of late night eat after a really hot party somewhere!

Cash Only!"}
