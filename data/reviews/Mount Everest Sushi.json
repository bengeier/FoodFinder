{"text":"I'm from the DMV area but I currently reside in downtown Pittsburgh. The DMV area is very widely populated with asians, and so with that being said, many people come from around the east coast to try our sushi. I've gone all the way from the east coast to west coast including japan itself and have tried all sorts of sushi (sushi being my favorite food). Mount Everest sushi is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to especially with the price they sell their sushi at. Surprisingly, if I hadn't known the price, I would believe that this sushi is top end given its fish quality, presentation, taste, and all its other contents. The seaweed itself was very good, it wasn't dry and had a very good aroma and taste. The rice stuck together very well and the texture was perfect. The place itself had a lot of options, including its sushi donut and poke bowl. It's really a great place, I would suggest this to anyone. Totally love it, and can't wait to go back. You won't regret it.

I was going to order more with my boyfriend, but luckily the kind lady warned me that I had ordered a lot and, my god was I full by the end of it.

Totally recommend this place! It's new, cheap (doesn't taste cheap at all), and amazing, how much better can it get!"}
{"text":"As others have said, be sure to try the poke bowls and the donuts. The poke bowls are layered with rice, vegetables, and fish, and the donuts are actually a donut shaped ring of rice with fish on top. Both were very good. Right now with Pitt on break you can park right in front and get in with no waiting, give it a try."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Mt. Everest Sushi the next day and was able to sit upstairs. There is a decent amount of space upstairs for additional seating, including some larger tables. 

The staff is incredibly friendly and go out of their way to make you feel part of their family. 

I tried the poke bowl for the first time, and it was outstanding. My daughter got the spider roll and loved it."}
{"text":"The poke bowl was fantastic! A lot of food given the price. A real new gem in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious poke tacos and rolls! Steeler Roll is really good :) I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I came for the poke and was quite pleased. After trying the rest of oakland sushi lunches and being disappointed for the most part, I figured I was through, but here arrives Mount Everest. Since they're the only place doing a poke bowl and I love poke it was an obvious choice. 

Tuna poke bowl with ahi and albacore. It's a set bowl as with the other bowls. They aren't set up for 'custom' yet. It was a delightfully presented bowl with all the fish, seaweed, bonito on top (adorned by an orchid flower), greens and soybean salad in the middle, with sesame and sushi rice on the bottom. 

This is a BIG bowl and the amount of rice and fish given was generous but not pit of balance with the salad and seaweed. I got everything I wanted from this excellent poke bowl. 

To be honest, I hope these guys take over the lunch sushi the fish supply can be less stressed and also leave this place with the best picks. I look forward to trying a roll next visit!"}
{"text":"After struggling to find a sushi and poke place for 2 years, we are home! The fish is fresh, the portions are large, and the presentation is beautiful. Came here twice this week and we will be back. Loved the poke bowl and steeler roll!"}
{"text":"If you're a college student from Nebraska that has never eaten at a sushi restaurant that wasn't in a mall food court, you're going to think that this is pretty good.

If you've had good sushi, however, you're going to wonder why this place has so many four and five star reviews."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars... amazing quality sushi (and presentation!) at such an awesome price. The sushi donut is amazing ... will definitely be back many times!!!"}
{"text":"This is the friendliest and most unique sushi joint that I've ever been to. The owner started 1.5 months ago and talked to me as I ate my lunch. He is extremely creative and dreams big.  Since he knows that there is already a saturated market in Pittsburgh for sushi, he puts emphasis on his own unique creations and wants people to be able to experience and enjoy them. I ordered a poke bowl which was super fresh and also came with a healthy amount of salad in good proportion with the fish and Rice.  He also gave me two free samples of his raw fish, without me asking for it.  One of the samples was tuna with a spicy Curry sauce that reminded me of Ethiopian food.  I've never had that kind of combo before and it was really good! He mentioned hiring more staff before school starts again, and I really hope he can keep up the personality and level of service that he brings to this place.  Definitely going to recommend all my friends to get food here!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I first walked in based on the interior of the restaurant, but decided to give it a go. I'm really glad I did.
The sushi was extremely fresh and tasty and the presentation was beautiful. The sushi chef clearly knows what he is doing. The price was very reasonable as well. Looking forward to going back in the future."}
{"text":"I have to admit, for takeout, they were unbelievably quick.

Furthermore, the price in comparison to the portion for the poke bowls is an absolute steal. I actually came here while still recovering from some nasty bug I got from eating sushi somewhere else, so I was really weary and unable to eat much in the first place from nausea. To my surprise, everything was so fresh that it actually made me feel loads better. 

That's honestly unheard of.

The quality of the fish here is incredibly fresh and I will certainly return as soon as I can. The poke bowls and sushi donuts have won my heart."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing sushi place I've been to yet. I visited from DC saw this place and decided to check it out and wow it blew me away. I ordered sushi donuts, steelers roll (favorite roll to date) and poke bowl. Serving size was massive. The chef was so interactive, describing different flavors, how to eat the donut etc. not only was flavoring amazing but the presentation was fabulous. The chef is absolutely amazing, this place is amazing you need to go. Like now!"}
{"text":"This place has some badass sushi, and by badass I mean amazing.  Hands down the freshest I've had in Pittsburgh.  The staff is incredibly friendly and the setting is accomodating.  They change up the menu pretty frequently, adding new creative dishes, but they'll always make you what you want.  Great location in Oakland, worth the trip from anywhere!"}
{"text":"Over the course of a half dozen visits this has become a go to spot for lunch oriented sushi. The poke bowls are a good bit more food than a simple sushi roll, with more variety in one dish, and at a much better price. 

Kelsang has been warm and friendly on all of my visits. I am excited to see what new bowls he comes up with when the seasons change!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise on a business trip. For $9 I got this beautiful poke bowl. The tuna was tasty, the rice was sticky, and the flower made me feel fancy. 

The gentleman who helped me was very friendly and very quick to provide this yummy treat."}
{"text":"A really excellent addition to the Oakland lunch scene.  Officially I'm opposed to sushi gimmicks, but off the record, the sushi donut is actually kind of adorable.  It's the perfect size for a very light lunch or a large midday snack.  The poke bowls are delicious and huge, definitely worth the $11 price tag (heads up that the \"house\" poke bowl is on the spicier side).  The presentation in general is just excellent.  In terms of freshness, this place is definitely above average, and the folks who work there are really friendly and chill.

The seating area upstairs looks like it's still being renovated, so I wouldn't bring your lady or gentleman friend here for a fancy night out just yet, but it's great for a casual lunch or dinner. I'm not looking forward to the end of the summer because this place is gonna get PACKED, but they'll have earned it."}
{"text":"Steelers roll-  5stars
Yuzu Salmon - 5 stars
Yellow Tail jalape√±o - 5 stars
Tuna Roll - 3stars 

Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Hole in wall place where all Pittsburgh university students go. They use Fresh quality fish no frozen"}
{"text":"I'm nervous to review this place, because once everyone finds out how good it is, either the quality will down or orders will take forever, but this is a business I need to support.

 I was supposed to meet friends for lunch when I walked past this little place. I was so excites about the menu that I ended up over ordering and canceling on my friends (I didn't say why). 

 Flowers and red pepper threads atop everything, sushi donuts and tacos, poke (FINALLY), fresh fish all whipped up instantly. All delicious. All beautifully assembled. I'm in love.

 I can't give any sushi place in Pittsburgh five stars, because the fish is just never going to be as good as what I've had on the coasts, but I assure you this is as good as it gets locally."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food and friendly service. The gentleman at the counter was very helpful. We had the sushi doughnuts, tacos, salmon poke, and tuna poke. Definitely over ordered, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the tuna poke bowl to go and it was good, not the best poke bowl unfortunately. It came with seaweed salad and a lot of lettuce."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT Sushi Tacos! I LOVE this place. I also had the Poke Bowl. A hidden gem in Oakland."}
{"text":"I've tried most of their poke bowls and they're absolutely wonderful. Also the atmosphere for a sitting in to eat is nice and cozy on the second floor. Also, very polite customer service."}
{"text":"UPDATE

Service is still amazing as ever. I owed $20.70 for two salmon poke bowls but I misunderstood and paid $20.17  But he was really nice about to and allowed to may him short a couple cents. It may not seem like much, but I personally take it as a big Service!

The salmon is quality, very fresh! And the portion is generous as are the owners. i always have such a positive experience.

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"What a great gem of a place. I had spicy tuna poke bowl, and it was the best poke I have ever eaten!! Beautiful fresh tuna in a wasabi-based sauce with seaweed and a salad on rice. The bowl was topped with a lovely flower. This place isn't much on ambiance, but who cares when the food is this good!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic flavor that delivers! What can you expect more?! Here on business trip with crazy workload and cannot afford the time to dine in the restaurant - eating at cafeteria and room service for a week... This totally saved my day!!! Will definitely order again! And I am not biased because I didn't eat well. If you taste the rice, sticky and fragrant with a hint of Japanese vinegar - it is perfectly correct!"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the entrance. The sushi is great. I had the poke bowl. I asked for it spicy and they delivered. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for something different to order for dinner last week. As we were checking Yelp, he said \"this place has sushi donuts.\" I said say no more and and off we were to Oakland. This place is very small and easy to miss. We got there around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday and no one else was in the restaurant. We ordered an order of sushi donuts (each order comes with 2), I ordered the salmon poke bowl, and my bf ordered the Monster roll. Our food was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I'm craving this place again as I'm typing this review. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the freshest most flavorful poke bowl I've ever had and I come from Vegas, a town where Poke places are as frequent as Mccdonalds. I got the Tuna Poke Bowl and it was amazing. I recommend getting some ginger and mango on it as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious and an excellent value.  I can't believe how large the poke bowls are and filled with sashimi!  The best rainbow roll I've ever tried.  Friendly quick staff too.  Next time I'm in town, this will be on my to do list."}
{"text":"My first Poke Bowl and it was delicious and the sushi taco was fabulous. Good food served by good people. You can't go wrong with both of those!!"}
{"text":"Very happy with this casual sushi place. Good value and friendly staff. I liked the salmon poke bowl!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owners/staff are so friendly and the fish is always fresh. I usually order the house special poke or whatever their fresh fish of the day is. Their poke always has a ton of fish and wakame, and if you get other variations they also add other yummy things like edamame or a crab salad mix. The prices are pretty average, but they are currently giving 10% off if you pay in cash and usually have other deals for students as well!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found a sushi spot this good in Pittsburgh. Wish I could buy stock in this place because I'm going to be spending a lot of money here in the future.

The restaurant is not an upscale, pretentious setting whatsoever. You order downstairs and head upstairs where they will bring you your order. No waiters or waitresses, no fancy decor, the focus here is where it belongs, the food!

I ordered the sushi special A, which was a small assortment of nigiri and California roll, the sushi donuts, and 4 spicy tuna rolls. All of this was about $45 and well worth it. The rice is perfect, the fish is outstanding, and in such a laid back environment I think this place is going to be hard to beat when it comes to damn good sushi. 

I know campus can be a pain in the butt to park on and navigate but this place is worth the trouble. The staff was very nice and I am already planning my next trip back."}
{"text":"Finally some affordable and clean tasting poke bowls in Pittsburgh. Had the salmon poke bowl and would highly recommend. The portions are large, and it's under $10. If you dine-in, they put a flower on top of your bowl. Also, the place appears small, but there's much more space upstairs."}
{"text":"We visited Mt Everest for a little snack based on the Yelp reviews. We grabbed some white tuna shashimi and nigiri but wanted something different. The 2 tacos for $6.95 were recommended. A simple hard taco shell was filled with a lovely cerviche like mix of tuna, salmon, avocado and other good things. What a deal for $6.95!  If I had just ordered the nigiri I would have probably given the restaurant 4 stars.  But the taco (and the friendly service) pushed me to 5 stars. My daughter (a Pitt student) will have to try the other dishes for us since we live south of Seattle, WA. I'm sure she won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here, and customer service is fantastic too! My favorite is probably the sushi taco!! Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, with a reasonable price! I highly recommend trying their \"Mt  Everest\" sushi roll. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"If you're someone who works in Oakland or goes to one of the universities there, this is the place to get your sushi fix. Most people from other parts of the city and surrounding suburbs will probably agree that Oakland is an unimaginable nightmare to navigate when regular semester classes are in progress. However, that just means you should come here over a school break! That's what a friend and I did over the summer. Had to be in Oakland for an appointment and it was the perfect opportunity to try it. Everything we had was very tasty and fresh. The sushi chef/owner even brought us some yummy tuna poke bowl to sample on the house (we ordered the salmon poke and it was very good as well). We tried a variety of rolls and yes, we had their famed sushi donuts, too. For the price, quality, and quantity, you can't beat this spot! Oh and everyone was super friendly there. It's not the fanciest spot, not sure if they've gotten to their renovations yet, but I'm not typically a sucker for ambiance and am usually pleased when I don't have to dress to the 9s to go out to eat. I came to grub! Haha. I (almost) can't wait until my next appointment in Oakland so I can drag the hubby here afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Went with my family on a Sunday at around 3, and there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant. Bad sign? Not at all. We started off with the tuna tacos, and they were amazing. They tasted SO fresh, and they had the perfect ratio of fish and fresh veggies, as well as being seasoned perfectly. I then got the tuna poke bowl, and it honestly blew my mind. There were two different types of tuna in the bowl- chunk tuna and, for lack of my knowledge on sushi terms, mushy tuna (not a bad mushy though!!). It also had seaweed salad, peppers, onions, lettuce (good spring mix), and white rice. It was so filling, so yummy, so fresh. I can't get over how good it was. If I wasn't concerned about mercury poisoning I'd eat it every day.

It was so good that a few days later I went again to try the salmon poke bowl. It had chunk salmon and, I believe, imitation crab, plus all the fixings from the tuna bowl. SO GOOD. You guys I'm obsessed with this place. The fish is so fresh and the employees are so nice. You have to make it a point to come here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mount Everest Sushi a couple times, so this review reflects my opinion after both visits (dine-in and take-out). For reference, I've tried their Pittsburgh roll, sushi donuts, and salmon poke bowl (all of which I recommend). 

First, the good: The fish is wonderful and fresh. Coming from the West Coast, I've had my fair share of sushi, sashimi and poke, and I'd say Mt. Everest's fish is pretty darn solid, and consistently so. The rolls and sushi donut are tasty and well-made. Service is friendly and very efficient, they plate the food so beautifully if you dine in, and they keep the place nice and clean.

The not-so-good: Since my first visit (December 2017), the prices have definitely gone up (e.g. from $8.75 to $10.75 for a salmon poke bowl), whereas the portion sizes of fish seem to have slightly shrunk (though they still remain within reason). The poke sauce is a bit lacking in flavor. There isn't a very large seating area, though this doesn't seem to be a problem. 

Verdict: I won't be coming here too often, given the increase in prices, but if you're craving some good-quality raw fish or are willing to indulge in some sushi rolls, Mount Everest Sushi will definitely hit the spot for you."}
{"text":"The salmon poke is wonderful. I love the taste of the rice, and the salmon is prertty fresh."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I really love sushi. I kept seeing this place on Postmates and I was in the mood for some sush so I thought I'd try it (not before checking Yelp, though!). I'm always a little iffy ordering sushi from a delivery service but I was happy to see the stars and reviews so of course I went ahead and tried it. So happy I did! Finally a place with good poke! 

I ordered the sushi platter with a California roll, tuna, salmon, shrimp and some kind of white fish sashimi. Very good. Tasty. Fresh fish. I also ordered the salmon poke bowl. Salmon, crab, rice, edamame. The salmon and crab were on point. I enjoyed both dishes so much and I can't wait to order from here again. 

The fish is fresh and the presentation is lovely. Finally a sushi place that is quality and affordable."}
{"text":"Delicious poke bowls! They are so nice too and quick! If you want to change something in the bowl, they easily let you do it with no charge! Love it here!"}
{"text":"This was a great choice for lunch !! We got 1 order of sushi donuts (it's a pair for $6.75, i think), a tuna poke bowl, and a salmon poke bowl. We would have had more than enough food with just the bowls, but everything was so good, we ate it all anyhow.

The donuts are more rice than sashimi (obv) and less rice than sushi, so it was the perfect ratio. 

The poke bowls were delicious and had veggies and greens in addition to rice, seaweed salad, fish, etc. The tuna bowl had a nutty marinade while the salmon bowl was more sesame oil/shallot tasting. Both were A ++."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you are ever in Pittsburgh. It is close to Carnegie Mellon and around some shopping places. The staff are extremely and the food is yummy. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the ambiance. When I went the first floor didn't have air conditioning which made it very hot and sticky. Upstairs had air but sadly there were some flies."}
{"text":"Great little gem that really piles it on.  Had the very generous salmon poke bowl, the tacos and Mt. Everest roll, which filled us up so much that they had to roll us out.  Great service, loved the presentation = memorable dinner"}
{"text":"The poke bowls were delicious AND beautiful, and the chef was super nice. He noticed that we both ordered tuna and brought us the seared ahi tuna on the house - it was equally as incredible! The fish was fresh, everything as super clean, and everyone working there was super nice. Stoked to go back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poke bowl! Very different from what I normally get in California. It's a pre-set bowl. The fish taste fresh, there are so many toppings in one bowl! However, I think the sauce is a bit too much. The spicy crab is also a bit too salty. Overall, it's great value for the price I paid!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool people,  fun menu, good sushi and fair price."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out. It was quick and that's good! It was different than the poke place downtown, where you can customize your order however you want. But here it is more of order off the menu. They have everything set up that you can't add extra or minus anything.  I got the spicy salmon and spicy crab combo. It came out in less than 5 minutes. But it didn't come with any sauce and I had to ask for a side of spicy mayo.  In the end, the taste! It was tasty I would give it 4 out of 5. Just because I like to have some sauce to go with my poke bawl. I wish it is chipotle style that you can customize your order. Overall it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi/ sashimi I have ever had. I decided to come here for lunch before my flight out of Pittsburgh. The meal here made me wish I had discovered this place earlier. 

The restaurant is more of a take out/ order and pay at the counter type. Seatings downstairs is very limited but they do have pretty good seatings upstairs. The people that work here are extremely nice. One of the guys even offered to carry my luggage upstairs. 

I decided to order the sashimi assortments B and the sushi donuts. This was way too much food for one person and I am sure I could have gotten full off just the sushi donuts, which were only $6. The sashimi came with variety of fishes, 3 pieces from each kind of fish. These were some of the freshest sashimi I have ever had. The presentation of the plate was phenomenal and was an art of its own. The sushi donuts were also fresh and delicious. I thought that the donut concept was so creative to the sushi game. I loved the spicy tuna on the donuts. 

All of the food came out super quickly. For all of the food I got, my order came out to be around $25. 

I highly recommend this place for some good sushi. I think it is a great addition to the Oakland area and is a great choice for college students who are on a budget."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The window front wasn't obviously visible so I felt a bit lost for a few minutes. Look for the small red-tiled store front. 

I ordered the tacos and spicy California rolls. Tacos came 2 to an order and they are full sized tacos! They were so damn good. The tacos were filled with lots of fresh mashed avo, seaweed salad, a plentiful layer of salmon & tuna, and then topped with a mixture of spicy pickled veggies. The edible purple orchid made it extra special!

The cali roll was pretty standard.

My coworker ordered a poke bowl and WOW - that looked pretty impressive. Her only comments were \"generous and delicious\" because she was so involved in inhaling her food. 

I would highly recommend this place.  Super understated, very reasonably priced, and soooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Unassuming but fantastic food. The food is too good for college students. Kidding...  or am I?

The sushi chef has cultivated quite a following from his years at Plum and now is sharing his good tastes without the pretense. 

My favorite is the house special poke bowl.  Perfect balance of flavors, generous amount of fish, great seasoned rice. Seriously, what else is there to talk about?!"}
{"text":"Great service, small and clean restaurant, with pretty good food. Only street parking available, but I think people use this more for take out. Fish seemed to be of good quality, simple and nice presentation. The poke bowls were good and the sushi donut is so cute looking!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews (thanks Yelpers!). Salmon poke bowl was better than ones I have had in Hawaii! Huge and filling for less than $9. I'll be back every day this week while I'm in town-- and it was super quickly made to order!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The fish is fresh and delicious!  My husband and I each had a poke bowl and shared a donut.  I can see myself craving the poke bowl all the time.  So much flavor and the textures are great!  We will be back- frequently!  We want to try all the different poke bowl.  Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"When I was an undergrad at Pitt, I used to frequent Sushi Boat often. Back then, it was a low key, cheap establishment for tasty noodle bowls, soups, and basic sushi. Now, it appears to have been revamped  into Mount Everest Sushi - the same level of tastiness but with a fresher look and more focused menu! 

The service is quick (each visit, I've seen two men working the front - looks like they work off each other to take turns preparing the food, taking orders, delivering food to tables, and cashing people out). I've tried the Salmon Pok√©, Sushi donut, and the Mount Everest roll here. The pok√© bowl is a very very, generous serving - a big bowl of rice, greens, seaweed salad, edamame, masago, and of course, salmon. Very fresh and definitely enough for a hearty and balanced meal. The sushi donut is very cute and a good portion for a light meal or snack. Priced at $6.75 for two, it's a great deal! The Mount Everest Roll was also huge and delicious.

The interior is pretty bright and colorful. Like what they used to have for Sushi Boat, the menu is written on the chalkboard to the right when entering the restaurant, but for Mount Everest, they've organized & cleaned up the menu more, added some basic descriptions, and made it more colorful."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall kinda place. Amazing presentation and flavors to match if not surpass. You might be skeptical when you walk in. You won't be when you leave. Try one of the bowls!"}
{"text":"My visit to mount everest sushi was second to none. Oakland just received one of the best sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh. For an affordable price, and 5 star quality you can't beat Mount Everest. Whether you want standard rolls or sashimi, you will be taken care of!"}
{"text":"An Oakland gem! Quick, friendly service; very fresh food; and creative preparations. I loved the tuna curry poke bowl and the salmon roll. Plenty of seating upstairs. The table needed to be washed - I'll attribute that to the bus-your-own-table protocol. Great lunch - great value. I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is great. My favorite are the poke bowls - really good value and so delicious!  I usually order takeout but there are a few seats in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets, considering its location and price point. For less than 10 bucks you get a bowl consisting of tasty fish (salmon or tuna), various kinds of veg and greens, and some rice. Not really sure what an authentic poke bowl would taste like but whatever you get here will at least be delicious. The bowl is well seasoned and the presentation is quite good too! fingers crossed that this little place stays the course when the school term starts back up in two months."}
{"text":"This will be short. This is a truly quality place with a very casual atmosphere. I'm so happy that they've opened in Pittsburgh.

Price-point is right in line with most other sushi places in PGH, quality is quite a bit higher."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Oakland. Place looks nondescript, but all the sushi orders we've placed so far are tasty and excellent. Beautifully plated and ample sized servings. Taking off a star because serving can be slow, esp during busy hours. However, consider that your sushi is carefully put together and meticulously hand rolled. If you're craving for sumptuous sushi without having to shell out big bucks, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in pittsburgh! the delicious flavors matched with the beautiful, artistic presentation make this a one of a kind experience. While the restaurant itself is very small and unassuming the people are helpful and kind hearted. after ordering a large platter of sushi, i was offered by one of the staff to take it out to my car. this is my new favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Salmon Poke Bowl to go on a Monday evening. The bowl was very large and the total was under $10 which was a total steal, or so I thought. When I got home, I was very disappointed. The bowl was mostly filled with a spring mix (i've never seen that in a poke bowl).There was very little fish and rice. I ordered a Salmon Poke Bowl but got a very lackluster salad of some sort. I didn't get to try the sushi, but after that, I'm not sure I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Some of the best and certainly most creative take on sushi I've ever seen! The poke bowl is awesome and the prices are ridiculously good! I would have liked a slightly nicer interior but they're new so id give them time to do some upgrades."}
{"text":"The sushi here is outstanding! I've visited five times, and I'm hooked. I love the sushi donut, the tuna tacos, and the delicious tuna and salmon poke bowls. They are colorful, filled with lots of goodies, large enough to share, creatively constructed, and a GREAT value. Kelsang has been welcoming and proud of his beautiful and fresh offerings. I hope he can spruce the place up a bit so that it will be appealing to all diners. Bravo, Mt. Everest!"}
{"text":"Go here!! I got the salmon poke bowl, and added avocado. It was super flavorful and just overall amazing. To add to the great food experience, the staff member working was SO friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be serving us. Great place."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!! Get the sushi taco for sure. I was pleasantly surprised that there were two in one order. The staff was very helpful with the tough decision on whether what we ordered was too much sushi or not. Great presentation and spice levels were on point!"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! Visited with two friends. I ordered the Boston roll, which had shrimp, cucumber, and avocado. Service was fast, and we didn't have to wait long for the food. My roll was pretty basic, but it was fresh and filling nonetheless. Last time I came, I got the sushi donuts, and I would highly recommend that for those wanting to try something special. I would argue that it may not be worth it to order the more regular-style rolls for the price, but sushi donuts I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised me through and through with its quality and originality. Service is swift and the sushi is both delicious and artistically designed. 

First, the quality of food. The raw fish was very fresh and all of the ingredients tasted very good. Rolls were well rolled and didn't fall apart easily, even when you took a bite. I was particularly impressed by how they combined all our orders on a plate in a way that made the dish look like a work of art. Personally, I tried the rainbow roll, Mount Everest roll, and the sushi donuts. 
     The rainbow roll had a very nice variety of sashimi and each bite was unique and refreshing. 
      The Mount Everest roll was packed with lots of good ingredients, however I'd recommend asking for it without any lettuce. The lettuce clashed with the other ingredients and did not mix well. 
      The sushi donut was a pleasant surprise. I thought it was just something interesting to have but might not taste great, but it was quite good! It comes with several sashimi pieces on a doughnut of rice all over a square of seaweed. All in all, an interesting dish that was fun to eat. 

I highly recommend this place for all sushi and poke lovers, and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Freshest sushi in Oakland, high quality and expertly presented by very friendly staff. And amazingly affordable - it would be well worth it even if priced higher. 

This is a new business whose owners set out on their own after having years of experience as preparers elsewhere - and their energy and dedication to make this the best place around is obvious. It's such a good deal for the quality of what they're offering that I really hope they make enough to succeed!"}
{"text":"Really really good sushi in Oakland close to the hospitals. 

Do yourself a favor and step away from your desk or patients (safely of course!) and take a stroll down to Mount Everest sushi.

I ordered spicy salmon, tuna, and two other combo rolls and they were all delicious with a beautiful presentation. There was plenty for 2 of us. I will definitely be ordering again. Next time I'll probably try the poke bowl. It looked yummy."}
{"text":"This place replaced the old, somewhat run-down, Chinese and sushi joint that seemed somehow confused about its identity. Now the inside doesn't look like it's changed much, but the menu looks fresh and more innovative--while this is still primarily a sushi place, they also like to highlight their poke bowls, \"sushi tacos,\" and \"sushi donuts.\" I have not tried those latter two creations, but from a first impression the poke bowls are fantastic. They are huge for what you pay, everything's fresh from the fish to the vegetable to the rice, and there's great flavor all around. Most importantly, it's not just \"sushi in a rice bowl,\" which is the closest thing that you can get in a neighboring establishment.

They offer several different bowls, each with a different type of fish, but even that aside the combination of vegetables and salad will vary for each. For example, the salmon bowl seemed to be more lightly seasoned and also contained roe, so that the whole thing tasted a bit more \"fishy,\" while the great white bowl (albacore) was aa bit heavier on the sauces. The picture here shows only a handful of ingredients, including both crab and seaweed salad and bonito flakes, but there are a lot of vegetables and a bed of sushi rice lying underneath, not to mention more fish.

This is definitely an awesome addition to the Oakland restaurant scene, bringing something new and a bit more \"refined\" but not in a way that gentrifies out the mostly student customer base."}
{"text":"Great poke! It's not build your own like some other places, but we got the house poke bowl and the salmon poke bowl and both were excellent! Fresh ingredients and healthy! Will definitely be back for eat-in or take-out!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we check out this new-ish sushi place in Oakland this weekend, so we decided to try this place since neither of us had ever been here and it seemed to have good reviews. We were not disappointed when we came today. I liked how this place had poke bowls (which can be hard to find outside of the West Coast/Hawaii), sushi tacos, and sushi donuts (which are pretty trendy right now lol). My friend and I both ordered a poke bowl; she got the tuna one and I had the salmon one. Both of our bowls looked amazing, had super fresh ingredients, and tasted mad delicious. We're both coming back again, probably gonna try the sushi tacos next. Honestly, a super legit place to go if you want poke bowls in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Just do it.  

The place is small, but the food comes fast and it is worth any hassle you could possibly endure to get it."}
{"text":"This is the coolest sushi spot in pittsburgh! Kelsang and Alex have taken sushi to a different level with freshness and creativity while maintaining a super relaxed and non pretentious vibe. This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon roll and fancy donuts. Both pretty good. You get a lot of food for the money I'm comparison to other sushi places. The donuts are super difficult to eat. I'm honestly not sure how you're supposed to do it. But it's gimmick works. I got a great pic for Instagram. The salmon roll was also decent. The pieces were all cut into totally different sizes though like they weren't looking where they were slicing. 

All-in-all, decent value, decent taste, wouldn't say it's out of this world."}
{"text":"This place sells delicious sushi at an affordable price. The owners and chef are super kind, and they are willing to make accommodations/modifications. The sushi is fresh and delicious. Sorry but the place next door (which I won't actually name) is not \"real\" sushi, but Mount Everest definitely is! This isn't my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh, but it is one of the best and one of the most reasonably-priced."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I'm a sushi snob. I was lucky to once visit Tokyo's Tsukiji Market, arguably the world's most famous fish auction. Early every morning, to the sounds of lip-smacking ooo-ing and aah-ing, the mom-and-pop sushi shops that fringe Tsukiji serve up the the world's most humble and most delicate sushi, embedded in perfectly seasoned rice. Since that trip, I've hardly been able to eat our local version of this delicacy. Until now! Three cheers for Mt. Everest - the Pittsburgh equivalent to those clean, modest stands. The sushi is simply that delectable and unquestionably fresh. And then there's the lovingly assembled, wonderfully fragrant and completely delicious poke bowls, topped with red pepper threads and an edible orchid. The quality of the food is matched by the integrity, kindness and professionalism of the owners who work hard to make this place a local treasure. Excellent all around!"}
{"text":"Name, food and style are confusing. Raw fish and Mt Everest?  This place serves Hawaii style bowl (poke) that is different than most other places. There is Korean and Japanese style across the street, but this one is Hawaiian. 

Had the tuna bowl and salmon bowl. The bowl has lots of salad. Greens : rice ratio is like 2:1.  Fish are ok. Decent but certainly not best in town.  Lots of nuts in the tuna and salmon bowl. So be careful if you are allergic to that.

Also had their Special Poke Bowl. No nuts in this one.  But, raw tuna + raw salmon + raw onion + raw green pepper + raw red pepper + cooked rice.  The amount of rice is more than tuna / salmon bowl, dont know if they changed recipe or what.  Sauce is slightly hot and sour.  

Worth a try, but do not expect it to be Japanese / Korean style because this poke is not."}
{"text":"Definitely met my high expectations! I got the tuna poke bowl. The fish was fresh and there was a humongous portion of it - frankly I had difficulty finishing it! I couldn't believe this whole thing was only 10 bucks. The seaweed salad was crisp and delicious, and the warm rice on the bottom really tied everything together well. The sauce that the tuna chunks were tossed in was also extremely tasty and didn't overwhelm the fish. My only complaint was that there was a bit too much dressing on the salad greens for my taste, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing about this meal. I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Am I in Oakland, CA or Pittsburgh? 

This place opened up about a month ago and I just had the chance to try it. Boy, am I glad I did. 

I had my first taste of poke in Hawaii last year.  And of course I loved the fresh, marinated tuna. But it wasn't something I expected to have soon again in Pittsburgh, given the city's generally weak ethnic food and seafood options. 

That's changed. This bowl was fresh, delicious, big, and affordable. I'll admit it wasn't as great as my first bowl in Hawaii, but that's not a fair comparison given local culture as geography. It had a bit more lettuce than I am used to, but it's not because they are skimping on the fish. The spicy tuna cubes were marinated in a delicious but not overpowering sauce. The bowl was balanced and did indeed have rice on the bottom.  I considered getting a side, but am glad I didn't because a bowl will fill you up. 

They have some other cutesy raw bar options like sushi donuts and tacos. I am kind of curious about them, but may never end up tasting them because it will be so hard to pass up another poke bowl. They also have Maki and hand rolls. 

If I discovered this place during the school year, I might try to keep it a secret. But school's out and I want these guys to succeed. So check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while and wish I came sooner! The salmon poke bowl was filling, fresh, and affordable. The flavors worked great together and all of the components were dressed well. 

I would definitely come back for the poke bowls as well as to try the sushi. Would highly recommend Mount Everest Sushi for a quick lunch or dinner! They have a catering menu with large sushi trays, too. Since the restaurant is small, you can always take your food to Schenley Plaza and eat outside."}
{"text":"Great. Had tuna poke bowl on recommendation at counter. This place is perfect. It has a warm hole in the wall vibe. Super friendly. Come here with a friend and linger. Come alone. Either would be worth the trip. As a traveler looking for a convenient place near the hotel, I could not have done better"}
{"text":"This is an amazing establishment for sushi and for the ever-growing poke trend. their bowls are wonderful fresh and delicious the prices are incredibly reasonable I would recommend this place to anybody in the surrounding Oakland area. Will def return for round 2!!"}
{"text":"To put it simply this place is amazing! Don't let the front of the restaurant turn you away. You will not be disappointed. I recommend the sushi donut and some poke bowls. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Um what?! Another amazing Poke place to hit Pittsburgh? Be still my heart. First off, the man who took my order was so nice. He was extremely helpful even though I came in 15 mins before close (yes I'm that person). I ordered a poke bowl, sushi donuts, and the spicy salmon roll so that I could try a little bit of everything. Honestly everything was delicious and for a $7 roll the spicy salmon came with 8 pieces which is very rare! The donuts were so fun and so easy to eat (or maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it with my hands). It was all so fresh also and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny you spend! Small cozy place. Love the sushi and bowls. I tried the traditional bow with seaweed peppers salmon and tuna. And the taco has the same things! I shouldn't order them at the same time. Saying so, they are really delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  The presentation is phenomenal and well worth the visit.  We were curious due to good yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Having been in the industry, I can say that this the BEST sushi in town!! I've eaten sushi for nearly 2 decades and this place has never disappointed.  From the food to the company. Owners Chef Alex and Chef Kelsang are always more than happy to try new things and make it fun.  They are never short on delivery and most of all they make it look easy!"}
{"text":"I really like the food which is delicious and affordable sushi place next to college."}
{"text":"Chef Kelsang is the best, the fish is fresh and so far everything I've ordered has been phenomenal. By the way, flower he adds to the dishes isn't just decoration, it's edible!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Pittsburgh! Highly recommend this place to anyone who craves sushi. Their poke bowls, sushi tacos, and sushi donuts brings a fresh breath to sushi within the city. The staff is very nice and very acommendating, if you are a vegan just ask them if they can make the sushi roll or donut into a vegan and they will!"}
{"text":"Poke bowls are crazy good and prices are absurdly low considering how good the quality of fish is"}
{"text":"Ordered a dragon roll and am pleased with how it came out.

Flavor is great and service was very fast! I waited about 5 min.

Overall amazing little sushi place in Oakland. My only complaint is pricing, but for flavor I'll definitely be returning to satisfy my sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Just don't get the eel roll. I found some bones in mine (seen on side of plate in picture) and it was not a pleasant experience. On top of that, the eel didn't seem cooked too well. I probably should have known better than to get eel at this place since it's more of a college joint. The rest of the food was fine. Not great, but pretty good. Very disappointed to find bones in my roll though. That was pretty awful. I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets in Pittsburgh from the countless places I've had sushi thus far. It can be tough to find sushi in Pittsburgh that has a substantial amount of fish that is fresh for an affordable price. This is especially true in Oakland, where restaurants often cater to the student population with cheap and easy grub. 

I've tried the poke, a few different rolls, the donuts, and tacos - all had an ample amount of very fresh tasting fish, and all for a reasonable price.  The toppings are also always fresh and well made. If you dine in, the artistic plating is a bonus. The staff here definitely know what they're doing in terms of flavor, composition, food handling, and presentation.

Sushi is one of my favorite foods. I've tried to refrain from getting it more than a couple times a month to go easy on the wallet, but the quality of the sushi here is so good I'm making this a weekly stop.

The staff is also always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was in Oakland so I decided to stop in for a poke bowl and I ordered the house special poke bowl it had tuna salmon seaweed salad cucumbers Red and green bell peppers it was great.  A little spicy It had wasabi and siracha. They offered 10% off if you payed in cash but who carries cash anymore!! Lol it was like $15 but it was two meals for sure. I want to go back and try the sushi donuts."}
{"text":"I went back here again and unfortunately it seems some items are better than others.  I tried the  sushi tacos and the special Poke bowl (tuna and salmon).  You can't customize the Poke bowl at all unlike other places.  While the fish was good, I could barely taste it under a load of sauce and red/green peppers and onions.  It was a similar situation for the tacos.  Also the taco shells were just generic Mexican style crispy corn based taco shells like you buy at the grocery and were not homemade. It would be better if the sauce and peppers/onions were much lighter so you could really taste the fish, which I know to be of high quality from my first experience.  I saw the sushi chef when I was there preparing a sashimi plate for another customer which looked amazing, with a very nice presentation for a quick casual restaurant like this.  I think I'll stick to options without sauce in the future and try the sashmi or chirashi next time."}
{"text":"Great casual dining spot downtown for some quick no-frills sushi.

Looked tiny initially but theres an upstairs seating area with at least another 4-5 tables.  There were no daily specials when I went in for lunch so potentially a dinner or weekend thing.

Prices seemed a little higher than expected given that it's order at counter type, but I was proved wrong.  My specialty roll was huge! And on top of that really good!  I got the Mount Everest and piece felt packed and the texture of the fish felt fresh.

TBH, there was waaaaaay too much sauce on my sushi. Like drowned, like horribly drowned I used a spoon to scoop off.  But IDK I still had such a satisfactory meal that I'd totally come back.  

Oh, dunno if they would refill ginger and wasabi for you, guess you can ask but its not service-based since you pay up-front.  Was a hassle cause I sat upstairs.  I like at least 3 refills of ginger . 

Wana go back to try nigiri! Feel like I didn't properly taste the flavor of the fishies."}
{"text":"First of all, their sushi tacos were hands down the best I've ever had of raw fish in any form. Tuna and salmon mixed with a variety of perfectly marinated peppers and veggies. Perfect. 

My husband and I went after a bodybuilding competition and ordered about 6 rolls, sushi donuts, and those delicious tacos. They plated our spread of assorted sushi rolls on a beautiful boat with colorful, edible flowers and plenty of wasabi and ginger. Not bad for a $60 tab! This would have easily been over $100 anywhere else. 

He also got the miso soup and said it was the best he has ever had - and he knows miso soup. 

I would highly recommend this to any sushi lover. The rolls aren't too fancy, but the fish is noticeably good quality."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm a sushi fan in a \"I like California rolls\" kind of way, but this place definitely made me want to branch out.  The menu here was full of fun twists on sushi, like sushi donuts and sushi tacos! My boyfriend and I decided to split an order of Steelers Rolls (because...Pittsburgh!), they had tempura shrimp in the middle, smoked salmon around the outside and were topped with a drizzle of spicy mayo...pretty darn good! The restaurant was a short walk from the Cathedral of Learning, so we walked over and ate our sushi outside while people watching.  Overall a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, quickly prepared and served, in a casual environment. 

Stopped by this place on an afternoon this week around 4 pm. I called as I was walking over, and they had my food ready for me 5 minutes later when I arrived. Beautiful plating all around for both the dishes I ordered. The fish was very fresh, the sushi rice perfectly prepared. My rainbow roll had lovely fresh crab inside and was served with decorative sauces that were great for the dipping. I was a little disappointed that the salmon in the poke bowl was coated in a sweet sauce rather that just being chunks of fish that I could dress myself, but I'm sure if I ordered it again I could request that. There was a healthy serving of greens in the poke bowl, too, which was nice.

The upstairs seating area was well air-conditioned on this hot summer day and had a bunch of basic linoleum tables and a serve-yourself water dispenser with styrofoam cups. You pay at the counter downstairs, but then your food is brought up to you. The crowd seemed mostly young college students (makes sense for the location!) with pop music playing overhead suited to the customer demographic. Seems like a great place for a casual lunch or dinner. Prices were fair for the quality of the fish."}
{"text":"First off, not only is the staff fantastic and the music fantastic but the fish is FRESH and delicious. 
I recently got a Poke bowl from a popular restaurant in Oakland, and the tuna was so old it TURNED TO MUSH as I bit into it. I ended up tossing 90% of the fish- so needless to say I was nervous about this Tuna Poke bowl.  And I told the owner this, upon hearing this he said \"If my tuna is old, I swear to you free food everyday!\" And he sliced  me a piece of tuna. People- IT WAS DIVINE. It was the perfect texture of Ahi tuna. Not smelly, not chewy and mushy. It was legitimately incredible. 

I have eaten sushi all over the world, and only twice has a chef offered a sample of the fish prior to purchase. The first time was in Tokyo, Japan and the second in this establishment.   This act of kindness and decency truly sold this place for me. When an owner/ chef not only \"talks the talk\", but puts it out there for you to sample: this is the real deal. 

My friends, you have many options for \"sushi\" in Pittsburgh. But I can tell you this place offers sanitary ( this is crucial with raw fish), and delicious food delivered with a smile. Also, the playlist here is incredible. If you're looking for fresh and delicious sushi, not mechanically rolled, not frozen and past the due date, not handed to you with an eye roll than this is the place for you! 

P.S. I live in Monroeville, but work in Robinson. I leave work early to avoid the commute, and yet I drove into Oakland to get this sushi. Yes, you read that correct: I have a two tunnel rush hour commute and I chose to drive into Oakland for this food. And you know what? It was worth every second. 

What are you waiting for? Go get you something delicious and actually worth your money! Pittsburgh has finally gotten an upgrade. Get yourself sushi of quality and worth your  hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Oh my god!  This place is amazing. I have been in Pittsburgh for a month and have frequented this spot at  least 10 times!!  I have enjoyed the tuna poke bowl always and the salmon bowl once, only because I wanted to try something else. Service is awesome. The bowls are fresh and flavorful.  I crave the bowl daily and I'm not doing well resisting this place. The price is right at about $10 a bowl and I am full every time!! This place isn't a secret but I know based on the owners and staff this place will be around for awhile!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of Sushi Boat, the business that used to be in this location. Thankfully, this place is infinitely better. The staff was incredibly friendly, the cook came out to talk to people and suggest menu offerings, and most importantly the sushi was delicious. This is coming from someone who can be pretty picky about sushi, since I've eaten it countless times since I was little. There is also additional seating upstairs. I have zero complaints, and I fully recommend this place to anyone in Oakland who is in the mood for good quality, affordable sushi. A well earned 5 stars, I'll definitely be a regular customer going forward."}
{"text":"The steeler sushi is fantastic! The sushi is coming with an amazing dragon painting on the plate. It is more than food! It's a piece of heart!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my take out/delivery experience. I've never actually been to the restaurant. I ordered sushi through the yelp app which is super easy and convenient. The delivery is actually fulfilled by grub hub. We got a few different rolls...spicy tuna, spicy salmon, philly roll, sushi donuts. The orochi roll was my favorite. It was something different and I loved that it was topped with avocado. They all were absolutely delicious. I really loved the presentation! They put all the rolls on a huge platter and it was so nicely garnished. It was about a 45 minute wait time and it even came a few minutes early! I was very pleased with this delivery experience and the quality of the sushi. This is my new go to for sushi take out!"}
{"text":"During my visit in Pittsburgh I decided to try some sushi. I was in the heart of Pitt University where they have a good selection or places for you to eat. I ended going to Mount Everest Sushi and OH MAN! this place is unbelievable. I never had a sushi taco which sounded weird but if you haven't have one, do yourself a favor and order 2. Forget about the rolls the poke bowls is the way to go oooooooooooh I can still taste the flavors. The chef is a master putting flavors in that bowl damn! Guys, I travel the U. S. EVERY year for work and I try different sushi places everywhere I go. This is one is different and is the best I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Quick update: this is my latest obsession in the area and satisfies all my sushi cravings!! Had to try the *sushi doughnut*. Smaller in size than I had expected, but so rich in taste! The sushi is fresh and artfully crafted. I think the vibrant colors attest to the freshness. It's a not as easy to eat as regular-way styled sushi, but I recommend taking a bite with some fish, avocado, rice, and seaweed on the bottom for the full experience! 

Only waited for what felt like 5-10 min. Perfect for my college budget & very accessible (situated in the heart of Oakland)"}
{"text":"So after break in between classes I'm so hungry! I was their first customer upon their opening. So college kids or business people on a lunch break this place for sushi is by far the best! The salmon here is so fresh not like most places for the first time I've fallen hard for their fancy doughnut and  rainbow roll! Chef Kelsang is so talented the way he presents the sushi makes you want to not even touch it before taking a picture... amazing place for great sushi. So many people different age and work back ground... the atmosphere is overall warming! Try it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, presentation is great and taste is awesome. This was my first time here and I tried 3 different rolls (shared with a friend) all of them were amazing a fresh. It's a really small place and you have to order before you sit down, but after having those rolls I would go back any time. Next time I'll try the poke bowl, it seems to be a popular choice."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi places that I've been to. The poke bowl is large and delicious. Quient place, perfect for a quick lunch in Oakland."}
{"text":"Mount Everest should definetely be in your bucket list if you want delicious, fresh, and affordable sushi. The steeler roll is a must have if you are a salmon lover, like me. Chef kelsang and Chef alex never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The raw fish was fresh, and you get a large portion of food. 

I've tried the salmon poke bowl, and the tuna poke bowl. Both were incredibly delicious and flavorful. My go-to is definitely the salmon poke bowl because of the price and size (under $10). There have been inconsistencies of the flavoring of the food sometimes though. The salad dressing on the greens can be overpowering at times -- slightly too acidic. Otherwise, I've been fairly pleasant with the quality of the food and the friendly staff. 

Food: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Portion Size: 5/5"}
{"text":"Good sushi place to go. The seaweed salad is delicious and the rolls are cut well. There is competition two doors up but they cut your sushi with a machine... you're better off going to Everest. The prices are also very reasonable.   Once I did try going when the listing hours say opened but the workers, owners, or who ever did not show up till about 20 minutes after."}
{"text":"Not expensive, there's seating upstairs, and really appreciated how personal the chef was when I came with family. The Salmon Poke Bowl is delicious and not surprisingly filling, because it's huge. There's not as much poke as I would like, but there are a lot of other toppings/ingredients and they are deliciousss. The crab in the Salmon bowl and even the rice is good! 

Tip: it's take out but I also saw the chef seat people and take their orders! This was all in Chinese though. I'd say it's still mostly take out/ order then seat."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Cheap, fast, fresh, and delicious. Couldn't ask for more. Each meal came on highly unique plating. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"AMAAZINGGGG!!
Freshest sushi I have ever had. I've had sushi at so many different places and there's is top notch. LOVED the Mount Everest roll.

The real show stopper was the sushi tacos. So creative and flavorful. They were a huge hit with my brain and I!

The tuna Poki bowl was also incredible and a huge portion.

Loved loved loved this place and will be back. Staff was friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"I think the salmon poke bowl here is creative, beautiful, and flavorful. I love the balance of textures among the edamame, seaweed, and imitation crab. With each bite you can explore all the interesting combinations of salt, sweet, and umami. Most importantly, the fish is always fresh and service is friendly.

Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of their sushi. For some reason, the vinegar taste is very strong in the rice (which holds up well in a poke bowl, but not in a maki roll). Furthermore, I really hate the drops of sriracha mayo that sushi joints often include on their rolls. Having visited Japan recently, I know that this distracts from the integrity of the fish. 

Overall, this is a bittersweet review for me because I love that poke has finally come to Pittsburgh, and I should be thankful that Mt. Everest has undertaken that bold move. Unfortunately, while the bowls are delicious and incredibly affordable, the sushi here needs some work."}
{"text":"Popped in and ordered some rolls, doughnuts and sashimi. Best since my trip to Japan a few months ago. The chef brought a taster of his own tuna bowl recipe. It was great!"}
{"text":"Wow, this may be my new favorite lunch spot. I got the tuna poke bowl and it was amazing. All of the flavors meld so well together with the sushi rice and salad and tuna. My friend got the tuna tacos which she also said were amazing. And the price is so reasonable. I couldn't even finish my meal.  There's a little bit of spice, which was just perfect for me. 
Also, it's very unassuming from the outside and even the first floor, so there weren't a ton of students lined up to order. There is some seating upstairs. You can order to go out in and they will bring your food upstairs to you. It is definitely the best sushi I've had in Oakland. 5 delicious stars."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch early on Saturday afternoon. We ordered sushi tacos, sushi doughnuts an Everest roll and some nigiri sushi. 

When ordering be careful to check the quantity. The doughnuts and tacos come in pairs. We ended up with way to much food. 

They tacos were served up first. The were excellent. The guacamole was super fresh and the combo of fish, veggies and guac blended together perfectly.  

Next up was the Everest roll and the nigiri.  The roll was just ok.  Nothing bad, just your typical sushi roll. The nigiri on the other hand was melt in your mouth amazing.  We only had salmon and tuna sushi but it was on par with anything I've had and I've had tons.  

Next up the sushi doughnuts.  It's hard to explain what they are. Just look at my pictures.  They were hard to eat because they fell apart when you bit into them. They tasted amazing, just a little messy. 

The only strike against this place is the decor. It's not very nice inside. The upstairs ceiling had wires hanging  from it and it was beat up looking.  It was not dirty. It was just the absolute minimal effort to make it work.  It is Oakland so I'll give the decor a pass, student tend to be a little destructive.

All in all this is an excellent sushi place. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Resturant run by Brothers from Tibet. Super fresh and delicious Poke bowls. We came back for more the next day."}
{"text":"I got the salmon Poke bowl and it was easily one of the best meals I've had in a while. The salmon was perfect, the spicy crab was delicious, the seaweed salad was amazing. The blend of veggies on top of the rice was well mixed. Not to mention, the presentation was flawless. 

The two people behind the counter were very busy, but they made it work without being visibly burdened. They were extremely nice to everyone who walked through the door. They were also patient even though they had a lot on their plates. 

I will definitely be here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"AmaIng spot. Very nice people, always treat us nice and are very fast. Fresh and yummy. Love the sushi taco. Definitely the spot to eat sushi in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We ordered donut sushi and mount Everest. Both were so good! We got it for delivery and it got to us easy and fresh! One order of donut sushi gets you 2 donuts."}
{"text":"This is the best poke bowl I've ever had!! The view from upstairs is pretty nice too! Really appreciated the abundance of outlets near tables so I could charge my phone while I ate!"}
{"text":"Although I was very, very sad to see sushi boat go, I'm glad it was replaced by Mount Everest sushi! I came here on one of the first days they were open. The owner, Kelsang, was so incredibly friendly - he offered me a free drink and made me a sushi taco to try as well. I've tried both their poke bowls and sushi rolls here, and you can tell how much care he puts into preparing each one. They're presented beautifully and the poke bowls especially are huge portions for the price. Tons of fresh fish, rice, and other toppings. My only complaint is that there's a little too much going on for the poke bowls and sushi. Still, definitely going to become my go to spot for sushi in Oakland!"}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant I have ever had in Pittsburgh!! I really love their poke bowls, their rolls also look very creative.
I've heard their sushi donuts are also famous, will try them next time!"}
{"text":"Yesssss they made the prettiest sushi in Pittsburgh. I love food art! This review is for their poke bowls. Lately I've been very into poke bowls, so I've decided to try their tuna poke bowl. They change it every once in awhile I think (?) but mmm the tuna bowl is so worth it! Their house made sauce is very yummy and everything just blend well together. I like my poke bowl certain way so I will ask the chef if he can add some extra stuff like jalepeno in there or mango. He always is happy to accommodate, it's a little extra but I am glad to pay it. It is very fulfilling, I am full every time. 
I haven't tried their sushi yet, that's next on my list. Also their sushi donuts look so beautiful I want to try that next as well. I will update my review once I do :) but if you haven't tried it, please dooooooo you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to eat good sushi for a reasonable price. Best place I've found. Chef is extremely kind and talented. I'd suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"The best poke place in Pittsburgh for sure. Fortunately for me it's in Oakland so I'll be sure to come often. Been here about 5 times so far and the salmon poke bowl has stood out the most to me so far as a favorite, using more traditional poke bowl toppings. Though their quality of ingredients makes their menu great in general."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the small/sketchy appearance when you first walk in. They actually have a pretty decent seating area upstairs. You order your food at the counter in the entrance and can then head upstairs to enjoy

I had the salmon poke bowl, and I thought it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I called to order and as busy as they were (everyone was scrambling around trying to get orders done), they had my order done in the ten minutes from when I called to the time it took me to walk over there! It's pretty impressive considering their phones were ringing off the hook order after order.

I ordered 2 house special pok√© bowls and an order of sushi tacos (which came with 2 tacos) and miso soup. They've raised their prices a bit since I've been there last and compared to the menu photos here on yelp so it's a little more pricey (I think my total came to around $41) but still, you get a ton of sashimi and it tastes super fresh. They were all packed with sashimi, especially the sushi tacos, it was amazing. Delicious too!"}
{"text":"Food: pretty typical sushi, nothing very special, small roll for the price of it

Price: the rolls were a little pricey for being so small 

Service: food came very quick and employees are friendly

Seating/atmosphere: decent amount of seating (most of it is upstairs), clean, not very fancy 

Miscellaneous: I have heard people rave about the poke bowl, so I think I need to try that! It is possible that the sushi wasn't as great quality because I got there around an hour before close."}
{"text":"I just finished playing workout and needed a protein boost! I ended up getting the salmon sushi bowl with a friend. There was so much to enjoy in the bowl. I definitely didn't want it to be too salty with my hypertension issues so I was glad it wasn't an issue. The ingredients are raw so don't be alarmed. I was skeptical but I was full and replenished afterwards. Imitation crab, salmon, and edamame with rice did the job for me! Plenty of greens as well for the health conscious folk in the yelp community. It is a bit pricey but I can't complain too much. I definitely wouldn't be able to make it myself lol."}
