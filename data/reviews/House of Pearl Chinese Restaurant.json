{"text":"Nice looking restaurant inside but could use some music. Kinda that awkward quiet. But on to the food. Started with pot stickers, veggie spring and egg rolls, as well as some soup. ..all amazing and wonderful.  We were off to a great start. Then the main courses came. One with beef and the other with chicken. Bad. They were aweful. I couldn't even eat more than one bite of the beef. So bland and bad. The chicken was over cooked and just tasted wrong. I would come here again but only for the appetizers! Never a main course!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I tried the lemon chicken and it was way to greasy and 90% breading. The second time I tried the chicken and broccoli , it was ok .. My last trip I had the orange chicken and it was very flavorful. The wonton soup is so tasty. The staff is super friendly and they seem to have a lot of regulars which is a good sign!"}
{"text":"We gave this place 4 chances. One Friday evening it was great.  Other 3 times were dry, raw, cold vegetables with dry chicken and warm sauce over.  I don't believe any of it ever saw the inside of a wok.  Even the rice was dry and cold. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"So good! Clean, friendly and amazing Chinese food. Their wonton soup is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  Service was great, portions huge, soup was good but after that it was all down hill.  The egg roll was mushy inside and lacked any flavor.  Then the main course arrived and my husband ordered a shrimp and broccoli dish, can't remember the name.  It was like eating raw garlic, no other flavors but garlic.  One bite is all he could do.  I love garlic and tried it and couldn't stomach it. My Kung Pao chicken had no flavor but peanuts. I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even my enemy."}
{"text":"Excellent !!  I have never dined in but always get take out.   They are always friendly and super nice and the food is nothing short of the best Chinese around.  Its always fresh and hot.  Consistently good for the past 7 years I plus I have been going here.   Sweet and Sour chicken overflows the top of the container and is really a huge portion.   Wonton Soup is really good and is full of wonton's from the bottom to top.  Sweet sauce for chicken is perfect."}
{"text":"Good sit down Chinese restaurant with food served on real plates. Casual, but clean. Great service, but I would expect that since I was the only eat - in customer the hour I was there on a Thursday night . Quite a few walk-ins for take out, but no others eating there. All food is served mild, but they ask if you want it medium or hot spicy. Portion was way more than I could eat and they didn't skimp on the meat."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken to go after work . There was a lot of food but the chicken was dry and hard to chew. The fried rice was very good."}
{"text":"This place was a very pleasant surprise.  Ambiance is average but food is great!  Wonton Soup seemed very authentic, had scallions and strips of pork - awesome!!!!  Lo mein was great and was not greasy - that is rare.  I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"House of Pain had a Bad start. Thought it was good we had American server so no language issue. But the ordering was never more difficult!! Guess you can't upgrade to fried rice.. it \"cost too much\" and \"vegs won't fit into bowl\".  Server was salty, & non-flexible on any modifications.  And couldn't describe their 8 jewel sauce ..it was \"impossible\".  
Returned the paper-wrap chicken, it was burnt to the aluminum foil. Had it taken off bill. They said the wrap was too dry. Fried rice tasted kinda burnt like the oil was over fried past smoke-point.  We were not pleased on this Mothers Day meal."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Brunswick. We've been coming here for 20 years and my dad has been ordering the same exact meal for 20 years (I believe it is the Hong Su Chicken). I like to change it up a little myself.

The crab Rangoon is amazing, the fried rice is excellent, and the Hot & Sour soup is great. I have also thoroughly enjoyed pretty much all the dishes I've tried. It's great for take-out, in fact, I have never even dined in the restaurant. Now that I think of it, I'm not sure I've ever even seen anyone dining in the restaurant, everyone orders takeout.

By the way, if you order the dinner combination platter, it could probably feed 3-4 people by itself. The dinners are great for sharing. If each person gets their own, you will be eating the leftovers for 4 days, and they don't re-heat very well."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food and a big varied menu.  Lots of different dishs with an emphasis on veggies.   There is a combo upgrade for $1.50 with egg roll and pork fried rice.  And a complete meal with won ton soup, bbq rib, egg roll and pork fried rice for $4.50 more.   Most meals are $8.95 to $11.95.  They have specials for $11.95 that have everything.   You will need some time to figure out the menu. 

Ok the food. Tried the pupu sampler with teriyaki beef, bbq ribs, shrimp toast, crab Rangoon and egg rolls.  It comes on a wooden veggie tray with a flaming mini grill! ! It's as good as it looks cool (see picture). I tried 8 jewel chicken (mushrooms, water chestnuts, baby corns, celery, peanuts, cashews, carrots, green pepper and brown sauce!  It looks good and tastes better. Very unique dish.  The shrimp egg foo young was average, needs more flavor.  The fried rice was another thing that could have got more flavor.

  That's why we are at three stars.   It should have been higher, but is worth another stop.   Try the specials,  or more unique dishes.  Going safe here does not pay!  But go and try it out is good restaurant.  Total bill for two $32 with app and two dinners."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but in the last 6 months its gone down hill quick.  The egg rolls are mushy, the Ribs taste like they had been sitting around for days, the Sweet and Sour Chicken was greasy, and the won ton soup was tasteless.  Like I said this place used to be great, I'll probably try them one for time before I write them off."}
{"text":"My wife and I are those two lonely people sitting in a side booth when you come in for your take-out order.  We usually go early on Saturday or Sunday and always end up getting the $10.99 specials with Won-Ton soup, egg roll, fried rice, and a chicken entr√©e.  The soup is great, the egg roll good, but the chicken is not the best Asian food that I have ever eaten (too much under cooked broccoli) but they give you enough for three meals and it tastes better after you take it home and heat it up.  The service is very friendly if not super efficient.  I like the way that they pack up your left overs for you instead of tossing you a box and having to do it yourself."}
{"text":"For the last 20 + years this was the go to spot for good Chinese food in Brunswick. Unfortunately new ownership has taken over the restaurant. I was willing to give the new owners a couple of shots at earning my business. Unfortunately, the food quality was subpar on both occasions. Needless to say I will be looking for a new go to spot."}
{"text":"it seems like so many people like this place, i just wish i did too because the prices are great and portions are generous. thats as far as the compliments will go from me though. my mom loves this place, but i got the general's chicken and first of all, the packaging is just off-putting, it's totally ghetto, why are you putting chinese take out boxes in plastic bags?? it's so bizarre. secondly, the taste, i don't even know what to say, i didn't know you could mess up general's chicken but apparently you can, the sauce it was in tasted like a hint of windex mixed in with orange chicken, ew. and orange chicken and general's chicken are two very different things so i was disappointed it tasted so unlike general's. we also ordered the crab rangoons and they were overdone, burnt and overcooked, yuck. overall i think there are some good items on this menu, none of which i personally order though. like i said my mom loves the egg foo young and she likes the spring rolls, so obviously there are some good items at the house of pearl, but i don't order those items. if you're looking for not-ghetto packaging and good general's chicken and good crab rangoon, go to wild fusion up the street."}
{"text":"we have never had a bad meal from House of Pearl..  just the right amount of spice when you order mild medium or spicy...   we don't go as much anymore because we moved farther away.. we do miss them... very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food is spotty but service is good. Kung Pao was nice and spicy, on request. Another time, the fried rice tasted funny. Sad. They never seem to do much business, at least when I'm there. I've stopped patronizing this establishment, unfortunately, as the quality of food declined a little too much. Also I noticed an unusual smell. Not a nice thing to notice in an eating establishment."}
{"text":"Not good. The place has changed. We stopped in and the food was not good. The egg rolls were crispy outside mushy inside no flavor. My chicken had a sour taste.  I asked them to take it back.  They gave me the bill for $11 for chicken that shouldn't be eaten.  Too many good places to eat to have bad chicken"}
