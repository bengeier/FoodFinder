{"text":"Small little place for take outs only. Very clean and fresh place. Delicious variety of South Indian food and desserts. A must try. Amazing prices. You can place an order over the phone or in the store. Though everything we ordered was great tasting, their Rasam was not so great. It was decent. Overall the dosa, coconut chutney, mendu vada, patties were good."}
{"text":"Tamil fast food place! It's definitely way cheaper than most places in Scarborough. This place is vegetarian hence if you're craving for Tamil food usuals like mutton rolls or meat curries, this isn't the place to go. Great service, super cheap and very clean place! I'm impressed!!"}
{"text":"Great place for value-for-money food. It doesn't have any seating area - just takeaway. However, the quality of food vs the price is a great deal. I loved their upma, idli and vada in particular. The food may not be hot always but still tastes great.  There are other Indian (particularly South Indian) dry snacks available at this place. I've never tried them but should be good.  There is good amount of parking outside the place which is shared by all the shops in the plaza. Generally, it is available though."}
