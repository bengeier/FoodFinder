{"text":"This place was a huge let down. Took my friend there for her birthday because we wanted to try something new and to start the service wasn't stellar. The waitress we had was pleasant enough but we waited such long stretches between drinks appetizers and meal that it felt like she forgot about us. Two couples at the next table were forgot about completely by her after they got their drinks and waited almost 40 mins for her to come back. They were our entertainment as we waited over an hour and a half for our food as they contemplated leaving in anger. When we finally got our food we only had one request that my friend get some mayonnaise for her burger. My friend waited 20mins for the waitress to grab mayo for her burger so she could eat it. By the time the waitress remembered (which she told us she forgot even though we just said it) my friends food was cold alongside bland. I understand mistakes happen but we tried to flag her down several times but she was too busy chatting up here coworker. Seems like an odd thing to do for so long when you say you're understaffed. The food was lack lustre and over priced. Our appetizer was calamari which without the questionable sauces, had no seasoning. My friends burger was 17bucks with fries and was bland and as she put it \"really dry and  not all that special\". My chicken and donuts was the highlight of the night which tasted great resulting in the whole party picking off my plate because their meals underwhelmed. I ended up picking up the check for myself and the birthday girl, at about 75bucks plus the tip that I still gave despite the poor service. Normally I am a huge tipper at 30% if the service is good, sometimes more of it's great but this time I threw a 5 down on the table and ran out the door never to return. The only way I would go back would be to get the chicken and donuts, through a drive through window."}
{"text":"I guess when a place is just getting started it's not going to be amazing off the hop. The prices and service was somthing to be desired at this location, the lack of a drink menu on new years eve was a bit disconcerting. Portions were pretty much the only thing rescueing this spot from a 1 star rating. Shame.... but i'll try again in 3 months and see if it gets better!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to make of this.  It's a sports bar that has a menu like a gastropub.  None of the usual sports bar foods, but that was fine with me since they apparently make everything in house.  As a test, I started with the French Onion Soup, since many places use a sodium bomb of powdered mix that is nearly inedible.    Being made in-house was a surprise in that the soup bore no resemblance to the industrial mix, but it was a letdown regardless.  The broth was watery and lacking in flavour, with very little actual onion, and was warm, but not hot.  For the main, I ordered the Seafood Coconut Curry, listed as \"Shrimp and haddock braised in a green coconut curry served over basmati rice and veggies\".  There was no shrimp at all, and that was easy to confirm because the appetizer sized \"bowl\" was less than an inch deep, for $17.  The haddock was overcooked, and even though the sauce was lacking in flavour, it still had a perfect spicy heat to it.  My dinner guests had the Perogies and the Pan Fried Tilapia Tacos.  The perogies did get a good review, and I had a chance to taste the tacos which were also quite good.  The main problem with all the meals were the sizes. The 3 mini tacos were appetizer sized at a price of $16.  The perogies were the best value at $12.  $65 later, after tiny portions of lukewarm, flavour deprived food, we left almost as hungry as we entered.  I would have thought that being open for over two weeks, the kinks would have been ironed out.  I would normally go back later for a second try but I'm not motivated.  I could chalk up the poor execution to growing pains, but the tiny portions for premium prices is a conscious decision."}
