{"text":"The only pizza place we order from in the south of Calgary! Sure delivery takes an hour in peak time but we only order on weekends so we expect it and plan for it. Busy is a good sign that they serve good food! Drivers are always polite, the food is great and exactly what you order is exactly what shows up. Oh yeah, and they don't skimp on FRESH toppings. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Have ordered literally dozens of pizzas from here over the years & they have always been great! Caesar salad is very good - as are the hot wings. Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer, but quality takes time. Pizza is loaded with toppings & flavorful cheese. It really fills you up. Costs a bit more but really worth it as it goes a lot farther. They will soon (Jan.  be moving to other side of MacLeod Trail ( still on Bannister Road ), but I will follow them! Amier & Moe are great people who work their butt's off in there!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but expect to wait if you order during peak times. I was told it would take 45 mins for 2 small pizzas and an order of wings. It took over an hour, granted the order was placed at 530 pm on a Friday. There were 6 other people waiting for their orders when I arrived. If you order during busy times, I'd recommend adding an extra 10~15 minutes to your wait time."}
{"text":"Sammy's does donairs best.  Their sweet sauce is so good I always get extra,  as well as with their donair fingers! I love all their sides and the pizzas are always very filling.  And bonus the owners are awesome guys! The new location is also quite large and extremely well done!"}
{"text":"Awful!! I heard about this place n I thought I should try it..I wish I didn't  Chicken donair was basically lettuce sandwich with a few pieces of chicken, pizza was too greasy, in fact it's a cheese pie and above all it's too pricy for the quality $17 for 2 chicken donair n 14.80 for medium cheese pizza, I could have bought 2 XL 4 topping pizza from dominos or papa jones. Never going again."}
{"text":"Just an average pizza joint. Incredibly salty meats too. Definitely much better places out there, and for the same price or cheaper."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area.  Locals rave about this place.  I ordered  it in September  and it was brutal.  The crust waaaay waaay under cooked.  It was gummy.  I threw it in the oven at home which helped drastically.  After telling the few people that recommended Sammy's about our experience they couldn't  believe it. Blah blah blah...\"i cant believe it\"...blah blah blah... well, we figured we must be wrong about this place and we were guilted into trying it again.  We ordered it again last night as everyone says \"Sammy's is the best\" well...same chewy under cooked disappointing pizzas.  The kids pepperoni Pizza may not of hit the oven longer than a couple minutes as the crust was stretching out like the cheese.  I am realizing  that people  in this area don't  leave this area so they don't  know any better.   I am grabbing Pizza from two different Pizza joints in town and hosting our friends tonight so they can eat good Pizza.  Attention entrepreneurs...there is an opportunity for a top notch Pizza joint in the area.  There is definitely a gap in the pizza market here.  The Caesar Salad earned the overall review of 2 stars.  Pizza  gets 1 star after we cooked it for another 15minutes in our oven at home."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. Been going here since I moved to the south five years ago. Prices are reasonable, toppings are generous, service is great."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza. Have been ordering from here for years, longer than I can remember, definitely more than five years. I always pick up since I live nearby and the service is always great with pizzas cooked on time, or just about to come out of the oven.   Warning, pizza will be hot enough to burn legs if you place the box on your lap in the car, but it's worth it for the perfectly melted cheese (which is placed on top of the toppings to hold everything to the crust, this helps to avoid getting all the toppings in one single bite and then having plain pizza dough left...if that sort of thing bothers you, then order from Sammy's)"}
{"text":"We recently moved down south from the 17th ave area and were glad to discover Sammy's pizza. I thought this was the land of Pizza 73 out in the suburbs and would be stuck with bad pizzas as a trade-off. The delivery driver Ryan helped us out with another pizza we wanted after he arrived, he headed back and fit this into his rounds and we had our extra pizza before the first one was even done. It's a nice deep dish style with generous cheese and toppings, getting customer service over and above this gives it an A+ grade from me."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that it's the world's greatest pizza unless I happen to be an intense globetrotter like Carmen Sandiego where I have actually tried pizza from other locations in the world (I hear the pizza in Siberia, is how you say...COOL...hahaha... *cough*). But I would say Sammy's certainly beats many pizza places in Calgary alone.  We've ordered pizza from here several times since Sammy's isn't a dine-in restaurant. It is located just off MacLeod Trail nearby Humptys. The price is fair, compared to most pizza joints where for the same amount of money, you get dis-formed regurgitate tasting pizza that a kindergarten child can easily draw with a set of crayons.  We've ordered several styles of pizza from Sammy's ranging from meat lovers to veggie lovers. But I must admit, I didn't fully appreciate their level until I tried their cheese pizza. It was hot, fresh, and the cheese was cooked so that you can enjoy the luscious melted texture, while you get the occasional pleasant surprise of the salty-bitter burnt fromage crust.   Did I just sound like an uptight gourmet reviewer who just spazzed over a simple piece of pizza? The child in me weeps at what I have become."}
{"text":"Great pies! Love the rest of the menu too. Wings and wraps are taste."}
{"text":"Sammy's consistently delivers quality pizza in a timely fashion, and honestly, consistency in Calgary is key. They make a great pizza. The crust always has that light buttery consistency, the toppings are always fresh, and the sauce has a tanginess that is somewhere between sweet and tart--making a great pizza when put in combination.  I've only ever tried their vegetarian, and I have to say that 9/10 I don't appreciate large pieces of tomato added to the top of my pizza. It's weird to me. I want things contained by cheese. Call me OCD, but it's just how I feel. In the case of Sammy's, however, the tomato seems to blend with everything else. Well done. It's actually pretty impressive."}
{"text":"Their name is not a gimmick, they are simply the best! Beautiful crisp, thick crust with all the toppings underneath the cheese.  The only thing better than the pizza is the staff! Donairs are delicious as well but you gotta try the pizza.  Always a great experience, an absolute MUST-TRY!"}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing pizza! This place is awesome! Right from when I walked in and saw the vibe, people were anxious for their pizzas, I could see it in their faces. Once I got my pizza, I couldn't wait to get home. I ate a slice in the parking lot. All I can say is pizza is my favorite food and this is on my Top 3 in Calgary."}
{"text":"We tried the Reuben pizza and the donair pizza. Both were really tasty, but the pizza style is quite bready so if you normally eat 3-4 slices, prepare to eat half that with these pizzas! They don't keep well in the fridge after 2 days so don't order too much. Otherwise, not a bad deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Sammys! I had heard about this place before and I just had to try it! The sign says \"Sammy's worlds greatest pizza\" A little bit of a bold claim wouldn't you say? Hahaha  but it was definitely a quality pizza with all bases covered. Good crust, good sauce and fresh toppings!   I would describe sammy's Pizza as Quasi deep dish( like pizza hut style but a little sturdier and less greasy with overall better quality) I really liked the cheese pizza we got! It seemed to be a mix of cheddar and mozzarella and the cheese got all crusty and crispy and delicious! the pizza crust was really good and had good flavour and texture!! The sauce was classic americana! Had that deep stewed tomato flavor with a nice herbal flavor (oregano-ey) I rather liked it! Overall the cheese pizza greatly pleased me and I would certainly get it again.  The vegetarian pizza was really good but lacked a bit of flavor. The veggies were a little watery and had no seasoning on them so the balance was a little bit off I must applaud the quality of the toppings overall,they just needed a little more punch. Each piece had a big old slice of fresh tomato which was very nice and a nice contrast to the cheese! So even though the veggie was a little bland it was quickly doctored by a little hot sauce!   I am definitely gonna come back here again! A lot of pie left to try! Next time MEAT is on top! Can't wait!  Sammy's definitely had some pizza mojo going on! but as for being the \"worlds greatest pizza\"??? Well I will let you decide! Check it!"}
{"text":"Sad to say this was the worst pizza I've ever had. The donair was so bad i threw the entire thing out."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Sammy's the past few years, more than five. Once I had a party at my place and I ordered about 10 pizzas and it was awesome. I spoke to the owner and he arranged everything, it went over without a hitch and my guests were happy to experience the taste that is Sammy's pizza in South Calgary.   As the years went by, I began ordering Sammy's less and less since the crust was too tough/crispy/hard for me! But then I discovered the donairs. Good donairs and then when I was doing a wheat-free challenge and super hungry and in the mood for a donair but not wanting the wheat in the pita ... I ordered the donair salad.   It seemed simple, and it really is just iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, some onion, banana peppers and some sauce with the donair pieces on top .. but the taste was awesome. So good. Really just like a donair but without the pita. I ate it all and was totally satisfied. Perhaps the salad is a bit on the small side, perhaps it's priced a little higher than I think it's really worth .. but it's really good. Definitely worth trying. The flavours mingle together perfectly, the sauce is great, everything is FRESH ... so four stars. No problemo.   Is Sammy's really the world's greatest pizza? That's funny and it's cute .. perhaps it's the world's greatest pizza for someone. Perhaps they need to get out more. But seriously, Sammy's is good. It'll knock some of your socks off. Try it at least."}
{"text":"Omg the best for thick crust! I had their four cheese and fries. And I never usually like crust on pizza but this one I only wanted to eat the crust because of the crispy cheese on top and perfect crispy cheese on the crust. French fries were seasoned well and dip it with the cheddar chipotle sauce - so bomb. I am normally a floppy thin crust pizza but this one was addicting"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from the states and rented an AirBNB for a few days. Once getting in we were famished and decided to \"just order a pizza\" - \"any pizza\". Pizza is pizza, right? Wrong. We chose Sammy's due to the reviews. They did not let us down! With two medium pizzas, he and I ate for 5 days/meals. The crust is outstanding- the sauce and toppings--- PERFECT!! We had traditional pepperoni- best pepperoni I've ever had on a pizza. The other was their new Ruben Pizza. Oh. My. Goodness! The meat was so incredibly tender and the mustard sauce was ridiculously satisfying. We ate it for dinner one night and lunch for four days after. Such a filling meal. Extremely tasty! I wish we had Sammy's in the U.S.! Also, notably- The gentleman who delivered our pizza was super nice and was precisely on time. Only took just over an hour on a weekend evening! (Peak time) Thanks you guys for making us some delicious grub!! Cannot wait to travel back to order again!"}
