{"text":"I been eating here  for years and only order one thing. the  chef special.    


Comes with shrimp tempora, miso soup, salade, hand role, California roll, salmon sashimi,  congee.  Tofu and soup 


Take out does not include ice cream,  edamame


Small place , basic service and ambience. 


Great for a cheap sushi  fix.   Nothing more nothing  less.

This is  low variety menu choices and menu photos are different than what you may receive.   So order only the chef choice.  If hi don't like the atmosphere get take out!"}
{"text":"Let me just start with a friendly warning: do not bring your date here on a first date (expecially if they are claustrophic).

I'll be blunt. The interior is definately not going to wow anyone so if you are the type to visit an eatery for both the food and ambiance, you are probably better off somewhere else. In fact you might even be tempted to get up and leave after being seated if you don't receive a warning. The restaurant is very small and every possible inch is filled with tables. There is no privacy  first because the tables are so close to each other and second because the restaurant is so small the chef can probably hear every single conversation going on in the room without moving from his spot behind the sushi bar. But don't let the decor scare you from giving this cozy little joint a try. 

The food itself was alot better than I thought it would be. I ordered the sashimi and udon lunch combo. The udon was made perfectly. The texture was just the right amount of chewyness. The sashimi was fresh. However, you should note that when ordering any of the sashimi combos, you are probably going to be getting all salmon sashimi even though the picture shows a variety of fish. This restaurant seems to only offer salmon for sashimi, which I'm fine with since I only eat salmon anyways.  

 Here's a tip: they let you order from the lunch menu even if it's after lunch hours! This is probably one of the reasons I will continue to visit this joint. Another reason because of the free appetizers! Appetizers consisted of: a small portion of salmon tempura(when i say small i mean small!), congee, miso soup, salad, and edamane. The pictures that the other reviewers posted is a pretty good depiction of what you get. 

The service is what you would expect at any other small sushi restaurant. There is only one server who also acts as the cashier. This makes sense, I don't think there would be room for any more people working at this restaurant. Speed of service was also quite fast. 

All in all, I will definately be coming back here for quick and cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Lousy Japanese food in a desolate corner location. The menu itself are all wrinkled and faded. The shrimp tempura was really skinny and over fried. Sushi, awful fish-to-rice ratio. Large rice and small fish slice on top. The actual food looked nothing like the ones pictured on the menu. Fresh salmon, though. Authentic Japanese food is what Toronto is lacking!

Service was fine, i tipped them fairly."}
{"text":"Very, very generous portions. Most free appetizers I've gotten at a sushi place. 10$ will have you satisfied. Salmon sashimi seems to be of good quality. Most of their menu items revolve around salmon."}
{"text":"I love going to this place when I crave for Sushi, their price is really cheap and their sushi is always fresh. I don't really mind the tiny interior as i actually enjoyed their intimacy."}
{"text":"this place shouldnt be open tbh. you really get what you pay for. service is whatever, food is surprisingly disappointing and doesn't live up to the photos shown on the disgustingly wet, taped up and oily menu. if your food isn't good, at least make the presentation of the bento (what I got) look like a bento instead of serving all the sides separately. never ever again"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place and will let everyone I know not to go...  

Do not be fooled by the pictures on the menu because the food you're actually getting are totally different...  My boyfriend & I ordered a chirashi sushi combo and a sashimi sushi rice at $7.95 each, however, all we got was salmon sashimi and rice with a salmon skin (??) handroll and one soggy tampura shrimp on the side... 

You might think their price are cheap but if you really think about it, by paying $2 extra at any other decent japanese restaurant, you can get what you actually ordered with better quality, services and much more comfortable seating.

We totally felt like being robbed by this restaurant..."}
{"text":"When it comes to the atmosphere, I really enjoy this place. It is cozy and small, so some might find that it is cramped, but that's the way I like it. 

As a student, I'm always on a tight budget and that makes this place perfect, because I don't like spending a lot of money. You'll get a lot of small side dishes,so by the end of your meal, you are full. Because it is a small business, they can only give you side dishes on availability. If you like a variety of food, this isn't the place for you, but for me, it tastes home like and comforting

I've only ever seen one guy at the counter making sushi and he is really dedicated to his business, working all the hours that he can, and for that,  I like to come here to eat and support the business too."}
{"text":"It's one of my hang out place.  The reason is simple.  I can't find a lower cost, descent quality and make me full Jap restaurant other than this.  No matter what you order, each person always come with a soup, salad, congee, piece of fried fish and green peas.  The food is fresh and very staple quality.  Not much variety for the combo though and I don't think they have ever change their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem in the middle of Scarborough. Definitely one of the best sushi places in town. Humble, quaint, family run, authentic Japanese food. Large portions and numerous appetizers included. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If you have realistic expectation this is a great sushi place. I and my family have been a regular customer for 8 years now, coming here about 8-10 times a year. My son from his very young age loves the salmon sushi here and he is the main reason why we come. It is a small and packed place, reminding us of the typical dining environment in Korea, Japan, or Hong Kong. If you like this kind of ambience you will find it cosy, instead of crammed and noisy. The owner chef is a Korean and is very friendly and hard-working.

The sushi is more Korean than Japanese. As other posts mentioned, the starters of congee, salad, miso soup, and fish are very good. We always order J, O, and G (or rice with sashimi on the other side of the menu). The service is usually fast (almost like fast food restaurant :)) and quality is predictable. Just see every visit as a visit to an old friend and you will begin to love this place!"}
{"text":"I just ate here and I'm really disappointed. The photos displayed on the menu do not represent what you get at all. The sushi rolls are small and sloppy and have barely any filling, the \"sashimi\" is just salmon cut up into small chunks. They do give some tasty apps for free, so that's a plus, but the deceiving photos make the entire experience a let down."}
{"text":"Really small but cozy little restaurant. Menu is only one page...not much variety. They only seem to have salmon...nothing else. It's okay...free sides comes with a bowl of congee"}
{"text":"Overall, the place was okkk. The waitress was very kind; the sashimi I ordered was fresh, but the sushi could've been better. 

This may seem like a strange, wth idea but maybe the Korean food (which is actually on their menu) might be better since it's owned by Korean owners anyway. Haven't tried it though. XP"}
{"text":"If you want a cheap filling meal with not much expectation, Hanabi is the right place for you.

Hanabi is one of the longest standing Japanese restaurant in the area, used to provide cheap hearty meal, sadly, this place has gone downhill over the years.

The food here used to look like the pictures in the menu. Now they are very different, sometimes I can't  even tell if what I got is actually what I ordered. Each meal comes with miso soup, a small bowl of delicious congee(so good), small lettuce salad, some edamame and a piece of salmon tempura with tofu. That's a lot of appetizer, which make up for the not so impressive sushi, in fact their appetizers are my favorite part of the meal.

Since I only had $10.50 cash with me today I ordered a$6.95 California rolls with sushi combo. It was very filling. I got one salmon tempura hand roll, 6 pieces of cali rolls, 5 pieces of salmon sushi and 1 salmon tempura roll and salmon roll. As you can see in the photo, the fish/avocado in the rolls are very very tiny. The rolls don't look appetizing, as if the chef knows the people who come here are not looking for quality food, might as well not to put any effort in it. To be honest, the Cali rolls tasted bland, and very fishy from the tobiko. And seriously, make them look more like rolls, they are almost shapeless

I remember my first visit here being amazed by the price and good food. There's barely any change to the price here as the ingredients are getting more and more expensive now, decrease on food quality seems reasonable.

Food_ 2/5 for sushi and maki, the sushi from loblaws are actually better, sadly. 5/5 for the congee tho
Service_4/5 fast and quick
Enviroment_ 3/5 as I mentioned, this restaurant opened for a long time, it is old and tiny, tightly packed tables

I would come back, only when I don't feel like cooking. Good value, decent food, why not. 

Ps, cash only, there's an ATM in the convenient store few steps away. 
DO NOT expect the food to look like the pictures on the menu!"}
{"text":"Am sorely tempted to give this place a one-star, but figured that the service was quite good and so deserves at least one star more.

My family and I ordered the following: Two chirashi sets, one G set, and one H set. 
Despite the very different menu photos and presentation, we received the following (see photos). I'll let you be the judge as to the difference!

They literally all had the same things - the only sashimi they had was salmon, the roll and handroll had fried salmon, and there was a shrimp tempura and rice. The only thing different was the presentation; the chirashi had the salmon sashimi on the rice, Set G had it on the side, while Set H received everything separated in little compartments.

The rice was horrendous! I could take long-grain rice, heat it up, and it would still taste better than this. It was hard, tasteless, and there was even rice crisp from the rice cooker. They also added the same sickening sweet sauce to everything. The shrimp tempura was stale, and soggy (because of the sweet syrupy sauce).

That being said, they do provide a variety of appetizers. We received edamame, agedashi tofu (with the sauce), fried dumplings (also with the sauce), fried salmon (again with the sauce), congee, miso soup, and salad. The waitress was also very kind."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this restaurant. It isn't the flashiest and by all means, the interior looks insanely small. However, when I look for a restaurant to eat at, it usually isn't the atmosphere. I really like the small feel of this restaurant and the prices are very reasonable. ($5-$10 for a meal.) I go here pretty often as it's quite close to my house and it doesn't claim to be anything it's not. Cheap meals at a small restaurant. Very cramped. I would recommend going here for a quick lunch or to get take out. Not good for large groups (I've only ever gone in pairs.)"}
{"text":"I started coming here a couple of years ago when my high school was still around the area. My first reaction was how small the place was. I did have my doubts the first time I came here but I was pleasantly surprised by how much food they give you for the price you pay.
My regular order is the bulgogi set. When you dine in, it comes with miso soup, salad, a hand roll, tofu, a shrimp tempura, a salmon tempura, congee, edamame, and green tea ice cream for dessert. But when you order take-out you only get the soup, salad, hand roll, and shrimp tempura for the same price which kinda sucks. I've also tried the udon and short ribs before. The udon is nothing special but the short ribs on the other hand have a lot of flavour.
You can order from the lunch menu during dinner too, but it's $1 more per order. It's still cheap nonetheless.
This restaurant has maintained decent quality and pricing over the few years I've tried it, a great pick if you're looking for a cheap meal and you're not too picky about the restaurant atmosphere/ambience!"}
{"text":"Should have known better after looking at the rating on Yelp.  I was thinking to myself, the place is somewhat packed so can't be that bad.

Couldn't  believe my eyes when I got the food order.   So one would expect the food you order is not that far off from the pictures on the menu.

We first received some free miso soup in a good size Korean ceramic soup bowl for the table, portions of congee, along with small plate of free appetizer of edamame, tofu and deep fried salmon pieces... Which is what saved them from a zero star.

Chef's special is a complete disaster. Our fish assortment turned out to be just Salmon galore.  Chopped, not sliced salmon sashimi.  And that's the only fish we got.  Salmon, salmon, and more salmon.  Maybe should consider changing the name to Salmon paradise!?

And in terms of a roll... Is that even a roll!?  Or a mushed up rice with a piece of seaweed, garnished with a bit of fish roe!?  Oh boy...

Yea... For the experience...
We know to look for more reputable place next time.

Here are some pics of the menu versus what we got."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hanabi for many, many years and if there's one thing I love about this little Japanese/Korean restaurant it would be how consistent it is. You walk in and you can expect to see the owner/chef at the front making sushi - he's always pleasant and very polite! Their menu is fairly simple. You'll find a bunch of teriyaki and tempura with rice dishes, udon, as well as sushi/sashimi combos. Just keep in mind that the only sashimi they have is salmon despite what the photos show.

The awesome thing about this place is that after you place your order you will almost instantly get a bunch of appetizers on the house to start - miso soup, warm congee, salad, and a trio of tofu, edamame, and tempura-style salmon. I say instantly because they work very efficiently here!

Prices are so reasonable that you can overlook the fact that what you get will likely not exactly match what you see in the menu - but that's not necessarily a bad thing because I find the owner/chef is always generous with the servings. You definitely won't leave the restaurant hungry."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch! Service is good and owner is nice. I do agree the only down fall is that they do not have much variety of sushi, however what they have is good enough for my kids and I. The food is fresh and tastes great.

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Family run and very good service. The portions have been getting smaller and smaller over the years but you can tell that they're trying to make ends meet and still provide the best they can to the customer. 

Cheap, fast, and lots of side dishes. Owner is very kind."}
{"text":"Nooo...!  Not another uncaring, sloppy eatery with a chef in a Japanese sushi chef-like robe pretending to be a sushi restaurant! My hopeful dream of finding a gem in the rough in this hole-in-the-wall eatery was dashed soon after being seated.  The pictures accompanying the filthy, ancient menu were completely misleading.  The chirashi image on the menu showed glorious layers of salmon sashimi accompanied by loads of other fish.  The waitress informed us that the salmon was not nearly as numerous as the picture imagined and salmon was really the only fish available!  The california rolls that came with my set menu were lopsided, and thick with rice that were haphazardly and loosely wrapped around not-so-fresh avocado and fake crab.  I watched the 'chef' put together rolls behind his tiny counter, and was completely put off by how careless and inattentive he was to the quality of his work.  The chicken teriyaki looked dinky and unappetizing.  Free appetizers accompanied the meal.  However, they obviously had been sitting around too long - what was supposed to be crispy was soggy, congealed and cold.  

I don't understand why there is a line up for this place.  We came here for dinner because others come here for lunch and raved about how cheap and delicious the lunch menu was.  Maybe lunch is better, but I would definitely stay away for dinner!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my family. It was a favourite because the owner always gave large portions of food and often treated us with little snacks that were \"on the house\". About a year or two ago, the quality (and quantity) of the food went spiraling downhill so we stopped coming. The food was being made with significantly less care and it became especially evident in the maki rolls where the rice would fall apart and the pieces were inconsistent in size. 

Tonight my family decided to come back and give them another try and I'm glad we did. I love that after all this time, they still provide an assortment of complimentary dishes such as: congee, salad, edamame beans, tempura salmon, cold tofu, miso soup, and handrolls. Perhaps because it wasn't a busy night, the complimentary congee, miso soup, and udon all came steamy hot which was fantastic. Warning to first-timers though: the quality of the sushi/sashimi here is definitely on the lower end. Don't come expecting quality sushi because that's not what you're going to get and you're essentially setting yourself up for disappointment. In terms of variety, this store really only offers salmon. Not that salmon isn't delicious but even if you order \"chirashi\" which the menu photo depicts as an assortment of sashimi, you'll likely just get salmon sashimi. My parents and I ordered the \"Dinner for 3\" combo tonight which costed $39.99 and we left with full bellies and some extras to take home. So yea, I would likely come back again next time."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi restaurant. 

Rolls are made so sloppy, rice is messy and very little filling. Sashimi is cut in irregular shapes of different sizes. Deceiving photos on menu do NOT reflect what you actually get when you order. 
Don't waste your time and money here! It doesn't seem like the owners care or put any effort into their sushi at all."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know about Hanabi:

Salmon. 

That's all they have in terms of sashimi and sushi. Luckily for me, I love salmon which is why I come back from time to time. And I love the little sides that they give - and if you're lucky, you get green tea ice cream at the end. 

If you're coming here expecting more variety, you will be disappointed. If all you care for is salmon for a decent price, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Use to go here alot... haven't been here in 5 years and nothing has changed! Except the owner, he has lost a lot of weight! Poor guy. 8-9 years ago he was chubby and young and happy. I guess it's not easy to run a business.

It's hanabi .  U get what you pay for . It is quantity over quality. And the price is right

You get congee, soup, edamame, tofu, and fried fish to start . Just to start! 

I always get J or L . 
And I'm okay with just salmon . It's what I prefer anyways ."}
{"text":"This place is very cheap and decent sushi which is perfect if you're on a budget and craving some sushi! They give a lot of appetizers on the side and it fills you up. You can always call ahead and ask for \"take out\". The customer service is amazing. Worth coming to try!

The only downside is that they do not offer many choices on sashimi. It seems they only have salmon for everything (salmon sushi, salmon sashimi)."}
{"text":"Having grown up in this neighbourhood, I have witnessed the regression of Hanabi. When it first popped up, my brother held his birthday dinner there and the food quality and service was a solid 7.5/10 from what I recall, which is a decent score in my books. However, in the last five years the quality has drastically plummeted. The sauces taste like they came straight from the instant food packet and the ratio of protein to rice for the donburis has been disappointing. What sticks in my memory is a unagi-don that I ordered here. The dish was an unappetising artwork made of 99 percent rice and 1 percent eel marinated in a \"teriyaki sauce\" that tasted like honey. I would not recommend any of my friends to go here."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and the food is always good. I don't really care if the chef is Japanese or not to be honest- most Japanese places are run by Chinese people anyways. 

Food always comes in a timely manner, and quality is pretty good. I suggest the chef choice. For 9.95$ it is like a sampler or everything (tempura, sushi, sashimi, salmon teriyaki, hand roll with appetizers and dessert). The only weird thing is the congee that they provide with the traditional jap salad. Then we get beans and tofu and miso soup.

The quality is not top notch but good. I would recommend!

Chef is also super friendly. Only downside is the size of this place because it gets cold in the winter especially when people walk in and out!"}
{"text":"This place was old and dirty and only serves salmon with no other fish options. But you get what you pay for $."}
{"text":"Two words, quick and cheap.

A little place hidden in a plaza mostly of Asian restaurants.

Gets really busy during lunch, what do you expect? It's cheap and it's quick, that's what you want for lunch right? When you're in a hurry for lunch, they do it right. They allow you to order off the lunch menu during dinner also.

The sashimi, no matter what the pic shows, it's all salmon. The udon is nice and chewy. The side dishes is a bonus. The rolls are kinda sloppy and the California roll was a fake crab meat only. The tempura was nice and cooked inside and crispy on the outside.

it is what it is, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Was looking for the possibly cheapest sushi in the GTA and stumbled upon this place on Yelp.. according to other reviews, all meals come with tons of other sides, so I thought I'd try them out and see for myself.

It is a small place, with a small menu, combos don't cost any more than 11 bucks.

30 SECONDS after we placed our order all other appetizers started coming in, you would be almost full by the time your food comes! The meal is complete with dessert as well, which is a bonus!

Service is really fast, and friendly. I like the sides that comes with the combos, you do not leave hungry. Meal comes within minutes, so this place is good if you're in a rush!

Would definitely come back for cheap sushi. Quality is average, but you will not leave hungry, that's for sure. There's plenty of food for the price.

{"text":"I got sucked into the reviews. They said the portions were large. I got takeout. Wasn't very impressed. The prices are good for the pictures they have, but the food didn't match the pictures, so the prices didn't end up great. Quality was mediocre. Tempura was over battered. They only have salmon sashimi, and it's not cut very nicely. I got the kalbi box and the kalbi was boneless and tough. That's not kalbi. That's beef chunk. BAD. Never getting that again. 

Here's a plus though. In each of the bento boxes we got, there was a hand roll with cooked salmon in it. That was rather nice. All in all though, I still probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the very corner of the plaza, it looks undiscerning almost missable. The yellow lighting and old furniture and the very worn out faded menu didn't make things better. 

I settled on the tempura combo and my friend the charishi dinner. The charishi image on the menu had a variety of sashimi on top but the waitress had told us it was only going to be salmon... 

The miso soup comes in a large korean stone pot with tofu and bean sprouts, so it was a large portion. It also came with salad, edamame beans, congee and a plate of appetizers including tofu and some grilled salmon (which felt so cold and was definitely made a few hours ago) but the complimentary dumplings were good

The tempura combo came with california roll (which she was nice enough to leave out the roe for me) a decent amount of salmon sashimi, and a tempura hand roll (again the salmon was cold and soggy and was made hours ago) The tempura itself was not so great, the 2 shrimp were fine, the sweet potato was covered in very thick batter and didn't feel cooked through, the deep fried tofu again was so cold/pre-made. 

The servings were large and there was also complimentary ice cream at the end. The waitress seemed apologetic and probably knows the food isnt that great. Don't think i would return though..."}
{"text":"It's really cheap for a reason. They only serve salmon, which is fine. But I wish they executed it better in terms of presentation. Had small portions, but again. There's a reason why it's so cheap. Personally do not think I would go or recommend it as a place for someone looking for sushi."}
{"text":"If you are any of the below 3, this place would be for you!
a) Broke
b) Hungry
c) Am okay with OK food

I live around the area, so whenever I need a quick fix, I would go to Hanabi's. The owner is extremely nice, and works hard, but in terms of atmosphere, if you're expecting something high-end, please go elsewhere. The venue is pretty small, but enough for you and another person.

In terms of the food, they only have salmon, so don't expect anything outside of that. The food is, again, OK, but enough to satisfy your sushi craving. 

Beware, they only take cash, so make sure you have that moo-lah before going in."}
{"text":"this used to be one of my fav japanese restaurants for some rather good and cheap sushi (and other food). the korean owner and bald dude (that is the only way i can describe him LOL) are very nice and hardworking. i would always order the \"L\" lunch special which is the udon with some sushi. the food is great ya know. ain't too shabby for what it's worth and plus you get some complimentary congee (THE GOD DAMN BOMB HOLY HELL), salad (your typical japanese/korean salad), some miso soup, and a plate of edamame me, tofu and i believe shrimp tempura.. oh yeah the presentation for the sushi ain't the ABSOLUTE BEST (but they do taste rather good and plus it's only one person working on it so owner got it hard) 

now i actually haven't been here for like at least two and a half years and legit just went today and was quite sad at how bad it has gotten. i was absolutely disappointed with the congee as it was not as good as before and not even salty..the portions for the complimentary food has decreased (can't really blame them though..their business might not be doing too well since there are many other better-looking restaurants in the plaza) and the miso soup tasted bitter. i order the \"L\" meal set again and damn like it took FOREVER FOR MY FOOD TO COME LIKE come on udon doesn't take that long...over 30 minutes for food was a little much and they weren't as busy as they used to be too so like ?! at least the complimentary ice cream still taste the same :,( 

overall, im quite upset with how bad it has gotten .. the original owner (the sushi chef) still works here but the bald dude is no where to be seen  (might be day off or idk) and they seemed to have hired some new workers (they were chinese..maybe that was why the food was taking so long and why it tasted different..no shade to chinese ppl though HOMEGIRL is one of you guys but still idk)"}
{"text":"This sushi place I have seen around for years but never went in, since the storefront is super tiny. 

Pros: The couple that works there are so nice and friendly. The sushi combos are cheap and you get some cute appetizers for free.

Cons: The fish quality is barely sashimi grade. It's like AYCE salmon. The sweet sauce covering everything and oily tempura are also not great quality.

Overall, 4 stars because this is the definition of cheap comfort food. If you think sushi is too expensive to be comfort food? Well come here and experience this home-style cooking. Do not come expecting authentic Japanese flavour, but it's great for the price."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the heart of Scarborough.  Great lunch deals. Friendly service and the sushi chef is very polite and friendly.  A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem at Midland and finch plaza. Everything tastes fresh at a cheap price."}
{"text":"This place isn't a bad place, I eat here pretty often and i get a good experience out of it every time. People that deduct stars because the sushi rolls aren't cut perfectly or how its sloppy is pretty silly. 

This is a local sushi shop in Scarborough, you can't expect a 5-star experience out of it every single time you go. 

The food is pretty good for the price you pay, you get complimentary soup, salad, and congee. There isn't a lot of space so if you decide to go with a group, 4 would be your maximum. The chef, waitress and everybody else that works there works hard, its hard to run a small local business so cut them some slack."}
{"text":"Hanabi is my favourite a la carte sushi restaurant. 

Every time I want to go for sushi, I face a small decision paralysis. On one hand, I want abundance, both in food choices and volume. On the other, I don't want to shell out $25 for all you can eat. Yet on the other hand, most a la carte places run me up to around $15-$18. Hanabi fills this gap in price. A single meal is almost guaranteed to be under $10 here. The core serving sizes are not noteworthy, however they offer a line of complementary side dishes, ranging from miso soup to green tea ice cream. So now you have a cheap meal with a big serving size. To further illustrate the point, for the price of a Big Mac meal, I can get a bowl of udon, 6 rolls, a hand roll, and a bunch of freebies. 

Another great thing about this place is the friendly staff. The sushi chef, there is only one, is always friendly. Whenever you leave, he will always stop what he's doing and say a friendly goodbye.

My biggest criticism lies in Hanabi's offering. I'm all for a restaurant having a limited menu. I see this as a good thing, a reassurance that it's really good at a specific thing. However, ingredients is another ball game. I believe other fish were on the menu at some point in the past. However, now the restaurant serves only shrimp, crab, and salmon. When asked about their sashimi, they will tell you only salmon is available. 

Overall, I am a frequent customer and will remain one. Hope you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Waiting in line at a Wal-Mart purchasing clips to build a fort in my room later that night, we were getting hungry, we're an indecisive couple so we like to blackball cuisines and introduce criteria to narrow down our options. \"No burritos, no Chinese, no Korean, no purple foods...\", 10 minutes later in line we were still getting no where, our main qualifier was \"cheap\", so naturally we call up our good friend Jeff to decide for us.

Hanabi or \"Hanabu\" (several 8\"x11\" printouts of restaurant hours had Hanabu written on them) is a small Japanese restaurant hidden away in the corner of the Midland/Finch plaza, it was busy on a Saturday night like any restaurant should be and it being a small restaurant, we squished ourselves in the foyer with our girthy friend and another 6-10 people before we were seated. 

My girlfriend and I had ordered Bento Dinner meals while Jeff ordered the chirashi (probably the cheapest meal on the menu). Do not believe what you see on the menus, they are wildly inaccurate. Our bentos came in waves rather than in a bento box as shown on the menu, first the side dishes (miso soup w/ bean sprouts?, edamame, salad, a piece of salmon, and congee?), they were plentiful and tasted ok but some items were questionable for a Japanese restaurant. Next were the main dishes which came, the maki and sushi were of various shapes and sizes which may be attributed to the chef's zany sense of humour, and the handroll was drenched in teriyaki sauce, he must really like his sauce. The portion size was generous for the pricing so we thought we were done but 20 minutes after we had finished, 2 plates of wild tempura appeared! There were 5-6 pieces of mixed tempura along with a bowl of inverted rice which was enough for a small meal in itself. Finally, the night was ended with a scoop of green tea ice cream.

PROS:
-Cheap (we knew we could count on Jeff)
-Large portion sizes and variety for a bento

CONS:
-Maki rolls look like they were made one handed, like the chef was preparing them 2 at a time to be more efficient
-uncomfortable ambience, the tables are quite close together, chairs are akin to a food court, and some random old man sitting with his back to us kept turning and staring at our table the entire night

An OK place to fill yourself on the cheap if quality isn't a concern."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for a cheap sushi bento but the quality has really declined over the years. While they have kept the price low, the sushi that comes in the bento has been cut down to very small pieces, and the sashimi itself doesn't taste that fresh. The food itself is edible but it's not great. Sad to see the restaurant so empty but I don't think I'll be back anymore."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything when you come here. If you just want a decently priced and quick meal then this is the place to come. A lot of locals in the area come here. Also, pictures can be quite deceiving for the sushi/sashimi. I've been here many times now but the first time really shocked me. They only serve salmon. Whether it's for chirashi or the sushi meals. But otherwise, they give plenty for apps - congee, salad, miso soup, trio platter includding edamame, salmon tempura and cold tofu."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi place. Came here with family and we ordered the set for a family of four (with rice and beef), salmon sashimi, and eel rice.
They had a good set of starters which included edamame beans, chilled tofu, some tempura, salad, miso soup, and this really good congee. The food didn't take long to arrive after.
Their udon is good, but the mussel in it didn't taste very fresh, and the same goes for the sushi and sashimi. The eel rice was flavourful and it had a lot of sauce (maybe too much for my taste). 
For what you're paying, it's not a bad place, but I've had better sushi. Come here for lunch for better deals, but it wouldn't be my go-to sushi place for dinner."}
{"text":"Prompt and tasteful quantity! Owner is kind man and caters to my need since I was a child."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. To anyone who gave this place more than one star, have you eaten sushi before? Have you been to a restaurant before? I would love to visit whatever rock you're living under.
As soon as I sat down, I realized right away that this restaurant owner does not care about their business. The menus were disgusting and dirty to the point where it was hard to see what was in the pictures. My bf and I decided to get the chirashi because it seemed to have a good variety based on the photo but when we ordered, the lady told us they only had salmon. I actually had no idea what to say. As much as I like salmon, in what world is it ok to show a photo with about 5-6 different kinds of fish and then tell the customer you have NONE of those except one? Here's an idea, why don't you replace those filthy-looking menus and put pictures of what you actually serve. Anyways, I wanted to leave at that point but my bf says hey maybe the food will be ok. 
Yeah...no. So my bf's chirashi comes. Do you know what the word chirashi means? It literally means \"scattered\" so chirashi means that the ingredients are supposed to be scattered over a bed of rice. We were made aware that their only ingredient was salmon but still expected it to be a lot of salmon sashimi served over rice as shown in the photo. Instead my bf gets a few random pieces of salmon on rice, salmon skin hand roll, a maki roll and one sad shrimp tempura. I got a salmon set with udon and it was the exact same as my bf's minus a few nigiri. Seriously, what is with this place and salmon? We were even served salmon as an appetizer. Does the owner own a salmon farm? Who knows. 
So I sat there, eating my plain udon (it literally tasted like nothing, and my bf who eats udon at least 3x a week would not touch it after one bite) and staring up at a photo of all the different kinds of fish used to make sushi, as if the owner was telling me \"you want to eat this? Well here's some salmon\". I thought it was funny that they serve party trays as well. A party tray of only salmon sushi apparently.
The salmon nigiri was also so sloppily made. I just happened to watch a buzzfeed video last night about random people learning to make sushi and honestly, what they were able to achieve in one day looked better than what this shop owner made for us after years of running this place. As if our entire experience was not bad enough, the chef making the sushi also handled our cash. 
I had an iced coffee in the car and as soon as we were done eating, I drank all of it to get the taste of that meal out of my mouth. If you are so broke that you cannot pay $2 more for decent sushi, then don't eat sushi. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Please dont expect anything upon entering this place. With the way everything looks, its pretty darn old and rubbish. From the menu to the decor to the walls. Giving this place 4 stars because of the ff. 
price point is good. 
Food was fresh 
Lots of variety in combo
I had udon sushi combo $7.5 super full

Down side, salmon seems to be the only sashimi/ fish they have, i understand completely on where the guys coming from, he doesnt want waste and his store is too small for big fish like tuna snapper etc."}
{"text":"I've come here since high school, and now mainly just come when my mom or grandma want a quick super cheap meal. 

All their menu items are below $10 and all their sets come with some soup, edamame beans, fried salmon with sweet sauce, fried tofu, congee at lunch and green tea ice cream for dinner and a salmon hand roll.

Their menu items look like it comes with a variety of sashimi but it's really just salmon. Like all salmon. On the very rare occasion there may be one other fish but other than that it's always salmon.

I mean, it doesn't taste bad and you get a lot of free stuff for that cheap of a price! 
So it's great! But it's not very impressive/nice looking/high quality food."}
{"text":"Best friends and I have been coming here for years. One thing that weve noticed is that the size if the servings has gone down to the point that it doesn't even look like the picture. Was a little annoyed at first, still kept coming here, because you can't find another sushi restaurant that's better value than this."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a four star. I went here once or twice about 4 years ago, and just came back for dinner yesterday. 

Although the maki rolls are pretty much messy rolls, they are quite tasty. 

It's inexpensive if you want a quick bite, and they give many complimentary side dishes which is a plus! 

The deep fried salmon I ordered on the side because it was so good as a side dish. For around $3-4 bucks i got 6 pieces. 

You get ice cream too!! Tbh i'm picky when it comes to food sometimes but when the service is OK considering it was hard to communicate with the server she still smiled away & tried to understand us, and the food is good but presentation can be ehhh.. I don't really mind. The price wasn't bad either. 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Hanabi Sushi is a very simple little restaurant. I've been here a few times for lunch. The lunch combos are about $10/person.
most of the lunch combos come with a soup and salad and then on top of that you'll also get some appetizers including edamame beans, potato, and some sweet congee.
i think it's definitely worth the $10/person. though can be a bit hard to find. it's way deep in the corner."}
{"text":"The way to love this place is to keep your expectations realistic - we're talking about a less than $10 sushi meal, that will make you full. Are you looking for a fancy environment for a first date? Or perhaps beautifully plated sashimi? Or uni? No, go somewhere else. This is where you make plans with old friends for a quick bite, when you text and say \"din, midland/finch sushi?\" and they reply with \"cool bruh, omw\".

It's tiny. The seats are cracking, so if you're wearing short shorts, be careful. I always order \"J\" meal, which comes with tempura, a handroll, sashimi (8-10 pieces), maki (~ 6 pieces) and sushi (~6 pieces). The sashimi is never precisely the same quantity, but that's because not every piece is cut the same size. Just go with it! Sometimes it's all salmon, sometimes they have some tuna in it. It depends on their catch. This costs $9.95, and comes with appetizer of edamame, tofu, congee, miso soup and fried salmon belly. Excellent price for being completely stuffed! 

Oh, and that's also with green tea ice cream. 

Pro tip - it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, before i started yelping, I loved hanabi because you get your bang for your buck and I thought It was amazing ..that was before I knew better.

Coming back to reminisce my high school memories, I was utterly disappointed. Yelp had turned my taste palate into a diva ! 

Once seated and ordered, we were brought a dozen of starters like soup, salad, congee (random, I know!), fried salmon, tofu and edamame beans. Once my food came I understood why they gave away so much free apps.

On the menu, Order J looked like it had everything I craved: assorted sushi, sashimi, tempura , and maki rolls..... But what came on my plate was 8 pieces of pre frozen salmon, 4 pieces of California roll, and a hand roll. My friend ordered something completely different and he got the exact same stuff. Nothing on my plate even remotely looked like the food I thought I ordered. The tempura was definitely the worse I've ever had. There was zero panko batter. Just a small piece of fried shrimp.

You'd spend 12$ here ... Why not spend the extra 5$ to get yourself some quality sushi ?

I'd give one star... But because it is so damn cheap, I guess that's one thing you have to sacrifice : quality."}
{"text":"Imagine how it is when you are feed like are in a factory assemble line?
Imagine waitress just throw food on your table without stopping?
Imagine you are in a small crowded restaurant when the only goal of the waitstaffs is to get you out ASAP so more customers can be served?

Hanabi Sushi is the place to be! Runned by Korean sushi chef owner with 1 Korean waitress and one Mandarian speaking waitress.

The price here is really cheap.. you can get a all day specials for $6.95 or a lunch special for $4.95  which included salad, soup, appetitizers, main course and ice cream at a lighting speed!

After I order, my salad and appetitizer and Korean congee appeared on my table in the count of 5! Then in less than 5 minute my table is full of food!

The miso soup is really strange mixture of bean sprout, shredded carrot and tofu.. it is a huge bowl and does not taste like miso soup at all!

Another disappointment is there are only Salmon for Sashimi.. so in my combo B ($10.95) I have only Salmon instead of a mix Sashimi. The sushi roll I found the rice are little hard and they are not the real round sushi rice. 

Tempera has 2 shrimps and 2 yams.. they tasted ok.. for the price I paid..at least the shrimps are fresh.

Services here is fast and impersonal.

It will be a good place if you are starving student on a limited budget and just want to stuff yourself with food... but if you looking for quality over quantities, go somewhere else.

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Given the number years this place has been around (A lot), everyone that goes to Finch/Midland for food has at least one memory of having been to this place at some point in time. Mine was from a lunch of slightly awkward silences with my family after a night where I presented my parents the gift of a son drunk out of his ass from a frat party during orientation week and a $65 cab bill to go with it. It was decent if nothing else beyond that there and a half years ago, so has the quality fared well ever since? The answer is \"Not Really\".

The price is in the low end for starters, totalling no more than $10 after taxes for either lunch or dinner, so you're probably not here for some top notch stuff in the first place. Orders come in pretty quick, and what you do get for that price is pretty good in terms of quality, the udon was alright and so was the sashimi. 

The good things to write about it end here, though. First off, I hope you like salmon, because that's basically all they have when it comes to fish. Salmon tempura appetizers, salmon sashimi, fried salmon tempura in a handroll, it gets pretty silly, even for somebody who eats mostly salmon. When you do get said salmon, the sizes are what I usually get from a lower end AYCE. It's not a problem for an AYCE since you'd just order double and call it at that, but as if I'd do the same here. As for service, fast service also means it's a place where they want to to go away as quickly as possible, so you can guess how friendly the servers are.

Honestly, the only reason my family and I came here was because Sakura Sushi of all places was full on a Sunday night at 8:30, so this was our second choice. After this, I'd probably rank it somewhere lower."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm broke ass poor that I don't mind the complaints I'm seeing.

Seating is very tight. It's like they tried to fit as many seats inside as possible (which they probably did, let's be real). 
Salmon is pretty much the only sashimi available when you order the sets (but I primarily only like salmon in my sushi, so that's a positive for me). It didn't taste very fresh, but I can live with that.
Presentation is sloppy, but I can also live with that.

Service is alright. We got our food quickly, and even got additional items that I wasn't sure were part of our meal (miso soup, salad, side dishes, etc.) That was a positive for me. 
The pricing for this place is cheap too. 

I would return if a friend wanted to come here, but I wouldn't go by myself."}
{"text":"My friend raved about how wonderful this place is, so i went to check it out.  It's a little restaurant tucked away in the corner of a plaza.  Well, it really is a hole in the wall kinda restaurant.  We sat down and the waitress gave us menus that were so well used that the corners were curling up lol.
I ordered the sashimi bento box.  It's called the sushi bento on the menu but the picture clearly showed salmon sashimi.   The food arrived fast.  Miso soup and congee, along with some side dishes of tofu, fried fish, and peas.  That's followed by the bento box.  The box consisted of a big maki roll, a shrimp tempura, and slices of salmon sashimi sitting on top of rice.  The salmon slices were delicious and fresh.  They melted in my mouth.  Love love love.  All that food for less than $10 in total.  More love lol."}
