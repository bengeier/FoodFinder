{"text":"If zero was possible, well, that's what I would put. Sat down, not even that busy, and it took 10 min for a waiter (had to ask for one). Then order is taken...and 30 min later, food. Sandwiches and salads. Really?!? The plus was the food is good, but way too slow for a restaurant."}
{"text":"The bitch at the register has a bad attitude. I'm guessing her name is kristen because that's what's on the receipt on the bag.  You could breath wrong and she would still have an attitude. Don't know how she works in a customer service position when she acts like a complete asshole."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant every couple of weeks and we love it. They have the best breakfast, and if you love bacon it's the thickest yummiest bacon ever! But no lie we have eaten there breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. Only drawback the service is a little slow. Decently priced especially if you have a players club."}
{"text":"Ughhh i come to this casino often but tonite i must say im very disappointed in my choice!!! I ordered the dinner: philly cheese steak , sorry to say that on menu it states its prime rib meat with cheese n onions... i ordered without grilled onions but as i got home i see the cheese is some \"yellow cheese\" lol not to mention the meat!!! Haha it was a f***n hamburger patty basically chopped up!! I couldnt eat it n never will order that crap again!! Ive also ordered the chicken parmesean, nasty! Dont order... better off with the club sandwich... jus sayin"}
{"text":"We stay at the hotel once a month and eat breakfast at cafe 24/7.  I always order a Denver Omelet with american cheese instead of cheddar. They are unable to get my order correct after    multiple visits. This weekend I made it very clear to the waitress no cheddar! just american cheese. When she brought out my omelet I saw a cold piece of american cheese on top of my omelet. The waitress said they put it on top for good measure. When I took it off I saw they had burned my omelet and covered it up with the cheese. I thought at least I finally got American cheese but as soon as I cut into I saw cheddar. I give up! No more omelets here, I will have the pancakes. Hard to mess up pancakes."}
{"text":"Please change the name to \"Well, it's close\". False advertising on the coffee, for sure. Brutal coffee. Food was ok and lady was nice though.  If you don't feel like driving and want to grab breakfast, well, it's close"}
{"text":"First time here. Will probably go someplace else to eat if we ever visit that casino again. I ordered the prime rib. First the side salad was a very small handful which took only four bites to eat. They gave me two full small cups of salad dressing enough for a family size salad which pretty much went to waste. The prime rib was pretty good but cold. The bake potato was really small. $16 later and within a short amount of time I was done. We also ordered the meatloaf. Ok this is where it gets disgusting. Everything was cold. The \"meatloaf\" so to speak, was two hamburger patties stacked together with cold gravy disguising it. The vegetables were the biggest part of the plate and were tasteless (did I mention Cold). The only thing good about this was the waitress. She was prompt in getting our drinks and friendly."}
{"text":"We came to the casino tonight for Eclipse Bingo which ended about 2:30am. About 3 O'clock we decided to check out this \"diner\". First we waited probably right round 10 minutes for anyone to come over and get a drink order from our table of four. Someone in my party noticed our assumed waitress asked a busser to get our drink order. He came over and said \"do you need any drinks over here\" Some one said they will have a water, and he said \"a water\" and seemed to be about ready to walk away. I told him I would like a water and we didnt see this going well so the remainder of the table also ordered water. The waitress finall came over and was clearly flustered (There were probably about 5 or 6 tables with people at them in the whole diner. She tolld Order #1, #2 and on #3 my husband ordered chorizo and Eggs, she said they were out of chorizo. So he went with his next choice Heuvos Ranchero. The waitress couldnt pronounce the name of his dish.. #4 ordered and he told her just how he wanted his Rueben sandwich, and what sides he wanted. She stared at the menu as he was ordering (she did not know anything about the Reuben meal. So we asked her to do seperate checks basically one side of the table and the other side was seperate. Even that was a task for her to figure out what she ment. We repeated it and pointed and she still did not understand, She apologized and was making excuses. So we wait another 20 minutes for these 4 sishes (nothing to complicated, we didnt order any thing special just made our options for sides and such.) She comes back with my husbands \"Heuvos Ranchero's\" and another person on the other bills Burger. She looked at her receipt and realized my order and the other gentleman's order never got put in. So instead of looking at her memo pad at what we ordered, she re asked us for what we ordered. After she walked away, My husband said \" I dont think this is the omlet I ordered, It didnt have any ranchero sauce, and were pretty sure it was prepared with ham, and was toped with cold white cubes of cheese. Almost 10 minutes later she came with the rest of our order. My husband pointed out that I didnt get my toast that came with my meal and He didnt get his Croissant with his.She brought the items to the table along with some jellie she pulled from her apron. I didnt eat my potatoes because they were somewhat dry and after this terrible visit I just wanted to leave. One of your guests ate maybe a 1/4 of his Rueben sandwhich and said it was nothing of how a Rueben should taste. My sister N' law did enjoy her burger and the frys were okay, After waiting to see any sign of our waitress for the bill, I finally told my party that were not waiting around for her its 4:30am and we were tired of this place, honestly thought we were on a Kitchen Nightmare episode. Even the table next to us had problems with this waitress. We went to the chasier and explained we have no bill because our waitres is MIA. They found the waitress and she came up with the bill, and apologized. She showed us our receipts and they of course were wrong. We said its fine will pay the bills how they came, since were all friends, we can wrok it out. This by far is the worst Diner I have ever eaten at. Good luck to you if you wish to come to this lil convienent diner at the VQ casino and hotel."}
{"text":"Well we have to try a place at least twice.  we were seated right away this time even though it was busier.  My husband chose the Buffet for 17.99 and I ordered off the menu. It was a Sunday breakfast moment, my healthy egg white omelet had spinach, mushrooms, and cheese which tasted good but nothing stellar. my husband had many different selections from the buffet but for the 17.99 there was no roast on the carving board , just a pork loin. I ordered a Bloody Mary and the rim of my glass was a virtual Salt Lick! Yuck! I could not finish it. The waiter was very helpful and friendly. sadly to say .. not sure if it is worth a third trip."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel a couple days before Christmas so we decided to try this place for dinner and then again for breakfast.  First off 24/7 Coffee Shop is a horrible name. Just based on name it sounds like a local coffee shop and that's it. Maybe you could get a muffin and an apple but nothing more.   My bf ordered the prime rib special cause it was dirt cheap, but quickly realized you get what you pay for. While a lot of sides were served with it, the steak was way over cooked and wasn't great quality, but that's probably to be expected with a casino steak dinner.  I had the turkey burger and fruit. Fries came instead of the fruit and there was no avocado on the sandwich. Pretty much everything that could have been wrong with it was wrong.   Service was ok, but not great.    We then came back in the morning for all you can eat pancakes for $2. We also got eggs and a fruit plate. The fruit plate was OK but normally a fruit plate will come with something besides just fruit, like a piece of banana bread or some yogurt. Not a deal breaker though.    All in all the meals were just OK, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I don't like buffets so I ordered their Philly cheese steak. Very good! think cut steak with onions and peppers with cheese! Fries were no big deal, wife had a burger and enjoyed it very much. This is one of three restaurants in the casino, everything else are in the fast food court. Also is the only restaurant open in the morning. We enjoyed it, and no issues with our server. You pay at the cashier on your way out. Very nice crew, and came by quite often to make sure things are well. When we come back I would like to try the other options first before I come back here."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner prime rib was just ok to me.very small piece and overcook. Comes with a potato and fresh vegetables. $11.99 that's pretty costly considering you don't win that much in there casino. I most likely would not return."}
{"text":"If you're older than 60 you should consider eating somewhere else because, actuarially, you're likely to be dead before your food arrives. They simply aren't staffing the place. One guy is pulling the weight of 3.   The wife wants me to add that her open-faced turkey sandwich was edible (the best she could come up with).   We will NOT be returning to this cafe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and have eaten here many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. The quality of the food is D-lish, tasty perfect size servings. The breakfast is the best Eggs Benedict is my favorite. We have brought our families also to enjoy this place. Highly recommended. Only con the service is a little slow but the servers are friendly"}
{"text":"The chicken Marsala oh so yummy  It was quick we didn't eat a lot of it tho we ordered the nachos for an appetizer and it was huge good but huge"}
