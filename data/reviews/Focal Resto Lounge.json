{"text":"Walked by and decided to stop for a drink. Service was great. Cocktail was very well made and the beers were $5 special. We ended up staying for dinner. Everything we ordered was excellent and very tasty. It's always nice to eat something that you know you couldn't make yourself at home. Awesome chef! I highly recommend dinner here. We will be back."}
{"text":"We wandered into this restaurant after an afternoon of shopping. I'm glad we did. The staff is knowledgable, attentive, skilled, and interested in their work. They were a pleasure to talk with. The drinks were excellent. So was the food. The duck confit poutine was a perfect combination of classic and modern. It was beautifully presented too. The restaurant was quiet while we were there. That will not last long. Get there now, before everyone discovers it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to see what they've done with this awkward spot at one of the least desirable corners of all of Queen West. They are starting up a brunch menu, which I read from the street and just had to check out. (I read something about a fried oyster .. hollandaise, blah, blah .. you had me at OYSTER). This will be starting this week so get your appetites ready! 
This place was completely redone inside with a swanky modern interior design and still had the new paint smell when I was there. I asked for a stout on tap and checked out the menu.
Being ready for a light snack instead of a full meal, I opted for an appetizer.
Duck confit poutine! Yes! Yes! (kudos to the chef and this very innovative menu).
A fav of mine since trying it on the road side in Québec. Sure I could have ate a huge bowl, but this was a neat little pile of deliciousness. And it was topped with kim chi, how innovative. Not only that, but additionally, there were crispy duck skin pieces piled on top of the kim chi. Now we're talkin' Keep it up Focal, this is a perfect way to spruce up this dilapidated part of the city."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.0/5.0

Lately I have been checking out different places for brunch and this place definitely serves up some interesting dishes. Everyone has their own take on benedicts and this restaurant is no exception.

The fried oyster benny comes with battered oyster on brioche bun, red thai chilli chinese sausages and soft poached eggs topped with a refreshing ginger lime hollandaise.

The French toast was also quite interesting. It is both sweet and savoury with stuff pork sausage. However, the crispy skin on top was a bit hard to eat and made quite a sound when you bite into it. Am not sure how it adds to the overall dish.

At first I was a bit apprehensive about the menu as it was quite fusion. However, the items were quite well prepared. 

Service was also very friendly and attentive. Would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. We tried the yin yang scallop, indo salmon, pomegranate cashew chicken and the upside down pineapple cake. All were delicious and had great presentation. The flavours were very well put together. Service was great and very friendly and informative about every dish. We also had a dozen oysters which came with 6 different sauces - the chef explained all of the different kinds of oysters and sauces. This was awesome :):):) highly recommend."}
{"text":"Don't let the decor throw you off best food I've had in a realllly long time incredible duck confit poutine and taro tacos!"}
{"text":"Great service. Engaging and attentive workers (was given extra napkins without needing to ask when eating messy tacos). Glass of water was never empty 

Ambience was lively yet intimate. There's a semi private dining table at the back of the restaurant with an electric fireplace. 

Appetizer: Salmon Taro Tacos (5/5 Stars) 
Crispy taro shaped into a taco shell  the flavors were amazing and taro shell was perfectly cooked; would much rather a taro shell than a salty cornflour taco shell. Seasoning was on point, it was sweet and savory. 

Dinner: Surf and Turf Ravioli (4 Stars)
Delicious crispy ravioli with stuffed with salmon, shrimp and scallops topped with butter chicken.. genius infusion of Italian and Indian flavors. The chicken was tender and melted in my mouth and the ravioli skins were so crisp. Butter chicken is a pretty heavy dish, so the seafood and the texture of the ravioli was a nice contrast to the dish. The butter chicken sauce got a bit heavy so I couldn't really taste the seafood. 

Dinner: Chimichurri Grilled Certified Angus NY Strip loin (4.5/5 Stars)
Also cooked to perfection(besides my steak was a bit charred.. seasoning was a bit burnt but I cut the outer part of it off and it was perfect). I ordered mine medium and it was definitely medium. The steak was so juicy in the balsamic vinegar reduction and the chimichurri sauce was amazing; wasn't spicy but could definitely taste the herbs and it complemented the steak nicely. 

Dessert #1: Cheesecake with Crispy Phyllo Pastry 
10/5 Stars) 
THIS IS A MUST GET when you eat here!! No bake cheesecake without the strong cream cheese taste. The texture gets a little boring but you can crack the caramelized phyllo pastry and eat it with the cheesecake. I normally don't like soft cheesecake but this by far one of my favorites!! The rosewater syrup and the edible flowers are a good combo as well. Need I say more??? 

Dessert #2: Grilled Pineapple Upside Down Cake w/ Vanilla Ice cream  (3/5 Stars)
Not a fan of pineapple upside down cake, but my partner enjoyed this. It was a pineapple sponge cake with candied bacon and nuts. The bacon was pretty good; tasted like jerky and texture was similar. 

Dessert #3: Pavlova (2.5/5 Stars)
For me, this wasn't one of my favorites. It was difficult to eat can't really cut into it without having to use your fork and smashing it into pieces IMO.. crispy meringue cookies with a soft marshmallow texture in the center. To me, I felt like the meringue was really bitter and I didn't like the pasty texture/taste. The custard, mango purée tasted really good nonetheless. 

1. Would recommend this place to a friend/stranger/ family member 
2.  Would tell everyone to try the cheesecake and steak
3......GET. THE. CHEESECAKE... FOR YOURSELF!!"}
{"text":"We went to focal resto lounge for a bachelorette party this weekend. James And Johnny were magnificent hosts.  You MUST have the poutine because it's divine.  For dessert, have the pineapple upside down cake because the bacon was as big as your head. Great atmosphere, amazing food and a must come see.  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"They are humble, clean, professional, and actively listening to feedback. 

Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. Servers were almost too polite, atmosphere was nice, drinks were proper."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch and I really love their food and service. The place before was a greasy spoon dive of a diner which no one really goes to, and the homeless centre next door with a lot of characters loitering may scare off people from going here, but they provide some quirky entertainment if you're dining by the window. The dining room reaches far back so you could always sit back there if you don't want these distractions.
The flock of transients outside is really unfortunate as this restaurant really deserve to be discovered by more people who shop and walk along this busy stretch of Queen Street.

Their menu has an Asian spin which is refreshing and unexpected. The first time I was there I had their fried oyster benedict which was awesome. The oyster was fresh and perfectly fried with the batter being light and not greasy. The bits of Lap Cheong (Chinese sausage) was a nice touch with it's rich taste and texture and the ginger lime hollandaise was slightly sweet with a slight tang which really goes well with the perfectly poached eggs.

On another visit I had the Chimichurri Salmon Quiche and it was also good too. I love anything with Chimichurri sauce and I really like the combination of salmon and the smokiness of the gouda and chipotle. The side salad made for another great brunch meal.
My friends had the Stuffed Portobello (they are vegetarian) and it looked really good and they really enjoyed it.

We were offered free dessert of our choice because our meals took so long, which really wasn't that long and we didn't notice much, which was really nice of the staff. My friends had the Pavlova which was topped with coconut custard, mango and pomegranate which looked really good and was a nice light ending. However, after being full from my Benny, I went with the Grilled Pineapple Upside-Down Cake which was a mammoth of a dessert which should be shared. Because it had candied bacon my friends couldn't have it. It was really good, but it was too much dessert for me and I could only finish half of it -- I actually ate more than I should as I felt bad for leaving so much behind.  All of the dishes we had looked and tasted really good, and on top of that a great staff, I will definitely be back and will try out their dinner menu."}
