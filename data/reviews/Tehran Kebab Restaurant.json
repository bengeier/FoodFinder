{"text":"Unbelievable foods. This is the worst experience I've ever been. Chicken breast is sour and hard. I'm pretty they just gave me the chicken breast that the last customer didn't pick up. I don't know why the cook wants to do that. Please don't go to this restaurant. It will disappoint you."}
{"text":"Found this spot along Yonge St. and decided to give it a try. 
You order food at the counter and seat yourself. It's a small spot but seating is sufficient given most people do take out here. 

We ordered the chicken and beef kebab combo ($9.99) which came with a drink. The food was pretty good but the meat was a bit salty. I personally enjoyed the chicken more, but both are worth trying. In an effort to try something new, I got the yogurt soda drink which came with the meal... which was a huge mistake. It tasted like how I imagine sour milk would taste, would not recommend. Drink aside, overall the meal was good and the wait for the food wasn't too long."}
{"text":"Cute little spot among many other Persian restaurants. It's casual and cafeteria style but the quality is great. I had the ash-e-reshteh and it was amazing. The kabobs were wonderful too and we're good size portions. The only reason I'm not giving 5 starts is because he people were a little confused about the others and I needed to return to ask for different parts of our order that they forgot. It's not perfect but a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"A new look and delicious food i got from UBEREATS 
it was fast and Gormesabzi was great i love it"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place as the restaurant we originally wanted to eat at was closed for renovations. 

You go in, order at the register, then seat yourself. They then bring you your meal and you walk back to the register to pay once you're done. 

The food here is reasonably priced. I got the chicken and beef kabob at $9.99 which came with a generous serving of rice and your choice of either pop or bottled water. I found the chicken salty but the beef good and moist. 

ps. I would not recommend the yogurt soda! It was sour!"}
{"text":"The restaurant had really bad smell and was very messy. When I started eating, my drink fell down accidentally but unfortunately the waitress didn't come for cleaning . I cleaned the table by myself but no one pay attention to the floor. At the end they charged me 5$ more without my permission because of floor. I always put 20% tip when I go any restaurant but it's hard to accept 5$ more without getting my permission. This is the last time that I use this restaurant."}
{"text":"They sell the worst vaziri in this world. The chicken breast is sour and it doesn't even taste like chicken. The koobideh is hard like stone. I really don't know if the chef know how to cook or the cook just did that on purpose. Please make better food or close the store."}
