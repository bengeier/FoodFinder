{"text":"A modern upscale Vietnamese restaurant is about what appealed to me.   The pho doesn't even come with Sriracha on side, nor hoisin sauce. But they call themselves authentic. The authentic thing about this restaurant is that the bricks were imported from Hanoi?   Pho tasted okay, we ordered viet iced coffee which was good. The lotus roots dish was cooked with too much garlic. I asked for chili peppers and it came cut up!   Another thing for the appetizers , the banh xeo doesn't come with chili paste to mix with the fish sauce."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for it's grand opening with some high hopes, but the food was just ok. It's in the neighbourhood and I'll definitely be back, and maybe they'll get some of the kinks out.   The atmosphere and the service was great. Everyone was very attentive and you can tell they were very eager to please. The decor is nice, and while it still feels like they're missing a few finishing touches, it really was great.   I had the Beef Pho, and while the broth was fantastic, it was odd that we didn't get a lime, sprouts, mint, or herbs (cilantro, mint basic, etc.). The amount of beef for the serving was a little small compared to most soups in the city. My partner had the chicken vermicelli, and again it was just average.   I'll update the review next time!"}
{"text":"Great pho, without the msg. The restaurant is clean and waitstaff are polite and friendly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and went in with my wife. We had the deep fried Viet springs rolls for our app. They were served with fish sauce and a bottle of Vietnamese hot sauce that my wife really loved. We also had the Meat Lovers Hot pot. Everything was delicious and service was very friendly. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Lan several times and the food has been consistently excellent.  The raw beef pho and the bbq pork fresh rolls are standouts. Always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Like the beef pho (broth is savory and clean so I feel great after), pork vermicelli bowls, and shrimp salad rolls. the food is good and consistent. Also, their crispy calamari is a delicious splurge. Easy to get a seat or delivery."}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews here and wonder if we are talking about the same restaurant? The food tasted like bad Chinese food, except it was over priced. One dish was worse than the next. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and it's a nice change from many of the Vietnamese restaurants in the city. The flavours are good, ingredients are really fresh, vegetables are crunchy and not overcooked.   Not to mention the owners are so friendly and genuinely happy to see their customers. Happy to have this place as an addition to the east end."}
{"text":"Food tasted pretty good, but compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, the portions are extremely small. Normally I can't finish an order of pho and not only did I finish it, I was still hungry after. I'll probably order again, since it was pretty good, but I'll be sure to order more food next time."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I've eaten in 3 times, and used UBER eats once. I think I prefer to eat in. I do think the restaurant can be a bit chilly in winter, and it's not that cosy, but the service has always been friendly and welcoming so I'm not too concerned. I love their deep fried Vietnam spring rolls, their Vietnamese pan cake was delicious and their beef tenderloin skewers will keep me coming back. I tried their pho bo, great cure for coughs and colds.  LAN herself is friendly and chatty, and honestly, I love that this place is not too far from my home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Riverdale for a stroll after some appointments nearby today.  We both were intrigued by Lan from the outside appearance.  We recently transitioned to vegetarianism, and are on the hunt for restaurants that are veggie friendly, tasty and interesting.  Very happy with our decision.  Ambience: 5  Immediately when we walked in, we were impressed by the quality and detail of the beautiful wood furnishing.  We've been all over Asia and really appreciated the fine wood craftsmanship there, and took time looking at the pieces and the decor.  It really added a nice touch of authenticity.  On route the washroom, I passed by more ornate tables and a boat!  I read somewhere that many of the furnishings were brought from Vietnam.  Overall, the place is very clean.  (The review by Lee below made me think he must have been at the wrong restaurant or may just be a difficult person to please. ;D)    Service: 5  The 2 staff members were very friendly and attentive.  Since it was 4pm on a Wednesday, we were the only ones inside (like almost all of the restaurants we passed).   Usually it's rare that we'd feel comfortable chatting and taking our time in a restaurant where we're the only ones, but the staff gave us plenty room.  They didn't rush us, hover or pushy.  The music was great at masking our convo too.  Also our server made sure to check that I was okay with the mayo on the takeout tofu bahn mi that I couldn't resist getting.  The food started to come out after 10 minutes or so, and it was clear that it was made fresh.   Food: 4.5  We got the following from the vegetarian section (sidebar: most restaurants are quite poor in providing vegetable options.  So we're very happy to see that there are vegetarian options for most sections on top of a separate section):   a. vegan springrolls - Normally we don't do apps, but the springrolls were $6 and was worth it.   Both of us loved the vegan springrolls.  They were pretty sizeable.  I thought the thin transparent wrapping was a really great touch for added taste and texture (vs the thicker flour wrapping of springrolls from other Viet restos). It was as flavourable as the meat versions we've had.    b. tofu pho I grew up eating pho in Hamilton (home of many great pho restos with #s in its names), but have never had non-meat pho before.  When I tasted the savoury broth, I no longer craved beef pho and its salty oilyness.  The tofu pho contained 6 sizeable crispy tofu that soaked up the broth, and oodles of big pieces of vegetables.  It was so tasty that I didn't even notice there wasn't bean sprouts, mint or other garnish until I read the other reviews.  I really like that Lan kept to the northern Vietnamese pho style, and didn't try to appease the masses with familiar garnishes.  The soup didn't need it.  I felt very satisfied, and was pleased that the vegetarian version made me feel energized and healthy, vs my normal '*burp* ready for a nap'.    c. veggies on crispy noodles We really enjoy the crispy noodles, which was topped by a big pile of different veggies and crispy tofu.  The onion pieces were cooked to perfection - crunchy, juicy and a little sweet.  Who knew.  My only suggestion was to not let the noodles sit on sauce for too long, as it became a bit too salty, but my husband didn't think so.    d. a tofu bahn mi to go Looking forward to this for lunch tomorrow!    e. Vietnamese coffee Tasty with soy milk (very happy about this as many restaurants don't have soy milk).     Price: 4  Only because we're pretty cheap (read: night markets in Asia cheap).  Tho we expected the food/environment/experience was not going to be like a cheap Asian restaurants.  Lan was very well priced for what we got.    Overall, we'd definitely come back again, and it's now on our list of places to bring visitors who wanted a cool and different dining experience."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese for a great price! Ordered off skip the dishes and we loved everything. Packaged nicely so no spillage, which is always a plus. Crispy spring roll was the perfect amount of greasy crispy deliciousness. I had the pork vermicelli bowl, pork was seasoned perfectly and good size. Crispy wontons were yummy too, it came with a creamy mayo sauce we weren't expecting compared to the usual sweet chili, but I really liked it.   Will add to our list of regular restaurants to order from."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed...decided to try this new resto based on the high rating and reviews. When we first arrived we were seated in the back with hardly any light...at our request they did turn on lights but as we read the menu the room got darker and darker..  We ordered the spicy chicken wings that came totally unspiced...when we pointed it out the server said that it comes with spice powder if we asked for it...why would we order spicy chicken wings and then have to request the spice?? We ordered banh mi sandwiches with extra meat and cilantro...the meat was flavourless despite the marinades...we would hate to think how skimpy the sandwiches would be without the order of extra meat...the cilantro was just woody stalks...barely any leaves.  On the plus side the decor is nice, the servers are friendly, very accommodating and they were sincerely interested in why we were disappointed. As this is a new establishment there's still hope for improvement....but we won't not return...there are too many good Vietnamese options in this city."}
{"text":"We were happy to see a Vietnamese place open in our neighborhood.  For our first visit, we brought a Vietnamese friend and her family.  She gave the place her seal of approval for authenticity and quality of food. We agreed!  A week later, we're back for our second visit.  The food is tasty and fresh. The service is attentive and friendly.  The prices are a tick higher than on Spadina but that reflects better quality and a nicer room.  The traditional music quietly in the background and the Vietnamese antique style furniture nicely accentuates the experience As we look at food being serve fat other tables, we want to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"Went here tonight on their second day open Nice tofu noodles, very friendly staff.  They did not have a liquor license or a debit machine yet, but that was not a problem.  Wish there were vegetarian spring rolls available - there are three other types of spring rolls."}
{"text":"I have eaten at LAN twice now. First time I ordered through foodora with my brother and the food was SO good we wolfed it down  Convinced by how much I was raving about it, my husband and I made it out to the location on a Wednesday night. The place was very quiet and empty, but still quaint and nicely decorated. We ordered the deep fried Viêt spring rolls, the pork sausages, the pork vermicelli bowl and the rare thinly sliced beef pho.  Everything was phenomenal exactly like before- the spring rolls were deep fried with the authentic crispy rice wrapping which is so hard to find even in Toronto. The fish sauce served with anything was AMAZING and obviously made in house.  According to my hard to please husband pho was the best he's had in toronto- not served with sides as previously mentioned in other reviews as is the northern tradition but such a delicious richer broth that they aren't needed. We were offered hot sauce with the pho.  I would order everything again for sure and this is going to be a regular place for us.   Price is right too so I really don't know what people are complaining about.... 5/6$ appies and 11$ mains like we are in Toronto people ... way better than Mimi's and Bach yen up on Gerrard ."}
{"text":"The rating is actually a 2.5 star rating. I'm in between Meh, I have experienced better and A-OK.  Lan's restaurant is a new modern upscale Vietnamese restaurant that recently opened in the Riverdale area of Toronto. The restaurant is Vietnamese run and owned with a focus on Northern Vietnamese cuisine.  I went this past evening to see if it was any different than the slew of mediocre Vietnamese restaurants in the east end of Toronto. I was quickly seated and asked for tea and they said they didn't have any, only ice water which was odd. I ended ordering a small Beef Pho Bo Dac Biet ($8.95 plus tax) and an order of Cha Gio which are deep fried spring rolls (2 for $4.95 plus tax).   Bean sprouts, lime or mint didn't accompany the pho because in the North they eat the pho plain unlike in the South. The pho was above average, good broth, noodles were almost cooked right but it had minimal beef and was mostly noodles. The deep fried spring rolls were tiny comparable to any Vietnamese restaurant in the city and wasn't filled with much. I understand they want to price higher because it's a more upscale Vietnamese restaurant but the portions are really really small. If you want to price yourself as one of the highest priced Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto, at least make your portions reasonable and don't cut corners.  The service was good and the people that own the restaurant are friendly. The place and decor is really nice with it's old Hanoi French architecture. It's also very spacious, clean and can accommodate large groups. Even though the food is good but not great and authentic Vietnamese food, there seems to be a disconnect between the pricing which is at the very top end of the pricing scale for Vietnamese restaurants and the portions which are small. Perhaps it's the right fit for the Caucasian Riverdale clientele but I'm not sure it will attract a Vietnamese clientele who are looking for good food and value."}
{"text":"Spied it in the corner of my eye as I was walking, went in to try it out.  Food is super tasty. I highly recommend the pork sausage appetizer, and so far every main course I've had has been hella tasty.  The person who runs it is a big draw; every time I go in we end up having a conversation about whatever, and she's remembered me from visit #1 even though my visits were few and far between.  From a decor POV, the place looks like a really nice Indian or Chinese restaurants, which probably belies how great this place is as a joint to come in for lunch, possibly get into a convo with the staff, and enjoy light food as well as larger dinners. Also admire the decor, I'd love to see more restaurants in TO match this place."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a friend and I was not disappointed!  This was my first experience trying Vietnamese food and I will definitely go back!  Great vegetarian selection on the menu too!  Recommend you try their cocktail call PHO Cocktail the flavours dance in your mouth - Yummy!!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place by accident as the Hanoi was closed. When you walk in you can see the difference between pho and what Lan serves. We had fried tofu and fresh tofu rolls. One person had irresistible Chicken soup. I have crispy noodles with veggies. The veggies were as crispy as the noodles. The portion was large and I almost wish I'd taken some of it to go. Almost, since I greedily are every bit. My companions loved theirs as well. We stayed for three hours talking and drinking tea and staff were welcoming and chill. My bills with appetizer and dinner and Diet Coke was only $21. Bonus: very clean and beautifully furnished. We all agreed we'd be. Ack."}
{"text":"I come here religiously for the pho ( it's huge and they don't skimp on anything) and hand rolled spring rolls.   Food and service is great , they are very personable and kind  and I'm so happy to have amazing Vietnamese food in the hood made with love !"}
{"text":"My husband and I were exploring for a good place to eat and we came across this gem. We decided to have the Vietnamese hot pot, after seeing this dish on Anthony Bourdain's show. It was absolutely delicious. Our appetizer was also delicious-we had deep fried Viet spring rolls served with fish sauce dipping sauce.   I have two criticisms: the lighting was poor and I found it slightly pricey but at the end of the day, it's about the service and the food. The service and the food were outstanding and I will go back. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It bothers me to bump a 1.5 star review up to a two, for various reasons. All kidding aside, we all want good restaurants to eat at in the hood, and we want them all to do well; it's what creates great neighbourhoods. In their defense we experienced a snow squall late afternoon that ended before dinner time, so perhaps the chef wasn't in that evening.  We went on a Thursday night in December and the restaurant was cold inside; the floors were cold and you could feel cold air coming from the back. Someone at our table asked to turn the heat up, and we were told they were having heating issues. The server said she had to reset it, then went and turned up the thermostat. When I went to the bathroom, situated at the very back of the restaurant, I discovered howling winds whipping in through the back door, turning the entire back bathroom area into a walk-in fridge. No wonder the place was freezing. There were two other tables and one more came in while we were there, and there was only one server running the show, and I think I saw one person in the kitchen.   They offer four beers, a couple of wines, and a small selection of mixed drinks. The decor is basic, and lack-luster. It's not on-trend or authentic by any means, with a poor use of space, layout and lighting. The back area is dark, separated from the rest of the place, and seems more a place for staff to eat, than anything else. The wood bench seating where we sat was not comfortable, but the acoustics were good for conversation.   Our food arrived rather quickly, and this made me suspicious. One of us ordered the tiger shrimp main dish, another, the sate chicken with vermicelli noodles, and they both liked their dishes. Two of us ordered grilled Lemongrass chicken with vermicelli noodles. Sounds delicious but it wasn't. The dish was dry and tasted pre-cooked. The fish sauce that came on the side, tasted awful, and I'd wished I hadn't dumped it in the bowl, in an attempt to add flavour. I ate quickly, focusing on the noodles, and the conversation. Also there were no little side goodies like you get at some Vietnamese places. It did come with a small spring roll but it was a disservice to the meal as it tasted like it came out of a box; no spring in this roll.  The server was very pleasant and accommodating, and if anything, made the experience less horrible than it was, so we chowed down like good little troupers and tried to pretend it wasn't happening. Overall, this place isn't authentic feeling or tasting, seems to operate on an as per amount of business basis, opening up the back areas, turning on lights and heating as required. I'm appalled to see the number of fake reviews; thank goodness Yelp has the sense to remove 9 of them."}
{"text":"The restaurant is renovated with taste, the menu itself is enclosed by wooden covers, very interesting design. The service staff was phenomenal, very friendly and attentive. They recommended the pan cake but they ran out. So we started off with the Vietnamese coffee and the fresh shrimp spring roll. The roll was delicious! The wrap was done just right to give the perfect texture, the sauce was made warm and it is on a sweet side. Two entries ordered: the yellow curry chicken and the special beef noodle soup. The curry was thick and creamy, very rich with flavours. As for the noodle soup, the soup was great. The noodle and meat was a bit disappointing compared to some other Vietnamese resto. The bill came out to be close to $40, which is not expensive than the average Vietnamese restos."}
{"text":"Just went to Lan Restaurant with my wife and son. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. There's a pleasant atmosphere, it's clean, authentic, and the service is excellent. You can tell owner Lan really takes pride in her work and loves to delight customers. We had the meat Hot Pot which is not only fun to eat because you cook your veggies and meat in the broth, it's delicious too. The spring rolls are by far the most unique spring rolls I've had and are really tasty. We really liked the mango salad too. Very accommodating for infants and children as well. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a pho place on queen street east. Initially from checking the reviews and ratings on Yelp, we had picked a neighbouring pho restaurant but we didn't realize the turnover time in between lunch and dinner so we decided to give LAN a try. Not sure what review I can give this restaurant. We arrived around 3-4 and the restaurant had a couple already seating eating half way in their meal. We were nicely greeted to a seat by the owner that I assumed as her name was LAN. We were given the menu and from first glance the menu looked professional and clear but not your typical PHO restaurant menu with the extension PHO options. The price points were above the average pho prices where given the increase prices I envision a different Twist to the dishes to make up for the higher prices. We ordered the mango salad for an appetizer where I have had better mango salad in my time. For our main we each order the PHO beef soup. I asked for a small and was given a large. At the point of arrival, I wasn't going to argue the error as you normally can't return a bowl of pho for size error. The broth was not anything special. My broth references are specific as I am aware it takes heart to make a good broth with the infused flavours of the beef bone. I wouldn't say the broth was bad but definitely not the best I've had. He waitress/owner was a bit off tracked with our service as she was chatting with the other couple about a bad review she had where I didn't feel that was professional considering you have other guests eating tables away. For a restaurant who thrives off exceptional service I didn't think she was very consistent with her follow through. A part that really threw me for a loop was when our pho arrived, we didn't not get the norm of bean sprouts and mint where when asked I was given the less than usual portion for two large bowls of PHO and no mint. Not sure if PHO eaten at this restaurant has no bean sprouts and mint but I certainty felt uncomfortable asking.   An overview review for the restaurant would only to say I had a bit of a standard as reading the reviews prior where My boyfriend must of been there at their time where \"service\" took a break???"}
{"text":"This review is for takeout. So, as the decor looks more upscale you'd expect a bit higher quality food. Unforunately it was half the quality and portion for twice the price of more authentic hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese places I usually go to on Gerrard. I ordered lemongrass chicken vermicelli (bun in Vietnamese), and it was served with rice instead. The portion was small, and I paid $4 for extra shrimp and 3 medium size shrimp came with it, not worth the price. The chicken was mediocre quality and flavor, and a few strips of cucumber and a few chunks of iceburg lettuce were the salad - no herbs or sprouts. Wow, really disappointing."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time a couple weeks ago. Barely anyone there during prime dinner rush. Lights off around the bar- quite dark inside. We're seated and put in our drink order. Which came wrong. Spring rolls and fresh rolls were excellent. Mains... not so much. One was plain rice with some grilled chicken, a rubbery fried egg and some iceberg lettuce \"salad\". The other which was described as fried noodles were actually noodles in a curry soup. Served with rice. It was a let down- texture not the most pleasant. Flavour was good.   To be honest, between the music, the service and the food... I just wanted out.   Overall: a low 3 out of 5 Would I return: no"}
{"text":"Rebrand...B(Lan)d. Very cute place but the low ceilings and lots of hard surfaces make it pretty loud. Our food came out fast which was a plus because I was hungry and stoked to try this place. Unfortunately, everything was pretty bland. The sauce for my lemongrass chicken Bun tasted like water. Also the cold shrimp rolls I started with were almost flavourless. It took 25 minutes to finally get our bill. As much as I like sitting around in front of empty dirty dishes waiting, that's a bit too long even for me. For the price point, I did expect more, but the restaurant has just opened, and if they step up their game, I am sure things could improve."}
{"text":"We came here on grand opening day on Friday evening, and today (Saturday) for lunch. I'm obsessed with their chicken pho! The broth is amazing, and full of chicken essence with hint of lemongrass. My husband said it's definitely something he'll want when he's sick in place of chicken noodle soup. You can choose from dark, white or mixed chicken meat to go with your pho. It's a very good gesture to have the option to choose. Both times, I went with a mix of white and dark chicken meat in my pho. It is the best chicken pho that my husband and I have had.   Their grill marinated pork Bahn mi is also amazing. Toasty baguette, nicely marinated pork with a balance of crisp veggies, and a hint of honey glaze. For $4.50, I think it's a steal for the quality you get.   We've also had their lemongrass chicken bun which was good. It didn't blow our mind away. The tumeric chicken with rice was meh. You can skip that dish.  Overall, great service and atmosphere. The decor is definitely not your typical pho houses. This place is tastefully designed and very clean (no sticky floors). We've already been here twice since they opened yesterday. So we will definitely be back for more pho, and Bahn mi!!"}
{"text":"Quite excited to have a Vietnamese restaurant open on the Eastside. The owner, Lan was kind enough to talk to us about her new restaurant and even treated us to Vietnamese coffee (which I've never had but am now addicted) and the steamed banana cake with coconut milk. We had the marinated pork vermicelli bowl and the sesame soya beef rice plate. Large portions and worth the price. The shrimp spring rolls was a great starter dish and the fresh lime juice was refreshing on a hot day like today.  Definitely will come back to try other dishes especially the banh mi sandwiches.   For families, the restaurant is spacious and can accommodate your stroller and on Sundays, kids under 6 can eat for free between 11-4."}
{"text":"Never order from ubereats. They skimp you on everything and though I specifically asked for it, they didn't even give me bean sprouts and limes and the herbs. I find it ridiculous that any restaurant thinks it's okay to skimp on the basics just because im ordering it from an app. If you don't want to give proper service to app delivery customers then don't make yourself available to these apps."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Foodora - the delivery was fine, but the food was cold. My beef vermicelli bowl had basically jerky in it (the beef was shrivelled, dry and overcooked) and the spring rolls were teeny tiny! Also a super small portion of food overall, and I'm not even a big eater."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything was amazing. You can't go wrong. Try everything! We had the spring roles, the Pho Ga soup and the chicken curry."}
