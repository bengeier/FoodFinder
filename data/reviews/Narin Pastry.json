{"text":"Today was my second time at Narin's Wilson location. I got an assortment of pistachio pastries including baklava. Absolutely delicious and addictive. You can taste the real/high quality honey, the pastry is soft, flakey and flavourful along with the pistachio filling. Definitely the best baklava that I have had and one of the best pastries that I have had. Also, very reasonably priced for high quality desserts. I got 6 pastries and a custard for just over $10.00.

{"text":"Stumbled upon this little shop after eating pho a couple of doors down.

First of all, the pastries are so beautiful, lovingly created and arranged with care. The lady we met running the shop I believe was the owner and while we had a bit of trouble communicating, she told us she makes all of the pastries herself. She also had a small section of various Turkish foods like beans, sauces, and Turkish delight candies.

We were stuffed after lunch but we just had to pick out a couple of pieces to try later on. 

After selecting a couple of beautiful looking treats (so sorry not sure of the proper names!), we were on our way. The temptation of the goodies were too strong and we ended up eating them all on the way home in the car haha.

The pastries we selected reminded me of baklava - filled with nuts, layers of light flaky pastry, all held together in silky honey syrup. Little bites of heaven!

Can't wait to come back to try more of their delights!!"}
{"text":"Baklava and other sweets, best you can find in Toronto!! Decent prices, good quality."}
{"text":"What a nice place, nice people and spotlessly clean establishment.

If you are looking for authentic Turkish pastries and bread products (including simit), come here.  Real bourek (which is a stuffed savoury pastry) - stuffed with either cheese, meat or potato.

They are polite here and it is a respectable place.  They carry a fantastic assortment of sweet cookies (meticulously made) and a wide range of bread products.  Their simit here reminds me of the time I spent in the M.E.  Just crispy enough exterior, soft inside, drenched on the outside with sesame seeds.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my to go place for Baklava 
* great variety of baklava. (Walnuts, pistachio, etc) 
* is not stingy on nut paste which makes it tastes very rich
* great space, have seatings 

- cashier doesn't know a lot of english so it is hard for her to describe the difference of the pastries. 
- a little pricey, but nuts are expensive and especially pistachios. 
- very sweet"}
