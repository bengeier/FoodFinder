{"text":"Not a bad place, lots of students, not much interior design.
For its interior design and dish size, I would say it's not hard to find the same or better for cheaper."}
{"text":"Good affordable place. Quite new. Clean. AC. Service is ok (when theyre not busy, or youll have to ask for your utensils, drinks or sauces twice which I did). They have all day specials, breakfast (till 11am) and other stir fry promos (11-5pm) ranging from $2.95 to $8.50 including a drink. Had Hainese chicken rice ($6.95) but the rice was all dry and hard ... almost like overnight microwaved rice. That was quite disappointing. But over all its ok. Right at Bur Oak and Kenndy."}
{"text":"First time here and order a spinach sauce with mushroom on fried rice. The rice was dried and had no taste to it. The sauce and mushroom was ok."}
{"text":"One thing I really enjoy coming here to eat is their ??? (Chinese French Toast). It's because they include the crunchy peanut butter in it which when placed in between the bread is gooey. Definitely one of my favourite spots for breakfast, brunch or afternoon tea.  

Came here tonight for dinner around 6pm. Service is extremely fast, plenty of seats for you to choose at 6pm, because this is considered early for dinner. Menus are provided promptly, and teas are given complimentary to the meal. In addition, there is a large bowl of soup that is also complimentary to the meal. We ordered two dishes with two bowls of rice and the total was less than $20. 

We had the sweet and sour pork and the fish with tofu, cauliflower and mushroom. Their dish proportions got a lot smaller compared to the years previous, but at the same time, food outside has been much more expensive nowadays. The fish with tofu, cauliflower and mushroom was slightly salty, but with rice, it was decent. The sweet and sour pork this time was attrocious. The sweet and sour pork were small bits of pork. I did not find anything larger than the size of a loonie in there.

Today, the meal was like a 2.5 star - the meal was small, but the cheap and affordable price and the expensive market makes up for it. Usually, the food is of bigger portion and food quality is pretty decent, that's why I'm leaving them with a 4 star - hopefully they won't disappoint me the next time I visit for dinner."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on Friday with a co-worker.  This place was packed!  There were many lunch specials with bowl noodle at $5.50, rice dish at $6.50 and stir fry noodle at $6.95, all came with coffee or tea.  We ordered a stir fry noodle and a curry soup noodle.  The portion was quite generous.  The stir fry was well done because it was not too oily.  It was tasty and had many shrimps.  I ate half and pack half home, and I was still full for the lunch.  My co-worker's soup noodle looked really red in color instead of curry in color, but she said it was not very spicy.  She could not finish the whole bowl either for lunch.  The milk tea was okay.

The food came out very fast (food court speed), and the services was okay.  I noticed that there were not sufficient condiment sets as my table didn't have a set, and the table next to mine only had a bottle of sugar, no salt or pepper.  I hope this would improve later.

All in all, Yiu's food tastes okay and the portion is good.  They use respectable amount of protein in the dishes.  The venue is clean enough.  It is great for a quick lunch.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Yiu's Chinese Cuisine is another new Hong Kong Style cafe just opens up in this plaza. 

More choices for me to dine in as a lone diner especially they offers all day special that includes a drink at $4.95! 

A lot of choices should able to make every one happy.

Beef Ball & Fish Ball Soup Noodle ($5.50) was quite standard but the Milk Tea was meh. Tea was not served hot enough and tasted like it been sitting around for awhile. 

Service though is really friendly and polite.

The elevator background music is really annoying... scream....."}
