{"text":"Finally!  A place with great tasting food for the right price and service. The restaurant sparkles with cleanliness while offering a welcoming seating environment.  I'll be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cozy sunday brunch; ordered the chicken omlette and was far better than expected. Service was super fast (little too fast than expected) and the staff is very nice. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast. The staff are very good. The food was great and we got it really quickly. Lots of coffee and we never had to ask for a refill. The price was quite reasonable. It will be our go to spot."}
{"text":"Simply amazing quality of food and service. I recommend the soup of the day because they use all fresh ingredients and flavor is outstanding  .Long story short you won't be disappointed and the owners are great people and on site helping out everyday."}
{"text":"It's your average breakfast place. There wasn't anything that \"wowed\" me in comparison to other places I've been to. Would I come back? Probably not for breakfast but I'd like to try their lunch options which looked much better!

I ordered the turkey bacon breakfast. The turkey bacon was cooked really well, I enjoyed that! However, the eggs were still a little slimy for my liking (i ordered over easy) and home fries were not crispy enough, they were not browned at all, it was as if they were just boiled then cut into cubes. I looked around to see everyone else's and it looked inconsistent, some were cooked to brown and crispy, others looked like mine. I was pretty bummed about that. 

My husband ordered the hungry man breakfast and felt like it wasn't true to its name. It really didn't seem like that much food. Compared to other breakfast places, we found that it's a little pricier for what you get. And his home fries were cooked like mine. 

Again, would I come back? No, not for breakfast. But next time I'd like to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the peameal eggs benedict (medium poached eggs), which was good. Wouldn't say it knocked it out of the park. Tastes like any other breakfast joint. Service was quick, and our server was friendly. The home fries aren't crispy. They're really soft...bit soggy on the inside like it was boiled."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for breakfast.  Consistently friendly service and good food.  Frequent top ups of coffee makes for a perfect breakfast place!  This time around we ordered omelettes and they gave my SO the option to substitute tomatoes and cucumber slices for the hash browns.  Omelettes came out fresh and hot off the grill.  What a nice way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Dead Thursday morning but barely any service.
I asked for medium well eggs, gave me runny yolk eggs, which I hate. Had a total of one refill for dine in coffee and was going to stay for another cup, but she confirmed I can do take out coffee after handing me the bill which I didn't ask for. Charged me another cup of coffee for take out coffee, argued with me over it when I inquired why my change was less than expected, this was after I gave her a 30% tip.. I would have gone elsewhere for coffee if I knew she was going to charge me for a bland cup, even Tim Horton's coffee is cheaper with a bigger size. As someone with extensive customer service experience, it was my first and last time here, never coming back."}
{"text":"This was a first visit with our family. The waitress-owner was pleasant and genuine as she took orders from adults and kids. The potatoes were on the oily side but the omelette dish, classic breakfast, and kiddie pancakes were delish. All the dishes came out together so nobody had to wait for their meal. Again, the waitress made this visit so nice that we will return in the future!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! It just opened, everything is so clean! The staff is super friendly, and always makes sure that you are satisfied! The breakfast is delicious! I love the waffles because they don't even require butter! The steak was a nice piece and it was cooked to perfection! The price was reasonable, and overall such a good experience. The early bird special is great for the amount of food you get. The food has really nice presentation. I had an veggie omelette to go, and they added so much vegetables to it, it was so good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh healthy food, with a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Can order convenient takeout or bring the whole family, they do their best to accommodate. Very reasonable prices so I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little diner for breakfast fare. The prices aren't dirt cheap but not expensive either. The staff is always lovely. And the food prep is fast. They even have gluten free bread. I enjoy the omelettes and the bacon egg plates. The food is scrumptious and plentiful. I've been back a few times and I've never had a bad plate. The location has tons of parking. If you love breakfast than you'll love this place"}
{"text":"Had the 2 pancakes with eggs and home fries. Made sure to ask for the home fries to be crispy - for some reason the server had to ask us 3 times to be sure we wanted it \"deep fried\" and was pushing us to have it grilled instead \"because it tastes better\". Just give us what we ask for, please.

The service was friendly although slow - I asked to place our order and upon saying \"sure\" the server proceeded to leave and do a few other things (bring drinks to another table, bring the bill to another table, take an order for a different table, bring the card machine to the table she gave the bill to) before finally taking our order.

The eggs tasted fresh and were quite tasty but the pancakes were chewy as if reheated rather than made fresh to order. The home fries were good (crispy like we wanted).

An OK breakfast place overall."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  My office is moving to the neighbourhood and I need a decent breakfast place to meet clients. Stopped In to try the Sunbeam Grill. 
Very clean, organized and quick. I like organized. Even the drinks in the cooler were all lined up facing out.  I like it.  Everything fresh made.  

Good work. Seen you again soon."}
{"text":"Sunbeam Grill is located in a plaza off Dundas next to Home Depot. It's relatively new and I spotted it while looking for the Smitty's that I subsequently remembered had been replaced by a Sleep Country a while ago. So what's the problem with Sunbeam.

Well to start with the food is not great; at least not the Hungryman Breakfast we shared which came with 3 eggs, 2 bacon strips, sausages, peameal bacon and 2 pancakes (or French Toast). The meats appeared to be cooked a few hours earlier and warmed. The pancakes came out 5 minutes after the rest of the meal and were crispy on the outside and uncooked on the inside.

It might be best to summarize what we thought were the pros and cons:

Pros
- Good parking
- Clean new interior
- Friendly (sit-anywhere-you-want) staff
- Comfortable chairs

Cons
- Temperature drops about 20 degrees each time the outside door opens
- Food is not fresh or well cooked (at least not ours)
- The mug (for my tea) smelled like a commercial dishwasher
- Toast (which we didn't know came with the meal) was slathered in butter
- Fruit salad tasted like it was scooped with a ladle used to scoop grill food

I'm sure this place will get better in time, but right now, I imagine they are going through some start-up issues."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. The service was good but got a bit slower as they got busier."}
{"text":"This was a better then decent breakfast a quaint decent spot. The food was better then average & the server was pleasant & attentive. I'd definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Our favourite breakfast place in town! Simple, delicious and well made food!!! Never thought I'd be a breakfast person until I ate here. We love this place! Our favourite dishes are the steak and eggs and the hashed corn beef!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Sunbeam since shortly after they opened. The place is very clean and bright and we're always greeted the moment we enter the restaurant.

The service is just great! As I said, we're always greeted immediately and the waitress brings menus as soon as we're seated. Our drinks arrive right after we order and I don't think I've ever waited for more than 5 minutes for our food to arrive. 

We've had several different dishes here (all breakfast). The Benedicts are always delicious, made with 3 eggs which are always cooked to perfection (we like them runny) and the Hollandaise is very good and plentiful. The home fries are always crisp and well-seasoned and when we've had sausage and bacon they've also always been cooked perfectly and taste great. 

I honestly can't find one thing to criticize. The washrooms are spotless, just like the rest of the place. I visited here with work friends one day and every one of them (I think there were 10 of us) agreed that the food and service were great. 

They have a really great early bird special with 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, home fries and toast for $5.99 if you're there before 10:00 a.m.  Can't beat that price!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast yesterday and it was nice and quiet. It was only us and one other table in a fair sized breakfast joint. I liked that even if the restaurant were full, the tables seemed spaced out comfortably. I find in some breakfast places you are almost sitting on your neighbours. 

The menu was also a good size. Not overwhelming. Very reasonably priced as well. I got a simple 3 eggs with ham and hashbrowns. Delicious and not overly greasy!

Customer service was pleasant and very accommodating. We will return!"}
{"text":"Don't really get all the hype for this place to be honest. Went here because we saw the stellar reviews, and while I did enjoy my meal (and my waitress was LOVELY!), it tasted like every other diner I've ever been too. I'm rarely in the area (had my driving test that day so I made the trek up to Oakville) but I'd probably try somewhere else before going there again, though if I wanted a decent diner option I wouldn't rule it out. They also serve alcohol there, if that's a deciding factor!"}
{"text":"I used to go into Erindale cafe regularly and was upset when it closed. I was thrilled to hear Kim and her husband opened a new location. The staff is friendly, Kim gets to know her customers and remembers what they like. It has a very personal feel. The restaurant is clean and bright. The food is always fast and reliably good. Great pancakes. They poach my eggs just right. My nieces and nephew, Abby, Mackenzie and Connor all love going there and Kim knows exactly what they like. It's nice to see personal service is still important these days."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of breakfast places or breakfast at all. Ben & Florentine is decent, but still doesn't make me want to eat there or have breakfast, plus it's expensive. But this place is a different story.

I've come here twice now and I plan on coming many more times. Both times I've been greeted by the same very friendly waitress, who has been very attentive and speedy. The place is well lit, clean and feels inviting.

Onto the food! I've ordered the same thing twice because the first time was amazing and I needed to know if the food was consistent. It was. The bacon is some of the best cooked bacon I've ever had, the eggs were perfect and the home fries were also perfect. I will update this review if that changes, but for now 5/5."}
