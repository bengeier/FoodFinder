{"text":"After my bad review, I got a personal email from the owner acknowledging my comments and sincerely apologizing.  Wow, that was the first time this has happened to me.  I didn't respond, but instead just made my way back in, anonymously.  
So, I still love the crab cakes and Mary and Nikki are even better than before and this time the whole place seemed to have a better vibe.  Was it my review?  NO!!! LOL.  Maybe I just spoke too soon on a new place in town.
Being an older crowd in Fountain Hills (I am 15 years younger than almost all of my neighbors) it is an odd thing to have a DJ spinning on a weekend - but as fuddy duddy as I am for my age, doesn't mean it isn't just what the doctor ordered for some.
John - thanks for reaching out to me.  I wish you the best with Fountini's and just know that you haven't lost my business."}
{"text":"Fountini's is our favorite Fountain Hills restaurant.  We eat there at least once a week, usually on Fri. nights.  The daily Happy Hour house wine is very good & only $3.00!  The staff is friendly & efficient, especially Bruce.  The chef is great with lots of tasty specialties.  We really enjoy Dave Karl's music on Friday nights.  He's a real crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"I went to Fountini's on a Monday night around 6:30 pm. The service was good, as my party and I were just getting a glass of wine. The fact that they serve house wine for $3 during Happy Hour, it's hard to go anywhere else. The house Cabernet was exceptionally good. (Maybe it was the $3 speaking.)

The reasons why I can't give 5 stars is the place cleared out and we were left with a small family that let their children run all over the place. A little girl was up at the bar for a minute, and then prancing around the dance floor. Mom was yelling at both her, the son, AND the father to all get a grip. This was incredibly awkward, especially since I was trying to have a relaxing conversation. I'm guessing if there were more customers, none of this would have gone down. As it seemed like the wait staff didn't care because the place was empty.

In addition, the place cleared out. COMPLETELY. So my party of 2 had the place all to ourselves. This was uncomfortable. Truthfully, I think with their Happy Hour and $3 glasses of wine, friendly staff and service, and nice atmosphere, it is unacceptable to have only 2 people in there during dinner time. 

Again, $3 glasses of good wine. Why aren't more people taking advantage of this?"}
{"text":"This place is fun, especially on karaoke nights! If you're in the Fountain Hills area, you already have very few options for night life, but Fountini's does give you something to do out on a Saturday night, if you don't want to drive far. 

They are pretty creative with what they do with their events with things such as kids karaoke. 

The food is ok, it's bar food, however it is above average bar food. The drinks are made strong and they are really good at maintaining a fun atmosphere. 

Now onto the bad side: On weeknights, sometimes it feels like they just don't care. They go as far as stopping karaoke early and Last Call is at a ridiculous 9:30 PM!

Great weekend place, look elsewhere for weeknights."}
{"text":"Fish and Chips is always a family favorite, so we finally decided to try this place on a Sat night. Surprisingly, we were the only people in the dinning room. Few people sat around the bar, but place was dead...which I didnt mind really. Our waiter (since we were the only diners) was very attentive. We ordered the Crab Cakes and Artichokes & Spinach dip for starters. Crab cake was average and so was the DIP. The presentation was very nice. I did like the sauce that came with the crab cakes, but for $13 the two crab cakes were rather small, Certainly not worth $13 dollars.
We ordered Fish and Chips for all 4 of us. The portion was very small. Maybe 10 long chips in each plate...which I didn't mind because I need to lay of the fries, but for $12 I expected more...Now for the main reason we were there....the Fish...Firstly the sign of good Fish is obviously the fish quality but the Batter is very important too...I hate it when the batter is too thick. This was lighted battered golden brown. I was fortunate and got the center pieces but my wife and daughter got the tin tail end pieces which was really more batter than fish. I am split about whether I will be back, I may but if I do I will certainly ask for the center pieces of the fish. In the mean time I will continue to search for Fish and Chips in the valley. Overall I rate this place as OK.."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I were exhausted from a long move to Ft Hills and wanted a dark quick place to grab a burger and maybe a game on tv.  A friend suggested this place so we gave it a try.  Very dark windows as we walked thru the door hid the minimalist bar and eating area. Simply done, greeted by the hippie dippie weather man (cool guy) and quickly took our drink order, served them and then dinner orderl The tunes were jukebox and then a two man gutair group set up and began performing.  Great music, so so vocals..but an A+ for effort.  My steak panini was generous and done the way I wanted, the fries were a bit limp,  Sweetie's cheeseburger must have been tasty because he ate it very quickly, We laughed, we sang, we had fun!"}
{"text":"Had a blast last night at Fountini's... I had the petite filet and it was amazing!  Karaoke with Kim and Deb was so much fun.  The staff are always so friendly and its definitley one of my top choices when I go out!"}
{"text":"What a disaster.  Horribly managed on a Friday night.  Something I ordered never made it to the table and I had to leave after 40+ min of waiting.  Server said she had to \"get her manager\" to remove the charge!

Empty drinks, generally ignored, even when not that busy.

The place is designed poorly, with the servers always down at one end of the bar and running back and forth, etc.

Had a lot of fun here in the past but whoever was managing on 1/27 needs to go."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends or even family if they like a fun time!  The prices here are reasonable and drinks are made right.  Always have a good time when I come here.  Great live music on Saturday  nights!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 6 after an outing to Saguaro Lake as it was on the way home. The food (crusted Walleye special) was REALLY Great and the service was good too! AND when the Karaoke started and we thought it would be time to leave, we were pleasantly surprised that it was a hang out for GOOD singers!! LOL!!!  Very casual and friendly atmosphere and a lot of fun. We even got up and danced on the stage (which was not being used as there is only live music mostly in the winter season when there are more winter residents)!!  It was well worth the detour into Fountain hills and finding it......."}
