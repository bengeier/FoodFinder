{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! I had the spicy tuna salad and was not expecting what I got. It was a wonderful suprise! The spicy dressing was not overpowering and did not take away from my tuna. I will definately eat there again and again! The service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"24 Aug 2012  Quiet, romantic or family style restaurant serving excellent COOKED sushi; salads; appetizers; soups; meat entrees as well as raw/sashimi.  Prices are reasonable, portions are good; service is 'fast as possible'.  Our friends love either Lunch or Dinners here.  Serve saki, wines, ETC.  Best kept 'secret' in the valley!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My family has had sushi from places all over the valley, and we just keep coming back here! It's such a comfortable, quiet place with excellent food at reasonable prices. Oh, and if you want something warm in addition to your Sushi, they make this unbelievable seafood bake. I can't remember exactly what it's called, but ask for \"shrimp bake\" and they'll know what you're talking about. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"I don't always remember to leave reviews unless I have a particularly good experience - or a particularly bad one.  My dining experience at Sakura was a very positive one, so I logged onto Yelp to write about it and was shocked that some customers had left negative reviews.  I sampled several items, beginning with a crab and avocado salad that was not on the menu but had just been prepared and was suggested by the server.  The flavors were light and delicate, and the salad was cool and refreshing - just the thing on a hot sunny day in Arizona.  I love the graceful touches that good Japanese chefs use when serving food.  The salad came with several slices of finely sliced fresh apple - the contrast of the red peel against the other pastels on my plate was an unexpected visual treat that I really appreciated.  I ordered an assortment of sushi rolls (I can't remember what they were now), but everything was extremely fresh.  So many sushi places in this area tasty stale and fishy - but this was what as good as any I've had in San Francisco.  The service was gracious and friendly.  They didn't ignore me, but they also didn't hover or hurry.  It was a relaxing and pleasant experience.    I'll be back - over and over again, and I'll be sure to take out of town guests when they come for a visit."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate sushi there last Friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning!!!  This place needs to close ASAP!!!  YOU risk your life if you EAT THERE!!!  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...first off I traveled all the way to Fountain Hills for this one. I felt like Survivor Man going way up there. If it wasn't for my friends treating me I don't think I would have gone...but enough of me complaining about the trip there.   This place isn't really much to look at I'll be honest. We were seated promptly and the waitress was really nice. We started off by ordering some teriyaki chicken sticks that pretty much had no flavor at all. So by now I was worried about the sushi. To my surprise the sushi was actually pretty good...not great but good. The prices were fair and the service was ok too. The only thing that was weird was when I went to the bathroom it was located outside the restaurant...like close to the ally. It's safe to say that as long as I didn't get food poisoning it was a good night but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  Friendly and accommodating.  They treat you like old friends even the first time you go.  I personally like the smallish atmosphere.  Food is wonderful!  Love the spicy tuna salad!"}
{"text":"I love Sakura Inn!  It may not be a dress up kind of sushi bar, but the sushi is great!  The best part is that they give you a decent amount of sushi for the money.  The waiter is very nice and he always remembers what you order.  He does a great job at customer service.  If you go there try the Neptune roll, yummy!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent small owned business.  First I want to say that I lived in Japan for 5 years.    The waiters were very nice.  They weren't rude at all.  The Japanese run their businesses like a business and get things done.    The sushi was excellent.  Way better then what I get at Whole Foods!  My parents LOVED the grilled salmon with rice and a small salad.  Mom got the small salmon, which was only slightly smaller then the large (enough for a woman's portion) and had a scoop of white rice.  My Dad got the large salmon which had a fair sized piece of salmon with a bowl of rice (of which I got most of ^_^  Score!)    My mom couldn't stop talking about the green tea!  It was just as she remembered in Japan and she has tried many green teas since.  She would go back for just the tea.  Heck, we're going there tomorrow.    For the most part, in Japan they automatically add of 9-35% tip, depending on the group size.  This was 18% and I would have given them 20%."}
{"text":"Real Japanese food prepared by Japanese in Fountain Hills. Their sushi boat is excellent. Just had dinner there on Satirday"}
{"text":"Great service , Great food- Authentic Japanese Food !! I travled in Japan several times and knew what is the authentic Japanese food.  Sakura Inn 's chef is from Japan and is a real good chef. He is making the authentic sushi~Yummi. All seafood there is fresh !! The menu had such a large selection of great sushi, and if you don't know how to order it. ASK the owner !!  The service was wonderful. We enjoyed everything from start to finish, what a great place!  We will return back to that restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Shame on you. The most disgusting sushi I have ever had in my life.  --beep beep edamame is still raw even after nuking (I should have fled when I heard it) --didnt think it was possible to ruin a Philly roll but you can if the cream cheese is RANCID!! --gari tastes of dishwasher rinse agent --nigiri rice is WARM under almost frozen hamachi!! --salmon wilted and old --retail grade maguro (House of Rice).  All cashier/server could say after our complaints and charging full price was \"would you like your receipt?\" $60 FOR THE WORST SUSHI OF MY LIFE.   PFFU^% OFF AND DIE!!!  I only made it down the street to the Safeway where I had to pull over and PUKE!! Faded salmon and RANCID CREAM CHEESE!!!  Wishing I could \"unlike\" C.N., Pam S. and MiMi P., after whose reviews I ventured to Sakura on Faith. SHAME ON YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, tiny but effective Japanese joint operated by Japanese immigrants who care about their food and customers. Is the service that of a 5* place? No, but it's great food & hospitality."}
