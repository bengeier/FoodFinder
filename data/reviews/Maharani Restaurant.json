{"text":"The lunch buffet is awesome! You can get mild, American-friendly dishes like chicken tikka masala and more authentic fares, such as goat meat. The buffet alOfws you to try tastes of everything, and go back and get more of what you love. 

The naan is delicious and the tikka masala is the perfect thing for a cold day. I know it's not something that is typically done, but one of my favorite things to eat at Maharani is a few of the gulab jamun with some mango ice cream in the same dish. Lovely combination of textures, and hot and cold. So tasty, and the perfect way to end a meal!

I would probably visit just for the smells!

Service is good, water glasses are constantly filled and plates are cleared quickly."}
{"text":"Been back.  They had some kind of lamb dish on the buffet.  I love lamb so I fished the meat out and just ate that, the onion chutney (it's a nice moderate spice level), naan, and rice.  I think I put away about 2 lbs of lamb.  So for 9 dollars - that's not a bad deal.  

Only problem - you can't predict when they'll have the lamb and when they won't.  

bah"}
{"text":"Masala sauce made out of CANNED TOMATO SOUP.

What other CANNED stuff are their sauces made out of?
Charging customers for $15 for an masala entree when the main attraction (the Sauce) is made out of CANNED TOMATO SOUP is outrageous.

Do I really need to say more? 
I won't comment on the service, atmosphere, etc because it doesn't really matter after finding out the sauce is made of of a CANNED TOMATO SOUP."}
{"text":"One of the few Indian places that actually made me happy on the spice scale, and pushed my envelope. They gave me plain rice, not basmati, which was confusing. otherwise, great service and quality food. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I used to like it a lot more and frequented Maharani while I live downtown. I love their Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Grilled Fish, and various forms of curries, especially the lamb and beef. Their naan and house made mango ice-cream top my list of favorites too. 

However, on one occasion after a meal I felt super thirsty throughout the entire afternoon, and had to keep drinking water non-stop. Not the greatest feeling after a buffet. Since then I haven't been back for a while.

Recently my lab had a craving for Indian buffet and they talked me into giving it another try. The food was good, but the feeling of addiction in the past didn't kick in. There are many others in the community, my friends included, who love Maharani. Personally I don't see myself going back in a (long) while. I know this is not going to be particularly helpful but I would suggest people to go once and decide for yourself if this is for you. And it will help too to go with an open mind and try the wide spread of food they have on offer. And if you do go I will be happy to hear any thoughts =)"}
{"text":"I've never ate in this restaurant but have had delivery from it a few times and it is quickly becoming when I want Indian and don't want to step outside. Decent food and they deliver when they say they will, what else do you want from delivery?"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Madison! Really fast and friendly service whether you eat in for dinner or lunch buffet or get take out. In a perfect world, I would have their fluffy buttery naan with every meal every day of my life."}
{"text":"Had the lamb tiki masala and was tasty... naan very good as well. Nothing fancy at this spot, but good food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Horrible service attitude of the wait staff !! Only one guy keeps running around and the lady who just keep folding napkins and stares at you even if  you are ready to order, doesn't care and calls herself a manager.
Owners - just don't count on your food , fix your service"}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here. We were told it would take 45 minutes. After an hour we called and they said the driver had already left and would be five to ten more minutes. Twenty minutes later we called back and were told the same thing. The driver finally showed up an hour and 40 minutes after we placed the order, and were lied to out right twice. We live 10 minutes from the restaurant. 

The reason I gave it two instead of one star is because the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Good food, quaint location.  We usually order take out - butter chicken and a nan.  Always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Overall the lunch buffet was good, but there were a few problems. I was there about 12:30 and every table was filled in the front section, but the food was not being replenished appropriately.  There were a few empty dishes, and one of the vegetable fritter dishes only had sauce left and no vegetable fritters. The chicken tikka was very dry and also cold. A few of the dishes seemed to be a little more soupy/thin compared to what I have had before. However I did like the manchurian cauliflower and channa masala. I prefer Swagat or Maharajah for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I am a small, white girl, but I'd like to think I know my Indian food. Indian is my favorite type of food and I've eaten a fair share (homemade and in restaurants). And I have to say, Maharani made my tummy very happy. 

Atmosphere - nothing fancy. They could improve on it, but it is clean, spacious, comfortable.

Food - Delicious! I had samosa chaat, which was fabulous! It was the prefect combination of cool, spicy, crunchy and creamy. I had the garlic naan and the Malai Kofta, which was delicious as well. The veggie dumplings were good, had a nice consistency and the gravy was very flavorful. 

Service - Wonderful. They were attentive without being pushy. They were very kind and attentive even though we stayed long after we were finished.

Now I just need to go back to try a dosa!"}
{"text":"Went for the Saturday buffet and it was really bad.

The food was okay, which is the only thing that prevents a 1-star, but the service was atrocious. The waiters were very rude and incompetent. One of them dropped water on one of our plates and didn't bother replacing them - and this was just one of many problems here. None of the dishes were refilled even upon request and the atmosphere was one where it seemed they were just waiting for us to leave so they could lock and close the restaurant (which they did as soon as we set foot out into the lobby).

Horrible, will never go again."}
{"text":"Could be the best Indian lunch buffet I've been to anywhere - England and India included. Wonderful variety, excellent spicing (flavorful without being overpoweringly hot). I'm vegetarian, and most other Indian buffets don't have as many veggies and are long on starchy dishes. On my must-do list every time I visit Madison. Staff can have a somewhat indifferent attitude, but hey, it's a buffet. They keep everything well supplied and get me whatever I ask for. Don't need ego stroking, just good food. Sometimes parking close by can be difficult. You might have to walk half a block. No big deal."}
{"text":"Food was just ok(grew up with Indian food). Fly zooming around our table, insect control lacking ! Staff was friendly considerate about the special needs individual in our group."}
{"text":"Sometimes when i go to bed hungry I have dreams about the vegetable curry. It is so good! We've tried many Indian restaurants in Madison and Maharani is the best."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Madison so far and I have tried 4. Why? They have more selection and it's delicious. You get a basket of fresh toasted buttery naan and get more if you ask."}
{"text":"I wish I could give something less than 1. I thought only the food is worse, their service beats that..  Please   don't waste your money here.."}
{"text":"An excellent lunch buffet with wide variety and delicious food.  You really can't go wrong with the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The  all-you-can-eat buffet is fun for me as a hardy, yet mainly vegetarian eater. The well-dressed waiters may look slightly disapproving if you attempt to taste EVERYTHING in one lunch hour, but they will not block your path either.  Being less familiar with Indian cuisine, I would appreciate more translation of what the colorful dishes were steaming before me."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but they frequently lie about how long things will take. Be aware. They often don't make your food until you arrive if you do takeout."}
{"text":"The huge buffet was awesome for Indian.
There were a lot of choices to pick from and was tasty, including a malai kabob"}
{"text":"I love this place. Lunch buffet is pretty good, but sometimes I can't get what I want, so I often go for dinner too. My favorites are veg samosa - which I eat with onion chutney, and Paneer Tikka Masala - Hot, spicy one. LOVE IT LOVE IT! If you are a student, they give you 10% off- so please do use them. it's my top favorite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"The residential apartments above Maharani have serious cockroach problems."}
{"text":"I dont claim to be an expert on indian food, but i do love it and have eaten plenty enough to know what is good. Simply put the food here is good."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and usually get it from swagat on the far west side and they never disappoint. When I moved down town I decided to try this place out, and I was very disappointed. The naan was so tough, it clearly was very old. The samosas were old and soggy, and the rice was dry."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet.  I did like some things--the samosa, mango ice cream, and gulab jamun were excellent--but everything else was mediocre.  We live not far from Devon in Chicago, so we are probably spoiled.  Still, it was my least favorite meal on our vacation in Madison."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food.  It didn't have the depth of flavor, which I expect of typical Indian food.  My friend tried a couple of chicken dishes from the lunch buffet and some meat.  They were very, very dry.  Fish dish was not good, either.  I tried a couple of vegetable dishes: one was very salty, and another was nothing special.  Mirch Masala on the capitol square is far better."}
{"text":"I crave Indian food pretty regularly and I'm happy to know that there are a number of Indian restaurants in Madison to satisfy my craving.

The samosa, vegetable pakora, paneer (cheese) pakora are decent.  However, the Aloo Tikki (small spicy potato discs) is very tasty with the right amount of spices.

I LOVE Parantha (layered whole wheat bread made with melted butter) and the Maharani Parantha here are delicious and remind me of when I used to make these with mom.  You have to eat them right when they come out though because that's when they're the best - hot, buttery, crispy and tender.  

The Roti Naan is pretty good too.  Made exactly the way naan is (baked in a tandoor oven) except they use whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  

The Chicken Tikka Masala is delectable.  The sauce is orange colored, rich, creamy and has nice chunks of boneless chicken (could use more chunks of chicken).  This is also spiced really nicely.  You get a choice of mild, medium or hot for the level of spiciness in your dishes.  Medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hot.

The Palak Paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy, spicy and buttery.  This is really, really good.  The only thing about the dish is that the ginger pieces were a little overwhelming.

Dessert
Gulab Jamun (it's like a deep fried dounut hole soaked in sugar syrup) has been my favorite Indian dessert since childhood.  Not a lot of places know how to make this dessert right.  It has to be lite and airy not dense and hard.  Maharani makes it just right and hot off of the stove!  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"First , rather than commenting about the food I would to comment about the service which is atrocious. It's been 6 months I have been staying in Madison and visited this place three as it is near to my office. Every time I visit This place I see a weird look on the face of the people working over there , never the smile never the warmth. 

The lady working over there is the never smiling, always rude with customers and blabbering to herself . I do not want to comment about the food as this is one of the worst Indian food any one can taste in a lifetime. I had given even chances to this restaurant and I am done with them .

Never visiting them again"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is just awesome. It seems like something different is on the buffet every time we go. The water that heats the buffet is always steaming.

We really enjoy going here."}
{"text":"Came to Madison for the first time and on the first day went here. Did not dissapoint at all. Great food, affordable prices but the service was a bit off. I think they were a bit understaffed. Anyway a great experience altogether."}
{"text":"Maharani is always at the top of our to-eat list: the food, the service, the location, the FOOD! all make this a really top-notch Indian restaurant.  I know that the dinner menu is great, but we hardly ever make it here for dinner, just because the lunch buffet is so impressive and reasonably-priced (there's a student discount, too). The naan is baked fresh and brought right to your table, the chutneys and sauces complement the food nicely, the samosas are perfectly dense and crispy, and the spices in the main dishes are just right (even though I could probably take it a little spicier).  And the waiters are always so attentive--Preet is especially wonderful! I love Maharani!"}
{"text":"Was in Madison for a wedding and was staying at the Hyatt downtown which was across from this restaurant. Reviews were good so decided to try out the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a bigger than normal selection of items and most importantly it was all fresh. A lot of times indian buffets have food that feels like it is a day or two old but this place each and every item was fresh. The goat curry was da bomb, the meat was tender and the curry had the perfect zing to it. The tandoori chicken was extremely good and fresh and so was the chicken tawa tikka. They even had one indo-chinese item, i.e. chicken manchurian which most indian restaurants screw up really badly but this one was by far one of the best I've had (probably second only to the restaurants on Oak Tree in Edison, NJ). 

 I focused my attention on the non-veg but my wife is veg and she said the veg items were pretty good too. The paneer makhni was the only item she said wasn't all that. 

What else, hmm ... they have outdoor seating which is nice and the decor indoor is nice too. Oh yes, they have a good selection of Indian beers as well as Indian wines (which is rare)."}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars, but the service really brings it down.
                                                                                                                                                                      
We were there several times for lunch buffet and never try their dinner. The service has always been pretty inattentive and sometimes unwelcoming, so never will try dinner.

Their naan bread is super great, always made fresh, so sometimes you gotta wait a little bit; most dishes are above level good--their chicken dishes are tender most of the time. The use of spices is excellent and exotic. I never tried fried food and they do look a bit soggy but again I can't tell. Dessert is always the same but I'm not bothered by that.

This is not a huge buffet, but the food they offer is great.  I like it this way because one really doesn't eat that much.  
 
The thing we don't like is the service, as mentioned. Sometimes servers don't even smile and come and go without saying anything.  Plates on your desk remain there.       

I don't think their servers do that on purpose, it's probably just the Indian way? However that does make the dinning experience sometimes uncomfortable.      Another thing is, when the food is empty, refills are slow or missing. It happens on weekends as well, days you pay more.

We still come back because the food is still pretty good. It's just such a shame that                                                                                                                                                                                                              they would have been such a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are any reviews that are less than 5 stars for this place. I lived in Madison for a year and I ate at Maharani almost every week, sometimes for multiple meals.

This is my favorite Indian restaurant, and that's saying a lot. My mother grew up in India, and she and her parents agree that it's really excellent.

The lunch buffet is definitely the best time to go. Unlike many of Indian places that I've been, they do a great job of both having a LOT of options and changing them regularly.

The staff is very friendly, and they definitely remember their regulars. I always went with one friend and when he moved, they asked me for updates on how he was doing.

Take-out is great too, as it's usually filling enough to last for multiple meals."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection and  value for lunch buffet.  Service was prompt and friendly at a recent visit.  The naan was hot and delicious--our basket was never empty.  The restaurant is elegant and clean--with one exception.  One important suggestion to management:  PLEASE clean the blinds and window wells--really a health hazard with over half an inch of dust on slats and dust and debris below windows--right next to booths--gross. It was evident these windows and blinds have not been cleaned in at least a year."}
{"text":"We stopped by at this restaurant on way from Wisconsin dells to chicago.
Food was disgusting, pricey and very small quantity. We ordered chicken biryani which had only two small pieces of chicken and had no taste. Service was also dicriminatory for white and non white people. White oeople will get great service and also a hot towel to wash hands athe end of dinner. Non white will not get that service.
to sum up bad food and pricey. You could get better food  for that price. We strongly donot recomnend this place to anyone.

{"text":"This is my favorite place for brunch. They offer lunch buffet on Saturday and Sunday too."}
{"text":"Maharani! Maybe it's just that it's across the street from me, but I order from Maharani pretty much every chance I get. Definitely on par if not better than most other Indian restaurants I've eaten at, but in Madison it's often difficult to get good \"anything that isn't 'New American'\" (i.e. what you might term \"ethnic food\") that this place is such a gem. I do hope they continue to do well.

Go support them! You won't be disappointed (they're also on GrubHub/Seamless now).

Inside, it's darling and exactly what you would hope an Indian restaurant would look like. Totally worth a stop in.

The Gohbi Manchurian is out of this world."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with bf and his friend just last year thought it was gonna be good since we were craving for indian food. well the waiter was's very nice to us seems like they were ignoring us. it was almost as if they didn't want to come to our table. Well i guess you can't get good customer service anymore no matter where you go :(... Just because I was with 2 white guys just sad this world we live in now."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, though it's no Swad. Staff is either silent or rude. Not really any middle ground. I've been scolded here before and so has my child."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I carry-out their vegetable mixed curry at least once a week. A wonderful atmosphere for eating in as well. I'd also recommend the vegetable pakora!"}
{"text":"I had never ever tried Indian cuisine before coming to Maharani a year ago.  I don't know exactly how that happened given that in high school (and to this day) I was obsessed with Red Dwarf, and if chicken vindaloo was good enough for Dave Lister it sure as hell was good enough for me.  Yet throughout all of my years in college I never had the chance to have a proper curry.  Part of the reason had to be at that time there were no Indian restaurants downtown to my knowledge.  I knew about the ones on Odana but I never drove out that way, so they just remained on the long list of places to go someday.  I also spent a good deal of my later college years frequenting mostly Thai restaurants whenever I had enough scratch to get a proper meal.  So it somehow came to be that I entered my late twenties knowing only that I loved Thai curry, with a huge question mark relating to Indian food.

Fortunately I've got a good group of friends that would not let this aberration stand.  One rainy spring night last year we were all arguing about our respective favorites in town, and I let it be known that I'd never tried anything Indian save a curry-flavored ramen one unfortunate time.  We went to Maharani because it was their agreed upon favorite.  I can now say that it is also mine.  It was one of those times when you experience something that in retrospect you don't know how you ever got by without.  I liked everything about Maharani.  My chicken shahikorma, medium spice, was the perfect starting point.  On return trips, and there have been many, I've fallen in love with the chicken shahjahani, the lamb jalfrazie, and the paneer - Oh boy do I like the paneer.  Yet writing this review I realize the one thing that I've not done is the chicken vindaloo.  Next time, for sure.

I'm not usually downtown around lunch, so I've never tried the buffet.  It sounds interesting, but I've been told that the Odana restaurants are superior in this regard.  I can't say one way or another.  I would easily give Maharani five stars except for one drawback: the service can be frustratingly slow.  Sometimes it's exceptional, but more than a few times I've sat at the table, papadams long gone, spooning nibbles of the onion relish, with an empty bottle of Kingfisher, just waiting to order.  I like the place too much to ever stop going, but that kind of thing drives me crazy.  Still, even with the occassional wait I put Maharani at the top of my list of Madison favorites."}
{"text":"I've only been to the lunch buffet on Sundays, but I absolutely love the place.

I would say the variety of dishes is deserving of 4 stars, but the taste of the food, the service, and NFL games being played at the bar on Sundays jack the overall rating up to a 5 star.

Runs you about $10 per person but its worth every penny.  Got kind of busy around the 12:30pm time-slot."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to!  I've tried quite a few of their many vegetarian items, but always come back to the palak paneer and veggie pakora to start.  I'm typically not a fan of buffets, but Maharani keeps it very fresh.  The servers have always been very friendly to me, and I love the fact that the dining room is so quiet.  Also, there is actually a difference between mild spice, medium spicy, and hot spicy, which hasn't always been my experience at other restaurants."}
{"text":"While I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine I eat Indian fairly regularly all over the US. I like to compare my favorite dishes at different places and no place cooks every dish perfect therefore my review is based on the dishes I ate. 
I ate here on a Saturday night and it was not crowded, no wait. The decor and ambiance is like most Indian restaurants not exactly pleasing mostly slightly worn out and not too tidy. The staff was not exactly brimming with enthusiasm but, were OK. The food was good I had Mulligatawny soup Chicken Tikka Masala and plain naan and everything tasted very good. Over all a pleasant experience.  I will definitely come back when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Would never suggest to anyone. Disappointed with this place. Could not have even a single thing even when I was starving..!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Indian restaurant in town. Just did their buffet on Saturday, and I was not disappointed. I tried so many different items, but one that stuck out to me was their butter chicken. YUM. They bring over your nann to you in a basket, which I appreciate, because it means the bread is not just sitting out on the line getting dried out. Their mango ice cream is also great. 

Also ordered a mango lassi, which had a great mango-yogurt balance going on, and was not overly sweet. 

Service is efficient and friendly, but not overly so as I've seen in some Indian places around Madison, where you take one sip of water and have a waiter rushing over to refill your glass."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with a colleague from work (who is Indian) as we were attending a conference.  The Hilton front desk referred us to come here for Indian.

The place had maybe 3-4 other tables with people so it was pretty empty.  When we asked for suggestions, neither the male or female waiters had any suggestions at all.  The waiters seemed disinterested and didn't smile.  They seemed unhappy working there and couldn't care less about the customers.  In conclusion, the service was awful.  

The food was mediocre.  I've had much better Indian food at most other Indian restauarants, but I thought it was okay.  We had the chicken tikki masala and chicken vindaloo.  The mango lassi was soso.  The garlic naan was good.  My colleague said none of the food was authentic or tasted good.  He even told the waiter this at the end of the meal (the waiter didn't seem to care).

As a side note, the waiter made a mistake serving the wrong dish to another table as well as messed up another table's check.  One patron actually started yelling at him in from of the entire restaurant about how poor the service was and the restaurant staff didn't seem to care at all.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are better Indian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The roach wasn't THAT big. Maybe thumbnail sized. I mean, I've seen ones in other countries the size of my entire thumb, so this was a lil' guy in comparison.

Mind you, that happened at the end of the meal so perhaps I should start at the beginning. 

We've been to Maharani countless times over the years. The food is usually good, the service is usually pretty lackluster.  However, this place has held a warm spot in my heart because it was one of our first date spots so we like to come back & reminisce.  

On this particular evening the service was worse than usual. We had to remind them we had ordered drinks, they brought out a completely wrong entree for the Mister, and the naan bread finally came out halfway through the meal. SIGH.  I think part of the service problem here is that they seem to do a team approach instead of sticking with assigned sections. So things just seem to fall by the wayside and who knows. Was this all foreshadowing what was to come?!  Perhaps. 

We finished eating & the server cleared away our plates. As she walked away I looked down to see a cockroach scurry across the table. It seemed to have been hiding under my plate.  The Mister, aghast, promptly trapped the rascal under a napkin and waited for the server to come back. She returned (to bring us our to-go boxes) and he lifted the napkin to show her the offending critter. She gasped and scooped it all up and went into the back. 

The Mister & I just stared at each other, incredulous. We figured this would be interesting... how would they handle it?  Would our dinner be comped? Would a manager come out, very apologetic?  

Soon after, she returned and informed us that pest control had been here earlier that day (presumably this was the excuse/explanation for why the roaches were on the run). She promptly handed us our bill and advised us she'd given us 20% off, explaining she'd only done that much since we'd already eaten our dinner.

SCREEEEEEEECCCCCHHH!   Wait.A.Minute.Here  So, what I'm understanding is that depending on at what point during your meal you have the bad experience, your discount will reflect that.  Good thing we didn't order dessert... if the roach had waited to show it's face until then it might have only been 5% off! 

I get it, restaurants can have roaches and many of them around town probably do. (Ick. I can't think about it too much or I'll end up a hermit). Regardless, it's pretty unusual for them to turn up on your table and what's critical after an incident like this is staff response which, disappointingly, was sorely lacking here."}
{"text":"Recent dinner experience at the Maharani was somewhat disappointing, It was crowded, but no excuse for the barely courteous service, dishes ordered not being delivered, etc. My mixed vegetable curry was hot, but lacked the subtle mix of spices that goes into good Indian cuisine. The vegetables were overcooked,lacked flavor. My dining companion was similarly underwhelmed by his lamb dish. Perhaps best to stick with the lunch buffet here. If they continue to offer dinner, they should ramp up the quality of the cooking and the service."}
{"text":"Amazing variety on the lunch buffet, restaurant was lovely and very clean.  Delicious options for everyone!"}
{"text":"Indian food is not Madison's strength, but this is probably the best one I've visited, especially compared to some real tragedies around Mineral Point Road, Park Street, etc. Buffet is great. I once went with a group of people, and we didn't get our food for like 2 hours, which sucked, so I've only eaten at the buffet since."}
{"text":"Ah, Maharani... you might be my new comfort food.  Indian food has never really been my thing, but am guessing I've either ordered wrong or been to some pretty bad Indian restaurants.  Went for the first time last week with a group of four people, one of whom dines there fairly frequently.  Very attentive, unobtrusive service.  I've been craving the Butter Chicken & Palak Paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) scooped up with the garlic naan every day since my visit.  So much so, that I need to end my review and go get some carry out."}
{"text":"Windows, loads of natural light, large buffet, attractive dining area, reasonable price. Good start, Huh? I joined a friend for buffet lunch on MLK Day. The place was hopping with the young and those of us that have been on this planet over 50 years. The temperature was dropping like a stone and the flurries were beginning to fly. Perfect day to over eat.

The buffet was chock full of different dishes some of which I had not seen before. There was a dish made from puffed rice and chopped onions along with other veggies. Very tasty, crispy treat. I had some tandoor chicken, goat masala, biryani, a veggie somosa,a really excellent yellow dal, and some other dishes which were equally as pleasing. 

The food was good but not outstanding. The service was fine. The price was right. Would I do it again? Yes. Might I prefer Maharaja? Yes. I find their dishes to be more distinctive and full flavored.My recent visit to Dhaba set the bar high. My love of Anmol in Milwaukee will never be surpassed. But variety Is the spice of life and there is room for the Maharani buffet on my spice rack.

Try it, You'll like it."}
{"text":"The food is really great. I can't tell you whether it is authentic, but it doesn't scream fake Americanized indian food. It also doesn't scream obsessively authentic is a way that will be distracting. It is that happy medium - somewhere between exotic and comforting.

Warm, creamy, rich, curries to die for on a winter day (so, six months per year).

The naan is awesome.

The mango lassis...mmm."}
{"text":"I haven't even received the food yet and I'm already motivated to write a review.  I ordered food for delivery around 7pm and was told it would arrive around 8.  It is now 8:40.  I called the restaurant a few minutes ago and was told the food \"might be on the way.\"  The person I spoke with on the phone was not fluent enough in English to tell me when my food might be arriving.  Do not order food from here for delivery on a Friday night and expect it to be delivered to you in a timely fashion.  It must be noted that I live about 2 blocks away from the restaurant.

I called and was told we would not be charged for our order since it was so late.  Then, the delivery person not only charged me the full amount, but did not have enough cash to offer me change.

WILL NEVER ORDER FOOD FROM THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.

Food is cold.  We will be sure to tell all our friends to never order from here!!!  Awful!!!

Ruined our entire night!! No flavor and not worth ever getting food from.

In addition, the food caused my boyfriend to have explosive diarrhea about 30 minutes after eating it.  Shameful on the part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best indian food in Madison according to me. I have been thee 3 times and also had their lunch buffet, it was all good. The place looks decent too. Service is nice. The only downside is that the staff isn't friendly. They are 'uptight', I don't know I don't have the right words. But, at times, it feels just business and no smiling and making the guest comfortable like in other restaurants. All in all, a good combo of everything. Worth visiting !"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was huge and excellent. No lamb dishes when I was there, though, to my disappointment. But I keep having excellent meals there every time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch buffet! They have a wide variety for lunch and it's all perfectly spiced. I love my spices, and I've noticed that some restaurants have that right tip of the hand with their spices, while others completely miss; and Maharani has it right.

I could literally eat their coconut chutney, paneer, chicken tikka masala and naan all day long (I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I did, since I ended up waddling out of there with a plump food baby...) 

My only very small gripe is that my friend had ordered a mango lassi, and we were well into our second plates until someone finally stopped by to clear our table, that I could order a drink for myself and we could check on my friend's drink order."}
{"text":"In previous years, I've had better experience with Maharani. This time we went for Saturday lunch buffet, and I have to say I was disappointed. The food was okay, though the Chicken Tikka Masala had very dry and chewy chicken. The staff was friendly but inattentive at the same time. I had to ask three times for more naan, and by the time we got some more (~20 minutes, and the restaurant was only half-full), my dish was completely cold.
My biggest concern was, however, that they stop refilling dish pans around 1:30pm - despite the fact that they are open until 3pm for lunch. I understand that they don't want too much leftovers, but then remove the empty pans and the name of the dish so the customer doesn't feel like  she's been cheated. It's really disheartening to walk up to the dessert rack only to find that out of originally eight options you have only two left to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch/Lunch buffet on Sunday. Overall I think it's OKAY Indian food, definitely decent value for the $12 buffet price!

They had a somewhat decent variety of foods. There is a small salad section, and you have the option of a variety of meats (breaded fish, tandoori chicken and etc...). There are a couple of Indian specific apps like vegetable samosa. There were also a couple of options for curry (maybe 4 or 5), and my go to is always the butter chicken or the tikka masala. A waiter also comes around and serves you naan

The desserts (if you have room after a couple of plates of goodies) are also decent as well. I had the mango ice cream, rice pudding

I'd be curious to come back and try their normal menu. I would consider this somewhat americanized indian food, but I enjoyed various plates. I hadn't had anything that was super spicy here."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to come on a date or for a nice conversation with friends. The food is excellent, from the appetizers right down to the mango ice cream. 

We got the $40 non-veggie meal for 2, and it was amazing. Very good, decently priced place to bring a date for a romantic night.

Service is also very good and polite."}
{"text":"One of my Madison-area friends has been on an Indian food kick ever since I suggested my Milwaukee go-to, Royal India. I'd never had Indian in Madison before, but Yelp has only rarely steered me wrong, so I trusted the judgment of the locals and my friend, my new girlfriend (who was with me on a day-trip to Madtown), and I settled on Maharani, right downtown. 

Indian restaurants seem to either be very formal or extremely casual. I can't speak for the place during their buffet (which, just looking at the size of it as they were cleaning up, looks formidable), but at least during our visit they seemed to err towards the formal side. That was definitely my first impression, so be prepared.

Waitstaff was polite, but distant. No points gained or lost there. Just standard operating procedure.

I ordered the goat curry, served spicy and bone-in. I figured something more basic would give me a gauge to work from if and when I return. I can definitely recommend the dish; it's very flavorful and the goat is tender and despite being covered in a really flavorful sauce, retains a little bit of that rich, slightly gamey flavor that the meat is known for.

My dining partners had the lamb curry (hot, just like mine) and chicken curry (ordered mild), which I sampled. Of the two, I definitely preferred the lamb--although that may have been due to spice level--but the chicken curry would be a good introduction to Indian food.

As I mentioned before, I don't have much to compare Maharani to in terms of Madison's Indian food scene, but I certainly didn't have any major complaints here. I'd love to return for the buffet."}
{"text":"Their chicken Tikka Masala and the lamb byriani were very good and so were the portions."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, however the service was a problem. We were seated right away but then waited for an interminable period with no one coming to our table. Some other tables that came in after us were waited upon promptly. After a while it got so bad that I got up and asked the hostess what was up with this. She ended up waiting on us herself but didn't seem real happy about it. In the meantime the rest of the waitstaff continued their erratic and distant behavior. To top it all off after I visited this restaurant someone used the credit card info to order $600 worth of coffeemakers. I'm thinking there was a connection."}
{"text":"Avoid the chicken pakora - it tastes like half-assed, microwaved Indian chicken fingers. And unless you're a huge fan of spinach, I would advise that you steer away from the spinach dishes. While I recognize that they would be good to a spinach lover, the flavor (or lack thereof) of the spinach tends to overwhelm everything else in the dish. The dosa is also a little bland.

Oh well, turns out there are some occasional bad dishes here. Still, everything else is awesome.

I highly recommend the lamb or beef shahi korma. Definitely one of the best things I ever ate. It's steeped in this delectable orange (the color, not the flavor) cream sauce which contains ground-up cashews that are both impossible to distinguish from the sauce, and impossible to not notice in the taste. And who ever thought that raisins match so well with red meat? 

The chef's special naan is also god damn amazing. Dip it in everything."}
{"text":"As i said before this place is so good.. can't stop eating. No seriously. I just can't stop eating it. The only way you could be better indian food would be if you went to india."}
{"text":"We recently stopped at the Maharani Indian Restaurant to try their lunch buffet after the Saturday morning winter farmer's market. What a great find! It's on the same block as the Metropolitan Condominiums so parking can be a little tricky. However, the food is worth it. The selection was vast and everything was delicious. Salads, entrees, deserts, and they brought fresh naan to our table. The only thing that was less than perfect was when trying to pay our bill at the end of our meal. The hostess rang up the previous patron and then disappeared for almost 10 minutes. Otherwise this place was outstanding. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Three of us showed up at 7:15 PM on Labor Day  (National holiday). We were seated at a booth in what was probably the waiting area; not great, but we were happy to find a place that was open. We ordered 3 entrees (a lamb, a chicken & an eggplant) and some naan  (bread) to share. It took longer than I thought it would. Our food was finally delivered and the first thing we noticed is that they all looked alike and the portions seemed small. The entrees were tasty, but not distinctive. The service was only OK. But again, they get extra points for being open."}
{"text":"I love this place - it's my go to for downtown Indian take out, delivery, or buffet. Their spicy is actually spicy. Garlic naan is out of this world."}
{"text":"It is my second time ordering from Maharani. It is also only my second time eating Indian food. I may not know anything about authentic Indian food, but I do know when food tastes good.  I've never eaten at the actual restaurant, so my review is based solely on the food. The two times I've ordered take-out from here I have gotten the Butter Chicken, medium spice, and the Keema Naan. The keema naan is just naan \"bread\" stuffed with lamb meat. The medium spice on the butter chicken is spicier than \"medium.\" However, I really enjoy it! The white rice that the dish comes with helps tame the spiciness. I do find myself taking some breaks in between bites. If you aren't someone that regularly eats spicy food I would recommend mild spice. This dish also contains peanuts, so beware to those that can't consume nuts! I enjoy ordering the naan with this entree because it works like a sponge to soak up all the sauce from the butter chicken and it is like a palate cleanser. Tonight was just one of those nights that I was craving some flavorful, filling take out. I received my order promptly and it satisfied my craving to a T. I'm a happy gal! Thank you Maharani!"}
{"text":"For dinner, the food was pretty tasty and the service was quick. I pretty much enjoyed everything, the only bummer is the food isn't particularly spicy. I ordered my dish hot and well... it was mild at best. Still pretty good, but if you have a spicy food itch like I do look elsewhere. There's a lot of vegetarian options, which is pretty cool too.

The buffet is pretty good too, they have a pretty wide selection of things. Definitely one of the better Indian food buffets I've been to since moving away from NY."}
{"text":"The service was really bad. The server seemed like he didn't want us to eat there. And they also overcharged with another dish we didn't order. So make sure you get the itemized receipt and check if they charge you correctly."}
{"text":"lunch buffet: tasty food, great selection, nice ambiance, decent prices, but hard-to-understand indian waiters who talk way too fast, which means they must make authentic indian food, right? right!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It seems both times, they had the same items in the buffet. Service was poor - none of the wait staff say anything to you until you pay the bill. We were seated by the window and a neon sign that was making a loud noise and smelled like it was burning or going to catch fire. The food was ok - the samosas were subpar, Maharaja on the West side seems to have the best tasting food and the most options for vegans/vegetarians."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere.  Friendly staff, and tasty Indian food.  Love the infinite rice! Thank you for not nickling and diming us!"}
{"text":"Don't know much about Indian food, but the lunch buffet was really good, 9.95 on weekends. I plan on going back. 
Parking is free in a hidden, dark garage. Drive along Broom and mid-block, make a turn into what looks like parking for the condos next to the restaurant. If you've passed the Capitol Centre Market, you've gone too far."}
{"text":"Customer service excellent. They love children.
Ambiance wonderful. 
Food delicious. 
Price - reasonable (they have dinner combos)

Overall -I'll never forget this place."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered delivery from this place, since I just go here for the buffet. BUT the buffet is so good!!! I've eaten at two other Indian restaurants in Madison and this one is my favorite out of the three. Really good food and good service."}
{"text":"Food is pretty avg, staff look confused, some look stoned, some are too arrogant and rude. Had a bad experience"}
{"text":"It's fine Indian food, but certainly no more than that.  Go to Royal India, Tandoor or Bombay Sweets in Milwaukee for real Indian.  Somehow they manage to make most of the food taste the same, and even with the heavy cream-based sauces used in many of their curries, pretty non-flavorful.  That said, for Madison, this is about as good as it gets.  My daughter and I did the buffet, the place was crowded.  The service was terrific, which I was concerned about after reading the reviews, but they've obviously taken that seriously, they were VERY attentive.  The prices are high (12.95 for buffet for me is cool, but my 11 year old doesnt eat as much and they have no kid buffet price).  Nice atmosphere.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"This place had a great lunch buffet for the price, but don't forget to ask for your student discount! They won't remind you, but it's 10% off. They have a great assortment of options at the buffet, and most of the buffet is vegetarian (some of it is vegan, but there is cream / yogurt in some dishes). $10.95 for lunch before your student discount makes this a decent option for lunch. They also have a dessert bar with \"mango\" ice cream that tastes more like orange, if you ask me. Again, no brown rice. :-("}
{"text":"This 5 star review is for their lunchtime buffet.  There was so much variety and each dish was delicious!  I've had Indian buffets before, but this is hands down the BEST one I have ever been to.  They really don't skimp on the good stuff (including garlic naan!)  

We also came here for dinner, which was equally delicious but much pricier and obviously less variety.  The lunch buffet is totally worth it if you don't mind being in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I want some Indian food, I like to go here. Honestly, this place is best for its buffet. The available options change every day, though there are some persistent options (chicken tikka masala, jasmine rice, samosas). It's fun to have a different experience each time you go - something that a lot of buffets could learn from, in my opinion.

I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner, because I am of the opinion that the dishes are overpriced for what you get. If you are craving Indian, I would make the time go here between 11 and 3, when the buffet is available.

Good dessert selection, which also varies with the day.

Service is OK. I usually have a full glass of water, which is much appreciated at a place like this. I would still expect that they would invest in some pitchers, and leave one at each table. Don't you want your customers to drink a lot of water, if you are a buffet?

Another criticism is the nan situation. It is very nice that they bring out fresh baked nan to each table - but at an Indian buffet, I usually want more than two pieces of the stuff. Regardless of the size of your party - one person, or two, or four - they will bring over four pieces of nan for your table. Why not just put the stuff out on the buffet? If you aren't going to do that, you should at least make sure that bread basket is as full as the water. They will bring more on request... but I don't want to have to ask for it, honestly. Getting the attention of a waiter is also not the easiest thing in the world, since you are sitting in a buffet setting."}
{"text":"One star just because the food is good. Be prepared to wait 2 hours to see a waiter. The manager is also incompetent and a horrible at customer service. We had to ask waiters to bring things like water before finally debating on leaving without paying after no one gave us our check. Ended up paying the manager directly and storming off after a terrible dinner. At least the food was good..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! I eat here about once a month. The chicken tikka masala is my go to dish. I also love their lamb shahi korma. All of their naan is delicious, they have lots of choices. I usually go for the cheese stuffed naan. If you order delivery expect about an hour wait. Dinner service is always consistent & very timely. I've never had to wait long to be seated. Be sure to finish your meal with a mango lassi. If you're craving Indian food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came in to get some Indian food and wow was I disappointed. Food was good but I have never had a server to rude in my life. When we asked for the food to be mild he scoffed under his breath and said \"seriously\". Then it took forever for a food to get there, tables that got there long after us were getting their food before us from the same server. He was being al nice to them. Then he was nowhere to be found after 20 min we had to ask the bus person to get our check. To find the server was just sitting down lounging. There are plenty of Indian restaurants in Madison I will NEVER come back here."}
{"text":"This is my choice for Indian food. I go in for the buffet so i don't have to choose which one i want. Favorite would be the curie chicken."}
{"text":"Maharini is a large menu Indian food restaurant with all the classic vegetarian options. This restaurant is the kind of place that has some vegetarian options under the curries, but then also a vegetarian section, but then also a vegetables section: it's that kind of confusing restaurant. But, my friends and I found the small text that said vegetable dinner for two, and the rest is history.

The dinner came with samosas, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry, malai kofta, rice, naan, and dessert. It started out with a lentil soup, which was not very good. Imagine buying chicken noodle soup, and instead of getting a broth with chicken and noodles in it, you get kind of a frothy, thicker soup that was the aforementioned soup put through a Ninja blender. That's what the soup was like: no lentils to be seen, a bit thicker, some lentil taste, and not very flavorful. 

The samosas were great. The crispy outside was nicely matched with the soft, potato inside. Out of the main dishes, I'd say only the malai kofta is worth recommending. The malai kofta was very good: the sauce was flavorful, not overwhelming, and it wonderfully seasoned each ball. The palak paneer should be avoided: its texture was quite unpleasant. Google is telling me that the difference between palak paneer and saag paneer is that palak is only spinach. The mixed vegetable curry was fine, but nothing worth writing home about (though, everything is worth telling Yelp about, I guess). I think it's worth noting that the rice was delicious, and I ate too much of it.

The service was okay. The food took a very long time to come out: I believe we waited around 35 minutes, and the restaurant was more than half empty at dinner time on Saturday night.

If I'm ever back in Madison and craving Indian food, I'd return if I couldn't find an alternative!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for my first try of Indian food. The restaurant was very nice-white linens, nice subtle authentic music, full bar and nicely dressed staff. 

They bring out an appetizer of thin crispy bread with 3 sauces. (Equivalent to chips and salsa) -very tasty

The menu is HUGE lots of meat and vegetarian options. I went with a lamb option that was cooked in cream with herbs and spices-delicious. 

We also ordered a naan bread filled with potatoes, onions and cheese, served warm. So good. 

For drinks they have Indian Beer (which I'm excited to try next time), and specialty cocktails. I ordered the chai martini. It was good but not the best I ever had. 

Overall this place is a hit if you want some authentic Indian cuisine. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Two words: Butter Chicken.

Other than that the paranthas are very good. And great service."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet with really good vegetarian options - they bring out naan w/ ghee (crispy buttered flatbread), and you can find stuffed paratha on the buffet table, along with a whole selection of desserts.

Really, really good! It's a few blocks from work, and just fabulous."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and friendly service. The Buffet is fresh and replenished at your asking. The chicken tikka masala is SUPERB! And so affordable. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Do I really have to give them a whole star?  My husband says yes, and that at least the food wasn't moldy.   Lacking was this restaurant's calling card for a one time visit.  The food was solidly mediocre.  The decor was pedestrian.  But the service, oh the service, earned a tails-up penny.  Awful, just awful.  Our Server failed to address an empty soda glass, did not offer additional Naan, and reopened the blinds after we shut them to block the bright sun.  We did not find chewed gum or stones in our food, so at least we can't complain that they were actively trying to kill us.  All that being said, the mold would have added more character."}
{"text":"Got chicken and mushroom curry, and two stuffed breads. I'm pretty good with spicy food, raised on schezuan food, but a little surprised by the medium heat on the curry, more like full vindaloo at most Indian places I've had. Still tasty, chicken very tender, all dark meat I believe, which is unusual, but I liked it and definitely not dry. Reason not five stars was the naan was a little soggy and barely had any chicken or veggies in them. I wasn't excpecting a calzone, but usuall stuffed naan a little more generous. Service was good, very nice lady. Will order from again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delicious and plentiful.  Love the choices of chutneys, so you can mix and match your own concoctions.  I'm not a dessert person but their carrot cashew dessert was surprisingly yummy!  Bill came to $14.19 with my ice tea and I am STUFFED!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many positive reviews of the place, we were shocked by our experience. The place is very beautiful inside (the fabric napkins and glasses give it a fancy touch). The service was great and the food is authentic. 

The con: Right after we ordered our appetizer and main entrees, we saw a mouse crawl in and out of the heater at the bottom of the floor. We gently got the waiter's attention who was just as shocked as us that a little vermin had appeared. The little mouse jumped onto a chair and crawled around a table for a few minutes before the ?manager? took control of the situation by spraying what I assume was a highly toxic chemical (it definitely wasn't just bleach) into the space between the floor board and the wall where the little creature had hid. I about lost it at that point bc you could hear the little rodent screaming in pain. 

The manager was extremely apologetic and humiliated by the entire ordeal. He have us all of our food for free however I still refuse to get close to any Indian restaurants.   This took place in the middle of summer, in the early afternoon- not during the winter months where rodents are forced to look for food and shelter indoors!"}
{"text":"Oh Maharani, great location and sometimes good food. I feel like if you go for an Americanized and popular entree a la chicken tikka masala they hit the nail on the head. They were able adjust the spiciness to a high level which I liked.

Now let's get to slightly more authentic foods. We got a dosa, hoping for a quality South Indian food experience. It was very large but very bland. It managed to give both of us a stomach ache.

Service was a little slow which also loses them points. 

However I will return and stick to items that are more commonly found in their buffet as I feel those are awesomely made and delicious"}
{"text":"I have never been to this place for the buffet so gave it a shot. It is excellent. Lots of choices including  my favorite lamb curry and lentil soup both very good. Lots of vegetarian dishes as well. The dining room is huge and better looking than most. A little more expensive than some at around eleven dollars I think, but worth it. I just wish the service staff that work here to at least be a little friendly. Even if there is a language barrier it doesn't hurt to make eye contact and SMILE! No one here did. I can live with it and would go back."}
{"text":"Once you get over the fact that you seem to be the only person talking in the restaurant because it's such an expansive place, you get lost in the large, delicious portions and steamy, buttery naan. The place doesn't look fancy enough for the prices on the dinner menu (about $13-16), but the food is good enough to avoid regret. 

If you don't want anything specific, the buffet is well worth it- all of the dishes always look steaming hot and fresh and there are at least 20+ different items (plus dessert) to choose from...all for only $8.95.

in fact, i wish i was there right now."}
{"text":"Indian food is generally expensive and this place is no exception. We ordered the veg dinner for 2 and it was way too much food which we were happy to pack and take home. The curries are nice and flavorful. We had samosas, mulligatawny soup, malai kofta, mix veg and daal (you can switch the curries with your choice of entre) we finished with gulag jamun which were not so great."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today. Great atmosphera, awesome food. I had fish masala and cheese naan ($18.88 with tax). Also, it was surprising that the entree includes also big bowl of rice (they chrge extra in Indian House for 3 times smaler amount of rice).Definitely will come back when visit next time Madison."}
{"text":"I wish it wasn't so easy to order from Maharani because I'm always happy I ordered and have Indian delivery, but their Indian definitely isn't the best in Madison, and then (personal problem) I always end up eating too much because Indian is addicting and then I am too full.
It is also a bit on a pricey side.
I will say though-  the non-vegetable dinner for 2 ($48) will feed at least 3 people with left overs, and is really great when you're in no decision to choose.
It's a great standby option, but there are likely better options."}
{"text":"I keep realizing that it's really unfair for me to expect amazing ethnic food in Madison--it's especially unfair to compare it to what I can get in NY. Of course, that won't stop me from doing it, so here goes...

Maharani is solid. Their lunch buffet is solid. The food is good, but certainly nothing special...and at $12 for the lunch buffet, it's also overpriced. Whenever yo make food en masse for a lunch buffet, stuff is bound to get dry--that's how I felt with some of the food they had out. 

On the plus side: Good rice pudding (apparently I'm the only one who eats it), good goat curry, nice (but basic) chicken tikka, good baji, and decent paneer. 

Minus side: Fish was dry, we weren't given enough naan (I attribute this to the service), and the lamb they had was way, way overcooked.

So, would I go back? Probably, especially since it's a group favorite of ours--we only go for lunch, though, and every few months at that. Three stars seems appropriate--it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and it's certainly incomparable to what I can get on Curry Row (6th Street) or Curry (Murray) Hill."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located very near to Capitol and at a prime location. The ambience is really nice, with tables organized in a nice manner. The food was delicious, it wasn't too spicy which make sense depending on the spice tolerance of various people. I got overwhelmed with the choice of desserts, mango ice cream is a must try, gulaab jamun was average, kheer, ras malai and caramel pudding was really nice.
Price: $12.50 per person on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Maharani's lunch buffet has a large selection, and based on the clientele, it seems appropriate for both Indian and non-Indian palates. I don't claim to know Indian food well, but I tried two Indian restaurants in Madison, and I preferred the other, though the food here was not bad by any standards. I really enjoyed the goat curry."}
{"text":"I'll get right to the point - I got the chicken tikki masala and while the sauce was decent paired with the white rice, the chicken was heavily over cooked. Definitely ate the full serving but avoided all the chicken."}
{"text":"Went there for the buffet on a Sunday afternoon. Service was terrible and most of the food in the containers was empty. Was there for more than half hour and they never refilled any of them even though they knew it was empty. When we payed our bill, we complained about the service and the waiter kept calling for the manager and she refused to come talk to us. Do not go here for Indian food. The food is not that great either. There are places that are a lot better. Its fine if you don't  know what good Indian food tastes like."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and it was close to my hotel.  I was a solo diner, and my service was not very good, but the food was.  I'd go back, but bring a book again to keep myself busy while I waited to be taken care of."}
{"text":"$13 for Chana masala is a bit much, no? The food took 2 hours. My friend Charles had beef w one of the waiters. Food was pretty decent. I wish I could give them 2.5 stars. I always round down. I'm a pessimist."}
{"text":"I have high expectations when it comes to Indian food, not fair! I know!!. Maharani is exactly in the middle of good and bad. I have had the buffet and have ordered off the menu, I would suggest the latter if you want to get a proper feel for their food. The food is good. The naans are soft and the curries usually good. I would not order the paneer tikka masala the reason being that the masala, I am certain is made from store bought tomato paste. Its no wonder that the panner tikka is a bright red and tangier than required. The kadhai paneer and the malai kofta are just as they are supposed to be. The best part of their food is that it is entirely predictable. Order in or take out on a Sunday evening to get incredibly good and fresh food and see the same dishes gradually go down in quality as the week progresses! My husband and I have seen this happen enough number of times to call this 'Statistically Significant\". Go here if you dont ever plan to be surprised. You get what you order and expect."}
{"text":"Amazing indian lunch buffet with really good indian food. All tables will get a basket of naan, there is also a desert bar with good mango ice cream.
Things I ate at the buffet:
·Briyani rice with chicken: delicious! Easily my favorite dish in the whole buffet. It wasn't too spicy either and the chicken in it was mostly red meat, yum.
·Samosa: big and delicious... It's stuffed with potatoes and was so good.
·Saag (creamy spinach): good
·Paneer: not bad. 
·Chicken tikka masala: this was a disappointment. This is one of the staples I always eat at all indian restaurants. I felt like I was eating defrosted pieces of dry Tyson chicken breast that had been cooked in the sauce. It almost tasted too healthy.
Overall, delicious and cheap food in unlimited quantities. Great deal especially for UW students!"}
{"text":"How can you not love their lunch buffet?  $8.95 (I believe) for tons and TONS of really pretty damn good Indian food.  It's a touch greasy, which makes it a great cure for a mild hangover.  Their samosas are above reproach, and the best days are when they have some kind of saag!"}
{"text":"There are a few Indian restaurants in Madison that offer a lunch buffet.  This one is definitely my favorite.  I find the location much brighter and cheerier than the other ones, and I really enjoy their selections in their lunch buffet.  They have the pretty traditional offerings and they always have samosas with a tamarind chutney and a green coriander chutney and some other ones.  I pretty much only pay attention to these two kinds of chutney.  They also usually have some kind of grilled dish simmering on the buffet line with onions and cabbage.  The few times I've been there, it's been chicken or fish."}
{"text":"Decent number of options in buffet menu.. Pleasant ambience and staff..but not a single item on the menu that tastes good or has any Indian spice touch..uttapam did not taste like dosa.. Chicken 65 and fish fry were hopeless...I would try other Indian options next time in Madison than this place..."}
{"text":"I will not recommend anyone to go here. Their food was stale, I had an upset immediately after I had dinner. The service was very bad too. Don't waste your money and appetite by going here. Please give it a skip."}
{"text":"This is really a 3 and a half! I went for the lunch buffet, and I'd say half the dishes were great and half were pretty low quality. Some tasty things worth noting were the Green Beans Poriyal which were incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly and a cauliflower dish I forget the name of. I wouldn't recommend the Dahi Vada (those donut-looking things) unless they're freshly out on the table, cuz they get so soggy so quickly! The paneer dish I had was good, the tikka masala was nice, but the fried fish dish was pretty blah- not fresh, and there's nothing worse than not-fresh fish! Dessert was yummy but the staple Indian buffet mango ice cream just tasted like vanilla grocery store ice cream flavored lightly with mango. Tip-if you're going anywhere important later, be careful, because you'll walk around smelling strongly of delicious curry for the rest of the day! You decide if that's a good or bad thing."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"}
{"text":"Recently, I had an extremely stressful and contentious day at work and I could think of nothing I wanted more than to visit the Maharani buffet for lunch.  So then I did.  That's how good it is."}
{"text":"As a visitor to Madison, I was expecting little more than the usual beef potatoes and other carbohydrates that I would normally expect from the late night Wisconsin fare. 

This restaurant was devastatingly good. Not only did they deliver straight to my airbnb, but the food was so satisfying and hearty that I had leftovers for the following day. It was equally, if not even more, delicious.

I ordered a side of rice, a saag specialty item, and the chef's naan. The naan was a meal unto itself. The rice was perfectly done and the curry had the perfect amount of spice. It is also worth noting that this restaurant is very generous with its side-portions.

Say yes to this choice, vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to go on a special occasion or when i'm feeling down. the palak dosai will cheer me right up. mmmmm. 

the only complaint i would have is that the waiters are TOO good at what they do. they come by the table about once a minute. you have to fight to hold onto your plate, they want to clear it right away."}
{"text":"Certainly enjoy the variety. Keep in mind service can be spotty and not as sharp. The food really is good to compensate."}
{"text":"Good food.  I would suggest ordering the food off the menu instead of the all-you-can-eat, cuz it's just not as good.  The menu food is a lot of food anyway.  it's cozy too.  Ambience has room for improvement."}
{"text":"I used to dislike Indian food so the first handful of times I came here for the buffet, I hated it. Now Mirch Masala has changed the game and gotten me into Indian food. I'd chose Mirch Masala over the Maharani any time, but this is my backup.

Their food is really solid. There's been a few hiccups with my delivery that has ticked me off, but not enough to not order from them.

The butter chicken, samosas, garlic naan, and Chef's Special naan are my go to. I also get keema naan, but I'm not really a fan of it from here. My boyfriend still loves it so maybe it's just me.

I'd definitely say give it a go if you're looking for a solid Indian restaurant. If you want the best, go to Mirch Masala."}
{"text":"This place was very authentic. When you walk in and see the fennel seeds and smell the curry in the air, you know you're in for some savory goodness. I had the Aloo Chole and shared a Mixed Grill. Everything was flavorful and well made. Would definitely go back for the Tandoori Chicken."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant often and enjoyed the jovial very friendly staff and reasonably good (sometimes very good) food in the buffet. Now I had not been there for a while, but went for lunch buffet today- with a guest, unfortunately. 

There seems to have been a change in ownership and/or staff. The demeanor of the new staff was very sour. Especially the woman who works there looked like it would be very painful for her to crack a smile or utter a friendly or welcoming word. The men floated around like shadows- forget about any personal touch. I felt very uncomfortable.

For the food-- I used to love the Rasam soup. Now it was more like a super salty brine. There also were really no vegetables-- the only choice was a mushy broccoli/potato mush. Broccoli is not even a real Indian vegetable. The grilled fish was reasonably good, as was the biryani (hence two stars). 

Finally, the restaurant no longer offers free parking, as they used to in the adjacent garage. One now has to search for paid street parking, making it much harder to eat here.

So- if you ate here before and liked it-- be warned on all accounts. There are better Indian food options in the Madison area, e.g. Taste of India on Monroe Street, and Swagat in Middleton- both of which also have convenient parking."}
{"text":"The biggest mistake I've made this week is leaving my leftover curry at the table. This place is absolutely delicious, and I plan on coming back as soon as possible.

I came here with a lovely group of people for dinner. I made a mental note that this restaurant offered a lunch buffet so I plan on revisiting for this aspect. The restaurant has a calm, Indian decor with an explosion of amazing smells and spices. It's also pretty spacy, so you won't find yourself bumping elbows or weaving around people.

Menu is huge, and it contains everything from lamb to chicken and veggies to dessert. I  ordered the chicken jalfrezie with a side of plain naan. Absolutely heavenly; how did they achieve such a creamy texture without dairy?! I'll never know. Hours later, my stomach is still happy. Chicken was moist, and the naan was fluffy and crunchy. Everything about my dinner experience here was lovely.

Our waters were refilled constantly, which is always a huge plus when eating spicy foods. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so my experience here was pretty positive overall. I love Indian food, and Madison has proven that this city can make some great curry. Yes, yum, yay!"}
{"text":"Never an empty glass and no one went home hungry. Amazing, truly authentic Indian (sans the tomato soup base used in sub par Americanized locations) built on complex flavors and real ingredients. The menu has so many choices it was hard to decide but every bite was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch yesterday.  I've probably visit this restaurant every time i'm in Madison.  I love the buffet! Great choices.  Not much to add, but the desserts are great as well."}
{"text":"$13 standard fare Indian lunch buffet. Overall I was not impressed by their buffet options. I'm not sure whether it was because I was there on a Sunday but I definitely expected a few more dishes. The vegetarian options were limited to Daal Makhni, Channa Masala and a few different types of pakoras. The non-veg options didn't come close to the quality of Indian food I've had elsewhere. The tandoori chicken was the best dish they had, but it wasn't able to distract me from how poorly made the chicken curry was.  Maybe their standard menu has better food, but that's not what I'm reviewing today. The quality of service was fine and the ambiance felt very casual -- I walked in wearing basketball shorts and a long sleeve tee and felt comfortable. In conclusion; the food is good and for the quantity one could eat you really are getting a great bargain. However, it does not remind me of a home-cooked meal which is my barometer for truly great Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"When in Madison, this and Maharaja are the places i will frequently go.  I have consistently returned because:

-the lunch buffet is a steal - very reasonably priced for lots of yummy options.
-although it appears hard to mess up a vegetable samosa, they are great at Maharani
-I enjoy the fish masala, and the garlic naan... I could go on. It is all so yummy!

Some negatives: 
-the staff can be awkward. Like, really awkward. 
-parking can be an issue if it is a busy time (although normally parking is not too big an issue)

This place is yummy enough that I am willing to deal with awkward waiters. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"so good.  so so good.  big menu with lots of authentic options.  and they give you a warm towel at the end of your meal.  why? i dunno"}
{"text":"Came here again to have the dosa (which is a item served traditionally as a south indian breakfast) But it is so delicious I would have it 3 times a day!

I wanted to have the dosa last time I came here but I got too tempted by the buffet to order off the menu. I finally get my promise to myself and had the mysore masala dosa. A rice crepe filled with potatoes and onions, with mysore sauce which is mildly spicy. If you have not seen dosa before, it is a sight! These crepes are over a foot long and extend over the edges of your plate. It came with 3 different kind of dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. The food never disappoints and the service is great! Prior to moving to Madison I had never had Indian food and was nervous to try it but upon trying the food here - I can't get enough of it! I highly suggest this place (: I'm a fairly picky eater but my favorite is the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent Indian food without a lot of expectations. The lunch buffet has a lot of options to choose with. With some options you might be disappointed but overall it's better. Sometimes when the restaurant is buzzing with a lot of customers, the service becomes too slow. Overall, decent food"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fresh, always plentiful.  Thy were terrific with kids and attentive in all aspects of service.  Would return to anytime!"}
{"text":"The thing I like about Indian buffets, typically, is that I have to stop eating when I get full, not when I simply get tired of the food.  Unfortunately, I stopped eating the lunch buffet here because it simply didn't really seem to be worth the trouble.  It wasn't exactly bad, it was just not that tasty.  Well, there was a spicy carrot dish that was so overspiced it was inedible.  The naan. for which I had to get up, go across the room to the waiter who was folding napkins, and ask for, was just OK."}
{"text":"Well.. Both maharani and maharana have the same taste in food.. Guess they have the same owners, that explains the name.. The food is ok.. Just like maharana.. I have tried it once that's all.."}
{"text":"Very unpleasant staff. Doesn't care about customer service. Behaves differently with different kind of people.
Although food is good i would not like to go back there."}
{"text":"These guys have the best of a number of classic Indian dishes in town. Unfortunately not the best mango ice cream or gulab jamuns in town but I'm more of a savory guy anyways. I never knew I liked goat until I tried Indian food! Great job Maharani!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had takeout from this restaurant, but so far I've been seriously impressed with the quality of the product. We've ordered the lamb vindaloo and the chicken tikka masala on both occasions, and I have been blown away by the flavor, consistency of the sauces, and high quality rice. I am anxious to go back to visit in the restaurant to see if the service in-house matches up to the takeaway experience. It is evidently a family run business and you can taste the difference in the recipes."}
{"text":"Everything on the lunch buffet was great. The dosa (Indian crepes that are stuffed) are VERY delicious! A person can get full on nothing but the vegetarian options,  there are plenty of meat dishes too.  Leave room for desert. Very friendly staff.  Parking near the capital is a little hit or miss but that is how it is everywhere downtown."}
{"text":"Oh god...chicken tikka....NOM NOM NOM.
Their buffet is sooo good. The naan is warm and buttery. All of the dishes are hot and delicious. I recommend the chicken tikka, butter chicken, chicken 65, garlic grilled chicken, and tandoori chicken."}
{"text":"Came here for an IYE! Great time meeting new people!

2014 was the year I became a fan of Indian and Thai curry so when I saw Maharani was on the menu for a IYE, I was all for it. 

Like many have pointed out, wait staff seems to the odd man out. I wouldn't say they were rude but maybe a bit... uninterested?? I am not sure if that is the correct word. Hard to explain. They were very much about getting straight to the business. More like \"hurry up and order\" It was just odd. Some people weigh service more heavily than others. For me, I am very much in the middle unless the staff is just plain rude. Again, the staff wasn't rude but they could work on being more open and inviting to diners. 

Curry and naan was plentiful. So much to choose from. I think I speak for all of those who attended the IYE when I say, it was hard to make an entree choice. There were several curries that peaked my interested. I finally settled on Chicken Vindaloo.

OK. I am extremely picky about chicken. I do not eat dark meat. Only chicken breast. It was my mistake for not asking what part of the chicken is used in their chicken curries. To my discovery, my curry used both dark and white meat. Ehhhhhggg!! I ended up picking out the dark meat. It wasn't that big of a deal but just still sucks. Next time, I will ask questions. The other curry places I frequent uses white meat. I guess I became accustom to this too quickly.

I do prefer Dhaba and Haveli over Maharani. To me, the other two complete the package of what I like about eating curry including atmosphere. I won't rule out ever dining here again however if I am in the area and wanting some curry."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet recently and although the food was tasty, the service and cleanliness were pretty awful. Never got drinks other than a water, never had a true server, and the checkout process was slow and inaccurate. Great food but the floor and behind-bar areas were trashed."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the actual restaurant or service because I get it delivered. the food is excellent vindalo currie is my favorite had it with chicken shrimp & lamb I love spicy ask for it extra spicy and they do try some of the different naan bread like the garlic the best only one in my house that likes Indian food although the kids will eat the chicken pakora generally good delivery did have 1 time were it took awhile and I had to call ended up taking almost 2 hours"}
{"text":"Swagat is better, plus I have never felt quite so much like I was in a drive through ... unless I am actually in a drive through. Yes I know it is a lunch buffet and that's the way it is. I think it's because of the way the cashier asked me \"How was everything sign here please thank you come again\" that did it."}
{"text":"We've gone here multiple times since our last review, so we thought that we'd write an update.

First of all, we've been here at least 8, 9, maybe 10 times, and the servers are always VERY friendly.  They've gone out of their way to bring food out of the kitchen for our son and they talk to us, too (though we admit that our son gets more attention than us).  Maybe they're only this friendly to people they've seen us a lot.

The food is very good, too--granted we've only been to the lunch buffet, but I'd be happy with the quality of this food even if was ordered a la carte.  Naan tastes fresh, tandoori chicken is moist (most of the time), sauces are flavorful (most of the time) though they don't necessarily pack in the heat that you'd expect from Indian food, tasty chutneys and curries.

We usually have a great experience with Maharani though every so often we'd come across a day at the buffet where some of the dishes lack the flavor.  What's weird is that we'll come on a day where EVERYTHING is good and then the next time we'll come on a day when maybe half of the dishes are worth raving about.  But we've had enough good experiences where we can forget the 1 or 2 bad days and come here when we're craving Indian."}
{"text":"I've only had takeout. No major complaints. I would order for a reliable hot meal, but so far nothing has blown my mind.

The lamb curry was kind of spicy but besides that not as flavorful as I would prefer. Supposedly comes with yogurt but if it's in the sauce I couldn't tell. Next time will ask for it as a side as well. Generous with the lamb; lots of big, delicious pieces in my dish! Would've liked some more veggies or something to break up the broth in addition to the meat.

Chicken 65 was pretty good and the naan was great but I've never seen a restaurant mess up naan.

Gotta go back for the buffet. It's kind of expensive to do takeout from here so that should be a more affordable way to sample the menu."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here fairly often. It is a bit expensive and it can take a bit of time to arrive. But the food is good and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection, and our 3 little kids (4 and under) ate well and were taken care of nicely by the staff (high chairs, cups with lids, etc.).  
The only thing that I could complain about was that my husband said it wasn't spicy enough, but he likes it super-duper-hot.  I like it more flavorfully-spicy, if that makes sense.  We've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in different areas of the country and in Europe, and this one was excellent."}
{"text":"Very average food...at least for the afternoon buffet! 
I'd much rather go to Maharani on Odana or India Darbar a few blocks away on Odana as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunches in madison! Great variety of Indian food for all you can eat buffet lunch. Nobody judges me for eating several heaping plates of garlic naan and tandoori chicken, and I like that. Trust me, you will leave full and happily sleepy 100% of the time."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, but not \"any\" Indian food. 

While the dining room is clean, and the service is decently good, the food is anything but lackluster. I went to a buffet lunch with friends, and was not at all impressed or even pleased with the food. On the buffet menu are lentil ball appetizer that's covered in yogurt sauce (I forgot the name ... shame on me), pilafs, 2/3 different type of curries (lamb meat and vegetable ones), and few other items that I didn't try. There are also desert, too. Some of my friend particularly liked the balls covered in honey sauce (again, I forgot the name of the dish, but that's what it is).   I'm not saying that the food is bad, it's OK, but not much more. My two Indian friends also share the same review - they told me to go somewhere else for more authentic food."}
{"text":"Lunch is best time to go - lunch buffet is amazing and a good value."}
{"text":"Went in on a weeknight. Food was okay. Wouldn't go back because food wasn't that great and experience was ordinary."}
{"text":"The Maharani Restaurant is comparable to its sister restaurant on Odana, except the ambiance is a little nicer at this location. I did notice that the service was a little spottier here though - neither as quick nor as thorough as the Odana restaurant. Although the Maharani was nearly empty at 9PM, the servers rarely checked on us. 

Regardless, the food was great. They served the same complimentary flatbread appetizer with the three chutneys, and THEY HAD CHANA MASALA ON THEIR MENU!!! I was so excited. I probably should have ordered it mild though, because medium was a little too spicy for me. Edible, but definitely not as enjoyable as I'm sure it would have been if I'd been able to chew and swallow without blowing smoke out of my ears. 

My friend's samosa chaat wasn't bad either - although neither of us expected it to be a plated dish...or to be so heavily topped with chickpeas. I think we were both expecting regular, fried dumplings filled with a potato/pea mix. 

Still, the perfect place to get your Indian food fix in Madtown. (: MmmMmMmm."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times and as far as Indian buffets go in Madison this one does the job. They tend to have a variety of vegetarian and meat items and the sassiest/spiciest onion chutney I have found in Dane County. 

I prefer India Darbar, but when I don't want to leave the confines of downtown this is my first choice."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. I was taken by the variety in the desserts and the food selection in the buffet. The nan was great, and the veg biryani was fabulous. I couldn't get enough of the gajar halwa either! Definitely one of the to-go places near campus for Indian food."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of my dining companion, we tried out the lunch buffet. It was a holiday and full of people who also didn't want to cook!  It was the tail end of service so feel free to take my review with a grain of salt so to speak. There were a good number of choices for rice and main dishes and several cold options, including salad. The goat dish was mostly bones though and the mint chutney was a bit off somehow. We were served one basket of naan with the buffet and the water was frequently replenished. The desserts were just about gone by the time we indulged but there were several choices and the mango ice cream hit the spot!  It was a good way to try a number of their dishes and I would probably order there again but probably not do the buffet."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Indian restaurants, I've been to. Wider choices and good setting. The place has a good ambiance too. A good bet for anyone new to Indian cuisine and would like to try it. Close to the lake, the Capitol, Downtown and the Univ. of Wisconsin. I for one, will go back again, possibly regularly."}
{"text":"This restaurant was much better than some of these reviews would lead you to believe. Amazingly rich flavors. The aloo tikki chat appetizer was the perfect start. We also had Chicken Tikka Masala was just right and the Sag Paneer was spot on. The best thing we had was the Vegetable Mango: I'm not vegetarian but I would never need to eat meat again if this was what I was offered to eat all the time. 
   We came for dinner so I can't review the buffet. Try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Maharani is definitely the best place for Indian food in Madison. As a guy that normally just appreciates a good burger, Indian food was never my thing. Until this place, that is. Maharani has more than a few SUPERB dishes, including chicken biriyani, their many curries, mano ice cream or lassi, and quite a few more. 

I would suggest for anyone looking for something a little different in Madison. There's something here for everyone, but be careful what you wish for with these dishes, mild is hot and hot takes you to hell and back. Delicious food and terrific service."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Maharani. Not only have I lived across the street for the last 3 years, I am a huge fan of Indian food. The buffet is a particular treat - pricey on the weekends especially, but well worth it for the lovely variety of rices, gravy dishes, and appetizers. 

The only downfall of Maharani is their service. Not terribly unusual or awful, but a couple times I had to go and find my waiter to get my glass of water refilled. Mostly they are relatively attentive, and I will keep going back because the food is WELL worth it."}
{"text":"Food
Kadai chicken was not fully cooked
The lentil served was in small quantity
Host and servers were good

Hard to find parking"}
{"text":"Food was really good but with takeout you ha e to pay attention to the details. I did not get any sauces!! I requested extra mint chutney and got nothing!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Maharani both for their lunch buffet and for dinner.

When it comes to their lunch buffet where Maharani truly excels is selection. They have the widest selection available in the Madison area which allows you to try more things -- half the point of a lunch buffet, in my opinion.

The lunch buffet has had consistently good quality food for the several times I've been there. They also do have some spicy dishes for those who are concerned about the lack of authenticity in the heat at most Indian buffets and fortunately by having more dishes available they keep service accessible to most people.

Lunch can get very crowded and that can impact water and naan basket refills.

Similarly dinner is great but can get expensive (especially if you are a naan fiend). The caliber of service increases dramatically when the lunch rush isn't on and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.

If you are looking to try as many new things as you can for lunch this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant service I've had in my life. The waiters are actively hostile, the way hardened French waiters can be, without the charm of being in Paris. The food wasn't very good, at that. Zero percent tip. Two people on a not-very-busy night, and it took as long as a James Cameron movie. Ugh."}
{"text":"I didn't change my number of stars, but I had to update an experience: Maharani just hosted my birthday party and it went swimmingly. They gave us their back room, which was so warm and inviting for my guests. Everyone's order was right and they served our drinks, appetizers, and entrees at the perfect time. And on top of that, the head waitress (she is always there, kicking ass) saved the day when we forgot birthday candles by just happening to have some behind the counter! Afterwards, everyone came up to tell me how full and happy they were. It was the perfect night. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Maharani is one of our fav. Place to eat on weekends, food quality and selections, price, cleanliness is a 5. Love the mango ice cream.! Some weekends I noticed that some dishes are overly salty. Please cut down on the salt. Or just have the salt and pepper available on the table. Thank you."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet, $12.95 (no drink). Water refills were frequent, but other than that service was terrible. We came in, waited. Finally, a man approached. He did not speak a word. He showed us to a table, and walked away. after waiting a few minutes we decided no one was coming back and headed for the buffet.  The restaurant itself is in need of a scrub down and a spruce up. 

The buffet itself was mostly mediocre. Several items I tried were pretty bad. The fried items were soggy. Most dishes were tasteless, and there was not much selection for a vegetarian.

BUT there was one dish that was out of this world good. Mater Paneer, or green peas and paneer.  I am almost crying thinking about it (NO JOKE). It was awesome. One of the best things I've ever eaten. I could eat this dish for EVERY MEAL EVERY DAY fFOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. Yeah, it needed all caps it was that good. Had it not been for this dish, which was a 5, I would have given this place only 1 star."}
{"text":"This restaurant went from being 5 stars to 4 to 3. The food was fantastic. We placed our orders for rasam, chicken vindaloo and rice. After we placed or orders, we got complimentary papadum, which was good. It took quite a long time to get the rasam, but when we got the it, it reminded me exactly of how my family makes it back home. I enjoyed every bite of it, and wanted more after I was done. Then we waited a very long time for our entree, but of course when we got it, we enjoyed it very much. It was pretty spicy, and because of the lack of attention our table got, we didn't get any refills of water after the first one, and we were struggling with the heat of the food. When we finished our food, it took 20 minutes to get the attention of someone to give us our check. Finally, a woman who was not our server saw us looking around and came to help us. I ordered a mango lassi to go, and she came back with that and the check soon after. The mango lassi was super good! It took another 10 minutes to get our server to pick up the check from us... He passed our table multiple times but didn't even look at us. I finally stopped him when he passed us to ask if we pay up front, and it was only then where he took the check from me. Overall, the food was great but the service was bad. It seemed like it was only our server that wasn't attentive, the others looked a little better. I would definitely just order take out from here so I can get good food without the slow service."}
{"text":"Great lunch Buffet! To be transparent I only eat Indian food that have buffets. This is one of the better ones. Food is fresh and plentiful, huge variety. If you're in the mood to over eat or can't decide what you want then come here."}
{"text":"Great tikka masala.  Garlic naan wasn't bad.  I was happy/satisfied!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.
We went with friends for the lunch Buffet and it was pretty delicious. The price wasn't too bad with how much food there was.
I really liked the \"buttered chicken\" which I had 2 helpings of. And the naan was great. 
Also the tandoori chicken was very moist and a great  selection of other Indian dishes that I don't know how to pronounce. 

It was nice to see that it was wheelchair accessible. 
The only small complaint that I had was that they didn't come around and refill our drinks and they completely forgot one of soda's. 
It was a little difficult to get someone's attention, but nothing that would keep me from going back. 

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good Indian Buffet  for s great price"}
{"text":"gotta come here for lunch!!! and they also served the naan bread fresh!!!"}
{"text":"So far my favorite Madison Indian restaurant.  Everything's always been fresh and tasty, and there are SO many choices!  The staff is friendly but a tad slow, but nothing to be annoyed with at all.  My first recommendation if someone asks for a good Indian buffet or sit down dinner!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs - found chewed up bubblegum in the food

We found chewed up bubblegum in our food during lunch buffet.  What is worse is that the manager refused to throw out the dish from the buffet and replace the contents.  People, this is a bad sign since they are willing to cut corners and worse to save a few bucks.  
Anyways why would they spit out gum into the food?  This is so gross!  I will not go there again since I am sure that they really don't give a damn about their customer's health and would rather have us get sick than waste a couple of bucks."}
{"text":"I've been to Maharani quite a few times since being here in Madison. I enjoy it a lot!

When I used to work downtown, the lunch buffet was a thing that I'd go to. Totally worth it if you're looking to try a bunch of things and not looking to spend too much money.

For dinner, I think I've always gotten the Chicken Tikka Masala. I have never been let down by it. They offer three levels of spiciness - mild, medium, and hot. The server didn't seem to understand my request for somewhere between mild and medium. Medium is too spicy for me but mild is not enough!"}
{"text":"I am so happy Maharani has started delivery in Fitchburg. It's going to be my go to henceforth! #win"}
{"text":"I love this place because the staff is awesome and the lunch buffet is all you can eat for like 10 bucks. I highly recommend the Chicken Masala, Mango Ice cream, and the coconut tomato soup, if they have it. I wouldn't recommend it for the rest of their hours because why pay more to eat a little later? 
The outdoor seating is also very nice, weather permitting!
This place is a staple in my list of places to take visitors to-  I've had many friends and relatives come visit and I take them there and they have all LOVED it. You will too!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Buffet seems bigger than the one at Maharajah.

Problem...... A cockroach ran up the wall behind my wife.   Waiter killed it.  No manager stopped by.  Needless to say we paid for our meal.  We never went back.  A shame too.   We really liked the food!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is delicious and staff is great. The beef curry is delicious and plethora of sauces and spices make the meal flavorful. Many different types of traditional Indian dishes make the buffet great."}
{"text":"No offense but I have to say a big no-no to this place. I once wrote the review but was filtered by Yelp. But hey, I have to say the truth - at least from my end.
I didn't want to waste my time writing for them. It was a very bad experience. The service was bad and I can find a better place for the taste. 
I actually hate to write a bad review, but well, I have to say what I've to say.
Hubby and I decided not to give it another shot."}

{"text":"MMMM MM! So yummy! 

I visited Maharani this weekend for brunch on Saturday. It was DELICIOUS! I really enjoy Indian food, but as someone who is not really all that familiar with it yet, buffets are the way to go. I can sample and try things without committing to an entire entree and risk not liking it. 

Maharani had a very decent selection of things to choose from. I was able to find lots of delicious foods to try. 

We were there around noon. The restaurant was pretty busy - most tables were full. We didn't have any wait though, and there was never a rushed feeling like they were trying to get us in and out. They came around often to refill our water glasses. I wish we would have gotten more Naan, but that wasn't a huge issue. The Naan was just SO GOOD. 

Parking can be difficult in this area. There are metered spots on the opposite side of the block that we were able to grab one of. That was nice as we didn't have to cross any streets. 

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Average is the best word to describe Maharani's lunch buffet. There salad/chutney bar takes up half of the buffet, and I would have like to have seen more vegetarian options. The food is tasty but I found the breads to be really dry. The staff knows how to get the job done but doesn't go out of their way to be friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable but not creative. If you want an Indian dining experience in Madison that's better than average, I would recommend Taj on Park Street or Maharaja on Odana."}
