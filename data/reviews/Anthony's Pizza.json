{"text":"I really like this pizza a lot!  The crust was better when it was the old Anthony' s.  The original  owner  passed away and I don't know if it's family who took it over or whoever. Overall, it is very  good pizza and the sandwiches  are great"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian I've ever had. It's no joke. I split a 6 cut with my buddy before a concert at Mr. Smalls. We couldn't even finish the 6 pieces cause it was so filling. I'd recommend it to anyone who's coming thru Millvale. I've also had their Italian Hoagie and it was solid. Well done."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Anthony's Pizza a few times and have always been happy with the food. The employees also have great customer service skills. The one thing that surprised me was how excellent their wings were - I like them extra crispy and Anthony's did not disappoint. They were crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, and had a great flavor. I would recommend this place to anyone in or around Millvale."}
{"text":"**When you Google \"Anthony's Pizza Brownsville Road,\" the number for the Millvale Anthony's will show up. Be mindful - they are not the same Anthony's. ***

I used to eat here all the time in the 90's. My family was really sad when they closed their doors.  We were thrilled when they reopened.

We got 2 large pizzas. One plain & the other banana pepper/peperoni. Delicious! Very thin pizza for someone who has never had it. The cheese is greasy & has a unique taste. The sauce is sweet. If you're into that, then this pizza will exceed your expectations. 

Pizza Bagels are a must! They have a very different taste than the pizza.  

Personally, I think this pizza is best when you eat in. (They took down the wall of 80's Hollywood Stars - Bummer). The cheese is so gooey and flavorful when it's fresh from the over. It's worth it to dine in if you have the time. 

I'm very happy they are back in business!"}
{"text":"Got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was severely disappointed. It's essentially a regular pizza with a bit of BBQ sauce poured on top. The chicken tasted and looked like sliced up frozen chicken patties."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza I have ever had. I grew up eating this Pizza before they closed there doors for 5 or so years, and I was beyond ecstatic when I saw they were reopening. 

The pizza is as good as I remember it being. Be forewarned that this is a greasy, greasy pie and the crust is very thin. I know that isn't for everyone but for me it is exactly what I want in a pizza. We ordered a large Mushroom and it was perfect. Lots of mushrooms and totally satisfying

I have to say that because they have just reopened, all of the local people who loved this food have been coming back so the wait was quite long. I think it is worth it though. And since this is their first weekend being reopened, I am sure they will work out the kinks soon.

In terms of the restaurant itself, they walls have lost a little character. There used to be a collage of black and white photos of celebrities covering the walls. Now everything is covered in this stone wallpaper, some of which is upside down. But, I do have to say that everything feels much cleaner than it was back in the day, mostly due to new boothes, and much brighter lighting. 

What can I say, I love this place and I hope that they continue to get the kind of business they seem to be getting now."}
{"text":"They're open again!

Their pizza bagels are my absolute favorite, and they bring back memories. I used to love grabbing a pizza bagel and an Italian ice after school or after softball games. I'd sit in the booths and stare at the walls that had millions of pictures on them. I even snuck a school picture of myself behind the plexiglass. Then I'd grab a gum ball from the big machine by the front door.

They just recently reopened, and I'm so happy to be able to taste my childhood again. Their bagels are just like how I remember."}
{"text":"Ordered from here yesterday for the first time. The food was great!  The pizza had the right mixture of spice, sauce and cheese, and the salad was filled with toppings and not just a bunch of lettuce with a tomato and a cucumber slice. Talking to the guy at the counter who I assume was the owner, he recommended the Sicilian. We WILL order from here again and will be taking the suggestion. Can't say enough how much we liked everything."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday - pretty sure the main \"cook\" was one something - dude was glossy eyed and was just dirty. I stood there as they made my hoagie and pizza bagels... the other guy \"working\" ate cheese out of the bag or container behind the line with his bare hands, the guy making my food was eating over my stuff and not washing his hands - I actually threw out my food when I got home - one thing I have learned is $14 isn't worth getting into a fight over - just disgusting. front desk lady was nice though"}
{"text":"I can't say much about the interior of the establishment but they fill orders quickly and their pizza and hoagies are delicious. We were drinking at The Grist House and looked for a quick place to grab some takeout. Anthony's pizza is just the right amount of greasy and really hits the spot. I look forward to my next experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight and got a large Pizza with Peppeoni and Sausage. I called ahead would definitely recommend calling your order in the place was very busy but worth the wait. The pizza is thin crust and was delicious. Great new pizza place."}
{"text":"Have attempted to call in to order a few times recently, but it either rings and goes to voicemail or goes straight to voicemail. Sketchy business practices"}
{"text":"I ordered a small pepperoni pizza and got half plain and half pepperoni. When I called in the guy who took my order sounded a little brash. When I came to pick up pizza it seemed like he was on drugs. I can't be for sure. But his eyes looked glossy and he just didn't seem put together very well. Pizza was good the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend at all. Got a large pizza. The quality was horrible. The sauce was not a good flavor at all. I had to wait 2 hours just for a pick up for this crap. Their pizza box was more like a diaper. The Pizza bagels were soggy yet burned. The employees looked like a bunch of drug addicts hanging out. And the Prices too high. Biggest waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Their jumbo fish sandwich is excellent! You can get it with fries for just $8.99. It's a truly massive serving so you really get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I tried to order pizza from Anthony's on a Wednesday evening. My son was playing in a baseball tournament in the area and Anthony's was one of the sponsors. I had a slice of their pizza at the ball field earlier in the week and I was hooked. I stopped in the shop around 5:30 before the game to grab a menu. I was informed that the menus have not returned from the printer yet so I took a picture of the menu on the wall with my phone. I told the woman behind the counter that I would be returning after the game to order about 6 pizzas. The game ended at 7:30 and I started trying to phone in my order but all I could reach was their answering machine. I took this as a sign that they were extremely busy so I decided to just drive up and place my order in person. They were closed. 7:30 PM on a Wednesday. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed especially since I informed them that I planned to place a large order! I took my business to a shop closer to my home! Their loss!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms.  Disgusting is putting it lightly.  The was hardly any bacon on the pie and the pizza was greasy and soggy.  The mushrooms were burnt and when I bit into one of them, my mouth filed with grease.  I threw the whole meal in the garbage."}
