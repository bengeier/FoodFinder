{"text":"As Tracy says, this place is well worth checking out.  Their breads are always fresh, pastries well-filled and delicious, and deli and sandwich offerings well-priced and made to order.  They even have rum balls (my sinful secret craving) - not the too large ones offered by  Dimpflmeier Bakery, but reasonably-sized ones at a good price.  On my flying visit a few moments ago, i purchased a fresh loaf of sour dough bread, a raspberry rhubarb pie, 2 macaroni salads and 3 egg-salad sandwiches (on sesame and onion kaisers with swiss cheese and extra onion). Now, you don't care how I like my sandwiches but the point is you get them exactly how you like them, not what the store wants to give you.  The is a big plus in my book.  Tomorrow I have them on my breakfast agenda.  Will let you know."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill if it isn't already at the bottom. They claim to bake their own cakes but they are actually outsourced. The \"warm\" food is always dried or partially frozen. They microwave everything. The only safe thing to eat there is anything factory sealed. The staff is friendly. But the rats aren't....."}
{"text":"Perfect fast lunch and coffee and treat...lors of variety and fresh. Most days we go there for lunch and breakfast...perfect local"}
{"text":"Oven Fresh is located where the old Buns Master Bakery was at for years.  It's nothing fancy but it's very clean, inexpensive and it offers a nice variety of freshly baked buns, deli meat, sandwiches, soups, Jamaican patties, etc.   On my recent visit, I purchased some Kaiser buns, smoked turkey and Swiss cheese.  Everything was super, super fresh, especially the Kaisers - don't tell anyone but they were better than Dimpfliemier.  The deli meats are also priced very well so, if you're in the area, consider supporting them rather than the big chain grocery stores."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced ($3 for a Cheese Roll) and I tried their home-made cake and the cream tasted sour because the cake had been there long time."}
