{"text":"This place is delicious. It's in my top 3 mariscos restaurants. The food is amazing and super tasty. The staff is really friendly. sometimes the food takes a bit but that's only because it's always packed! I am really happy that they expanded the restaurant as it is now a lot bigger and everyone is not right next to each other."}
{"text":"Best micheladas (Mexican Bloody Mary) in the world... And so cheap.. The food is good too but those micheladas oh my god..."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! First and last time going, after waiting a hour for only a shrimp cocktail the waitress brings me a dirty spoon.  I was okay with that I'll just ask for another one but as I was half ways finish with my food I saw a hair on my shrimp cocktail. I was  grossed out I had to tell the manager."}
{"text":"Food is Excellent. I ordered the Tostada de Ceviche and it was great. Also ordered the combination and it was pretty tasty. The combination includes  the Torito which is a guerito (chile) stuffed with marlin. It was not the way I expected. Still was good. Aguas frescas are natural. I ordered Jamaica and yes it was perfect. 

I give this place four stars because of the facilities. It is crowded and the restroom was not clean :/ I am very picky with restrooms. They do not need to be fancy but clean. This was not clean and smelled pretty bad.

They had a band playing. I went on Sunday at 2 pm. The band was too laud and you can not talk at all. You can not even order. That loud it is. So be prepare for the noise.

Service is not excellent. The servers are very nice but very slow. Review your check they charged us wrong."}
{"text":"Super fresh seafood!! How do I know? I developed a slight allergy for Shrimp when I moved to the US (everytime I eat shrimp I get hives on my face). Ate shrimp all my life back home (I grew up by the sea) and never had a problem. I go to this restaurant and eat shrimp... nothing happens and tastes delicious!!!

When you arrive and sit, the waitress brings you chips and salsa and a cup of hot steamy shrimp boullion. I always order Shrimp Aguachile ( raw shrimp cooked in lime juice and chile) or Cocktel Campechana (big cup of seafood variety). I tried the Pescado Empanizado today and it was delicious!!!!! I will order that next time. ALSO there are people selling stuff like mexican pastries and other mexican food you dont really find at the stores ( like queso from Chihuahua) so bring some extra cash with you !! 

Things I dislike about this place: 

Waitresses lack of customer service skills and take forever to aknowledge that you arrived and need to be seated. I have seated myself and waited 10 minutes for the menus and What would you like to drink? Question.
Music is EXTREMELY loud. I love the fact that you can go and listen to some live Banda music while you are enjoying your seafood.. however the place is too small and music too loud. I had to point my order to the waitress from the menu because she couldnt hear me so don't expect being able to conversate with your party. 

Those are my major issues however FOOD IS SO GOOD that I don't care..PLUS they are remodeling the restaurant and it looks like they are adding space!! 

Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family. I had been craving the 7 mares caldo and a coworker told me this place was good. Well we got there around 4:35 sat wherever we liked. The booth was okay just the bottles they have on the table had flys on it. It was pretty gross. We waited about 10 minutes for someone to get our just out drinks. We waited another 5 minutes for her to return. To take our order, we got 7mares (19.00), kids quesadilla (5.00), tostada de javia (5.00), and fajitas with rice and beans (15.00). Plus 2 horchata drinks (4.00 plus refill 4.00). Out food was served around 5:25! I was a asking my husband if they had gone to get fresh seafood because it was only us and 1 couple?!? I tried to let it go once I got my soup. The taste was great but I noticed that the shrimp were so tiny that I told my husband that they might have taken it from the sopa maruchan con camarones. Our waitress only came once after our food was served gave us a refill. By the time we finished we waited 10 minutes to get our bill. Still was just us and 1 couple. When we got our bill we saw that it was $105!! I asked to see the receipt for what we got and the lady laughed and said she didn't have. I told my husband it was expensive and he told me oh don't worry about it's fine. We gave them his card to pay and I was still thinking how expensive it was. His card had gotten declined and my husband got a text message alerting us on a fraud on his card. They asked we we were there and to make sure the price was correct. I had to drive to an ATM to take money out because the payment wasn't going to go through. I told my husband to make sure the price was correct if it was correct obviously we were going to pay the amount. One skinny bitch told him that the price was correct and she was not going to look over it, this fat bitch just looked at us as if we didn't have money and our waitress helped us. We literally spent 20 minutes looking over our bill. My husband told them how much they were charging for taxes and boom our total came out to 60.00!!! They were basically charging us an extra $45.00 on taxes!! When my husband was signing the check the skinny bitch decided to ask if he was going to tip?!?! No bitch we aren't and we I'll never go back!!! BEWARE PEOPLE MAKE SURE YOU SEE THE PRICES AND HAVE AN IDEA HOW MUCH YOU WILL BE PAYING !!! This place should be reported to the BBB!! I wish I would have read the reviews before I went!! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Food is better some days than others, Seems more fresh. My favorite entree is the  Aguachiles, yummy! Prices are pretty much as other Mexican seafood restaurants. But the servers/waitresses should smile more often as they currently walk around looking unhappy! LOL no really, the food is good, service not so much."}
{"text":"Good food realy bad service"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone here the food is good fresh but just the service is terrible i've been here several times , and they just don't have a good customer service , i'm not saying don't go here just letting you know they're rude ...  The Ceviche is great that's why I keep coming back whoever is the cook is good that's all I got to say !!!"}
{"text":"You simply will not find better micheladas in Phoenix. The camarones a la cucaracha are the tastiest in town. This place is one of the best for Mariscos. The service is not always the best but we continue to come because the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great food. Service is ok. My favorite is the camarones ala diabla and the camarones ala cucaracha! Good beer selection. Just beware of ur bill. They always seemed to add another 15-20 bucks on ur bill specially if u have been drinking. So they get 4stars."}
{"text":"Esta bien rico , la música y todo se es chicha bien bruno .

Me gusta todo ,  

El precio si está un poco carñiosos jejeje"}
{"text":"Food is extremely good , but service is bad and also they let kids bring their guinea pigs go in , (for me are still rats)  management or Waitress should say something but seem they didn't care"}
{"text":"Ok so i come here only when I'm really craving some awesome mariscos!!!! Mmmmmm, their portions are big and reasonable...i haven't been here for a while so i don't know if their prices have changed but i usually get the battered shrimp w/ rice and beans and it's about 12 - 13 bucks but i always take home left overs. Now the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the restaurant has bands that come in and play music but the restaurant is too small and you can't even have a conversation because you can't hear...OMG!!! THAT IRRITATES ME BAAAD!!! That's the only drawback from this place....so i don't go that often, the best time to go is on a weekday afternoon...WEEKENDS ARE INSANE...DON'T GO and save yourself from the wait and insanity"}
{"text":"The mariscos here were hella good! I had an absolutely great ceviche and some bomb ass oysters! the margaritas were ok all though I prefer the aguas frescas. The limonadas are especially delicious!  

There was a live Banda Sinaloense playing and it was pretty loud. They were talented although not a full nor authentic Banda, but we aren't judging on the music but the food!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with this restaurant. Mariscos are hard to come by (good ones, that is) and this place almost wholeheartedly delivered. 

Pros:
- Food was great.
- Service was good too.
- Lots of pre-meal extras.
- Big portions!
- Horchata is actually good.

Cons:
- Music was loud and annoying. 
- Parking sucks. 

Weird:
- Some guy off the street was trying to sell us bread. The restaurant staff seemed to not mind, so I guess it was cool.

Great place. I will definitely be making plans to return in the future."}
{"text":"Good food. All the beers are like 4 bucks each, but other than that everything is reasonably priced. Shrimp and fish tacos are pretty good. The carne asada plate was good. They have a banda usually. Good for friends going out to eat and drink or the family. I will always come back here."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!!  I've gone to this place a lot growing up because my dad loves it. I do know it is expensive, but this last time I was in for a surprise! So first of all they don't give you an itemized receipt. They'll just write an even number on the note pad they took your order on & say this is what you owe. So when I last went, the total seemed higher than anticipated. So I broke down everything we got and added it up just out of curiosity. Come to find out, they were charging us about $20 or $30 more than what I totaled. So when I asked the cashier to break it down for me she started saying that the lemonade costed more than the other drinks but nowhere on the menu does it say that. One lemonade was \"$3.50\" which was what my dads beer cost!(again the menu does not reflect that price) well long story short when she added it up she said she had even forgotten to charge us for a lemonade & it was STILL less than the amount written on the ticket!!! I could not believe they were trying to steal from us. I paid what they asked and got out of there. I'm NEVERRRRR EVER going back and will make sure none of my friends or family do either."}
{"text":"Service was surprisingly fast considering that it was Christmas night and the place was packed. We left stuffed and took the rest home to finish for lunch. We'll have to come back on another day, but if this is how they do on a busy night, slow days must really be good."}
{"text":"Este lugar es lo peor.. malas meseras y un muy desagradable lugar para comer...  fuimos a comer pero nunca nos atendieron tenian soloooo  4 mesas y como 5 meseras y nunguna. Nos atendio .. es el peor lugar de mariscos .. el chiuahuta esta muchsisisimo mejor"}
{"text":"Okay let me start off by saying this, i ate here repeatedly since 2007 because this is the only place i thought had good mariscos, vuelve a la vida has roaches, mariscos chihuaua has sucky waitresses, and to make a long story short this was the place to go before they made the restaraunt bigger.   Since they made it bigger i have only came 2xs which is nothing compared to going once or twice a week as before, both times i had very bad experiences our waitress was a very good looking girl however lacked common sense we had one drink never asked for refills our drinks were empty the entire meal i asked her twice for a refill, the chips were stale( probably because i watched a waitress take chips off of a table and dump them back in the chip oven so they basically recycle their chips), she couldnt get off her phone, our appetizer we ordered never came, there was ants crawling on the wall and near my food when i told her she pretended like she couldnt hear me, the banda doesnt bother me, and the food both times wasnt that great but they raised their prices."}
{"text":"Good service. Everything was good. Used to fish and shrimp tacos prepared estilo Altalta. So the shredded lettuce threw me off a little bit but wasn't bad. I'd come back if I was local."}
{"text":"I have to give it two stars due to the cleanliness of the place. The window shades, floor and walls were all splattered with what it looked it could be salsa or hot sauce. I had to clean the booth seat because it had some kind of liquid on it; flies were present. Something that also disturbed me was that the sauces, salsa and mayo bottles had no caps! Do you think the flies landed there a few times? You betcha! It worries me that their standard of cleanliness could be also carried in the kitchen were food is prepared. Speaking of food, it was good, overpriced but the portions were ok. The Banda music was super loud (great music though) but we could not hear each other. We put on our earphones and we could hear the music without busting our ears! The staff was friendly and repeatedly asked if everything was fine. I hope that they take notice on these reviews and give the place a good cleaning, from the ceiling to the floor including the walls and window shades. And please, please, please, get rid of the flies!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Went in with the family,  waitress was a bit rude. Brought or food out partially,  then disappeared.  Had to ask the barback/cleaner lady for our stuff.  Food was not great,  which is sad used to be really good. Table next to us was also frustrated with the service and food."}
{"text":"Los aguachiles pala. Cruda 


Buena comida ya Se donde ir para la otra vez que vaya

Desde L.A"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING HEALTH CODE VIOLATION THAT SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A RESTAURANT. Went and got cheese enchiladas and found a curly hair mixed in the cheese inside the enchiladas. Rice was also too hard and under cooked to eat. When we called them to let them know, they made us bring the plate back for everyone to look for the hair and then claimed it wasn't there until I tried to show them a picture from my phone of it. They laughed in our faces and were incredibly rude. And when I spoke to them they claimed that they did not know English even though the rude lady knew exactly what I was saying. To top it off they would not even refund the money for the full meals that we purchased. I'll never return and this place should be shut down for its lack of cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"I hot culichis filete was not very good. Service was slow and took 20 minutes for refills. Another 20 for us to chase her to get our bill. The salsa was not good."}
{"text":"This place has awesome sea food my favorite are the breaded shrimp. They are too bomb only downfall of this place is how small it is and they sometimes have live music which can get a little hectic but if you don't mind that than this place is great. The portions are great you get a lot of food for your money."}
{"text":"Altata requires a minimum of two meals every time I come to Phoenix. Best Mexican seafood I've ever had and I've been to a lot of places.  

The place usually has live music and it's LOUD! Definitely not for the faint at heart. 

If you can power through the music then you'll LOVE LOVE LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Indeed Altata does have some of the best seafood ever! The reason why I am only giving three stars is because of the service.  I cannot emphasize enough that if your a women eating here with out a man and your not ordering things left and right you WILL receive the worst service ever. Every time I've visited we always get ignored biece of someone else. I once waited thirty minutes just to get someone to run my debit card. I've learned to just get up and tell them to do it. 

The food like I said before is what keeps me coming back. Although I no longer eat inside I always order  .  It to go."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida pero lastima por el mal servicio que dan las meseras andan con mala cara y descuidan muchos sus mesas ......."}
{"text":"While in AZ for family, we went to this place per the recommendation of some cousins. Those same cousins came with us and told us to get the platter of shrimp mojo de ajo style. I'm not a big fan of shrimp so I was like, \"meh\" and ordered the ceviche tostada with scallops and squid... It was pretty good. I was actually surprised by how fresh the seafood was considering we were in Arizona! 

I messed up. When their shrimp platters came, the smell alone got me salivating. It was a full platter of large shrimp smothered in garlic goodness. I stole a handful or so from my dad's plate and savored every bite. Those shrimp kicked my tostada's ass. Again, VERY surprised that I can now say my favorite shrimp plate is down in Arizona.

The only reason I give this place a 3 is because everything else we had was alright. The little soup that comes in a cup was okay and had some definite seafood flavor, but was too salty."}
{"text":"Mariscos Altata has very bad costumer service. I do not think that they appreciate the importance about providing good costumer to their clients. 

We arrived at 12 PM and were promptly seated, we thought we were off to a good start. Took the waitress 15 minutes to acknowledge us. When she finally did she took our drink order and took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, STILL waitress had not taken our entree order ,although we tried telling her what we wanted to get, she kept saying she would be right back. Next us was a party of 4 who had arrived 15 minutes after us. While we were still with only our drinks, they were already getting their food. 

We were so upset that they kept forgetting our table, we paid our drinks and left to La Botana on 43rd ave And Indian School. I will never return here nor recommend this place to anyone due to their horrible costumer service."}
{"text":"We always come here to get the famous cucaracha shrimp and it has been always great but today the shrimp it was totally over cooked and we asked our waitress so respectfully and she took our plates to the kitchen with no problem; 15 min later she came with the exact same plates saying they didn't have more shrimp to make another plate for us and replace the over cooked ones! And the waitress said that they don't have anymore shrimps,I didn't bolive, they just put more dressing and that's it.and 10 min after I saw that same plate with shrimps for a different table,  After that the waitress didn't come to check on us for the rest of our staying she just brought the check and didn't say anything else. Poor servece"}
{"text":"As far as authentic mexican seafood places go, you really can't beat Altata. I've grown up in mom and pop mexican food restaurants, so in my professional opinion (lol) this is the best!!! Hands down. If you're not scared of what the place looks like (it's very unpretentious, simple tables/chairs/decorations), you will enjoy a delicious plate of food. Our absolute favorite (we get it EVERY single time we go) is \"camarones a la cucaracha\" which are buttered, grilled shrimp with a dipping sauce. Another of my favorites is the cream-cheese stuffed fish filet, and you can't go wrong with a plain old shrimp cocktail. 

I really should have given this place four stars because the one thing we really dislike about this place is the loud music they have sometimes on evenings and weekends. They let large bandas come in, I mean, sometimes with like, ten people and it's such a small place that a band with a tuba and drums make it literally impossible to carry a conversation with the person sitting in front of you. Since the food and service are so good, however, I gave it five stars. If the music really bothers you, the Altata on Indian School and 35th avenue (I think it's there) has the same cooks, but doesn't have live music or serve beer (this might be a problem for some people). 

Oh, also, they allow vendors to come into the restaurant. You'll be hit up by like, five people during your dinner to buy things from them (trinkets, DVDs, etc.). The food really is so good, though, that these things really don't matter to me."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat! Friendly device, great food, and nice background music! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I'm one word it's awful!!!!$' The food was nasty!!!!' Don't waste time or money here."}
{"text":"La verdad mucho tiempo sin venir a Este lugar exelente carne azada muy buen sabor y los  tacos De pescado riquisimos buen servicio"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm still trying to recover the hearing that I lost while dining here. The food is good... The shrimp broth they serve you is so delicious... There salsa is unique flavorful... My husband had campechana especial and it was very flavorful and good... I had fried fish rice and beans.. All very good... Michelada good... But Damn the music is painfully loud... Shocks you to the core... Nothing against banda but whoa! Makes it hard to enjoy your food. Also the staff not sto friendly... Kind of rude actually.. Maybe it's the frustration of being unable to hear their customers..."}
{"text":"Top notch, from the soup and chips to the shrimp seafood platter for two, food was great. Machine tortillas was my only complaint, so that ain't too bad.

They make a solid michelada too.

Banda live music is badass, loud,so not much of a place for a family get together or intimate meal...

37 minutes drive for me and I would gladly do it again."}
{"text":"Was to many fly's in the restraunt food was nasty don't order fish filet it was soggy rice wasn't fully cooked the cucumbers had a nasty flavor. I wolf not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Ok, so this review might not be 100% fair because generally I'm not much of a seafood gal and this place is pretty seafoodcentric. I went here for lunch today with a couple of girls from work. This place does have a few non seafood items, but it is pretty limited. I got a carne asada taco and I got a scallop tostada (I like scallops alright). Well, the taco was somewhat bland. There was nothing exciting or special about the carne. The scallops were alright, but it was a scallop ceviche and I felt like the scallops hadn't had enough lime or hadn't marinated long enough because they still looked pretty raw to me (I'm not sure if this is normal...). The flavor was good, but very spicy! I liked that, but I didn't like looking at the scallops while I was eating...it made me a little nervous. Also, the tostada was loaded with juice or sauce that fell all over and the tortilla didn't hold up to the topping (both mine and another girl's totally fell apart). Overall, this place was fine and definitely authentic, but I would not go back."}
{"text":"1 michelada ($7), 1 tostada de ceviche($4.50), some fried shrimp plate for g1 ($16.99) , a jamaica  for g1 ($5)....how the f'k does my check come out to $70????????? Fuck this place, i sent the check back! Just cause i bring a white girl here they gonna try and play me???  Do not come here! Been 20 minutes since i sent the check back and they gonna play like im not gonna say something.......

Update: So after i sent the check back, and after 20 minutes of that server saying she was gonna revise my check, she comes back and says, we refunded the 67.50 plus the added gratuity to your card, your actual bill was only $34.....and then she really awkwardly watched me sign the new reciept for a tip...needless to say, i put a big fat ZERO..never going to that place again.And after putting this on facebook, i had soo many responses from friends, saying how this has happened to them as well....DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! THEY RELY ON HUNGOVER paisas that go there on weekends and stay drunk and dont pay attentiin to their bill...DONT GO THERE...THEY WILL CHARGE YOU DOUBLE Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The music is soooo loud. My friend and I converse in between songs. I don't know how parents can bring their young children here. I would never.... We had the fried fish and it was delicious! We also has fried shrimp, ha ha all fried is heaven. The food is yummy. Had there tacos el governador, which was disappointing because it's just a shrimp taco. Maybe the cook doesn't know what they are,lol.. The michelada is a bit less than average, they don't bring you the left over beer. I seriously dislike that. Too much michelada needs more beer. Over all a place to go mingle not the best at there dishes.. I prefer Playa Hermosa for the food and micheladas."}
