{"text":"We just moved from Scottsdale to chandler a couple months ago and finding a great spot to frequent has been a major struggle. Thank goodness for the Brickyard! Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drinks.. Not one detail is ever overlooked.. Very attentive staff from the girls up front to the bartenders, expos & management.. We have been in this industry for YEARS and appreciate when you can find a place that runs so smoothly where you can actually relax & enjoy yourself;-) We're beyond stoked to have found this place and whenever we get a break, we are bellied up at the bar eating those delicious tacos! Thanks to everyone for making this a great spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary pretty low key this year but still enjoyable. We found the Brickyard and it was definitely the best choice! Their tapas (or shareable plates) were delicious! We ordered two kinds of tacos (Chandler Street Tacos and the Pork \"Bahn Mi\" Tacos) and the Mini Bricks. There was so much flavor in each bite than although they weren't each a full meal (they are tapas after all) we were very satisfied by the time we were finished. Their cocktails were on point too. I would definitely recommend their Margarita, although I'm sure any of their cocktails would be good. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Henry is an amazing bartender! He knew the history of the different styles of drinks, and of course he knew exactly how to make them with style. Fresh squeezed juices, perfectly balanced flavors, and personal touches really made it feel special. This is definitely not another messy college bar, it is a true cocktail experience!"}
{"text":"Best food in downtown chandler! I'm taking a star away because all the hard surfaces the noise level make it hard to carry on a conversation. But the grilled peach, chicken and churros are all so AMAZING! I was so blown away with the favors!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in downtown Chandler.  The staff knows how to please and are cry attentive.  They are craft cocktail experts and know how to make a fantastic drink.  The chef is very creative and has great takes on the appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"Wow.....truly impressed with the craftsmen ship of each cocktail. Each drink was perfectly balanced and tasteful. The ambiance was comfortable and modern. The staff was warm and inviting and truly mastered their craft. It is our new go to spot for visitors and date night."}
{"text":"Another amazing night at the brickyard! Food was awesome and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"A go to spot if your in Downtown Chandler. Just about all of the staff ate great. Bartenders do it right. Gavin (owner) is very present. The pork belly and the tacos are very tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I lf you like noise this your place.  My wife's margarita was the smallest l have seen. Most of the drink was the ice cube. I ordered a hamburger . It came as two small sliders.  No mustard on the place. Also l asked for onions couldn't find them.  My  first n last time here."}
{"text":"This may be the best cocktail/restaurant in town! Actually it is thee best in the State! They do an impeccable job of creating beautiful foods and gorgeous cocktails for any palette. Very knowledgeable Mixologists that are willing to direct you into a suitable cocktail for your taste."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to visit when you're in Chandler. The service was prompt and the food was phenomenal. But the menu is small there's no doubt that care goes into every meal. The drinks are top notch and crafted extremely well. Even though they've been open for only 5 weeks, this place shows no sign of being new kids on the block and have the utmost professionalism to their customers and to the name. Will enjoy visiting the Brickyard over and over again on my visits to Chandler Arizona. Thanks for taking care of us, Gavin and Tara!  If you can, I'd love to know what Bourbon used in the Old Fashioned, as being from Chicago, I can't frequent as much as I'd like!"}
{"text":"The mother f-ing bomb. No weak drinks. Always awesome drinks and great service! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and the food was delicious! Loved the atmosphere and our waiter was cool. The prices for a happy hour are ok and the portions are small but the quality and taste make up for that! We had the street tacos, pork belly skewers, and calamari! So yummy, will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. The tapas style \"shareable\" menu makes it possible to try many different things. EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. The drink menu is so creative and fun! Again.. all delicious choices. It's really hard to go wrong here. The service is over the moon. They explained all the details of every dish, made excellent suggestions for food and drinks. Great date night!! We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food! Love coming here the staff is great! The atmosphere is wonderful! Enjoyed myself fully thanks again!"}
{"text":"The small plates are pretty small. I had the street tacos and there were 3 tacos that were on 3 inch tortillas  (no exaggeration).... for $12 and no sides are included. They were really yummy but I left hungry. The restaurant itself is pretty small and cramped. Service was great though."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb!!! Super cozy. Exposed brick and prohibition style. The craft cocktails are amazing. They have tapas to share. We had the roasted cauliflower, loaded fingerlings, and street tacos. All delish. For drinks we had the dove (tequila drink) and the blackberry pimms cup. We ate and drank every last bit. Wish we lived in the east valley so we could be regulars. Will make this a stop any time we come back out this way."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is \"small and old school\".  Food is simply amazing.  Breath of fresh air for downtown Chandler.  Our new \"place\"!"}
{"text":"A group of four came in at 7:00 on Saturday night for a drink. There were two stools at the bar available so the girls sat while the guys stood behind. The seat back cushioned stools are very sturdy and comfortable.  The bartender recommended a drink and it was fantastic. I love the bow ties and dress of the bartenders! They are very attentive and friendly. We had dinner reservations elsewhere but we will be going back to The Brickyard for dinner and drinks soon."}
{"text":"This is my third time here.  The drinks are great, and by great I mean, some of the best mixology I have ever tasted.
The bartenders are artists.  I like the drinks on the menu, but prefer telling the bartenders what I like and letting them get creative.  Don't expect sub-minute drinks, perfection takes time.  Just order ahead.
I tried the food for the first time.  The calamari is out of this world.  I talked to one of the owners, who always seem to be there watching over things(nice touch), there is a new spring menu coming out and I put eyes on the jello seared ahi.  Can't wait to try it.
This place isn't cheap, but worth it for the quality and unique vibe.
The Brickhouse is a welcome addition to the tired downtown Chandler scene."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Best part is the cocktails. Really really good. If you want the best ingredients and someone that knows what they are doing, this is the place to go in downtown chandler."}
{"text":"A few weeks back a friend asked if I had been \"to the new place in Chandler\" which piqued my curiosity. I was sold within the first 5 minutes. 

Your bartenders are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.  And damn do they ply some amazing wares!

Food is well above the mark, highly recommend trying the charred octopus, you will not be disappointed.

Let's be honest - the old fashioned  (rye, not bourbon please) is what keeps me coming back each and every time. The house rye is tasty, but if you miss happy hour (which is a nice 3 hour stretch, including weekends), then grab yourself a pour of Rittenhouse. Amazing! 

If you get a chance, let Bobby bend your ear on the plethora of cocktail options ... mad genius behind the bar!  Can't wait to see what they come up with next and how the place develops."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner, great atmosphere!  We were so impressed with the food, it was a culinary delight.  We sat at the bar and the two bartenders were so incredibly helpful and attentive.  They gave us wonderful menu recommendations.  Definitely order the Octopus and Butternut Squash ravioli.  Love the sharing style plates, definitely allows you to roam their yummy menu!"}
{"text":"The bar keeps definitely groove to the craft cocktail craze with flair.  Kitchen staff have same groove going on.   Food was fine but come here for the booze."}
{"text":"Simply amazing: great quality, fast service, awesome ambiance. I had the Shishito peppers (best I've tried) and the lamb. Mouthful of flavors.

Endorsed"}
{"text":"My experience was brought to me by two specific bartenders, Bobby and Tyler. I later found out that Bobby was chief mixologist. Over the course of a few hours and several \"WOOS\" from a table of especially rambunctious teachers, they maintained an exceptional level of professionalism filled with personality and smiles. 

The entire wait staffed adorned in plaid, vests, ties and bow ties proved smiles and excitement throughout the evening. What struck me was that one of the owners, Gavin, was running food and bussing my entire stay of a Friday evening. He was hustling as hard as his staff. Finding out his role at the end of the evening made an even bigger impact to my entire experience. 

As for the cocktails, sitting at the bar and talking to the bartenders (they will make whatever your hearts desire). Give them a base liquor and a desired taste profile and your tastebuds will be in pure bliss. Want something made specifically? The will make your preferred drink even better than you've perfected in your own home. Their drinks are made in a way only to be described as, enough to taste the base liquor but not enough to know the extent. Every drink drinks extremely smooth, almost too smooth. The personality of the bartenders and the flawlessly executed cocktails makes this a must revisit."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, I was expecting typical bar food but instead I received some delicious eats! My wife and I had the truffle Mac and cheese, the mixture of bread crumbs and truffle sauce completed this dish. My wife had the calimari, I don't eat that stuff so can't say much. She loved it tho! And we shared the mushroom Swiss bricks, I couldn't believe how much flavor could be in a slider!  Food was deelish! Next time we are in AZ we will def comeback. Shout out to Bartender Henry he was very attentive to everyone in his section and the Arnold palmer he made my wife was yummo."}
{"text":"This menu has an amazing variety of full flavored options!  The shishito peppers are a favorite!!"}
{"text":"If you're a foodie you'll absolutely love this place!  Fantastic food, great service and crazy unique craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Great drinks. We had icebergs and they were excellent! Our bartender Marie took great care of us. Thanks Marie!!!"}
{"text":"Pork belly skewers and loaded fingerling potatoes?  Three words. Aaaaa-maaaaaaze-zing!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! All of the shared plates we tried were flavorful and well prepared.  The lamb was 'melt in your mouth' good!!  Our waitress was fun and provided prompt service.  The manager even stopped by to check out how things were going.  We can see how this place is always hopping!!"}
{"text":"Dont miss the calamari ! Food is full of flavor drinks are proper . My favorite restaurant no doubt"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went at about 9pm on Friday and there was no wait for a table for four people. The vibe was awesome and the service was great. The food was a little pricey but very high quality and worth the splurge every once in awhile (I had the Chandler street tacos and creme brulee). And the cocktail menu was amazing! Again, a little pricey, but unique drinks to try on occasion. I had one which incorporated cascara tea from Peixoto Coffee next door - delicious and I loved the partnership between local Chandler businesses! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! I brought my hubby here for Father's Day and we had the best time! The staff was amazing, the food was Delish and the drinks were phenomenal!! I highly recommend the house made Churros and the Tropic Thunder drink! We plan to become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Nice combination of cocktails and cuisine! Warm and friendly atmosphere to enjoy time with family and friends. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Just finished a great meal here.  Very creative menu with lots of items for sharing.  I had the Charred Octopus and Tuna Tartare.  Charred Octopus was super tender, had a bit of char from being grilled and was accompanied with a few Japanese shishito peppers.  The tartare was also really good.  Tuna was bright and fresh, sunny side quail egg on top with bright orange tobiko eggs (fish roe) on top.  A fun and surprising find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. As expected it is a little pricy, especially for drinks but definitely good enough to recommend."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying the 5 course NYE dinner!!! With Alcohol pairing! The food was sperfect! Loved the Amuse. A Salmon Puff! With a homemade soy!! Course 1 a Scallop with Shrimp toast! Cooked the perfect temperature! And sauce was savory. Course 2 the Kale Caesar!!!! Wowza! Caper berries are delicious! Course 3 the squash ravioli! This should NEVER CHNAGE! It's just too good!!! Course 4 the Sea bass. With forbidden rice and julienned veg mix. It was great but my husband had the Osso Bucco and it was an explosion of the most tender fall off the bone meat and the rich sauce accompanied with a horseradish cream! Whoa! Just WHOA!!! And then the dessert! This chocolate pudding with homemade salted Carmel and peppercorn whip cream finished with berries and bacon brittle. I want this every day now! Lol  the drink pairings were so great too! Thoughtful craft cocktails with smooth finishes and great creativity! Will be back! AGAIN!  between the Chef, Manager/Owner Gavin, the mixologist and our amazing server Remy..... it was a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. Food is amazing and cocktails are fantastic.  Started with the Desert Rose, with the awesome champagne foam, and finished with the Sonoran Sour. Both were delicious drinks. Great environment, not only dapper, but also incredibly helpful staff! Highly recommend you check out this place, it's new and it's crazy great!"}
{"text":"Omg...food absolutely amazing! !! We didn't set out looking for tapas,  but what a great treat! !! There at happy hour into dinner time.  Great server,  great food,  great atmosphere. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Small and intimate in a good way. Owner is always around and pays attention to all details.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very nice and very knowledgeable.
Food - all tapas.  We had pork skewers, hamachi crudo, charred octopus, grilled cauliflower, and pork banh mi tacos.  EVERYTHING was great and very hard to pick a favorite. And I consider myself very picky. Pretty much can't go wrong. 
Drinks - good bourbon list and good options for specialty drinks. Also good gin and rum options. 
Highly recommend it and is a great date night place"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim because I saw the cocktail list and knew my husband would love that. From the moment we entered we were impressed. The bar has a throwback/speakeasy vibe that starts when you walk in and doesn't stop. We started with a pimm's cup and an old fashion and they tasted fresh, clean, and expertly crafted. We ordered fried artichokes, pork belly skewers, and loaded potatoes for dinner and the food was fantastic. Rich, vibrant, aromatic, and colorful these dishes elevated our experience. You can tell there is a high level of pride here. The gentleman who brought our food explained everything and was very knowledgeable about the elements that were involved. We finished with coffee and creme brûlée. I should mention the service was amazing. We sat at the bar and had excellent conversation with Henry who was super cool and made us feel like old friends. We appreciate our experience here so much we can't wait to come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Delicious small plates for sharing. Highly recommended for the food. Deduct one star for the uncomfortable hi-top tables. Great service."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh cocktails & inventive cuisine. The space is artful & creative. The staff is intelligent & friendly. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a few cocktails on a friends birthday and we had a nice time. Our server, Kane, was amazing - based solely on his service we would be back. It helped that the Primm Cups were fabulous though.  

Side note: the beer selection is lacking, I would still prefer a few more beer options but I understand it's a cocktail lounge so I won't take any stars for that."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome! The food was amazing and everyone enjoyed themselves. I had actually ordered the asparagus salad with ingredients that I know I love, but the sauce was a bit off for me and not something I could get into. Our waitress, Ashley, couldn't have been more gracious about it. She very willingly offered to swap out the salad for me. I ended up the spinach salad that was delicious! 
That is service!
Thank you, all we had a wonderful evening. 
My only drawback is the volume, with concrete floors, brick walls, tin ceiling the noise was above normal or average."}
{"text":"This place was packed on the weekend, but for some reason the back patio was wide open. They even have a nice fireplace/built in chiminea in the patio. The food is unique and they their drinks are one of a kind. You might even find yourself asking what some of the items on the menu are, because you might not have heard of them. The menu is definitely for foodies that want something new and the drink menu feels like a through back to the 1920! Beautiful dishes with a romantic patio!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Been here twice.   Had banh mi tacos, octopus, meat/cheese plate.   Also has several beers including prohibition.  Also had really good Manhattan and a gin and tonic drink.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, especially the pork belly. Lots of options of tapas!  The bartenders were super nice and knowledgeable and even suggested specific specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"I love the tuna as I'm sure everyone does. (Doesn't matter if it's between the appetizer or the main dish, they're both excellent) -- I would love it if the corn soup made its debut officially onto the next menu's seasonal changeover. For anyone that hasn't had it, I know you will find that it is a beautiful delicately flavored dish that you just can't get enough of! Can't wait to see what chef comes up with for next season."}
{"text":"Wow.  

Ended up in downtown Chandler for solo dinner on a Tuesday night, and this place called to me.  I am so glad it did!

First off, these people love cocktails.  I mean, REALLY love them.  There is a ridiculous collection of bitters, and all the top shelf liquors a functioning alcoholic could want.  I decided to go with a Pimm's Cup, because it's been approximately HOLY HELL degrees every day this week, and Pimm's is a solid choice when it's hot outside.  Good move on my part - it was light, refreshing, and perfect for an evening in the triple digits.

Then the food -- ahhh, the food.  I had a hard time deciding because everything looked so good, but I finally settled on the fried calamari (I can't resist some battered squid, y'all) and an endive & pear salad, as a nod to the healthier side of things.  But not too healthy - that salad also had candied walnuts and blue cheese.  It was quite tasty, overall, but I have to say my heart was stolen by that fabulous calamari.  The batter had Sriracha in it, and it was served tossed with big leafy herbs and small field lettuce leaves.  And the best part was the roasted half a lemon, which you squeeze over the whole thing.  It gives a light acidity that just makes the whole thing pop.  Seriously, eat this.  If you can handle a little heat (Sriracha!) you owe it to yourself to try the calamari here."}
{"text":"This was such a great place! From dinner to drinks to dessert to the stellar service 5 stars all the way around!

The Delicious Sour might be my new favorite drink! Unless that honor goes to the delightful Pineapple Passion Pimm's Cup! 

We sampled the Loaded Potato, Tuna Sashimi, Pork Belly Skewers, Dumplings and Chocolate Pot Au Creme. I would have all of them again. 

Our server and the manager were perfectly attentive. 

I can't wait to go back and sample more of their delicious offerings!"}
{"text":"Best Hendrick's gin and tonic I've had in awhile!  Calamari was good, but a little rubbery.  The churros were amazing!  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place: the food (of course), the atmosphere,the staff, the energy, the music.  Shrimp toast, ham and egg, duck, and the beet salads are all must try. I hope they make it to the next menu - their food and drink menu changes quarterly.  The only thing I would change at all is adding lunch... even if only on Fridays... perfect spot to meet friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner this past week after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp. The Brickyard did not disappoint. We ordered the octopus, fired artichokes and a meat and cheese board as well as the ahi tuna entree. All were amazing. A great selection of unique drinks and the staff was friendly. Our waitress was attentive and the manager (?) was great at coming by and explaining the food as it came out. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and have a few drinks. Casual place to hang out, meet your friends after work, and relax. Great menu and happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"I met my good friend there for after hour drinks on a Friday night. My mom came along as well... We had a blast! The drinks were delicious and unique, the waitress Milah, was friendly and helpful. She was very knowledgeable about the food/drinks on the menu. While sitting on tge back patio, the vibe was chill.  it was reflected in the music that was playing! It seemed to be a slow night but we had such a good time we didn't notice!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed. We love inventive cooking and this place is doing it very well. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The dishes were beautiful and tasty. The drinks were great and unique. One of our new favorites! Walked right in on a Friday night. I'm sure that won't last for long as people discover this place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Their service, drinks and food are absolutely amazing! You must try their Pork Belly Skewers and to drink their Smokey Mezcal. This is my favorite spot in downtown Chandler. If you want a place to chill with some good food and drinks. This is the spot to check out. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 3.5 stars. And not because I didn't love the drinks, creativity placed in the food, or the atmosphere, but because this is a tapas style restaurant. For a place that is promoting food sharing, there really isn't anything on the menu meant to be shared with more than 2. I think there's a real opportunity here to up-sell larger portions for larger groups. We came in a pack of 4, ate, ordered two rounds of drinks 6 appetizers, and one shared meal, and we all walked away hungry. I am for sure going back, but probably not in a group. And most likely to taste test the rest of their drink menu."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and its exceptional. We booked the back patio for a private party and it was perfection: bistro lights, fireplace, delightful ambience. The food is beautifully done and delectable. Our favorites dishes are the street tacos, lamb loin, and short rib \"Osso Buco\". The service was terrific from start to finish. Owner Gavin helped us design a multi course party with care and great thought."}
{"text":"The food was not quite what I expected for the price, but they definitely make the best cocktail in Chandler. Service has been hit or miss for me, but overall good."}
{"text":"First timers.  Nice concept. Really friendly & hospital staff, starting with the owner, Gavin.  Quick hit & run for us tonight.  Had the mini bricks, a craft cocktail & craft beer.  Cool atmosphere.  We will come back!"}
{"text":"FOOD - 
Delicious Mini Bricks aka Sliders and ahhhmazing Roasted Cauliflower with curried Fennel salad and Pistachios. I as a person hate cauliflower ...just hate it , but i could not just eat it here but loved it...It is thaaaat good. Highly recommend it.

SERVICE -
Henry and another guy both were awesome. Water was refilled constantly without even being asked and we were checked on couple times as to how everything was and they even lowered their volume when requested.

DRINKS - 

Dint get to try any this visit , but saw Henry making few DEAD DAIQ's and they looked really really good. Can't wait to try them on next time :)

Overall very happy with our whole dining experience tonight( Sunday August 7th 2106 )and will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Called hours before to get a table. They told us they would get us in. We showed up and they told us they could not help us. We called ahead for a reason. Stay away. They obviously don't get economics.... won't be back."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, beware of the \"Mini Bricks\"... Reading the menu it looks like a loaded fries type dish... but comes out with beef sliders. Totally lost my appetite and they were still on my bill. Not the staffs fault, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"What more can be said? Amazing in everything they do. Had the Calamari, could be its own dish with an Asian flare, Shrimp & Grits, depth of flavors and Miso Icelandic Cod- best Cod dish I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Woooooow!!!!!! I am an absolute goody and this place is 100% incredible!!!! Really good drinks and an incredible menu that tastes even better than it sounds on the menu. This is not the place you go when your starving and want a 2lb burrito. This is the place you go when you really want to have an outstanding meal with great ambiance and really really quality food. Out of this world!!!! The chef that created this menu is a maestro of the culinary arts. Truly!!! And executes every dish I've had to perfection. Almost sensory overload. Seriously something you should try at least once. Worth every penny!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good food, nice atmosphere and great service! I highly recommend for date night."}
{"text":"Where on earth do I begin?? My Mom and I paid them a visit. We saw them as we were walking by looking for somewhere to eat. First- the food was exceptional. I had the fingerling potatoes, street tacos, and pork belly skewers, and the sliders. Each had its own unique flavor profile. We went during happy hour so we were able to get an added bonus of great food for an even greater prices. Second- the staff! Hospitality was awesome. I really don't know who my server was but everyone that passed or served my table was beyond pleasant. I am so glad I found this gem of a restaurant.  I will certainly be returning on a regular basis! 10 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Old school atmosphere with servers who have tattoos, rolled up sleeves and suspenders on, a very clean old school look. Serving up quality shareable appetizers. Have an extensive selection of alcohol so I recommend taking a long look at their 12 page drink menu online. Quality drinks I'm sure you won't be disappointed no matter what your drink of choice is"}
{"text":"Left a tip instead of a review on accident. Overall: really good food and really good service. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My husband and I mainly go here for their awesome & different drinks they have, but there food is good! They have a shareable menu which is very good & also a dinner menu which we haven't ever tried. Bobby the bartender is amazing there! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's so good, people are so friendly and the drinks are extremely well made! Also the food is spot on! They keep things new and exciting!!"}
{"text":"We have tried to make ourselves regulars whenever we find a free evening, which isn't very often. Every time we come I would give it five stars and somehow they find new sways to improve. The staff is amazing, the owner is always kind and friendly, atmosphere can be loud and crowded but that just tells me everyone else loves coming here as much as we do. The drinks are phenomenal and the food is outstanding and we love the tapas so we can always order our fav and other new dish to try ! Def would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My brother took me here for a few drinks and some food.  We had the short rib osso buco, charred octopus, and shishito peppers. The food is really amazing here. Unbelievable how tender the octopus is and the flavor is over the top. The sauce on the osso buco was excellent and it was also very tender and perfectly cooked. The peppers were a great snack.  You get a really spicy one once in a while so you need to be careful if you are sensitive to hot foods. The bartenders and the selection of liquor here are excellent and they have some rare whiskys. My brother treated me to a shot of Pappy Van Winkle which is really hard to find. Really a memorable evening, I look forward to doing it again!"}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but this is our favorite place to eat!  The food is sooo good and the drinks are awesome.  Love the atmosphere/ decor and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Me and the woman were on the way to the airport looking for a place to snag some shareables and a few drinks and found ourselves in the modern yet rustic feeling Brickyard. Most of the menu was oriented for sharing plates with ya shorty or enjoying unique drinks with friends. Our meal was highlighted by the great presentation and taste of the pork skewers. They came out just as they were pictured on the website and tasted even better than they looked. We also had the loaded potatoes, shrimps tacos, and some dark and stormys which all exceeded our expectations. The music was awesome and not too loud that it'd drown out conversation. Overall, great ambiance, food, and service. Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Chandler! Creative menu of cocktails and food. Ambiance is sophisticated and relaxed at the same time. Tried the  \"redefining Peixoto\" a Brazilian caipirinha with their neighboring Peixoto Coffee coffee tea as a syrup. Delicious!! We tried several dishes to share and liked all of them: shishito peppers, loaded potatoes, street tacos, gyoza, etc."}
{"text":"Good location, the environment was pleasant on arrival.  We were seated fast, our waiter was really smooth, funny and attentive.  Orderd wine, three plates of food and desert.  Now what I enjoyed most about this place is that you choose \"sharing\" plates where your not getting a gaint portion but rather medium sized portions enough to share and sample different foods with perhaps a girlfriend, date or someone special etc.  If your used to having gaint plates to yourself this place may not be best for you.  Overall the experience was great, my only critism was the desert menu was small, not sure if they change it a lot but I cook a lot in my time, and you can make cheese cake, carrot cake etc ahead of time and have it as a desert item on a menu, not sure why they don't.  Anyways check this place out if you need to take a girl out :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!
My husband, friend and I came here after walking around downtown Chandler trying to decide where to have dinner. Several restaurants have 4 out of 5 stars on yelp, we decided on The Brickyard and so glad we did. From the moment we walked in, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. We had great service and the food, wow. Every dish we tried had great flavor and presentation! Loved the ravioli, the Brussels sprouts, and everything we tried. Atmosphere is inviting and the drinks are good too. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen or so times and find it becoming one of my favorite places to chill.  The vibe is just right and it steps things up a notch in the quality and service department. 

The staff is great and I particularly love it when we have Ashley taking care of us.  She \"get's it\", remembers what you like to eat and drink, and has a great relaxed and natural style to her.  Bobby who is always mixing up some wonderful cocktails has also floored a few of the friends I've brought there.  Great to see the revival of the professional bartender going down in a few good places nearby.  Crudo in DT Phx and the Brickyard are leading the charge IMO.  

I also love the idea of the Brickyard's small plates.  Why eat a lot of one thing when you can graze around and taste lots of stuff.  Their mix on food is diverse and I always down a few orders of shishito peppers which apart from one of my sushi joints, can't be found.  The  Grilled octopus,  Artichokes, Gyoza, and olives served warm are all very good.  I'd love to see them incorporate a few specials floating in and out in the future.

The place is new and always clean including the bathrooms which are solo with a locked door which is always nice. The music is good and lively but if you go there a lot it can begin to wear down on you.  I'd love to hear some new mixes floating in... perhaps some Thievery Corporation or maybe even Bitter:Sweet to keep the theme.

The owner Gavin is always involved and is a roll up the sleeves type guy who happily gets his hands dirty.  He's the kind of owner you route for to do well because of it and of course his staff.

Prices are a little higher than most but people need to understand what it takes to hire and maintain high quality people in the AZ restaurant scene, sit in that DTC location, serve high end ingredients and booze, and build out from scratch.  

The Brickyard has done an excellent job and is must visit if you are a foodie or like high quality spirits.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Downtown Chandler! Since some of my friends live close by, we've been to The Brickyard Downtown a few times. They haven't been too busy around the 4 or 5 o'clock mark on weekdays & the service has always been on point, even when the crowd picks up.

While we haven't tried the full menu items, we've gotten the happy hour options & they've been really good! The Mushroom Swiss Bricks and Loaded Potatoes are definitely must-gets!  I don't eat too much beef but I really like the sliders; they're the perfect size & even come with some French fries. The first time we tried the Loaded Potatoes, we actually enjoyed them so much that we got another order of them! They're always piping hot & come tossed with truffle cream & bits of bacon ... super addicting.

The main reason I like The Brickyard though is for the drinks. While their happy hour special doesn't really save us much money in the long run (since we end up getting multiple cocktails), they are really tasty! My favorite is the Pineapple Passion Pimm's Cup as it's a nice fruity cocktail. My friends have also really liked the Stirred Tommy's Margarita & Lavender Bee's Knees.

Overall, great casual spot to meet up with friends! It's a bit expensive but overall, worth it .. especially since we don't have to drive too far to get there!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a happy hour. Good prices,unique and tasty drinks (if you want to change it up from alcohol, their Sea-Side Salvation is a winner). Good vibe. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is not your typical Chandler restaurant and bar. Craft cocktails, a solid wine list, and thoughtful food menu, along with a classic decor make you feel like you're in Chicago, New York, or San Francisco. The electro swing music really brings everything together. I think this is the first place in Chandler I would recommend traveling from any part of the valley to experience. And today is their grand opening! It can only get better from here."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the Brickyard. The food is amazing. The bartenders and the waiters/ waitresses are very friendly. We found this place by accident 4 months ago and since make it a point to have dinner there once every two weeks. Date night kinda thing. LOVE LOVE LOVE the place!
It's small with an old-school bar atmosphere like you'd find in Chicago or San Fran. Really cool but more important the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Inspired cocktail list, and interesting local (to the southwest) draft beer selection, along with some incredible tapas-style bites and plates.  Absolutely beyond yummy! Everything we had was over the top good -- and we tried a lot of plates at our table -- but without doubt the Banh Mi was the best.  Totally unexpected and completely welcome!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was of how perfectly the bouncer responded to my request for one of the balloons tied to the railing of the outdoor seating area. He was quite the hulking gentleman as he untied the balloon for me and allowed me on my way with it. 

Next impression came when my wonderful friend, who may have had her very fair share of vodka, talked the ear off one of the waiters. Try as he might he just could not slink away to safety. 

I didn't try the food, only the beer, but based on the service alone, this place deserves a solid four stars."}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't been said yet? It is hard to criticize an establishment ran by such a passionate proprietor. Not only did he check twice on our level of satisfaction, he took the time to chat with us about his restaurant, the choice of finishes and decor, and his journey to arrive where he is currently. We had the grandest of times, the blend between service, quality and value was perfect. We will definitely return on our next trip to the area. If I had to nitpick, I'd say a couple of the dishes we tried were a tad busy, but that is really personal preference. Go and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner. I had the best old fashion I think I've ever had. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"We went for a family dinner to this tapas style sports bar. They have no high chairs or booster seats for children so be forewarned.

We enjoyed the happy hour menu - 

pork belly on skewers - my favorite of the night. With pearl onions in between, the belly had the right amount of crispiness on the outside.

Loaded baked potato fries - meh these were ok.  Fingerling potatoes with drizzles of sauce and chives. The sauce was a little overpowering.

Calamari - just average and for $14 was not a lot.

Sliders - they only come with two but the patties were done perfectly with a touch of cole slaw.

Pork tacos - a little spicy but a fun bite in your mouth.

Spicy Shrimp tacos - these were great with a nice mix of small shrimp and mango

I would say 6-7 dishes would fill up about 4 people. Service was attentive but go during happy hour. Also alcohol was expensive at $44 for a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Love love love The Brickyard in downtown Chandler! We had our holiday party there last night & it was a big hit! Gavin & staff were great & the food was amazing! I highly recommend you stop by & try it out."}
{"text":"We spent some time at the Bar and tried some of their cocktails. I tried one of the smoked drinks and I thought is was downright awful:/ The bar itself is cool and a great place to hang out. There are many drinks to choose from and I had some that were better which is why I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great finger food and bomb drinks. Highly recommend this place when visiting downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. They make their own drink(syrups and such) from scratch, as well as all their food. It's a little upscale but a relaxing vibe. Very interesting drink options. I got some apple alcoholic drink and man it was so delicious! The drinks are pricey in my opinion, so happy hour would be the only time I'd go here."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for quality cocktails in the East Valley and am so glad this place delivered. They have a great selection of standard classics but I was particularly impressed with the custom creations of the chief mixologist Bobby, who was kind enough to stop by our table to chat when I had questions about some of the ingredients. We had drinks at the nearby Ostrich a few weeks prior to our visit and I definitely preferred these.

The food was also very good and we enjoyed the sharing of small plates approach. Service was excellent on a Thursday night. The music was fun and the ambiance was mercifully not dominated by flat-screen televisions. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Freak'in yummy everything - food and craft cocktails. So glad we came here!!!  We will be back often. Thx, Brickyard folks!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 6 year old twins here on a Sunday and it was perfect. Not the place for kids on a Friday or Saturday per say, but Sunday was just right. They were the only kids in there and got the special treatment. The bartender made them a special mocktail which made them feel extra special.  We ordered from the happy hour menu, street tacos, burgers, peppers and cocktails. Everything was super tasty. I did have to order an extra shot of vodka for my drinks, they were a bit weak for my Irish palate, but extremely and dangerously delicious.  The owner Gavin was there and chatted with us for a bit, great and welcoming guy.  We will definitely come back here for date night."}
{"text":"This would have been a 3.5 for me if I could give half stars. I had high expectations for this place but I wasn't super blown away. Still good overall, though! 

We came late for drinks on Saturday night (like 11 ish). It's a really cute place to hang out, but the cocktails were actually a little too much for me. I like fun craft cocktails but these weren't my favorite. Definitely fun to try, there's some really creative mixes! I want to try the rootbeer flip if I come again. 

I'd like to try the food too, but we never got around to it this weekend. I'll update my review once we try more!"}
{"text":"Second visit , we feel like regulars. Excellent beer selection, super staff, food is amazing for Chandler , when it was served every detail of cooking and ingredients were explained. The follow up by several servers was over the top! You simply can not love this place. Kudos to the build out-awesome"}
{"text":"We had a very nice first experience here. We had the spicy tacos, coconut shrimp and tuna sashimi. Nice tapas but they add up. We also had some very nice cocktails and the service was top-notch. We sat on back patio which had a of cozy fireplace. Very nice atmosphere. We would go back if we are ever in Chandler again. The music was odd though. The owner called is electro swing to go with the prohibition era vibe but after a few songs I was ready for a new genre."}
{"text":"The Brickyard has very quickly become one of my favorite places in the East Valley. 

There are not a lot of places that I trust to make a solid old fashioned, but the bartenders here knock it out of the park every damn time. I've had sips of other drinks and all have been excellent, particularly the Pimm's Cup, but seriously, if you've ever in your life been vaguely interested in an old fashioned, get one here. I literally close my eyes and sigh in contentment with every first sip of one. If cocktails aren't your jam, don't fret. Their whiskey selection would make any casual (or not-so-casual) alcoholic misty eyed with joy.

I've had a lot of their dishes, but I think their menu is changing soon (if it hasn't already). Not sure what'll be added or kept, but I have a good amount of trust in their kitchen to keep on rockin' every dish they put out. I'm a big fan of charcuterie boards across the board (heh) but theirs in particular is pretty great. I appreciate hat the servers always take the time to explain in detail each piece of the board. I'd also recommend the street tacos (because street tacos always) and the fingerling potatoes (because if you don't love potatoes, you're wrong). 

The service is always stellar here. Everyone is warm and inviting as soon as you walk in, and despite only having been in a handful of times, they recognize me and take the time to make some small talk. All the servers are great about knowing the menu inside and out, and never hesitate to make recommendations when asked. 

The environment is pretty cool too. A little dark, but pretty much what you'd expect from a place with exceptional cocktails and an amazing whiskey selection. They've done a lot with a somewhat awkwardly shaped space--it goes surprisingly far back, but is a pretty narrow place. They've got a patio in the back with extra tables that's really nice when weather permits, and even has a fire place for when it's chilly in the winter. 

I've recommended this place to tons of people, and wouldn't hesitate to keep doing so. Downtown Chandler can be a little rough to find parking on weekends, but Brickyard is well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always very tasty & their bar tenders are consistently phenomenal. An average date (3-4 dishes + 4-6 cocktails) runs around $100+ but it's completely worth it. 

We've been about a dozen times or so & it's a great \"nice\" night out. All the staff is friendly & attentive. It's a great go-to without having to dive to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Craft cocktails in Chandler??? When did the scene blow up here so big? Not sure but it's safe to say the Brickyard is winning the race.

Exceptional service, expertly crafted drinks and FINALLY something other than pretzels, pizza and bar food to complement my booze.

Sure there are some really good bars I'm Downtown Chandler, but I have yet to find one that impresses me from a culinary standpoint, and this place does just that.

Every dish I've tried here is a winner... I'm sure the other desserts are great too but I can't stop eating the mini churros. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Fan-freakin'-tastic from start to finish.  The bartenders take cocktails VERY seriously and although the term \"craft cocktails\" is becoming cliche, these folks nail the very meaning.  

Our brussel sprout/kimchee appetizer was delicious.  The tuna entree was perfection.  The meringue cocktail was fabulous but it is very sweet.  We also got the smokey mezcal cocktail and it was delicious.  

Service was excellent.  They don't take reservations so get there early because it fills up fast."}
{"text":"What was not to love about this place. The food is a stellar, a Tapas Style menu, which was executed flawlessly. I mean flawless. The flavor profiles are to die for, the quality of ingredients is top notch, there is an inventiveness and a steady hand from this young chef. He is one to watch out for. He hails from Oregon and his parents run one of the best Seafood joints I have been too in my entire life. If you are a die hard foodie this place is a must go. I could eat the calamari everyday for life and the grilled lemon was a perfect addition. The grilled octopus was cooked exactly the way octopus should be leaving it tender not chewy and had some serious zing and heat.  My friend loved her porkbelly skewers. I absolutely loved the grilled peach salad and the goat cheese was actually one of the best I have ever had. The craft cocktails were  just as well thought out for their ingredients and custom in house syrups, etc. The staff is hip, friendly, knowledgeable, and fun. The decor is a cozy original brick, an array of leather and studded seating throughout, original tin ceilings adorn the walls as art. Did I mention the back patio? It was gorgeous as well, I just want to sit there all evening and drink one day. Swoon over everything. I cant wait to come back. I think I am in love with a restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on Yelp reviews and ABC15 saying it is one of the 15 bars you must try in 2017. I was not disappointed. The somewhat of a small place has a great vibe. The music was at the right volume setting as to not over power conversations. The liquor selection seems to be extensive. I wish I remembered the bartender's name but he seemed to love mixing drinks. He made it look like an art form. The calamari and the street tacos were so damn tasty. Definitely try this spot out."}
{"text":"We strolled into this place after a dinner across the street.  It looked interesting; very old fashioned, with a modern twist.  The drink menu almost made me fall out of my chair, as the cocktails start at $10.  I kept my mouth shut to appease the wife, and ordered an old fashion, on the rocks.  

I must say it was a decent old fashion.  $12 worth?  Eh, I guess.

My wife ordered a s'mores themed cocktail which was ok.  She didn't finish it and wasn't overly excited about it.

The first bartender to greet us was very pleasant to deal with.  He was engaging, explained the menu and what the place was all about.  He was very knowledgeable about the drinks they served, and was very personable.  Then we got bartender #2 who took over our side of the bar.  He was a complete and utter ass.  He was a smartass to customers, had an attitude, and you could smell his arrogance from the street.  He shrugged off several attempts at simple questions, as we were curious as to the drinks he was making and to learn more about the theme of the place.  Bottom line, he thought he was too good for the customers in there.  Little did he know we had a big group coming to meet us that dropped about $400 at the bar down the way.  His loss.

Moral of the story, don't be an ass because it can affect your business. If you think being a bartender in Chandler affords you the right to look down upon others, understand who you are serving because they may have a pocket full of cash ready to spend with you if you just show the slightest bit of decency.

Try it at your own risk.  Or just go to the better bar down the street."}
{"text":"Drinks with catchy movie titles and movie quotes and characters woven into the description that also taste fantastic, 5 stars! Happy hour menu includes beer, food and cocktails at a discount. Fried cauliflower was the BEST!"}
{"text":"Small plates - yummy food. Best cocktails I've had in a while. Super fresh, not syrupy. Service was on point. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A great new hangout for downtown Chandler. The drink menu is full of custom creations. My fave was the \"Auld\" fashion (limit 2) Only 4 entrees available, my party of 5 tried most of them. Each one is unique in the combination of flavors. My block cut steak was superb. My gals ahi tuna was a flavor masterpiece. Several hors d'oeuvres were ordered and enjoyed. The meat & cheese board and the  fried artichokes are not to be missed. All in all, a great evening spent. Highly recommend to all foodies (& drinkers)."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to stop in for a drink when we were walking by! This place is a gem. Love the decor, our server was great, and the charred octopus was divine. I'm ecstatic finding a bar with quality food and craft cocktails only a few miles from home. Can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Shared portions and atmosphere to the hilt!!! The Bread pudding is amazing!! Must stop"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Downtown Chandler.......great food & drinks with a lot of style!"}
{"text":"Went here to have a cocktail with a friend and loved it!! 
So I went back again and it was still a great experience. 
Their shareable plates are interesting and delicious. Their cocktails are done right! 
It's a super small place which makes for a cozy feel but can also feel a little cramped and hectic on a busy night. 
The calamari is the best I've have in awhile. The mac and cheese was a little soupy but the flavor was amazing!! 
They have great bourbon and they know how to use it! 
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this establishment prior to a concert at Chandler Center for the Arts because it was within walking distance.  It was just a bonus that it was happy hour and we got to sample more of their cocktails. The mixologist happens to have a flair for taking classic cocktails and infusing new and exciting flavors.  For instance, the \"Delicious Sour\" is their take on the classic Whiskey Sour.  This drink is far less \"sour\" and more complex than the standard classic and adds hints of cinnamon and meringue.  It is fantastic!  My wife had something that was named something similar to \"Pineapple Pimm's Cup\".  I'm leery of drinks based on pineapple juice, as they tend to be too sweet.  This drink was sweet, but not over the top.  The sweetness only lured you in to the honey and lemon flavors waiting just below the surface.
We had another round of different drinks with more unexpected and delightful flavors, but I'll leave it to you to explore the \"Custom\" cocktails...
I want to touch on the happy hour food, which was on par with the spectacular drinks!  No really... the \"Mushroom Swiss Bricks\" are similar to sliders, but are real, honest to goodness, beef patties with amazing sauteed mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  They even threw in some shoestring French fries!  In short, yum!  We also tried the \"Loaded Fingerlings\".  Let's just say that we will absolutely be back for more of those...  We were almost done when the couple next to us ordered fish tacos.  The smell was like heaven and they were presented so beautifully that we had to order them to see if it was a fluke!  Our attentive waitress brought them to the table and - WOW!  You will not believe the flavor this place packs into those little tortillas!  I mean, who puts Bok Choy on fish tacos?  Well, let me tell you, it's these guys!
What a great experience.  This place is super cool with the industrial vibe the decor presents.  The staff is accommodating and eager to give suggestions based on your preferences.  And, as an aside, the bartender is extremely entertaining and engaging.  You can tell that he loves his job and takes pride in every drink he makes.  You've got to try this place for yourself.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is an awesome addition to downtown Chandler. The offering of mixed drinks is amazing. And the bartenders certainly know their craft. They'll make suggestions, and watching them build these craft drinks is fun.  Nothing ordinary here. The food is certainly an equal. This is not pub grub... the pork belly and the ahi are my favorites. Also try the shishito peppers ... been here several times and always a treat."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely great time here. The food selection was very fresh and innovative. Our server Jordan was extremely informative describing everything we ordered so that we could understand the food we were eating. The manager Bobby who was the manager and mixologists made an appearance and was extremely nice. I will be back next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I'm picky and this place just wowed me! From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and helpful! Kane recommended Pimms Cup as a not too sweet but refreshing cocktail and it was refreshing and tasty with cucumber and fresh mint! We shared the Street Tacos, Roasted Cauliflower and under Kanes direction the Pork belly skewers! All 3 were amazing! Honestly the best food I've had in a long, long time! Gavin, the owner came over to our table several times to see how we were liking it. We ended with the Churro Trio for dessert and loved every bite! Great place! I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was top notch.  Truly gourmet with an actual chef behind the food.  We had the kale salad, one of the best we ever ate; Mac and cheese, two bites total, and the pasta carbinara.  All great, but for $60 with two beers, we left hungry.  The portions are very small. Service was very friendly, although we think they forgot about our carbinara, as it came very late.  We likely won't be back because we just need more to eat for $60."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks! We ordered the octopus (very tender, one of the best I've had), tomato & burrata (great flavor combinations), mini bricks (sliders...it would have been helpful if that was in the description...I had no idea that's what they were, they tasted like gourmet big macs...good, but I would have preferred to try something different), brussel sprouts (didn't taste much kimchee, wish they were spicier, but very good), and hangar steak (good, but not spectacular). I will definitely be back if I visit Chandler again! Does not disappoint! Next time I will save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Bobby gave absolutely phenomenal service to us even though we arrived 20 minutes before the kitchen shut down. 

We shared the artichoke appetizer, mini burgers, skirt steak tacos, creme brûlée and chocolate cake. We ordered far more than we intended because the food was so good, but did bring some for leftovers. 

!The burgers and artichoke were both good but I don't know that we would order them again. The tacos...oh the tacos! The skirt steak was tender, moist and full of flavor. I could probably develop an addiction to these!

The creme brûlée was tasty with a citrus flavor. The dark chocolate cake with espresso and vanilla gelato was fantastic...this is coming from a girl that doesn't like coffee at all!

We look forward to coming back to try more great food and experience excellent service, although it'll be hard not get the tacos again."}
{"text":"We went to the Brickyard the other night, and I will say that overall it was a very good experience. OK, down to the nitty-gritty of the 3 stars. PRICE. For what you get, the price is too high. $18 for a plate that was \"lager portions\" to share for two was not enough to feed 1 person as a dinner. My only complaint is price per portion size. It's off. I dont mind the smaller portions, I just would like a smaller price tag on it. Call me a cheap B*&%^rd....Im ok with it."}
{"text":"Here are my rated attributes each on a 10 point scale....10 being highest of course:

Service = 8.5, very friendly and prompt
Food Quality = 9, fantastic presentation and quality
Portion Size = 6, pretty small
Food Prices = 6, pretty expensive for the size
Ambience = 7, cool looking, but very loud, cramped and only high tables
Drink Selection = 9, vast and interesting selections
Drink Prices = 6, pretty pricey, $10


Overall, I'd give this restaurant a 7.5 out of 10. Definitely fun, good service, great presentation of quality food. A bit small inside, small portions, pricey and loud. Would I rush back if there were other places nearby that I hadn't tried? No. If I was out with friends and they wanted to go, would I go back? Yes. Certainly worth trying in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and their drinks are expertly crafted and served by very friendly people. 
I love the concept of sharing plates so as the menu suggests you can have a discussion with your companion. Unfortunately, it is so loud in the place it isn't a relaxing experience at all. I was in a hurry to eat and get out so I could hear myself think. The price for two (3 beers  and 2 small plates and 1 larger one was $65 before tip)."}
{"text":"Best craft cocktails I've ever had.  The Brickyard has the craft cocktail mixology down. Pimms Cup, their spin on the margarita, and yuz your head were faves. Bois in da hood is good if you are in the mood for dessert. Their tapas are good too.  Recommend the meat & cheese board & brick sliders. Service was excellent. You can tell they really care about serving quality food & drink."}
{"text":"We love this place. Small, quaint, comfortable. Excellent service. The food was phenomenal. The drinks were unique and tasty. Not for somebody who is on a budget but if you are celebrating an anniversary or a special occasion, go for it!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Arizona for a confernce, A very fun place, food was yummy....chicken, pork belly, scallops and even the lamb was scrumdilioshis. The wait staff was also top notch."}
{"text":"Have gone to the Brickyard a few times now and have to say it is always a great experience.  Have tried multiple specialty cocktails and thought they all tasted great.  I've only tried the pork bahn mi tacos, they were incredible!  One of the best parts of the Brickyard is their staff.  Watching them make cocktails is a show in itself. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We went here for our date night. The service, food, and cocktails we're all great! We had the caipirinha which was one of the happy hour cocktails. It was fantastic, not too sweet and very refreshing. The shishito peppers and calamari we're delicious and had a nice spicy kick to them. We also had the loaded potatoes and flat iron steak, which were also tasty. Our absolute favorite were the pork belly skewers, they were amazing! Great  prices on their HH too. Finished off with the bread pudding which was the perfect end to our meal. I highly recommend this restaurant. It has a great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional.   The food even better.   Even though I am from Seattle, I found all the seafood apps quite fresh and prepared beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"I was invited with some friends.  The place is very small and loud.  There are TV's and no music.  Would not of been able to hear music is there was some.  I had the margaritas that were delicious.  For me, the food is weird and high prices.  Glad I checked it out but not my style for a repeat.  When I say the food is weird I should tell you what we had. 
Stuffed Piquillo Peppers , Shishito Peppers , Charred Octopus  with squid ink sauce."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I wish there had been more meat filled selections. Everything we had was good though. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Had the best meal; started with a squash ravioli with a cream sauce then I had chicken with mushroom over lemon polenta and my husband had the salmon with wine reduction.  EXCELLENT.  service was spot on, friendly and knowledgeable.
thank you yelp reviews for leading us here."}
{"text":"Brickyard is really cool place to grab a snack and a drink, plus their kitchen is open late on weekends which is awesome if you happen to work in the restaurant industry. The cocktail list is huge and everything Ive tried has been great. Bonus: The owner (Gavin) is there every night and is always hospital."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastically amazing .. Cane.. Kain Cain, (not sure how you spell his name) was our waiter and he did an amazing job assisting us. The food and drink recommendations were perfect! The food is to die for and the vibe of the place is very urban and chill. My friend and I got the squash ravioli, pork belly skewers, and fried calamari as well as mini churros for dessert. Everything was perfect! Best food in AZ so far."}
{"text":"This place is outright amazing. Their quality of food is top notch, and their ambience adds to the flavor and experience. The bar is very well laid out, and I admired the lighting. As the name suggests, the place has an old rustic feeling to it. We ordered three different starters here, and shared between the two of us. They were definitely quite filling since these people are pretty generous with their portions. We ordered the fried dumplings, the sliders and the tacos, and all of them were really tasty. Service was prompt, and their drinks are great too. Definitely recommend this place in Chandler downtown!"}
{"text":"Overall:  Nice place, not too expensive, nice environment, different foods with lots of unique flavors.

Food:  Pretty simple menu, about 20 items.  Tapas style.  Unique items on the menu, things I haven't found elsewhere.  Nice, eclectic blend.  Good flavors.  Nothing very spicy (that may be good or bad depending on your preferences).  Presentation is very good.  Portions are on the smaller side.

Atmosphere:  Nice.  Quiet if you get seated out back, a bit on the loud side if seated inside.  But able to carry on a conversation in either place.  Servers and Bartenders are quite pleasant and know the drinks and the menu.

Price:  Reasonable.  If you get drinks, all-in you'll get up in the $70-$90 range.

NET:  Will definitely be back.  Wish they took reservations for couples

TIP:  Won't take reservations for under 4.  Try to get there before 6PM if you're just a couple."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and a pretty good drink selection. Food is a little pricey for the portion sizes but I will definitely make this a place I regularly go back to."}
{"text":"We had the brussels sprouts, arugula and beet salad, butternut-squash ravioli, and the crème brûlée.  I'm a big fan of brussels sprouts. This was a unique preparation in that it had a lot of spice similar to that of buffalo wings. It was good just not clearly superior food.  This can also be said for the arugula beet salad.  The raviolis were a five star preparation; a true melding of unique flavors. The crème brûlée was spot on perfect as well."}
{"text":"Great, great food. I would've eaten another 10 banh mi tacos if there were in front of me."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, atmosphere and service. We ordered multiple items off the menu and find it hard to pick a favorite because of how tasty they all were. BANH MI tacos and flat iron steak are always a good choice! Desert was definitely worth it with the Chocolate Pot Au Creme being mouthwatering. Overall a wonderful date night and I for one will be putting this restaurant on my favorites list."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. The food was incredible, as well as the service. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weeks ago with a co-worker and it was exceptional. The service was spot on, including a visit from the manager checking on us about mid-way through the meal. And the food... I can't say enough about the pork belly, mac and cheese, sea bass and a host of other small plates we tried. This is a tasty treat in Chandler and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Bobby, the manager, came and introduced himself and made sure everything was good. Jordan, our server, was amazing at his job. He explained everything that came out on the plate, and described everything with great detail. After talking to him, everything on the menu sounded like the best meal ever. I will highly suggest this place also the Chocolate Pot Au Crème. The bacon brittle was to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fabulous service. We order 2 pork belly, 2 ham & egg, calamari, shrimp toast, short rib, and creme brûlée for just 3 of us! This is our first time here after hearing a lot of buzz about it. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Have been to the Brickyard 4 times now and must say it is solid attention to the downtown Chandler eating and drinking scene .  Have had several of the appetizers and a couple of the dinners all have been excellent. Tap beers are great as well as the custom cocktails. Give it a try, you will enjoy."}
{"text":"I almost gave four stars because of the high prices but everything was truly worth the price. Defiantly or a place I could afford to go often but a treat for sure. Their bar staff is knowledgable, helpful, and made the best craft cocktails my boyfriend and I had ever tasted. The pork belly skewers were like heaven in your mouth. Not disappointed by one thing. All in all a little pricey for a quick lunch but actually worth it for the quality of food, drink, and service."}
{"text":"The best place in the east valley for high end cocktails my bartender Bobby blow me way with his drink menu 
I'll definitely be going here is n a regular basis. Henry the other bartender made me the best old fashion I've ever had. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations these guys truly know their stuff!"}
{"text":"Great cocktail selection and vibe.  Service decent.  Food a bit pricey for the quality.  Great place for drinks."}
{"text":"I am a hard guy to impress but this place is absolutely phenomenal. I had read about this restaurant here and decided to try it out. Everything went well for me. I ordered a cocktail (I don't remember the name) which was very good. It took him 5 mins to make the drink and I was wondering; never have I ordered a drink thus far in my life that took 5 mins to come to me. This better be good as I am expecting it. And it was better; beyond my expectations. I ordered Street Takos and Calamari to go with the drink. Both dishes were very tasty.  Overall I loved the taste, presentation of food and service. Unlike most restaurants I have been to, the cook here ensures that the food is good and is presented in an equally good manner. Both taste and presentation of food coupled with excellent service made my Friday night. I would recommend this place any time, any day."}
{"text":"A great addition to the downtown Chandler scene. The tapas concept is a nice change. Hangar steak, tacos, ahi tuna and shishito peppers all prepared perfectly. I really appreciate the attention to presentation and the staff could not have been more friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Simply the best tapas restaurant, and maybe THE best restaurant, in the east valley. I've been twice, and each time was outstanding - service, food, cocktails - everything was on point. They change their menus every couple months. Severs and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable and attentive.

My only 2 gripes - 1. space can be a little 'tight'; they really pack you in. This time of year, I'd suggest grabbing one of their patio tables (there's only a few). 2. It can get loud. If you're there with a group, it's great. If you're there on a first date, and you really want to have a good conversation, sit outside or don't go on a Saturday night. 

Other than that...just go...it's awesome.

Try the...shishito peppers, Chandler street tacos, roasted cauliflower, pork belly skewers."}
{"text":"Great space with great food. Loud inside, but we sat outside. They have an interesting menu, all based of sharing plates (although you could just order them for yourself). The cheese plate was excellent and so was the flank steak! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow, wow!! This place was everything I hoped it would be. Great service, drinks and food. You can tell each item is prepared with fresh ingredients. I highly recommend the blackberry elderflower drink and the pork bahn tacos. The roasted chicken was the moisted poultry I've eaten. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The wife and I just moved to the area and I wanted to check Brickyard out. Small, quaint place and we sat at the bar which was very aesthetically pleasing.   Overall, we really liked it. We tried 4 of the plates (its small share style) and a desert. Everything was very good. The drinks were really on point and the bartender(s) were really helpful and friendly. Only negative I can think of would be the price. I'm from D.C. And traveled a lot to Boston, NYC, etc for work and the prices are right on par with nice bars in these cities so I feel like it's a bit overpriced for the area. If you don't mind spending the money, though, the food and drinks are superb. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Truly delicious.....drinks,  food  , service , atmosphere  the whole kitten   Caboodle. Great place for a date can be romantic or a great place to just go hang with friends it is a little bit on the louder side. I would say it's a must try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Perfect craft cocktails.  Excellent service.  Maximizing the speak-easy trent in downtown Chandler.  Great to see Gavin do it his way!"}
{"text":"5+ stars! Called in a few days beforehand to reserve a spot for 13 people for my husbands birthday. Gavin was so kind, got back to me right away, and when I called to change from 13 to 10 people he said no problem. We arrived at the restaurant and had a great spot! It was the entire tables first time at Brickyard. We ordered the pork belly skewers (possibly the best I've ever tasted), the carne street tacos (we ended up ordering 5 orders!), the fingerling potatoes (another favorite), the peppers (a little hot but good)... Everyone ordered an entree too (dang we must have been hungry). We all shared a little bit of everything, by far my favorite was a tie between the squash pasta dish and the Osso Buco! Yummmm! To top it off, our server (forgive me for not remembering your name) was so amazing and was always there when we needed something. We highly recommend this spot for great food, amazing craft cocktails, and the service. Side note: Chocolate Martini is ammmmazing."}
{"text":"Street tacos, roasted cauliflower, churros, and Pin's Cup are delicious. Everything is home made. This place definitely has their act together on service, food, and presentation. My wife and I had a great happy hour date. Gavin and Kane took great care of us. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Didn't try the food, but I can bet it is as good as the cocktails and service. Definitely worth the visit if you are into craft cocktails and trying new things."}
{"text":"We have probably been here about 10 times at least  now and every time it's 5 stars! The food is always perfect and the service even better! We had the salmon for dinner and dumplings for an appetizer both were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great vibe in this newer addition to downtown Chandler. Many mixed drink selections, some good whiskeys, small craft beer selection. The food is fantastic, haven't had anything we didn't like. Our favorites are the shishito peppers, octopus, ravioli, mac n cheese and Bahn mi tacos!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant in the valley that I've tried so far! I moved here a little over a year ago from San Francisco, and have been on the hunt for some good restaurants. I've been to some great ones but this one takes the cake. Their cocktails and food are innovative. The flavors are balanced and so delicious. I can't wait to come back, and they change the menu every 4 months so I'm excited to see what they come up with next."}
{"text":"I decided to select this place to bring in my most recent Bday.  I ended up choosing this place solely based on the fact that it has very good yelp ratings, some of the highest most consistent ratings there is in the chandler area...

Overall, I would rate the Brickyard a solid B+; here is the breakdown. 

Service: A -mazing!  The female server that assisted us throughout the evening was probably one of the best I have ever encountered ... She was very knowledgable about all the food & drinks right down to the very ingredients, which was quite impressive!  Even the hostess was able to suggest some drinks/food items after promptly seating us in the back patio.

Drinks:  A- wesome!  By far this place has one of the best/most creative extensive custom cocktail  menus out of any place I have ever eaten @ in AZ.  Not to mention many of the spirits carried here like one of my favs - mezcal- you usually can't find at the majority of places.  All the different drinks we tried rocked the house, and as long as you know what spirit/alcohol you were interested in their mixologists will make you something delicious!!

Food:  Good, not great or anything exceptional ... But at the same time there was nothing to complain about ... I think I just had higher expectations based on the high yelp reviews.  

Specifics on the food since I'm a real foodie:  the best thing to do, since this is a tapas spot is to try as much as you can and share.  The best items were the pork tacos & the squash ravioli - both very flavorful and tasty. The beef tacos, duck, and fingerling potatoes were good.  I didn't find any of the food items to be out of this world though, but I heard their menu changes frequently, so I will definitely go back to try other things.

The scene:  I grew up in the northeast - NY to be exact, so this place reminded me of places I would frequent back home w/ all the brick and the long tight bar throughout the restaurant.  Cool ambiance & social crowd - definitely low key compared to the old town scottsdale scene. It was a very chill spot to hang, and I was very surprised how busy downtown chandler gets these days!!

In summary, this place is a must try ... It definitely stands out from your typical watering hole/eatery!!"}
{"text":"I just had my birthday get together here last night and it was phenomenal! After being so unsure on where to spend the evening, I decided to tryout the Brickyard. First off, they were so accommodating when making the reservations, and even followed up with me a couple of days before the reserved date. I had a small party of 8, and we were seated on the back patio next to the fireplace. It was so private and cozy and was exactly what I wanted! We were helped my Ariel, who was so friendly, sweet, and made us feel like she was part of the party as well. It was a little pricey, but more than worth it. The drinks were out of this world, as well as the skewers! I recommend this place to ANYONE who is looking for a nice night out. The costumer service, food, drinks, and overall experience was better than any of the restaurants down the street (especially the perch)! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love!! We came three times to have dinner here while on our two week trip. Everyone there has been lovely and helpful, even Bobby stopping by to check in on the drinks and food. Love the tapas style and the different takes on the food. But definitely recommend sitting out on the back patio. It may be small but it is lovely back there! And you can talk to your dinner partner normally. If we ever come back to the Phoneix area we are definitely stopping by again!"}
{"text":"I struggled with giving this place three stars because I think it might deserve four if I give it a second chance. First, let me say that if you don't order smart here, your bill will be extremely expensive. There also seems to be some deceptive upselling by the staff as well. 

Most of their menu is shared/tapas style. My husband and I ordered 4 dishes to share as our meal. Four sounds like a lot but the portions of each dish are not large. We had the pork belly skewers, pork tacos, mac and cheese, and meat and cheese board. Some of these items were on happy hour pricing like the tacos and the skewers. We also ordered two drinks from the happy hour menu. Our bill totaled $75. This is steep for a dinner for two! 

Let me say that we are a dual income/no children household and we are NOT shy about spending money on dining and entertainment. However, this experience was not what I would expect for the price. 

The positives: The restaurant itself is nicely decorated but small. The food is plated beautifully and the presentation is absolutely top notch. The service is five star. 

The negatives: the staff upsells you on everything with no mention of extra price. Again, I'm not upset with spending money on nice things but I don't like to be surprised. We ordered a plate of tacos. Our server asked if we wanted four tacos since we were sharing it, no mention of how many it normally comes with. When we got our bill, it looks like the dish comes with three tacos for $6, and then it is $3 extra for one additional bite sized taco. Shouldn't that have been mentioned? Same for the skewers. We were charged extra for one extra skewer. Also, as mentioned before, the portions are small. 

I would return here as the food was really tasty and the service was great. However, I learned my lesson and will not be taken advantage of again and will order smarter next time. I do recommend going to take advantage of happy hour pricing because some things are quite expensive for just a few bites of food."}
{"text":"Great place, great apps, great vibe, great drinks. Owner is nice and says hello to everyone. Bartender (Bobby?) was talkative and happy and helped with recommendations on apps and drinks. Excellent service with a smile while very busy. Props to him. He made the experience better. Not so much for the other guy though. Kind of an angry stiff who can kill a mood. Too bad, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. But whatever, I'll be back again for sure. Brickyard is definitely a great spot to go."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and pork belly skewers. Delicious bite sized items. Great drinks. Great location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great craft cocktails, bartenders have extensive knowledge of Bourbons and whiskies, and there mini bricks plate couldn't be a more sound use of ingredients, cause it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night and it was freaking amazing! The drinks are made from scratch, the food was a party in my mouth and the service was impeccable! The waitress was so nice and on top of everything. I think it was the manager but a gentleman came over and explained every dish that came out... truly top notch!.. I live in Los Angeles, and when I come back to visit, I'm definitely going back to brickyard !"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 4, and we ordered like 6 small plates and one large. We were pleasantly surprised and impressed with each of our dishes, they had great flavors and unique twists. I wish they had more patio seating, but that is not only complaint. I recommend going with a small group so you can order and try many things, the dishes are very rich and you would not want to eat one dish by yourself- they are meant for sharing."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the wife. Seen good reviews and they are well deserved. The Pork Belly Skewers have to be the best pork dish I've ever had. 

Stuffed chicken breast was just as good. I'm not normally a big lemon person in my meals. Beer on the other hand lemon is a almost a must. First time I've had polenta and I liked it. 

For desert, the Chocolate pot de Creme. The bacon almond brittle was suprisingly awesome. The bacon sneaks up on you and  BAM there it is!.

We also had the assorted olives. They were great for olives but I'm not a big olive person."}
{"text":"Downtown Chandler is nice.  Not just another city next to a college town but a city of its own.  Oh, yes, food and cocktails are the reason for this review.

Table of seven - first come first served and we were grateful for the extra effort the staff went to in order to seat us quickly.  Super courteous and professional.

Price - umm they are high medium.  Still five stars.  Why, food quality, ambiance and staff.  Which are the only reason we eat out right; well we eat out also for the chance for conversation.  

This spot serves small plates to encourage sharing.  The coconut prawns are light and delicious and served on a bed of warm tapioca.  Delicious.  Three orders for us.  The warm olives are a must and incredible.  While we waited for our extraordinary cocktails we dug into an order of olives and two of the meat and cheese platters.   Perfect.  

Drinks are widely varied and inventive, do try the \"inconceivable \" from their romance section.  Nice bourbon and whisky selection too.  

Three salads - delicious, three orders of sliders and fries - perfect and a tasty slaw variety topping them, one of each dessert and our party was just getting started.  

Go to this spot and you will be pleased and enticed by their offerings.  Enjoy and remember price is priceless if you get to build relationships with family and friends.  A nice time was had by all.  j"}
{"text":"We dined in here yesterday evening to celebrate a birthday with family and friends.

The cocktails are delicious their approach to making and refining certain flavors is very strong. We tried two different drinks that resembled a citrus and more of a cool flowering mojito, I tried walking on the sun which definitely had a nice tone of heat, I could go without the egg white. We tried several of the small plates including the calamari which was a favorite probably the best of all the items we tried. We also tried the Chandler Street Tacos, the Baja mi tacos, the cheese plate, potato skins and the pork belly skewers. Everything was delicious. 

Our favorite was definitely the Baja mi tacos and calamari. I would recommend it but keep in mind the prices are expensive approximately 10 to 12 for a cocktail and small plates ranging from 10 to 15 with only enough to get a strong taste of the dish."}
{"text":"We ended up at The Brickyard almost by accident - and I am glad we did. We had a group of 7 guys out for a birthday on a late Sunday evening. We had chosen The Perch, but they had inexplicably stopped serving their entire menu other than their late night menu at 8:00 PM. 

We walked across the dirt lot and saw the back entrance to The Brickyard and decided to give it a shot. By luck, Gavin (co-owner) was out back and when asked if they were still serving he immediately welcomed us and got us a table set up inside. He explained the menu and concept and talked with us a little about what they were doing at the restaurant. 

The menu here is focused on sharing plates - so much so that there are only four entrees listed (more on those later). I have seen this concept attempted before, but often times it falls flat due to poor attention to detail, small portions or bad selection. These guys have it absolutely NAILED. Of the three sharing plates we tried (all were great) the fried artichokes were the crown jewel.

Everyone in our party ordered either the ahi or roasted chicken entrees, except for me. I had the steak - a block cut strip loin. It was pan seared to perfection on the outside and finished in the oven - and had that perfect crystallized crust that adds texture and flavor. One of the best cooked steaks I have ever had. 

The cocktail selection is creative, but still accessible with flavors that  will appeal to both the craft cocktail enthusiasts and those who are newer to drinking creatively. I recommend the Tropic Thunder - which is literally served in a closed mason jar with cherry wood smoke floating atop the drink. 

The building itself is very basic - the old brick walls and minimalist decor shift the focus to the food and drink presentation and ultimately the quality of the fare itself. The service staff was extremely knowledgeable and having the owner there willing to converse and talk shop and food in general made for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great bartenders.  Fun menu.  Nice happy hour.  Quick, courteous service."}
{"text":"We had a good experience the other night trying out the Scottish salmon and short rib.  Wine was perfect with the salmon (Mt. Beautiful) and the Old Fashioned cocktail was excellent.  This place is pricey ($80 for two entrees and two drinks each), so we may have to come back at happy hour."}
{"text":"Dig this place. Drinks were amazing, bartender was awesome, food was great but they only provide small appetizer sized plates. Pricey for food and drinks, only reason it gets a 4 instead of 5."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Hands down my favorite non Chinese restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"This is one of those next generation places where the portions are small and different, but expensive.  Tried the sharing platters and had a few drinks with some family.  The service was slow and wouldn't recommend it.  Neat to try out if in the area, but not go out of your way."}
{"text":"This place was a great find. The handcrafted cocktails were fantastic. Its nice to find a place uses egg whites in their drinks. The selection of specialty drinks was extensive, and all of them sounded appetizing.

We ordered the pork belly skewers, calamari, roast chicken and ahi tuna. The pork belly and chicken stole the show. The pork was crispy, and the chicken had incredible flavor. The ahi was excellent also. 

The place is small, and the staff were very friendly. I'm looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"There are a lot of fun new places opening or that have opened in downtown Chandler, hopefully we don't get as crazy as Gilbert, but still a good thing. And they all go beyond the ubiquitous and boring sports bar that is prevalent throughout the Valley. But The Brickyard is really heads above the rest in terms of food, far superior to The Perch and even Chicago 55 (which suffers a bit from sharing the same kitchen imho, Chicago 55 deserves something a bit more upscale.) Although I could do without the servers listing EVERY ingredient in what I've ordered when they deliver the food, everything was tasty and fresh with interesting flavors and textures. One drawback is the high ceilings and all brick, loud as all get out in there, but discovered some tables in back that seemed much quieter that I will try next time."}
{"text":"Our favorite downtown Chandler place for Happy Hour!! Food: the shishito peppers are awesome and FUN! Why fun? You get a bowl of about 30 cooked, seasoned peppers, and 1/15 will be spicy! Even the hot ones aren't off putting, buy you do notice the heat. They call it shishito pepper roulette! The pork belly skewers are to die for, the fish tacos have delicious sauce/seasoning, the mushroom sliders have a yummy teriyaki sauce. The truffle cream potatoes are delicious! I've never gotten anything I didn't really love there. Drinks: if you like a Manhattan, you'll be over the moon for the Aprecocious. It comes with infused smoke, though I do wish they found a more upscale way to contain the smoke than with a cocktail napkin and a rubber band. FYI, the prices are high end, just like their quality. Happy Hour is the way to go if you don't want sticker shock."}
{"text":"Nice upscale bar on Boston Street with a decent tapas menu.  Drinks are definitely top notch and the service is excellent.  They have a very extensive selection of bourbon and this isn't really a spot for beer though they do have a few on draft.  There are a few seats outside in the back along with several tables and a large bar inside.  There is some seating outside too, so overall it looks small but there is plenty of room.  Definitely worth checking out..."}
{"text":"Great food flavors. Great team service. A must go. We had 7 different shared plates. All excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the best carbonara I've ever had. 
This is a tapas place. Little food. Big bill. But food was done perfectly and drinks are fun. 
Good service and manager was friendly and takes care of the clientele."}
{"text":"I love this place! The cocktails are very original as well as the food. The staff knows how to take care of you without being too intrusive. One of my go to date spots with the wife."}
{"text":"Great food - such talented chefs! Fun atmosphere, friendly staff and a manager. Drinks are good and fairly priced. The calamari is some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Yummy food but small portions. Expensive for the amount of food but fresh and beautiful presentation.  We tried the asparagus salad, squash ravioli, and fish tacos. My favorite was the ravioli. I wouldn't have tried it had the waitress not recommended it but it was delicious. Loved the apple slivers with it. We also got 2 desserts. My favorite was the creme brûlée. It had a slight orange flavor to it that was different and delish. Service was great. Overall fun place to try some different foods but not a great place if you want to eat a lot."}
{"text":"New menu dropped and it is amazing! Never a disappointment here pretty much recommend all of it. And the craft cocktails are a true work of art. Def worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best calamari! The beef taco meat was really dry although the flavor was good. Lovely service. The 2 things I'd love to see changed to make this an even sicker weekend spot: dim the lights and pump up the music. A lovely spot I will return to!"}
{"text":"The Brickyard is a place that I always recommend to people. Between the wonderful perfectly made small bites to the mixology that seems way out of place for a little place in Chandler, it is a recipe for an amazing time. The bartenders (who are remarkable) will teach you about what you are about to experience and give advice without making you feel \"uneducated\" about what you are doing. Very wonderful place!!! I will go back again and again! 

Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at the Brickyard tonight; it has a nice atmosphere nice brick walls and cool looking bar. Open air format and not too loud. Decent selection of mixed drinks; however, not a lot of beers on tap. They started a new menu tonight. Portions very small and priced a little high. I had one beer, dinner salad,  two slider app and a non-alcoholic Arnold Palmer and it was $31 dollars. My Arnold Palmer was $5 bucks seems high for half ice tea and lemonade. Overall food tries to be fancy with lots of gourmet words to describe it. The fish tacos my friend got were very small we were surprised how small they were. Wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night at 6pm. Staff were friendly and always checking on you. The menu didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Went this past Friday and atmosphere was great. Drinks were really pricey for Chandler. We're not in Scottsdale or Vegas! Drinks were good though ( you can actually taste the alcohol and every element in the drink description is present ). We ordered 4 appetizers for 4 people and food was delicious, but was still hungry after. Granted appetizers aren't supposed to fill you up, but I was expecting more food on the plates coming out. In the end, 7 drinks and 4 appetizers later, the bill came out to $150 including tip. The struggle is real!!!"}
{"text":"Im always a fan of a place that takes pride in presenting customers with the total package.  Great food, drinks,  atmosphere, and service. This place does them all really well."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and tasty appetizers. Friendly bar staff. Definitely a place to keep one the rotation. The tacos were outstanding with plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"Pork belly skewers were awesome.  The french 75 cocktail was great. The old fashion was too sugary for my taste, it cut the bite of the bourbon too much.

They didn't mess up my martini, I am always blown away by how many bartenders cant make a good gin martini. I would have liked it in a martini glass though, just me being picky. 

We will definately be back, though not as much as I would like because it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service (the manager even stopped by to see how we were doing) and an awesome vibe.

They dont take reservations and by the time you are done with food and drinks, the bill may be more than you expected :)"}
{"text":"Very fun place for a great cocktail.  It is super cute inside, too.  We liked sitting at the bar.  We enjoyed the pork belly app, too.  We will be back again for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Had my birthday celebration here and it has quickly become one of my new favorite places. Had the Tropic Thunder drink and it was the best cocktail I have ever had! They put out group on their small patio out back which was a perfectly intimate setting for our group of 10. The service was great and very helpful when asked about the menu and drink selection."}
{"text":"Really great addition to DC. The vibe, drinks, and  uniforms remind me of a bygone era.  You'll have a hard time deciding on what to try first.  I say start with the Clover Club and work your way down."}
{"text":"AMAZING. AMAZING. AMAZING. Quality, fresh food with perfectly paired flavor profiles. The craft cocktails are some of the best I've ever had, including the pisco sour, which is difficult to find. Atmosphere is that of the roaring 20's, and suits  it's brick and old time classy feel. Staff is attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable of the menu. This place is exactly what Chandler needed!!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, food absolutely delicious. We sat on the patio was afraid I would be cold but the heaters and the fact we sat next to the fireplace made it extremely comfortable. Our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this place. Only thing to improve would be more items on the menu! We had the ham and eggs, mussels, ramen, diver scallops, and churros, all amazing. Our favorite was the Ham and Eggs. Very foodie food. To drink we had 4 different items off of the themed drink menu-again, all amazing. One of my husbands drinks was a
Bourbon with vanilla and tobacco, it was served in a bottle with tobacco smoke. It smelled divine and after pouring out the drink we saved the smoke to take whiffs off of (it smelled THAT good). It's pricey, but well worth it and you can tell that every dish and drink was made with precision and care."}
{"text":"Me: So the tacos...

Craig: Those were some damn good tacos. 

Me: I think those were my favorite. But a leeetle pricey. Three tacos for $12? That's a $4 street taco. 

Craig: Yeah, those are some spendy tacos. 

Me: But delicious. So many flavors. Now, the truffle mac and cheese--I thought it was good. 

Craig: I liked it more than you. And that's why you let me finish it. 

Me: Well, you did let me have the third taco. 

Craig: True. This is why we're friends. 

Me: I really enjoyed the braised pork cheeks on polenta. Although it needed salt. 

Craig: I'm no salt fiend, like you, but I agree. 

Me: I forgot to take a picture. Fuck!

Craig: The service is excellent. They helped us choose our plates, which is always tough at a tapas place. 

Me: Yes, our server was fab. So helpful, but not intrusive. Speaking of not intrusive, I liked the music. Good, interesting music, and not too loud. 

Craig: Yeah, like electric swing music. On the back patio it's not too loud. 

Me: Yeah, inside it sounded too loud. I liked the patio. Cozy, classy, lovely. 

Craig: At least when the weather is nice. 

Me: I liked that we got seated immediately at 6:00 on a Thursday, despite the happy hour hipster crowd. This place is very hipster-y

Craig: It is, but not in a bad way. I'd say the place is more hipster-y than the clientele. 

Me: Agreed. And now we await the churros. 

...

Me: The churros! 

Craig: Wait! Take a picture. 

Me: Oh yeah, damn. Don't touch that churro. It's mine!

Craig:*laughing*

Me: Ooooh, I like that raspberry sauce. 

Craig: Yeah, it has a nice tartness. 

Me: I like the chocolate and raspberry together. That's amazing. Definitely worth the wait. 

Craig: Yeah, I liked that they split evenly. The math worked out in our favor this time. 

Me: Yes. Three apiece. Perfect. So, stars?

Craig: I think a solid 4.

Me: Really, not 5? I'd go 5. Great food, great service, awesome ambience. All the food was so pretty and tasty. 

Craig: You won me over. I could go 5. I think my hesitation was we only had a few dishes. 

Me: Ehh, we always rate places on first impression. 

Craig: We do love to judge. 

Me: 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect...We loved it! Great service! Great Food! Great Drinks! We had only planned to have a drink and go someplace else.  We ended up having several cocktails and sampled a couple small plates.  If you have one drink, try the Signature \"Large Farva\" -Auchie A.O. * Cynar * Cinnamon Syrup Amontillado Sherry * Cardamom * Vanilla Tobacco Smoke.  The Bread Pudding for desert was perfect.  We asked the Mixologist for a desert drink and we were amazed by the \"Bug's Life\" -Fugu Horchata * Old Forester * Fernet Menta Nola Coffee * Coconut Milk * Gummies."}
{"text":"Unique twists on fresh flavors, impeccable service and a stunning environment.  By far the best restaurant and bar in Chandler, let alone the whole Phoenix land area.  Every single cocktail was on point...Wishing this was in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"A random dinner and drink night and we ended up at this wonderful spot! If you are visiting downtown Chandler, Az please take the time to check stop in. 

I found it on Yelp and we all agreed to try it.  We loved the idea of shared plates.  I have to acknowledge our sweet waitress who was very knowledge of all items on the menu. The drink menu itself was impressive and they use all in-housemade syrups and ingriendants! Let me add the food is also local freshly made everyday! 

We ordered several plates to all share as that is what the restaurant wants you to do. We decided on the truffle mac n cheese, fingering potatoes, mini bricks, and the crispy chicken. 

My oh my! Just by my pictures you can see how beautiful it all looked but let me say the taste was amazing! Service and all, I will be back to try when the menu changes for the fall season."}
{"text":"Very good quality of foods and service. This was one of the bests we've found so far in and around Phoenix. I can definitely recommend this place to any of my friends when they come to Chandler. As it's a bar environment, I wouldn't take kids there though."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! The customer service hands-down is the best I've ever encountered. Henry is an AMAZING mixologist! Happy hour is great, food is to die for. Overall, I wish I could just live here. If you skip out on this place, you're making the biggest mistake of your life."}
{"text":"Cool lil spot for a date.  Great cocktails, had their version of a margarita and dug it.  Total fail on the truffle Mac n cheese.  Mac n cheese wasn't even baked together.  Macaroni was over-cooked and they tried to bury it under a toasted breadcrumb top so it looked \"baked\".  Skip it and go for the Spicy Shrimp tacos.  Those were on point, tasty."}
{"text":"I loved the Brickyard! I was in town for work and a colleague and I visited for drinks at the bar. First of all, the drinks are fantastic! We ended up staying for apps and ended up having the cheeseboard (I would have liked if there were a choice of cheeses but they have a set menu for that), the chicken thighs which were perfectly tender, the scallops and calamari which were fresh and out of this world!! Fantastic place to visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious meats, exquisite cheeses, perfect pairing of beer, music, dessert and personality. That's how my night here was. I ordered the cheese board which is chefs choice of meats and cheese with palette cleansers and enhancers. Jordan is the man you want to ask for when you're here. He has an expert knowledge of the products he's serving you. When he brought out my meal he explained what each item on the plate was. He suggested desserts and I ordered the mini churros. It was equally as good. Again, when he brought the plate out, he explained what each sauce was. While my party and I were eating our meals, Bobby, the mixologist and manager, came over and introduced himself. We were sitting on the back patio and we're the only ones outside. It's chilly outside and the building door was closed. Him coming out to check on us sealed the deal on this place! It's very rare to see a manager come out and personally introduce themselves. When I'm back in town I will come back here and ask for Jordan. If you're in the area please stop in. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow! I say \"wow!\"
The craft cocktails are AMAZING!  Food is delightful too!  I came here from Tempe and would happily drive from Phoenix or Scottsdale to come here again.  The music is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This was a fun little spot. Would make a great date night/first date. The drink menu has a spin on old cocktails with various spirits. 

Ordered a few coctaills a nd plates everything was good. Staff was very attentive and informed. They gave great suggestions. The resturant was clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good little bar that serves yummy tapas hidden along the shopping strip! Our server was helpful & nice, and the manager also stopped by to ask us how the food was going as well!

I really liked the Calamari, and a family member ordered the Brussel Sprouts which was equally delicious! I also tried some pork belly which was yummy too - this place has an open entrance... wall? and the bar is STOCKED! The Bohemian Rhapsody (yes, I was the designated driver lol) was sour and tasty as well... overall, a really great stop!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in downtown Chandler! The cocktails and atmosphere are amazing!"}
{"text":"Every dish and cocktail felt like a different journey with the spices and flair added to every one of them."}
{"text":"Very cute spot in downtown Chandler!! I came after the symphony for some drinks, but I think I'd definitely like to come back hungrier (and probably during Happy Hour) to try some of their food because it looked so promising!!!

I appreciate the carefully crafted cocktail options - a lot of classics that you don't actually see around too often, but not SO many that you're overwhelmed as in many cocktail bars! I got a Pisco Sour & the Ramos Gin Fizz (huge egg white phase lately I guess). Now that I think of my time in Arizona, I don't think I see these drink options very frequently, so I was SO excited to get them both at The Brickyard! (originally I only wanted one drink, but with both options right next to each other - I couldn't help myself!) OH! And the cocktails all use fresh squeezed juice - YUM! What a nice touch!

The space/ambiance is quite nice on a Saturday evening - a great place to just grab drinks/appetizers and catch up with friends. Music isn't too loud (also, great selection! A little Parov Stelar was playing in the outdoor patio in the back). Can't wait to go back again, but for the food AND the drinks!!"}
{"text":"Everything was incredible!!! From the cocktails to the the NINE shared plates and the excellent service from Eric (\"Kane\") there aren't words to express how great everything was!! Will differently return!"}
{"text":"A classy and elegant addition to Chandlers downtown nightlife, this place is for people who love fancy mixed drinks.

The bar was busy, but my friend and I got the last 2 spots in front of the mixologist and it was a great experience.

We had a good time trying new mixed drinks, and what a selection!  Also, we went in for the Bean Sprouts and they were addictive and delicious.

A little on the pricey side, but these guys work hard, dressed to the nines, and are very friendly. They are encouraging you drink more of course, cause they want to try to make everything!

Cool spot, fancy place for a drink on a date or a meeting."}
{"text":"Drinks here are fantastic! Seriously not a bad one on the menu. The desert rose is very tasty. Sip responsibly :) the tacos are ok, I wasn't the biggest fan. Potatoes were good. I'd definitely try different food items the next time!"}
{"text":"My go-to for a modern, classy, urban vibe with delicious shareable plates with the most unique take on favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. 

This is literally the best place we have eaten since moving to Chandler. 

 Went downtown yesterday with the intent of trying a bunch of different places,  we almost didn't leave. 

The pork belly skewers and loaded baked potato were amazing best I have had anywhere,  ever.  The presentation looked like something from a television show. 

We literally just kept looking accross the table and saying \"wow\" 

My Fiance got the elderberry cocktail from the happy hour menu,  I got the Raj IPA.  The cocktail was very well done and the bartender was impressive. 

We will be back.  I encourage you to try this place have lived here for  while now and were kicking ourselves for not knowing about this place. 

Finish with a natural popsicle from a cross the street!  :)"}
{"text":"Very good experience, our server (Payton?) was great, the food was very good. Loved the hipster atmosphere and tapas presentation. Stand out dishes were the salmon tartare, and bahn mi pork tacos. The truffle Mac was also very good if you're a fan of truffle. Only criticism is the two hostesses at the door were not friendly. Perhaps they forgot how to smile."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Downtown Chandler! It's reliably good, with great happy hour specials, unique cocktails and amazing food -- in both taste and presentation. The location is fairly small, but I think that's why they're able to offer such amazing food and service. My husband is a chef, so we tend to be a bit picky, but the Brickyard never disappoints. It's definitely a go-to for us in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic service, great atmosphere.   A true culinary delight!  The drinks were so fresh and unigue.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. we tried a bunch of different appetizers and drinks and we thought it was all very interesting and delicious. If you have an adventurous palate this is the place to go! My husband and I need to go back!"}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to experience the Brickyard on two separate occasions and both have been impressive.  

On my most recent visit I popped in on a Saturday afternoon for a bit of day drinking and received amazing service.  The place was steady and there were only a few seats available at the bar.  The bartender Bobby greeted us shortly after we sat down and provided us with waters and menus.  

He made some great suggestions for from the happy hour menu and they were spot on.  We decided to stay for a second drink and they were just as good if not better than the previous ones.  

All of the bartenders were attentive, efficient and kind.  I can't remember the others names.

The drinks are solid and the atmosphere is appropriate. 

This maybe my new Mon-Fri happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Cocktails like none other, great vibe, very creative small plates.  Overall a great place to start off the evening with early happy hour times.  Gavin takes care of his customers and the staff seems to truly enjoy working there.  We love this place.  Only downside is prices are a little higher than some might expect in DC, but it is justified."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  All I can say is; expensively delicious.  I too like that it's really expensive and the chairs are really high.  This way it's less encouraging for people to bring crying babies and bratty children. 
I hate going to a bar and seeing kids running around.  It's such a turn off during happy hour."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for drinks and dinner in Chandler/Gilbert. Every item on their menu is fantastic, their drinks are mixed to perfection. Come in for happy hour for some cheap drinks and eats and I promise you won't be disappointed. The only thing they need to do is expand their location as it's always packed!"}
{"text":"This is just the perfect place you can found for the perfect cocktails and some great starters in Chandler! I went there couple times and tried a lot of different cocktails, starters and dessert. And not disappointed! The service is always friendly but very professional! I already recommended this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Arizona. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Tyler, super nice and very knowledgeable. I ordered one of the negroni drinks (can't remember the full name) with tequila instead of mezcal... I drank my first one in less than 10 mins? It felt that way at least, the drink was amazing - very unique and original. 

My friend and I ordered:
- Pork belly 
- Grilled octopus 
- Ham and egg
- Lamb 
- Duck confit 

Everything we ate was phenomenal! I was blown away by the ham and egg dish, specifically the crispy poached egg. 

The lamb was superb and so tender! And the marinade was perfect. 

The grilled octopus and pork belly was also amazing! 

Every dish had its own unique taste and I felt like I could of ate 2-4 more plates of each. I'm hungry again...

Oh and the duck was awesome too apparently... I'm not a fan of duck so I passed. 

**Thank you, Tyler and Bobby, for making this a wonderful experience. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My review of The Brickyard is long overdue! 
Let me start by saying that this is my favorite bar/restaurant/place to go out of all times. 
If I had time (and the money..) I would come here every day they are open.
Everything about this place is amazing (if you sit at the bar, in my opinion). The bartenders, Henry and Bobby are so knowledgeable, friendly and professional. 
When my husband and I come have a cocktail at the bar, Henry remembers what we like and how we like it. That's what makes this bar an amazing place. They truly care about their customers. Plus, you should see them make the cocktails! (Unbelievable)
Let's talk about the food now, they have a great menu, Chef Aaron changed the menu a few times already so it always nice to try something new! It's rare to have a bar where you can actually eat great food and drink amazing cocktails !
The owner Gavin is very nice and friendly, plus he always recognizes us so that makes you feel quite \"important\". Overall, The Brickyard is THE PLACE TO BE IN DOWNTOWN CHANDLER!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!! Great food, tasty cocktails, comfortable ambience, and phenomenal service! Literally, what else could you ask for? 

First time visit tonight and my expectations were blown away! Our server, Remy, was great- she was patient with our questions, super knowledgeable on the menu, and gave excellent suggestions. She executed silent service, anticipated our needs, and just overall, was awesome.

My best friend and I split the squash ravioli, the bahn mi tacos, and the short ribs osso buco.  All of the dishes were gorgeously plated, well balanced in flavors and promptly served! I'd say my favorite item was the tacos, they were delicious. 

Long story short: I can't wait to go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked the food.  The octopus was great and I definitely enjoyed the pork belly skewers on the happy hour menu.  They were crispy, delicious, and filling.  Additionally, the cocktails are well made and satisfying.  For happy hour they're $7 but your bill can get out of hand even on the happy hour discount.  Between the two of us on happy hour our bill was $80+ for a few apps, the octopus app (not on HH) and 5 drinks total.  Not exactly a deal.  

The trend of restaurants in Chandler occupying narrow spaces continues here as there is maybe 6 feet of walking room that quickly crowds with people and servers.  There is relief if you're sitting in the back area.  If you're at the bar or one of the adjacent tables anytime after 5pm, you're likely to be bumped and crowded.  The energy is good but the elbow room is not.  

It's a nice addition to Chandler but I can't get excited about it as a regular spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for drinks and eats in Chandler...all phoenix metro. The bartenders, or more appropriately the mixologists are in point.  They also make it apoint to make you feel remembered. 

Before here,  best place for cocktails was bitter and twisted, but i feel this place edges them because of the food. 

Come here if you enjoy cocktails and tapas while listening to funky jazz."}
{"text":"I dropped in here the other night for a beer and some tacos.  The tacos were of a fusion variety and were absolutely exceptional.  The portion was a little small for diners looking for a chipotle like experience.  For me, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The best compliment I can give is that no matter the day of the week or time of day the food, drink & service quality are consistent & excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've had in Chandler. The pork cheeks and ham and eggs were amazing! The mussels were ok (it's hard to compare to Maryland mussels), but the broth they came in was fantastic. Please double the great toasted bread that comes with it to soak up all that broth! Great cocktails, especially the dark and stormy. Friendly bartenders. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great little spot in downtown Chandler. Great vibe, cocktails and fantastic food. 

We decided we'd swing in after a trip to a Chandler festival. It was great to sit at the beautiful bar and have some fresh inventive food and beverage. Plus the drink menu is all a tribute to cinema. Great names. Try the monkey and shrek drinks. 

The pork tacos are just beyond wonderful. And the peppers with caramelized soy are not to be passed by. We also tried the calamari.  All the food is fresh and cleaver. A brilliant change of menu from all the other gastro pub fare. 

The staff are well dressed and polite and knowledgeable about their food and beverage. Always a great help when you're new and not quite sure on what to get.  This is a great place if you find yourself in the downtown area. Thanks to Bobby and Henry for making our visit awesome"}
{"text":"The reviews were very good so my wife and I tried this spot out, it exceeded our expectations! The food was delicious and the drinks were very refreshing. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best dinner and late night spot in downtown chandler. Pork belly skewers are fantastic. Great selection of craft drinks. Open until 2 which is nice as a few of the other spots nearby close much earlier."}
{"text":"This is an upscale bar with delicious food and unique, delicious drinks! We enjoyed the atmosphere, and the bartenders are very friendly. We sat at the bar and saw first hand all of the cool, unique drinks being made. The food servings are definitely small, which is surprising considering how pricey they are. That was a bit disappointing. There is inside seating, and it can get pretty crowded since it's such a small place. But there's also a back patio that you can be seated at. I definitely recommend the drink \"Primms Cup\". Seriously one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had. Citrusy with fresh mint and cucumber, it's so refreshing! I will come back just for that! Just make sure that you come prepared to spend plenty of $$, since the prices are definitely higher here than the surrounding bars and restaurants. One side note: we stepped out to the back patio for a minute, and before we did, we told both bartenders that we'd be right back. We checked out the patio, the upon our return, we saw a couple take their places in our seats. No big deal, as we had our drinks with us. Our glasses of water, however, were still placed on the bar where we had been previously sitting. When we sat down two seats over, we saw them each take a drink of water straight from our glasses, which were still marked with lip gloss. We didn't realize this until it happened, else we would have said something. We saw both bartenders witness this without saying a word to them. Awkward..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but I feel like they try way too hard. The hipster ambiance is played out and unoriginal. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. Unfortunately it had pink store bought mini marshmallows scattered across the top. The \"whimsy\" they were attempting to add to the dish was just gross and out of place. Not impressed. There are much better restaurants right down the street."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The service is really good. The only downside is that the place is a little small so it can get a bit tight, but other than that, I highly recommend this place for an everyday dinner, a date or just to have a few drinks and eat some food!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place and the ambiance.   Great setting for meeting a couple of friends and the service was excellent.  Only snag was a peanut dish for someone allergic to peanuts (not their fault) and the dish was remade so that I could sample it sans the peanuts which was way beyond expected.  Small plate restaurants around the country vary in serving size just a bit and 3 hungry fellas made quick work of everything that came out.  Next time I will bring my wife to slow down consumption. Portions aren't huge but everything was beyond excellent."}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers for the suggestions.  We had tacos, pork belly skewers, and calamari to start. The tacos was the star that we ordered another.  Great tapas and cocktails!"}
{"text":"A foodies delight! Excellent food and fun environment. 
The Brickyard is our go-to place for a casual drink and tapas!"}
{"text":"I was in Chandler for work and found this place on yelp for dinner. The drinks, the food, the staff, the host, the ambience, everything is great!!! I had a Frosen, that is a iced rose, that was to dye for. I wanted to try other cocktails but had to drive. The food was delicious. A little on the pricier side but worth it. The tomatoe salad was very good. All the ingredients were fresh. I also had the salmon with potatoe pancak, broccoli rabe, and mustard vinaigrette. I usually don't like mustard but I cleaned that plate. And the staff was awesome. The bartenders introduce themselves and learn everybody's name. They are very personable and upbeat. Even the hostess open the door for
Me on my way out. I kind of just want to come back to Chandler to visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have to admit that when I came from LA to Arizona to visit my boyfriend for the first time, I wasn't expecting to find the same level of foodie heaven that LA is known to offer. I know. I know. I'm such a snob for thinking this way, but I am more than capable of admitting my faults when I am utterly wrong.  

    Service: We came in around 5pm and were seated and greeted within a very timely manner. Our server (I believe his name was Cane; He has a voice MADE for radio) was very pleasant and was more than happy to make suggestions and answer our questions thoroughly without ever coming off annoyed by our inquisitions. 

    Now, the fun part: THE FOOD. Holy mother of all that is edible! We started off with the Pork Belly Skewers ($12/$9 HH) which were perfectly balanced between the saltiness of the pork and the sweetness of the honey soy reduction. Next, we had the Grilled Octopus ($12). It was perfectly cooked and paired really well with the smoked paprika aioli (I wanted to lick that plate. Sorry, not sorry). The Hamachi Crudo ($14) graced us with its presence next and was a definite highlight of the meal. Such a light dish with acidity from the grapefruit supremes and yuzu kosho vinaigrette. We thought we would be done after this dish, but I wanted to squeeze one more in since I was enjoying everything so much. We lastly decided to end with the Burrata ($10) with heirloom tomatoes and a blood orange and sherry sauce. Absolutely worth the squeeze.

   Conclusion: We are so pleased with our visit that we have already decided we will be returning during my next visit from LA. Keep up the amazing work and I shall be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"L-O-V-E The Brickyard Downtown!  We've been looking for a great mixologist place and this is it. Tried several drinks; absolutely loved all of them!  They are creative and so different from your typical bars.  Totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for happy hour.. gets loud but very good bar service and the truffle fingerlings are yummo!!"}
{"text":"GREAT find in downtown Chandler. Almost missed it as I was walking towards Vintage 95. I'm glad I didn't!  Classy bar and a definite must if you are in the area and thirsty. Here's why:

- Throwback decor mixed with a little hipster... super cool.
- Fantastic mixologists with great service and craft cocktail skills (which also means, customer must have patience and not expect a 30 second turnaround on a drink order). Oh, must mention: they're dressed like classic bartenders.. vests, ties, well-groomed. No sloppiness here, ladies and gents!
- Drink menu and top-shelf choices were fabulous.
- Management involvement on the floor and engagement with customers and doing what you don't see many managers do nowdays.... managing! 
- Pricing for cocktails is very reasonable considering all the work and quality ingredients involved. Not bad at all! 

At about a 4.25 star rating right now as the place is still fine tuning all the last details. We'll be back and prety sure they will be higher on the scale if they just keep doing what they're doing.  Can't wait to partake in more menu choices!"}
{"text":"I visited here w my girlfriend and had a few glasses of yummy wine.  We were hungry, however we couldn't find anything that looked tasty on the menu.  Lots of seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing Drinks, Amazing Food, Amazing Staff and Amazing Owner! I can't say enough about how Great of an experience it is at Brickyard! Hands down our favorite place to go for Food and Drinks! Ask me what's my favorite Dish? Everything I've had there which is most of the menu since we go there as often as we can!"}
{"text":"This uber hipster spot in downtown Chandler specializes in craft cocktails and man are they tasty. They also serve food and I was super excited by the different items on the menu. They all sounded delicious and the flavor in the dishes was fantastic. However the portions were fairly small for the price and none came with sides or anything to make it a complete meal. I guess they are intended to be small snacks to consume while drinking but I didn't realize that going in. Everyone was real friendly and we had a fun time. Lots of suspenders and mustaches going on so if you are not into the hipster scene then it might not be for you... but the manager Gavin seemed to be pretty down to earth and nice."}
{"text":"Dog friendly? Check.
Happy hour? Check.
Unique restaurant I haven't tried before? Check.

We shared three happy hour plates here: the cauliflower, pork belly skewers and the sliders/mini bricks. Happy hour runs from 3-6 and our plates were a few dollars off the normal price. The pork belly skewers came out first and I enjoyed the tender pork belly with grilled lightly crisp edges. There was a bit too much sauce on it for me though which overpowered the other flavors in the dish. I also liked the cauliflower which had a beautiful presentation and nicely paired flavors of Calabrian chile with cauliflower and shaved Parmesan. I didn't care too much for the \"mini bricks\" which were pretty basic and had wilted soggy lettuce in them by the time we received them.

Service was friendly and sweet. Our server was very nice and brought out a little bowl of water for our pups.

The dishes are beautifully plated but prices did seem a bit high for what we got. I felt like we would have spent a pretty penny just to get full, even with the happy hour deals. It was still a pleasant experience though."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites. Came in after work on a Thursday. Happened to be happy hour. The cocktail list is amazing. Everything we tried was wonderful. The waitress was super knowledgeable. We had the pork lollipops-YUM!! The tacos and the coconut shrimp -which sounded a little strange but it was amazing. So fresh! Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! You must try this very eclectic place with a wonderful atmosphere both historical and hip at the same time. The kale salad and butternut squash ravioli were our favorites. You must try! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great bar/restaurant located in historic Downtown Chandler.  The place has a good look to it and an interesting food and drink menu.  I had a pisco sour, meringue-a-tang, and the shishito peppers.  Everything tasted and looked great.  Bobby was the bartender and was friendly and provided excellent service.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Considering the look of the place, i was expecting everything to cost a lot more than it did."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food is good.  Lot of history cool place will be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun easy happy hour in downtown Chandler. The Brickyard Downtown was cute enough but the prices compared to the very small servings has me giving this a thumbs down.  There's too many choices to expect people to pay those prices and walk away still hungry. I've heard the same from the friends I have in this area.  We are all close and love to support the local businesses.  Disappointed and won't go back."}
{"text":"First time here....The food here is exquisite!!! The smallest thought and detail goes into it. Environment is relaxed and comfortable. Definitely will return. Once again the food is SPECTACULAR. The service was great too.. Kane took care of us. Everything on all scales was a thumbs up from me!!"}
{"text":"Been twice, great vibe great layout, price point is good, one review that I read was way off the mark, think the writer  was drunk didn't get much right.  Staff is very professional, excellent service and fun folks.  I have not tried the food yet but it did look delicious.  The hand crafted drinks are the best I have ever had and I have had alot.  This is a neat place, my new go to spot.  Great job Gavin!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in downtown Chandler. The history behind this restaurant is very interesting. This restaurant has great tapas. The flavors in the food are extremely delicious. The drinks are very good. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes tapas and wants delicious food."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here. I debated between giving a 3 star or 4 and landed on the 3. If I were rating then on just the calamari I'd give them a 5, it was excellent! However, the chicken entree we got was just average and a little dry and the room because it's brick and beautiful tin ceiling makes for a very noisy place. So it was difficult to have a conversation. Other than that,  the staff was vet friendly and the decor was nice. We'll go back again for the calamari and try something else."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing. Everything we ordered was delicious. If you don't get the pork belly you are missing out. Got here on a Wed about 5 pm and was seated right away. When we left at 630 it was packed so be early if you can. Nice happy hour specials too. Peau de chocolate with bacon brittle and salted caramel to die for."}
{"text":"We went to the Brickyard Saturday night at 7:30. Sadly to note, they don't take reservations. It was full, we got the last 2 seats at the end of the bar in front of Bobby's station. After Bobby introduced himself and gave us a very friendly introduction and handshake, we reviewed the drink and food menu. We loved the speakeasy crafty cocktail selection and nibbles. The atmosphere was classic, very nice, open brick, tin roof, rustic feel, very loud which was fine for us, maybe hard to hear if you were in a large group.

My dining partner ordered an Old Fashion and I tried the The French 75 after which I moved onto a Pimm's Cup cocktail. We decided to order from the sharing plates, in between our cocktails. We ordered the Steak & Egg Carpaccio (Truffle Aioli, Quail Eggs, Crostini, Caper Berries, Micro Arugula), Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Saffron Risotto, Chorizo, Herb Puree, Pistachios), Pork and Shrimp Gyoza's (Fried Crisp, Sweet Chili, Pickled Radish), and the Pork Belly (Garlic Chips, Honey Soy, Ryu Powder) 

The drinks were excellent, on the very pricey side for Chandler though. The sharing plates were very good, the Pork Belly could be more generous though. Other than that very good but again very pricey. 

Service was excellent, though was not greeted by the manager as everyone said \"they were\", he was too busy talking with his familiar customers. We will definitely be back, just hope it stays in business with that price point."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here. The drinks are some of the best of the Valley, and same can be said of the food. Service was friendly and attentive. Food highlights were the octopus, Bahn Mi tacos, truffle Mac n chz, and the Brussels sprouts (aka everything we ordered). I loved this place and cannot wait to return, I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun, unique, and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Solid cocktails, great food, and awesome staff.  It's like coming in to hang out with friends.  This is my go-to spot in Chandler. 

If you're thinking about going here, stop thinking and just go!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Good vibe and very good craft cocktails. The food menu is a bit limited but it's a great place to stop for a drink"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some drinks and food with the cowokers on a weekday. Customer service was spot on here! Our server was attentive and friendly. The manager made the effort to stop by our table to welcome us in and let him know if we needed anything.

The fingerling potatoes and pork belly skewers are a definite go to! The drink menu was vast, there was so many I wanted to try. I'll definitely be back to try more of their drinks and get another order (or two) of the skewers!"}
{"text":"Found ourselves in downtown Chandler and looked up reviews for a place to eat. We wound up here because they are open late and I'm so happy that we did. The food was impeccable. The service was beyond amazing. Their suggestions were spot on. We ordered the banh mi tacos, charred octopus, calamari and gingered beef. We loved everything so much that we had dessert even though neither of us have a huge sweet tooth. Needless to say, the churros were perfect. Even though Chandler is quite a trek for us, I have no doubt that we'll be stopping in again soon. Surely the best meal that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great for spicy and non-spicy dishes. Wonderful service and good atmosphere. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Thursday night dinner with a friend. First time here. Food was delicious! We got several of the small sharing plates. Truffle Mac & cheese, fish tacos, squash ravioli, Swiss mushroom bricks. All were very very good. I'd love to come back! Btw- the pasta tasted like it was from scratch!"}
{"text":"Such a cool happy hour venue. Beautiful, tasty cocktails. Didn't realize they had adorable back patio so be sure to check that out. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner with some friends. The back patio is so cute and secluded. Food was delicious. You can order a bunch of tapas to share you can get an order for yourself. I would also recommend ordering a cocktail. They have an extensive cocktail menu, as well as a wine list. I definitely suggest the Game Ogre drink. Unique and so good."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Where do I begin.... The food was wonderful- very unique, fresh, great quality, and enjoyed the variety. The drinks were just as good. Love the drink combinations and professional mixologists. And the service was phenomenal- everyone knew the dish they were serving in detail by describing the exact dish when it's brought to your table. The servers were all knowledgable and very kind. My new favorite place. I highly recommend the pork tacos, loaded potato, and calamari, but you can't go wrong with any dish."}
{"text":"Do not skip this place!!!! The Osso Buco was melt in your mouth delicious and the horseradish sauce had a unique and wonderful taste.  The squash ravioli had so much flavor.  It was topped off with creme Brûlée that was perfectly carmelized. Cocktails seemed to be a specialty--- I ordered an amaretto sour not realizing it was on the specialty drink menu.  What a fabulous treat- the delicious sour was made with all fresh ingredients with a perfect frothy top. Service was wonderful.  Server was very attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This was a last minute dining decision but I'm happy I made the choice to eat here. The tropic thunder drink was awesome and smelled like a camp fire. We tried 3 items the pork skewers, squash ravioli, stuffed chicken breast.  All of these items were good but the chicken breast was amazing! I dropped a star for the pricing being high on the drinks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service food, drinks, atmosphere, water yes! The water! Literally everything I ate and drank was delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, tapas style and limited menu. Wasn't sure what I was getting into other then the full bar but the meal was flavorful. With simple choices like, chicken, fish tacos and shared plates it was a nice quick eat."}
{"text":"Incredible selection of drinks and bites. Thoroughly enjoyed the new spin on some 
favorites like their pork belly skewers, artichoke and cauliflower appetizers. The craft cocktails were mouth watering. Their outstanding service and vibrant scene make it my new fave in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new hot spot in downtown Chandler as both my husband and I are foodies and love to try new spots! The drinks are outstanding but not cheap! ...And the appetizers are small portions that work well if you like meat and seafood...We had 5 drinks and 4 appetizers for the 2 of us and paid over $120 with tip... a little pricey for us to make a regular hang out for drinks...but it's fun and we enjoyed sitting outside ...I would suggest sitting on the back patio- it seemed to have more space...we sat out front since we didn't want to wait for a table out back and the inside is super loud with tables crammed up against each other...They don't take reservations so be prepared on a weekend to wait...We went on a Friday night but maybe it's quieter on a week night...We will go again because the bartender knows how to make drinks!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! What a great spot to meet friends and have a fun night out on the town. Excellent addition to down town Chandler! I imagine we will spend many nights here this fall/ winter"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour on a weekday. It was fantastic!  The people were so helpful and awesome, the drinks themselves and choices of drinks were great and I can't say enough about the food. It felt a lot like some of the pubs we went to in Scotland and Ireland. The chef there is a creative artist. Beautiful and delicious tapas. The shishito peppers are some of the best I've had, the pork belly skewers and pork bahn mi tacos were delicious. If you haven't gone there yet, you must go!"}
{"text":"One of the best tapa's places I have ever been to.  Every item I ordered was delicious and flavors were perfectly melded together.  The chef puts a lot thought into his dishes. 

My favorite:

Truffle Potato Wedges
Banh mi pork tacos
Kimchi brussell sprouts. 

Great vibes and also interesting cocktails!"}
{"text":"Went in here for a quick drink.  The bartender was friendly and knowledgable about soctch and whiskeys. Before i order anything the bartender gave me a glass of ice water.   They have a good selection of like whistle pig, nikka, yellow spot, and others.  I will definitely come back here again if i visit Chandler in the future"}
{"text":"So I try to use my 5 stars sparingly for those places that I really believe deserve them, this is for sure one of them. We came to try a new place since I recently moved here. This has already become one of my favorites! I love a good old fashioned, just keep it basic, and they nailed it! We shared the potatos, roasted cauliflower, calamari, and mussels. Every one of them was DELICIOUS! I can't wait to come back and try more food, and repeat some of the same. Great find! Must try...food didn't last long enough for the picture sorry!"}
{"text":"The Short Rib \"Osso Buco\" is to DIE for. Who knew the marriage between Italian & Korean would be so AWEEEMAZING! The drinks are exceptional and the mini churros are delish...We will Definitely be back !"}
{"text":"When you combine exquisitely crafted drinks, with delectable dining selections you simply cannot go wrong.  The bartenders are akin to chemists in a laboratory, and the culinary selections are spot on for the cultured consumer.  Get the pork belly...it was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Everything we ordered was amazing. Loaded fingerling potatoes are so so good. Kale Caesar wow!  Came in on a whim. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"We went there on a recent trip to Arizona.  The food and atmosphere were great, service was extraordinary and it was just a nice place to go for dinner.  Our Waitress was Ashley, and she was extraordinary.  Clearly knew the place inside and out, gave great recommendations and got us what we wanted before we knew we wanted it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink.  They have a great liquor and cocktail selection.  I opted for a glass of Blanton's served neat.  The food menu looked pretty solid and entrees were reasonably priced in the $20 range.  I could see this place filling up on the weekends.  Looking forward to coming back and trying some of their food and one of their inventive cocktails."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks here for the first time tonight. All the food was delicious and pretty good portions for sharing plates. Also, the drink variety was great. We had 3 different drinks and loved each of them, you can tell they have an excellent mixologist. Glad we got a chance to dine here, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"wonderful staff and a great environment, even better food and drinks! the pimm's cup is one of my favorite drinks on the menu!"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp tacos & a large sharing beef dish...
The shrimp tacos were amazing!
It was a little loud-
 but in a good way...
Great vibe with lots of happy people to talk with...
A great social place to take on a date!
I will be back!
The food & service were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of bartenders make make my signature drink at a lot of bars. Some were on point, others were ok. Our bartender at the Brickyard made my signature drink and I will never forget it for all the right reasons. 

If you can appreciate a good mixed drink, and you can appreciate a real bartender who knows the craft and is a throwback to a simpler, purer time, then treat yourself to the bar at the Brickyard."}
{"text":"Love this new, cool, cute patioed craft food and drink gem in downtown Chandler. Our food scene just keeps getting better and this is an excellent addition! Feel is hip but not at all pretentious, wait staff were all a delight and the owner even came out to check on US. Service was perfect. Not a kid place, but a great date and small group place for foodies. Everything was great, be sure to order a wide shareable variety. The platings are all so beautiful, and the flavors even better. Gyoza and carpaccio were both inventively spiced right. The cauliflower and fennel Apple salad were delicious. I also loved their house made alcohol root beer float like drink. We will enthusiastically be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The atmosphere is great.  The food was even better.  Highly reccomend the Shrimp and Grits and the Prims Cup cocktail.  Remi our server was great.  5 stars from this crew!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this cute place, Friday evening on a whim with my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised! Did I like all the food on the menu? No, (I'm a picky eater) BUT the food that we did have was amazing... the sliders and potatoes, I mean come on. Delicious. Cocktails were crazy good - they definitely respect the art of cocktail making. I was happy we snagged a spot at the end of the bar, because it was definitely a crowded place (personally a little too crowded for my preference) but it was energetic, vibrant, entertaining and enjoyable. We both discussed that we would love to come back, but maybe at a less busy time."}
{"text":"The only thing I'd change, closer to my house! Love the whole look and feel of the restaurant. It's been a prefect date night, family dinner, and dinner with friends restaurant! The menu has enough familiarity and adventure to make almost everyone happy! The food is only complimented by the yummy drinks. The waitress gave us great recommendations on drinks, the cocktail menu is pretty big. Lots to choice from, but the two drinks I had were both delicious!"}
{"text":"Best old fashioned ever!!! They have their own variations, it's all good. I cannot get this anywhere else, thank you to The Brickyard. I don't know what else to say."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, everything I've had has been great. I love the tapas because I like to be able to try several items instead of ordering a huge portion of just one thing. I've had probably half of the menu and there wasn't one thing that wasn't delicious. The craft cocktails are great too! 

The only thing I don't love is that they change their menu, so if you have a favorite item it could possibly be gone in a couple months. I do like to try new things though, so I guess I have a mixed review there. 

This is probably my favorite place in Chandler. The service has always been pretty good as well! It's not a huge place so if you go at a prime time you might have to wait. I usually go at off times and am able to get a seat at the bar.  Not the cheapest place around, but I'd rather spend more for something great than save a few bucks for something mediocre."}
{"text":"Just found my new favorite spot!! This place was amazing and the food was so delicious!! We started off with 2 apps - bacon wrap shrimp and the shishito peppers then did the gorgonzola pear salad, then Sirloin and finally ended with Churros with house made dipping sauces.. YUM!!  All of it was all so wonderful!!! On top of that the service was top notch and the ambiance and atmosphere is just beautiful.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot. Chandler has been in dire need of a craft cocktail bar, much like what you might find in Old Town Scottsdale. Tons of variety in regards to whisky. Bartenders are super helpful, educated about the alcohol and personable. Will have to try the small plates next visit."}
{"text":"Great service from Rimi (sp?) and owner Gavin and Bobby, et al.  Thank you for helping us have a wonderful night before the wedding meal for my daughter and all the family!  Everything was wonderful.  Highly recommend this food and ambience."}
{"text":"Amazing food & love the aromatic cocktails!!! Great vibe and Enjoyed the night! The owner came to our table several times to check on us !!! Every time we ordered something from the menu the waitress or the owner would come explain all the ingredients !! Attention to detail on everything they do here !"}
{"text":"Excellent! We had the loaded potatoes, calamari, and bahn mi tacos. Everything was SO flavorful. When our food was served they took the time to explain each dish, which was great since it was our first time there. The drink menu is extensive and I appreciated a delicious mocktail list being pregnant! Service was great, food was great, we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Excellent food and delicious hand-crafted cocktails.
The menu is very creative and the food is excellent.
Service is always good.  Staff seem to love what they do, very friendly and engage in great conversation.
Eclectic is the best way I can describe this place.  A true gem in Downtown Chandler.
Patio is awesome!
Well done! Highly recommend 
MJ"}
{"text":"Food was great, service great.  But $22 for a plate of 2 scallops?!?!!

Will not return"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we gave the spot a try! The cocktails were really cute and movie themed which made them fun to try. The Tapas style food was absolutely incredible. It definitely stole the show! Each one we tried had a different and unique flavor and all of them were absolutely amazing. We loved the street tacos! And don't even get me started on the pork belly skewers! Even though it was pricey we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I've never been big on cocktails. I know they're good but i never really raves about how good they are until i came to the Brickyard Downtown. I have the House of 1000 Corpses Revivers and it was smooth and light. The second time i got The Swamp Thang. The best cocktails I've had in chandler. The atmosphere is great as well. Music wasn't too loud which makes conversation easier. The bartenders were also attentive without being overbearing. Overall a great spot."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night with some friends to enjoy Happy Hour.  Service is very good but beware prices are outrages for the small portioned Tapas.  Combined we spent $180.00 with tip and could have gone out for a really nice dinner for that amount. I think this place needs to do some cost control or they will not last long.  Nice place but we will not return as there are other places that offer true Happy Hour pricing."}
{"text":"Their menu is always changing which is awesome. Love the environment.  Possibly the best place in downtown Chandler. THEY. HAVE. A. FLAMING.  DRINK. Which is to die for. Must try. Bartender actually making good suggestions instead of the most pricey ones. A m a z I n g"}
{"text":"This is half of a $17 shrimp and grits which we asked to have removed from our bill because it was awful and I was pissed about spending that much on a tiny dish like that.

The food is here kinda going downhill and doesn't stack up to the places to each side of it. The prices are insane!

Nice gals working here though. Drinks are stupid expensive as well."}
{"text":"I'm getting back on the review train here, and I have to start it off with my all time favorite bar. 

I love it here, and I've been there enough that the staff recognize me as a frequent visitor. Even if I wasn't, the staff is always friendly. I had a birthday dinner here, and the owner, Gavin, was very accommodating!

Aside from being hospitable, the staff is very knowledgable on the food and provisions. 

Their old fashioned is absolutely top notch and I'm tempted to get it every time because I know it's solid and cannot disappoint. However, they have a wide variety of other craft cocktails available and they're all very punny with their names. Much appreciated. Beers and wines are aplenty in their drink selections as well. Again, they are very knowledgable as I've had off menu drinks from them, and I just believe they can do no wrong. 

Their food menu can rotate every once in awhile, but I trust the head cook wholeheartedly on these decisions. Plus they've kept staples that has kept me going back and force it upon others for their own wellbeing. The tacos are perfect and tender, but the winner of my heart are the potatoes. I literally swoon every time they arrive. I think it's the truffle oil that really completes it. Or bacon. Or just magic. 

I highly recommend making a stop here. Or three."}
{"text":"Such a nice spot in Dtown Chandler!  The handcrafted cocktails and food will keep you coming back.  The food and drinks are NOT expensive.  Everything is priced in accordance with the ambiance.  Ever hear \"you get what you pay for\"?  You want a cheap whiskey and some soggy, fried food, go somewhere else.  Everyone will be happier...  

Not to mention the knowledgeable and PATIENT staff.  We hosted my wife's birthday party with a group of about 20.  Ariel was THE BEST!!!  Keeping every couple on separate tabs, taking multiple food and drink orders without writing anything down or making any mistakes.  Coming from the bartending/serving world myself, very impressed.  

I wish nothing but the best for Gavin and the entire crew at The Brickyard.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really want to come back to this place. I was only having a few drinks with a friend, we didn't order any appetizers or anything (we weren't really hungry just hanging out and catching up). The place was super full and only had one cramped seat, or one seat waaaaaaay in the back. We wanted to have some privacy and opted for the back table. It was near the kitchen and the restroom and we were not impressed. However it great on us, seemed very exclusive. Although we were way in the back the staff always checked in on us and would always check to make sure we always had water. The hostest even came back asking if we wanted to move out to the opentable. The atmostphere was pretty great, I want to come back for a meal one day."}
{"text":"I go to downtown Chandler often and this is one of my favorites here. The ambience is cool with and old look to the place and a nice outdoor patio area in the back. It's not a big place and getting a table may take a bit of time on the weekend but I think that is pretty normal every good place in the valley. Food is unique and very good. Small portion Tappas is the specialty here and you will want to try lots of different things. I have had most items on the menu and all are good. It's a bit on the expensive side (if you are hungry) but not overpriced. I would say priced appropriately for the quality and the tastiness. The vibe is cool here too. Good cocktails, good food and friendly staff. If you haven't gone you should give this spot a try."}
{"text":"We loved it! Amazing flavors on so many items. Wonderful cocktail menu too! Go with friends and share lots of plates so you can taste them all."}
{"text":"Nice work Brickyard. You nailed it as the best place in downtown chandler.  I had delayed coming in because I thought it was a \"fancy cocktail bar\" and I am a beer drinker. While they do have great cocktail menu the beer on tap is tasty, food incredible and service outstanding. Bar tenders explained each dish in detail when serving. Classy place without a hint of pretentiousness. Try it !"}
{"text":"What an amazing list of options for some of the most original food pairings.  I very highly recommend the fried calamari...or the octopus. I had both...UNFORGETTABLE!  
The drink BOOK, is intimidating...but our server knew everything about the drinks and food, her recommendations were spot on.  There is a back patio...very romantic!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is never never disappoints! The cauliflower and the calamari is what to get on the menu- delicious; full of flavor and the amount is just enough to share!
Drinks are amazing please- go sit at the bar mingle with the amazing bartenders! They are mixologists they can create anything you would like and even just make you an original drink in amazement! I never leave disappointed or hungry! 
Go check it out during happy hour if you want to try out and save your coins!"}
{"text":"Great Great Bar Staff. Chelsea, Rob, Henry & Tyler. So good to hangout with these guys, they made us feel so welcome. Food was great as was the presentation. See you all soon, Carolyn and Bernard."}
{"text":"Went in for drinks only on a saturday night. Atmosphere is great and the drinks were amazing. The whisky sour was delicious and extreamly well crafted. The food that only people were ordering looked delicious and we will definately go back and eat there soon!"}
{"text":"Great service, the food is worth the price! Great fun atmosphere. Just go someplace else for dessert. The crème brûlée was satisfactory. But check this place out."}
{"text":"Had a couple of beers. Looks like it could be a lot of fun on the weekend. 
Nice downtown Chandler bar. 
Mike the bar tender was real personable. He recommended a great coffee shop for the following morning and educated me on the scene in Chandler."}
{"text":"Smooth Happy hour stop after Spring Training game.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Good place to try something new or an old favorite."}
{"text":"Crazy delicious!! There is a reason this place was jammed packed at 5pm on a Wednesday. I met my friend for drinks and bites and everything we ordered came out just right. I had the pork bahn mi tacos, we shared the potatoes, and he ordered the ramen. My mom is still watering on how tasty the food was. Also, let's not forget about the martinis I guzzled down. Wow! I can't wait to come back and try other things on their fantastic menu."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and I must say that my wife and I both enjoyed our date night at The Brickyard. 
Great ambiance, great service and was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the food. 
Our waiter Kane was pleasant, professional and very informative. He knew the food and drink menu inside and out. The bartenders and chefs appeared to take pride in their work with their presentation and execution.  In fact, all of the employees seemed to enjoy their jobs. 
We went for happy hour and took advantage of some of the specials but also ordered off the main menu. 
We thoroughly enjoyed the calamari. Incredibly tender and seasoned perfectly. 
The street tacos were also nicely seasoned. My wife loves Big Macs so we had to get their \"mini Big Macs\" which were cooked perfectly aside from a tad too salty. 
The roasted brussel sprouts with Kimchi, gocheejang and sausage was unique and enjoyable as well!
We didn't try an entrée this time for the starters and 2 cocktails each filled us up nicely. 
We are thrilled that we found a local spot with great service, drink options, a diverse menu and a cool vibe!
We will definitely be back. 
Well done Brickyard!"}
{"text":"What a charming new spot in downtown Chandler! My boyfriend and I stopped in for a drink. They offer an extensive craft cocktail menu that offers very novel drinks... Many of them used egg whites as an ingredient. Ok, egg whites? Yeah, I realize it sounds like your next salmonella poisoning... The egg whites actually add a nice velvety texture to the drinks though. My boyfriend ordered the Sonoran sour that has egg whites and he ended up hating the consistency, but stirring it with a straw made the consistency velvety again after it separated. If egg whites aren't your thing, there are plenty of other options. I ordered the Pimm's cup, and it is a refreshing cocktail with hints of mint. I would go with this one if you're afraid of the egg whites. I will be back, perhaps to even try their food. The patio in the back looks cute as well with a few cabanas and tables for patio dining. Also, the hostess at the front on Saturday night was very friendly and sweet. Fantastic customer service. Management, please recognize her for this."}
{"text":"For a light dinner experience in a section of town most people don't know about.  Service was great, make sure you're ready to order at least 5 items off the tapas style menu. Seating is tight, and your neighbors will love to talk to you about your dishes. Dessert was great, but expect to be craving more with the portion size."}
{"text":"It was simply ok. The drinks were unique . I was not to excited about my choice . Unfortunately I do not remember the exact name of the drink however my husband ordered pork belly tacos and I did not like them one bit overall I'd have to say the potato wedges were the best where we sat was on a balcony where you can see people walk by it seemed as if some of the employees on shift had their friends walking by while reading a group of individuals are constantly pacing around our table they are also attempting to clean where no one has sat to Make Way for their friends to hold a discussion I do not like or feel it is appropriate to spray chemicals while people are eating especially within a five foot distance from the one experience I had I don't expect to have any more experiences with them"}
{"text":"Michael our bartender introduced us to a spectacular menu... this was one of the best culinary experiences we've had in AZ .. we tried the scallops, pork belly and  ham & eggs, which are a are a must !!!  We can't recommend enough .."}
{"text":"The Brickyard sticks out in Chandler like a sore thumb..... this place is super 'hip' with amazing drinks... it has the feeling of a downtown Phoenix bar. I wish they were in downtown because as is my imbibing at this bar is limited, but my loss is Chandler's gain. I met a friend here for happy hour and it was a very good hh. They have discounted apps and 'classic' specialty cocktails. I had their Pimm's and it was one of the best renditions of a Pimm's cup I've had in a long time! We also tried a couple of their 'custom' drinks, which were a little less successful. My friend had a tasty sounding drink that sounded sweet (it had coffee and cocoa and a marshmallow), but was super boozy and was difficult to drink. I tried the sonoran sour, which was alright, but I much preferred the Pimm's. We also tried their pork belly app, which was tasty, but too small for the price.  Regardless, I think this is a high quality bar and a must visit if you're in the downtown Chandler area!"}
{"text":"The Brickyard rocks! We tried several cocktails and small plates at the bar and would order each again. Mixologists were great recommending items off the menu and so attentive. We will be back next time in town, so fun."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour the other day. Their happy hour is from 3-6, which I wish was extended out more since I feel like that's a pretty short time period. 

I ordered the Timothy Margarita and the pork belly skewers. The margarita was pretty strong however i felt that the skewers were a bit salty. 

I think that their pricing for happy hour is a bit expensive for happy hour pricing. Drinks are around $7 and food for happy hour is around $9-10 a plate. They have a pretty big drink list so I would probably come back again for some drinks."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying YOU BETTER GET TO THIS PLACE FAST WOW.   It's in downtown Chandler and not that much space inside but who cares.   First time here and it will not be our last after this awesome experience. 

We started off by ordering some of their specialty cocktails and we were not disappointed.  The flavors and taste were on point,  the bartenders are amazing and point you in the right direction and explain everything their serving you to the detail.  

Now the food omg so good once it hits your lips.  It's tiny plates but exploding with flavor.  Our top 3 are the pork belly tacos, the pork belly skewers and the ravioli are a must try whenever you come check this place out.  

Don't pass this spot up and get here now!!!"}
{"text":"There are many reasons The Brickyard Downtown is rated well. We had great customer service. Our server was attentive and very helpful with suggestions. We ordered calamari, fried cauliflower, pork belly skewers, truffle mac, pork cheeks, churros, and pot au creme for dessert. Every item was delicious and had wonderful flavors. A lot of care goes into the food and cocktails here. Careful, items add up quick but they're well worthwhile. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Impeccable service at the bar and great etiquette in preparing their drinks. I had a real old fashion old fashioned drink. The charred octopus was delightful, the orange sriracha was a great touch. Fun ambiance, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place had been on my list for quite sometime and I finally got a chance to check it out last week. We got lucky since we ended up getting the last available table without a wait. Clearly, it is an incredibly popular place for happy hour gatherings. My friend was running a little late and I decided to get started with Lavender Bee's Knees and an order of olives. The portion size of the olives was ridiculous! It was literally a huge tub of assorted olives sauteed in butter and herbs and served warm. And they weren't pitted! I was really impressed. The drink was fairly good and of course, lacked enough alcohol owing to happy hour prices. My friend finally arrived and we placed an order for fish tacos and loaded potatoes. The potatoes were pretty great.. they were fried and tossed in truffle cream, parmesan, bacon and chives. How could it possibly go wrong? My friend did seem to enjoy the tacos. Another round of drinks were ordered and this time I decided to stick to beer. I've learnt that this is the best way to go at happy hour. We finished the night with mini bricks and another round of drinks. Based on the server's recommendation, I decided to get the Delicious Sour. This was actually quite fantastic! An extremely well balanced drink with some great sweet and sour notes. My least favorite thing of the night were the sliders.. The beef probably wasn't given enough time to rest before serving. The patties bled out and turned the insides of the bun pink. I found this a tad unappetizing and couldn't eat my slider. My friend gladly offered to finish the plate clean! They came with fries which were pretty good. Also, I really liked the fact that we kept snacking on the big bowl of olives the whole time we were there. I would certainly return again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable. All took amazing care of us. We love seafood so we focused on the grilled octopus, Ahi tartar and both were amazing. The octopus was very tender and cooked perfectly. The ahi super fresh. 

We had the brussel sprouts with kimchi and chorizo  I think.  The asparagus with some many things in there I can't remember to include here. See the pic. 

Craft cocktails really fun. Talked with a mixologist there and he recommended a nice gin drink. Looks for the smoldering cinnamon bark. 

We missed happy hour but that seems to be a big hit too. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Great atmosphere. And a celeb sighting. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Exceptional Downtown Chandler restaurant experience before before attending Chandler Center for the Arts.  This restaurant has front patio seating if you're interested in all the downtown buzz or quaint rear patio for a more intimate dining experience with outdoor fireplace and festive lighting!  We desired a glass of red wine so our server Ashley suggested a taste of House red and Disruptive Cab. Sauv. My wife began with a house red cab for smooth velvety taste and nicely priced at $5 for happy hour!  I began with a Disruptive Cab for a bigger bolder taste but it punched the wallet at $12.  We began by sharing Honey Roasted Carrots at $11 which was yummy and so nicely presented we hesitated taking the first serving.   For our entree we shared pan seared Canadian Salmon at $18 and very beautifully presented and scrumptious to the taste!  Sharing plates enabled us to leave room for the Chocolate Pot Au Creme at $7, oh my!! I could not do justice to these food items with a detailed description but the servers appear well equipped to explain in every detail how & what is about to greet your taste buds.  We conclude by saying our server Ashley and her Team Members left us with a memorable dining experience looking forward to a return trip"}
{"text":"After a fun night drinking five or six coffee beverages with some amazing Yelpers, we were hungry and jittery. We needed some food! And since Amber R. spoke so highly of this place, we took a short walk over and were seated right away for some tapas. Let's eat!

Pork Belly Skewers, $12 [Honey Soy, Peanuts, Pearl Onions, Garlic Chip, Scallion]: I shared this small dish with Amber. It was thoughtfully constructed and had a spicy, sesame, airy powder that was fun on the side. The pork belly itself was fatty and delicious. Those little cubes packed big flavor.

Scottish Salmon, $16 [Crème Fraiche, Chives, Buttered Leeks, Shiitake Mushrooms]: I got this \"large tapas\" for myself. First of all, the crème fraiche and buttered leeks... wow! It was so creamy and decadent. Pair it with the earthy shiitake mushroom and it was bite after delicious bite until the salmon was all gone. Oh my! I wish it came with polenta or something.

The Brickyard Downtown is a trendy chic place with a beautiful bar where they handcraft, from what I've been told Amber, amazing cocktails. If I wasn't so dehydrated from all the coffee drinks, I would have ordered some booze. Dishes are a pretty penny but delish so I recommend only coming here for light bites. It's a beautiful place to bring a date. Staff is friendly, the manager came by to check up on us, and it was a pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"We were in town for just two days and wanted to see a different part of town than Scottsdale and found good reviews for Brickyard so we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed the atmosphere was great as was the service and the food. We tried the ravioli, pork tacos and fingerling potatoes. All yummy. The dark and stormy was also a hit!"}
{"text":"Food:  Great tasting, good quality (made from scratch), good selection.  I wish there were more lighter dishes to choose from.  Most tapas items are kind of heavy.
Service:  Fantastic.  Didn't feel neglected, but it also didn't feel intrusive.
Price:  I feel the Yelp price chart is a little misleading given most of the items are tapas and meant to be shared.  Each plate seemed somewhat overpriced for what you got ($15 for 3 tempura shrimp on a bed of tapioca).

I'll return given the tastiness of the food.  However; the price will prevent the Brickyard from joining my list of regular \"go to\" places."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I just wished it wasn't always so loud. The hubby & I love coming here but it's hard to carry a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"I simply cannot say enough good things about the Brickyard...  While the east valley tends to lack in quality dining establishments.  I have to say Gavin has knocked it out of the park with the Brickyard... Celebrating my birthday on a Friday evening, although they were quite busy I was able to call ahead and our party of four were promptly seated..  very interesting cocktail list and if they do not have it on the list they will accommodate you.. I tried 2 different cocktails during dinner and both were spot on.  we shared several small plates , the brussel sprouts, shishito peppers, pork belly tacos, ravioli, beat salad,  cheese board  duck confit (my favorite)and the lamb needless to say we over ordered but all was delish and I had the lamb and salad for lunch the next day..
chocolate martini for desert was probably the best I have had, just the right amount of sweetness.. I cant wait to go back.. Great Job Gavin and amazing food Chef Aaron.."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars to this cozy, South Beach vibe place right in the center of Chandler. Many selections of mixed drinks; my French 75 was perfect. We had the tuna sashimi, shrimp tacos, and coconut shrimp. They have small and large plates to share/tapas style. Check out the back patio, it is perfect for a date, romantic and Intimate. The heating lamps were a plus. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We initially noticed a new restaurant and thought we should give it a shot.  Well, they had brussel sprouts, one of my favorites.  Then we glanced over at the cocktail side of the house.  OMG, these guys and gals know what they are doing.  The flavors on the menu are impeccable.  When you grab a bartender and give him a few flavor ideas, he (or she) will come back with an amazing drink.  Notable mention is the Boggs Punch and Henry's Gentleman Jack winning Cocktail.  We recently explored more of the food.  The Bahn mi tacos are out of this world.  The Squash Ravioli is a MUST!  Pork Belly skewers should also not be missed.  I would eat every meal here is they weren't so dang busy!  I hope they are in business for many many years to come!"}
{"text":"We are moving to Chandler in March and wanted to try some of the restaurants in the downtown Chandler area.  We heard about The Brickyard from some of the people in our new residence.  We decided to check it out on a Thursday around 4:30 pm - in time for Happy Hour.  The staff was very fun, the atmosphere was great, the drinks were fabulous (the staff made great recommendations), and the food was delicious as well.  I had red wine and my boyfriend had some of the custom cocktails - both delicious!  We tried some Pork Belly Skewers (succulent and mouthwatering), Mini Bricks (these are sliders that are amazing- juicy and so flavorful!!).  We enjoyed ourselves so much on Thursday, we came back on Friday!  It was packed!!  The staff was great again - recommending drinks based on what flavor we liked.  Chelsea, Tyler, Bobby, Henry are very fun and make great craft cocktails.  On Friday, we tried the Pork and Shrimp Gyoza (The spicy chili sauce - you will want it on everything!), Mini Bricks, Roasted Cauliflower, Fresh Salad - - - all amazing!!  Back again on Sunday for more and had the street tacos and more of their craft cocktails.

Overall, The Brickyard Downtown has a wonderful atmosphere, great staff, amazing cocktails and food and will be one of our favorites in downtown Chandler.  They don't have the most extensive menu and it isn't \"cheap\" . .. . However, you pay for what you get (everything they do here is done with care and is done perfectly!) - - - and this staff, atmosphere, cocktails and food is worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here not sure why we didn't get here sooner! I had the Dove and Cubano cocktails and they're both fantastic! I bartender Bobby was incredible and knows how to make a damn good drink! We also ordered that shishito peppers along with the pork belly and they both blew our minds! The pork belly was so flavorful and tender and wonderful and I will be getting both those items again and I cannot wait to try everything else on the menu. This place has wonderful Decour and ambience and as the perfect place for a date night we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was beyond amazing. We basically ordered everything off the menu. Brussels, cauliflower, street tacos, the loaded potato fingerlings were by far my favorite. Everything was just amazing, food is beyond great. Atmosphere was great, staff beyond friendly. Most enjoyable evening by far. I will say that the place is small, so get there early for good seat. Other than that, I will be returning."}
{"text":"Boom ! Food is on point- all of it ! We ordered 75 pct of the tapas and could not decide what we liked most! Good vibes, music, and service. Search no more for a great Sunday unwind and chillax meal!"}
{"text":"First time here & very impressed. We went for happy hour. The cocktails were great, the food was very good, the service was spectacular  (thanks Remy). The owner was there and made sure we were well cared for. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you want to have a date night at a beautiful restaurant enjoying a glass of wine and small bites, this is the place to be.

The hostess was very welcoming. Shortly after we were seated, our waitress showed up shortly after introducing their drinks and food menu to us. She knows the menu very welcome and could tell us the detail of how each dish is being cooked and prepared. Very impressive. Since it was a long week at work, I ordered a glass of Riesling. She allowed me to try a sip before ordering the whole glass. For entrees, we ordered the pork belly skewers, shishito peppers, loaded potato and charred octopus. My favorite was definitely the pork belly skewers. It was well seasoned and the pork was very tender. Shishito peppers was not spicy at all and a bit too mushy. I wouldn't recommend it. Loaded potatoes were soaked in flavor. The charred octopus was also well seasoned, favorable and so tender that you can cut it into a half with the folk. I highly recommend this dish. For dessert, we ordered the mini churros with 3 different types of dipping sauce. Chocolate dipping was definitely my favorite. Raspberry was a bit soar and not for my taste. 

Our waitress was just great! She was attentive and constantly keeping an eye on our table to make sure that we are well taking care of. She was funny too. The bar is very decorated and staffs were all well dressed. I will most definitely come back here again with friends. 

P.S. This restaurant does not take reservation. Since it isn't a big restaurant, you might need to have an expectation of some wait time for tables during the weekends."}
{"text":"Very creative craft drinks. Lighting, music and their  unique food play into the quaint atmosphere. Just moved to Chandler from Tucson and this is becoming one of my favorite places to eat and drink. (Their mussels are a must have!)"}
