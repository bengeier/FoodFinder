{"text":"Great service the gentleman seem to work very hard to complete great food I have tried the chicken philly, rice bowl & the chicken alfredo excellent food"}
{"text":"Customer service when calling in an order sucks. Peeps are rude and act like they have a problem with taking orders. I only had fries with sauce from here but the sauce was watery and the fries were booo. My husband ordered the tilapia dinner and his fish was dry so he didn't even finish and when he went in to pick up the order he saw them pouring Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce into another container and then adding water to it. No wonder the sauce was thin. Needless to say we won't be returning to this joint. DO BETTER OR JUST CLOSE YOUR DOORS SHEESH!!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. Took an hour just to get the order wrong. Ordered 2 whole wing dinners, one honey lemon pepper one garlic parm. They made both garlic parm. I got my money back and left. Terrible. First and last time here. How do you mess up 10 wings? They need better kitchen staff. When I arrived it was only 2 people working the kitchen, then 4 more came out of nowhere."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Fries extra greasy . Grease was dripping from them. Little dirty and a bunch people in back. Don't like that many people around where food being prepared. Won't go back shame"}
{"text":"Food cooked fresh. Very personable staff.  If you want some good food, cooked with time and care then try this place.  I don't like fast food places and chains, you always find the tastiest food and local places like this."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Customer service was very poor, hard to understand, and not polite. They also said they didn't deliver? Which is advertised all over website, store front etc."}
{"text":"I waited 25 min for a polish boy after being quoted 10. I walked up to register to ask for a refund as my polish boy was ready. I wanted to write a bad review...but then I tasted the polish boy. The skies broke open and the angels sang and I seriously considered going back in and waiting another \"ten\" (read: 25-30) minutes of my life for another polish boy.   Call ahead. Don't order and go in to wait. It's a hole in the wall and a little seedy, but the quality is good.  I feel like if they can get their timing together, they'll be on the same path as the Fix/Black Box Fix. However, since I'm inpatient I won't return for a few months so they have some time to get it together and I can update the review."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Philly over fries. The wait wasn't too bad for a walk up during lunch hour. I'll be coming back here to try more items for sure. I would have taken a picture of what I got. But I ate it all. It was like a finely chopped chicken philly and the fries act as the bread. The whole thing was really flavorful. Cheesy and Saucy."}
{"text":"The manager seemed very rude and unprofessional. I did not have a pleasant experience. The only thing incredible is the 10 violations on their most recent food inspection by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health."}
{"text":"Very,very small wings. Good flavor and well prepared. Kitchen is very disorganised. 10 minute wait was more like 25 minutes.That being said they have food super late."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE never will I order from this place again a 15 min order for ten wings took 50 mins lol 4 orders went out fast 3 took hella long mine was the longest along with how no hair net and the girl not wearing gloves while handling the food if u like hood places this is the place for u RATCHET!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome to have such an establishment in the area! We've been about three times now and have yet to be disappointed by the food or the service. Every employee we've encountered had been so fantastic, pleasant, cheerful, and lovely! The Polish Boys are fantastic, as was the Philly. Such a fantastic addition to our little stretch of Mayfield! Also, the hours can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food was good, but for the service was ass. Called in two orders in advanced, was told it'll be 15-20 minutes. Waited, and then arrived to be told that our orders weren't taken, and one of the order is out, so we spent a approximately another 20-30 minutes for our food to prepared.   Need more improvement with all service, and taking orders.   I understand the food production as being in that field for a 1-2 years, but my experience was not well."}
{"text":"This place is TRASH! Tried to support the  business, but 3rd strike for me. $12 dollars for what?!?! Two bites in and it's a quarter gone. Beside the person answering the phone, no one knows what they're doing. No one greets you upon entering, you almost have to be just as rude as they are just to be serviced. After I had to bogart my way to the counter, (3 separate people have canceled their orders and left at this point) I wait for another 10 mins before I'm handed my already bagged up from the underside of the table carryout order... minus the other half of it. And all I taste is cheese and ranch. Waste of time, energy and money."}
{"text":"Came here and they took 55 minutes to get me my food and I believe they gave it to someone else and now i'm pissed. Don't recommend coming!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here through Uber Eats. waited two+ hours and it just never came. Highly, highly disappointed. I would've respected it more if they cancelled the order because they were backed up or too busy. Instead they kept delaying it until they cancelled it, two+ hours later."}
{"text":"The wait was about twice what we were quoted, but the customer service was super nice & attentive, they were just super busy and understaffed. Food was REALLY good; got the steak philly over fries & it was delicious & a good size for the money.   All in all, I highly recommend, just don't go in a hurry!"}
{"text":"do not go here!  cooks are rude and take forever to fulfill an order.  told me to get out when waiting for an uber eats order."}
{"text":"The honey lemon pepper wings were amazing! I'd recommend calling ahead  for your order, as the wait can be a little longer than expected. I removed one star because I had a couple of minor issues with my fish and scampie dinner. The scampie sauce was a little bland, and the dinner was ready before the wings, resulting in the garlic bread and fries getting a little soggy. If they could work on their timing and execution, this would be a 5 star review."}
