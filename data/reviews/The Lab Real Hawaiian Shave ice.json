{"text":"Great place to stop and get a nice cold treat. Very clean and professional looking with great options and staff. Will be coming back whenever in the mall."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and it was totally worth it. I was really contemplating between the shaved ice and the dole whip but the girl helping me out (with the glasses) was really nice and patient. She told me all the options and even made some recommendations that I'll definitely have to try next time I'm in town! The dole whip was bomb and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Seen the Hawaiian rainbow shave ice photo which caught my attention & it was a good day for shave ice with this warm weather. Keanu was working today. Great personality, could tell he was a local with the pidgin accent just like myself. Great service, he knew the menu well & even offered extra toppings to add onto my shave ice which of course I got lihing mui powder (MY FAVE)! I encouraged him to tell owner to build one in the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood. Great traffic. Maybe you could spice the shave ice with alcohol?! That'll be a great idea. Cool place to get good shave ice & great service as well. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"So good!  The staff is amazing and the shaved ice was perfect!!  They even have dole whips and real Thrifty ice cream!"}
{"text":"Came here for some shave ice and dole whip. This is located inside Meadows Mall at the end of the food court.   Hubby got me dole whip while my daughter got a rainbow shaved ice. Hubby got himself a chocolate sundae. The girl behind the counter was dashing to make our goodies. My dole whip came out first. I took a spoonful and it was so good. At the bottom was the pineapple juice. It was topped with a cherry and umbrella. As we sat eating our delicious desserts, there was trans dance music playing. I liked the music and vibe inside. Prices were worth it. They even serve ice cream from Thrifty's. They sell drinks, candy and even milkshakes. My daughter's shave ice came out next and then hubby's chocolate ice cream sundae. Yum!   Seating is limited. There is around 4 tables inside. I absolutely love this place. Good place for dole whip."}
{"text":"Best shave ice I've had outside of Hawaii! So ono; if you come visit the 9th Island, you gotta stop in. Plenty flavors, condensed milk, ice cream in da bottom, good vibe, lots of aloha! Mahalo to The Lab for giving me some 8-0-8 nostalgia!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not bad for not being the real deal like Hawaii. But I'd go back. Make sure you find the coupon deal. They're out there."}
{"text":"Totally awesome service. Its always from where we live, but it was good. A teate of Hawaii, so if I miss Hawaii I will come here to get some shave ice..."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet flavors. Would recommend all the flavors. First try was my favorite all time shaved ice is bubblegum.Takes me back to the days."}
{"text":"Brah, where's da beef?!! Waste money unless you understand that you're only getting half the order of Dole Whip with a donut hole. Check in photos. Dole Whip with Li Hing. I thought the first time was a fluke, but no, this is how they make it. All along the sides with giant hole in the middle. Still ono though. Just disappointing and insulting."}
{"text":"Delicious yummy organic vegan Shaved Ice!!! I gotta go back... Great spot to get something delicious frozen and yummy full of flavor..  Would recommend anyone to thus place..."}
{"text":"The Skinny: came here for Dole whip...which is kind of overpriced for the serving size. (3)  Came here for Dole whip because Dole whip rocks my world. And once a year I get like a huge craving for it. My lovely hubby indulged me by heading out of our way to satisfy my appetite. We ordered it and it came with a little umbrella and maraschino cherry. Cute.  Then I dig in. Ummm....there is kinda of a large hole in the middle of the Dole whip. Lame!  Given that it cost $4.50 for this relatively small treat, it is pretty pricey for what it is. Sigh! I guess it's okay if you only go back once a year to get your Dole whip groove on. Otherwise, probably should avoid this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. Offcourse fruity but its about the experience of a complete flavour. Served with good vibes, Gracias."}
{"text":"This place located a little near the food court inside Meadows Mall.. The service was great. They let us try some samples, we felt as if we knew the owners from the store from feeling so comfortable with open conversation. The ice was perfect! You know how usually when you want to bite into a snowcone/shaved ice and it's hard, breaks apart and usually falls accidentally onto the floor? This ice isn't like that, it's soft ice and it's just perfect, to lick, bite it even just eat off a spoon! They do however put so much ice that it looks like it will fall but it won't so don't worry about that. It's definitely delicious though. I do recommend trying it out (: plus they had nice pretty models modeling for the store that also advertised a cute clothing line that, if I am not mistaken, started with people in Hawaii? Overall we loved it."}
{"text":"Unbelievable....was exactly like the shaved ice we got in Hawaii. I found this place by searching on Yelp and took my fellow Yelpers advice and got the Tigers blood and POG with dole whip on the bottom. Staff was friendly and answered our questions. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I was craving the dole pineapple whip...had to drive all the way to the Meadows mall...was so worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and daughter tried out this place and said that it was great. The shave ice & the customer service.   We came down as a family on a weekend to get some shave ice. I put my order in with a guy with glasses. I ordered a single scoop of ice cream on a cone, a child shave ice - strawberry, and a dole whip. I reiterated that my daughter only wanted strawberry flavoring and nothing else.   After we ordered two big parties walked in to get shave ice too. They gave me my sons ice cream order after a minute or so. And he told us that we had two people in front of us before my daughters shave ice was ready. Well we were skipped by 8 orders or so. They served the parties that ordered after I did. The employee was trying to give my daughter a shave ice that we didn't even order which was for the second party that ordered. I had to tell him what I ordered again after waiting more than 20 minutes. They gave me my dole whip order and the guy calls me up to the order window to ask me to pay again for my order again!  I was explained to HIM that I had already paid for my orders. He never gave anyone a receipt, he had to look through the transactions to find my order. Then he says, \"Sorry about that and the wait. We're busy.\" While I'm walking away from the window the other employee (a girl) tells him you need to print out the receipts so you don't mess up anyone's orders!   My husband is disappointed with the service today. He's been raving about this place to me, our family & friends. I wouldn't have cared if he skipped us a couple times but to skip us and forget our order, and ask me to pay again?! I was close to asking not for a refund and walking out of there.   We will probably come back one of these days if we're ever at Meadows Mall again. But hopefully we'll have better service."}
{"text":"This business was brought to my attention as the owner visited a patient of mine from work.  Offering real Hawaiian shaved ice, Thrifty's ice cream, and Dole Whip, one stop could satisfy a whole family's various sweet tooth/teeth.  Normally I would not go out of the way to Meadows Mall as it is far from where I live but I now have a reason to stop by if I'm in the area again.    Two locations inside Meadow's mall (a booth downstairs) provides some of the nicest dole whips and Hawaiian shaved ices you can enjoy here in Vegas.  I opted to try a shaved ice with half Tiger's blood and half P.O.G. with condensed milk drizzled over everything.   Tiger's blood (usually watermelon, strawberry, and a hint of coconut) was nice and sweet and I also enjoyed the P.O.G. (Passion fruit, Orange, Guava).   Served with a spoon and a straw, the size was huge and good enough for two.    The dole whip was just as refreshing as ever.  I'm not nearly a pineapple fan but I'll gladly take this frozen concoction any and every day.   I suggest you try this as well if you have never had the opportunity to do so.  If it was Disneyland's best kept dessert for a long time, you know it must be good!  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 2 / 100"}
{"text":"Sat in their lobby for 10 mins. No employees. No signs. Nothing saying closed or be back soon. Very unprofessional. Actually decided to walk around the mall for a few more minutes and doubled back on the way out to see if anyone was there, still no one. If you're closed then turn your lights off or put away your merchandise. Is there a zero star option?"}
{"text":"Place was good.  Flavors good too. Prices were great. 5 bucks is fair and they give you money worth on size of ice and flavors. I'd go again if I am ever at the mall.  Down side is... Had a \"candy lady\" atmosphere...lotta stuff going on in that store. Stick to the ices..ice creams..and whips and you would free up space on counter intead of \"Hey I made a run to Costco let's sell this extra stuff here since I bought in bulk for self\". 3 1/2 - 4  stars though."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Hawaiian Shave Ice with ice cream on the bottom and condensed milk is the closest thing to the island! And the pineapple dole whip just like the one at Disneyland. Definitely worth going to this place and definitely worth coming back, great environment and great service!   Also worth trying is their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Spilled my Rainbow Remix snow cone and Keanu wiped up the mess and re-topped it off for me. Totally cool and chill guy. This place also has a chill vibe to it and an awesome selection -- definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! First time there. I went for a lemonade and they pulled me in with the free samples. Went for the watermelon and Tiger's Blood. So good and great service"}
{"text":"Get a taste of some authentic shaved ice here at the Lab! It's so good! The staff are so friendly and accommodating willing to appease your every desire! I never miss out on some shaved ice every time I go to the mall here."}
{"text":"Great Spot!!! Will recommend to anybody that is looking for an ice cream or shaved ice!! 10/10"}
{"text":"What's not to like...shave ice, Dole whip and Thrifty icecream! including milkshakes and all the goodies... It's located inside Meadows Mall. It's small, clean and modern with few bar tables.   My bf had the Hawaiian shave ice with watermelon and mango. I had the World famous fudge sundae and we took home a pint of their Butter Pecan and Black Cherry.  Every order were perfectly delicious. The flavors are top notch. For those lactose intolerant people... It's dairy free. Shave ice with any two flavors is $5, single scoop of Thrifty icecream is $3, double is $4 and pint and sundae are both $6.50.   We sat at the table and listened to the music that was playing on the flat-screen TV.   The customer service is on point as well.  Highly recommend this icecream shop!"}
{"text":"Just got back from visiting Hawaii and having the best shave ice ever, only to find the real deal here in Vegas.  Talk about ono.  Stop by and visit Aaron the awesome asian dude witb the pineapple palm tree hair.  He said I could say that...lol.  He and the shave ice were the bombs.  Great attitude and shave ice with all the local flavors including POG.  The vanilla pineapple dole whip swirl is the best combo of sweet and tang. Check them out."}
{"text":"I've had shave ice in Hawaii------this is definitely the closest to the real thing that I've had in Vegas. The service was fast and friendly. Will be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Great selection of all kinds of items. Hawaiian style Shaved Ice with all kinds of add ons such as ice cream, dole whip, li hing mui powder, mochi, condensed milk, sour spray, nuts and more. Lots of flavors too. 2 flavors are $5.50 extra flavors are 50 cents each. They also have Thrifty Ice cream and dole whip, sodas, floats, milk shakes, and lemonade!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here. I love it because it's lactose free and she's lactose intolerant so she got to taste this delicious treat I grew up on in hawaii. It's very close to my house which makes it convenient for me if I want to get some dessert for me and my daughter. Located inside the meadows mall. I like the dole pineapple with whip and li hing mui."}
{"text":"This place sells great shave ice, that's not my issue! The problem I personally had with my visit was the music! EVERY song that played during my experience while there and the two hours I was getting my nails done across from them had nothing but EXCESSIVE profanity [f bombs and the b word] and vulgarity. I'm all for a place having great music, but there was nothing professional or tasteful about that choice of music! Not a place for family, yet alone a decent human being. Not sure if that's just that particular person on staff and their choice of music or the company in general but I won't be returning with my family. This happened today around 7pm-9pm if it helps management pinpoint the culprit!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.   I was leaving the food court and on my way out I noticed a Thrifty's Ice cream sign. Took a step back and was digging the whole set up. It had a very modern ice cream parlor shop look with the Hawaii feel customer service.  Me coming from Hawaii, it's great to finally have something like this in Las Vegas. Shaved Ice is well needed in the Vegas heat.   This is the 3rd store in this location. It was once a cupcake place, coffee place & now \"The Lab\" I wish them all the luck.  For the best Thrifty's Ice Cream & Hawaiian Shaved Ice, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of shave ice flavors and goodies (thrifty ice cream, pineapple whip, waffles and candies). Pretty decent prices for what u get. Nice clean space only a few seats inside but it's right on the side of food court with lots of seating.  Had the tigers blood/POG shave ice & dole whip, both were great and service was quick. Try them out while u shop at Meadows mall (or wait for your wife lol)"}
{"text":"Shave Ice is pretty big for $5.  Really tasty.  The selection of flavors is good.   The location is convenient to the parking lot - as close to the door as possible in the food court.   It's the real deal shave ice - just the right consistency and amount of syrup.  They also have candy, dole whip, Thrifty Ice Cream, and I'm not sure what else.  We will go again."}
{"text":"I really loved the girl helping behind the counter.  The mall was closing and she hadn't counted her drawer yet so she was able to go out of her way and help even though we showed up two minutes before closing.  The Hawaiian Shaved ice was really good.  Really hit the spot after a hot afternoon at the park.  I would have gotten a smaller one the sizes are huge.  A nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place is great and the girls r very nice and they explained what they had as the shaved ice and I've cream, very friendly. And the shaved ice is pretty big u can also add more flavors instead of just doing one.  This place is clean and fun."}
{"text":"Located in the small wing near the entrance to the mall (the parking lot is Sears side) and the beginning of the Food Court (the end is Johnny Rockets or the smoothie place); one of the closest restaurants is Panda Express, across the way. It's small, but there are a few tables with bar/pub height chairs. It's clean. The menu is easy to read. The ladies there are pretty nice, and will give you an ice cream sample, if you ask for it.   We've only had the Thrifty ice cream (lots of yummy flavors available) so far, but my in-laws had the Dole Whip (said it was just as good as they remembered having it on our past Hawaii trip). I grew up with Thrifty ice cream (there was one in my city that we would go to regularly, especially after school), so it's part nostalgia whenever we get Thrifty ice cream nowadays. When Thrifty (the store chain) closed down here, lots of places (ie. gas stations) decided to carry the popular ice cream brand. Glad it's inside of the Meadows Mall, too.   We sat at the table and listened to Hip-Hop that was playing while the videos were on the flat-screen TV inside.   We'll be back! I'm definitely going to try a different flavor of Thrifty ice cream, or even get Dole Whip next time."}
{"text":"Loved It!!! Thank you Keanu for your amazing customer service. My Dole Whip made me feel like I was back home in Disneyland"}
{"text":"Just tried the hawaiian bass shave ice with  cream on top so good great service true local"}
{"text":"Shave ice keeps me cool mahalo's & I will come back later on when I'm not working  @ my job on the South Las Vegas strip but first I need money $"}
{"text":"If you love Hawaiian shaved ice, you'll love this place! It has all the original flavors along with house specials. I had melona and coconut flavors, and li hing mui powder. 2 flavors are $5 and 50 cents for add ons. Decent size.  The other flavors tried was cotton candy, mango, blue raspberry, sno capped (condensed milk on top).  Ono!"}
{"text":"Aw so glad the manager got back to me ! I will definitely give you guys another try and I am excited to do so :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by the lab today to try out their raspberry dole whip. I've had the pineapple and the lemon flavor before but didn't know they made raspberry. It was absolutely amazing. The lady working there was so friendly and we ended up talking about trance music. She change the station and we ended up watching some cool videos.'. I was really impressed with the customer service and the quality of the products here. The staff seem super knowledgeable on everything and really enjoyed talking about the store."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good... The Dole pineapple whip with lemon is amazing!!!   The customer service is on point as well... Super nice !!!!   Oh... For those lactose intolerant people... It's dairy free!!!"}
{"text":"I went to the little kiosk downstairs in the mall with my friend and we decided to eat a little treat. We swirled the pineapple and vanilla Dole Whip....Oh to the M to the Gee! It was utterly refreshing! After we finished sharing one I had to order another one LOL #fattystats! Will be back soon to get more deliciousness :)"}
{"text":"Very nice.  Tucked away in the food court of Meadow's Mall food court. Got the Pineapple Dole Whip.  Incredible!!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     48/100  Finally got the chance to check this place out. I haven't been to Meadows Mall in a long time! Some things have changed since the last time I was here. Haven't had \"Real Hawaiian Shave Ice\" since I was back home on Oahu, 6+ years ago.   Heard a lot about this place from my cousins, who come here often.  \"Bettah than the place at container park.\" After trying this place out, \"Yes, I can say it is.\" They have more options and flavors to add to the shave ice. And more aloha spirit, it adds to the authenticity.   They have other cold dessert options, such as Dole Whip, Thrifty Ice Cream, milkshakes, malts, floats, dole float, hot fudge sundae but your best bet here is the shave ice. The other ones you can find else where, but if you're in the mall and craving for something other than shave ice, go for it.   They have a variety of toppings: mochi, condensed milk, dole whip, sour spray, li hing mui powder, strawberry/raspberry sauce, Ghirardelli chocolate syrup.   The only thing that's missing which would make it more authentic is having azuki beans as a topping.   The guy at this location, was for real a local braddah from Hawai'i. Super friendly and we chatted with him while we sampled some of the shave ice flavors. He definitely had the Aloha Spirit. Although he's lived in Las Vegas for 14 years he still had a strong Hawaiian Pidgin accent. It was nice to hear. I miss it. I don't hear it that often.   Sorry, I forgot a photo of the shave ice. I only had a few spoons of it because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake (diabetes).   This place made me miss home. Will be back soon!  TIP: They have Melona, POG (Passion Orange Guava) & Tiger's Blood syrup!   TIP: There are two locations at the Meadows Mall, only locations in Vegas right now. One is in the food court near the mall entrance with more seating. The one we went to was the one downstairs in the middle of the mall near Bath & Body Works and The Disney Store."}
{"text":"Best place in town for real Hawaiian shave ice. They use the old school shave ice machines and it just comes out perfect. Portions are big and prices are just right."}
{"text":"I've read several reviews before going. I went and was greeted by a young lady (didn't catch her name) I asked for a pineapple dole whip. I asked for a direct pour since a lot of people mentioned about the empty hole. I did ask and she said the reason why they swirl it is because they weigh the amount given. So for everyone complaining about the hole it's not their  fault it's company policy. I only went for the dole whip and I was happy. Will be going back."}
{"text":"We wanted something sweet after our loss at the YMCA gym across the street back in September so we came here after checking on Yelp. What we didn't realize is this was inside a mall (That's what happens when you're just here for the weekend).   Anytime someone writes \"Real Hawaiian Shave Ice\" or the \"World's best shave ice\" I have to put it to the litmus test. That is, for me to come and taste it.  Not saying I have the best tongue for the job (tho my tongue can be good for something else...lol), but I've tasted many and here my take on this place inside the Meadows Mall.   First when you walk in, you see a mixture of albums and skating. Then this place sells shave ice along with dole whip and Thrifty ice cream. The food choices are great, the decor I wasn't sure what they were going for: A sports theme or just a fan of music. But regardless of either one, there were more uncertainties.   They advertised on the counter to buy a giftcard for $10 and you get $15 worth.  Which at first sounded great, and when we arrived at the register after the line here, the girl at the counter told us we can use the $10 now, but the $5 later? Which makes zero sense because if we were to gift this gift card, wouldn't the recipient be a little pissed thinking they can only use partial at a time?   So regardless of us trying to save some money, we as a group all bought shave ice and ice cream anyways. The inside is very tiny, seats about 3 parties for a total of about 10 to 12 people. And the wait for shave ice was not short either, it took nearly 20 minutes from order to receiving it finally.   The verdict? A little sweet on the syrup, but the ice itself is fine and perfect.  This place doesn't have the usual Hawaiian flavors like POG but I would say the choices were decent.  I do think the price/quantity ratio is a bit expensive for what you get.   After our party had received our shave ice, the counter lady gave us a small dole whip on the house. Quite nice, tho it didn't have that cap at the bottom of the dispenser so it kind of looked like tasty yellow poop.   I realized this place had restaurant.com gift certificates after the visit. I wished I had known because I would've done that instead of asking to purchase the awkward gift card."}
{"text":"Strawberry/POG with condensed milk.  Not as big as it seems.  I couldnt really taste the condensed milk.  I wish they offered fruit with their shaved ice like they do in Hawaii.  But overall, I liked it and will be returning!"}
{"text":"What an outstanding group of workers. They went above and beyound. Kanua and his team member forget her name but they were both off the hook. Happy 21st to you girl. Mahalo."}
{"text":"Beats having to track a food truck down just to get it. We used to go to the shave ice stand at the indoor swap meet on decatur and Snow ono...but since they all closed down...this is by far the next best thing. It's the closest thing to Hawaiian Shave Ice as you can get! They even serve that famous Dole.   I love that it is situated in a mall. Beats having to stand in the sun on a scorching hot summer day with 2 kids, a toddler, and a baby in tow. It's located in the food court across the nail shop. How is a nail shop in a food court? It's not really, just gotta walk down a few steps after Panda Express and boom.  As for the clutter of random candy sold on their counter...I don't mind it. It just reminds me of the mom and pop shops back in HI. 4 stars because it only comes in 1 size. Wish they offered at least a kid size for those with children...5 bucks a kid is pretty steep and a waste if they don't finish it. So why don't I just use my brain and split between kids? Welp, with all the flavors to choose from...none of my boys will want to share or give up portioning. They'll end up fighting trying to scoop some of whoever has shave ice left. Nothing like a bunch of kids fighting to ruin the vibe. Lol  I can go on but you gotta go for yourself. You won't be disappointed and it really is a great treat esssspecially if you have dairy allergies (as a few of my kids do).  Eat up then shop up after! Haha..."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend he found this place and said I should get it. So I went on a weekday it was awesome had a connection with the guy behind the machine. Hook me up island style we talk like back on the island.   Took my wife here cause I told her it was like island style environment. Went there it was busy. Took an order of ice cream , shave ice and the dole whip.   One the guy messed up the order gave someone else's order then skip our order by 8 people. Wife been waiting for almost 30 mins. Gave my wife the dole wipe  then messed up the order again for the 5th time. Saying we only order one thing. And that my son had chocolate ice cream.   Another 10 mins pass still waiting on my daughters shave us after receiving the shave ice the quality was not great at all. Didn't look like what the other people had. Like they rush the order just to get it out. Well this is just one Yelp view and this place has a such high rate cause others where being taken care of. But my family was not very said cause I hype up my wife to go here and we live in the other side of town.   Well I would come here again for the first guy that served me. But if I see these two again I refuse to go.   Greeting 10  Customer service 2 Location food court  Store clean 8 Taken care of returning customer sad face   This summer is going to be very busy make sure you get a receipt to ensure your order is right or have them repeat your order so they don't mess it up"}
{"text":"Yesterday 6-28-15 around 2PM I got a strong hankering for a Dole Whip.   I turned to my trusty friend, Yelp, and found this place.   I was so torn because I wanted a shave ice AND  a Dole Whip...but get this...you can get your shave ice \"snow-capped\", meaning a little dollop of dole whip ON TOP OF YOUR SHAVE ICE. Genius.  The shave ice is $5 and there's only one size, the snow-cap was like 50, so the total with tax was $5.95.   The shave ice was very nicely shaped and had an adequate amount of tiger's blood syrup on it.  My only complaints would be the syrup was just sweet...there was no sourness or acidity to it, and the texture was more icy than I'm used to for shave ice.  I prefer Sno Ono...DAT DOLE WHIP THO....oooh lordy it was good.   The gal working was nice...she really took her time and made our treats lovely and delicious.  They were playing techno music on a big screen tv and I saw a DJ turntable...they're going for an EDC vibe I think.  It was clean enough but the front is completely cluttered with miscellaneous junk like candies for sale, broken suckers, a valentine's gift basket??? Bizarre...looks like they should do a little spring cleaning.  Overall not bad, and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Was craving something new and not to far. Located in the food court and atmosphere was okay. It was kinda loud so I had to talk really loud to get my order across. Service was fast. Would come back and recommend this place. My friend tried the dole whip and they even had a raspberry flavor which tasted yummy. The candy kinda threw me off didn't really fit with the theme."}
{"text":"A little small on portions comparing to other places and Shaved Ice trucks, but the price was more than fair and the staff was quick to complete our order and followed through to make sure we were happy.  Hated the placement...in a mall food court.  I guess it's almost not fair to ding them for the annoying ass teens that run in and out like it's a damned mall...nevermind.  I'll certainly swing by again."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bad customer service. You could go to thriftys ice cream and get the same for half the price with friendlier employees. Not employees that don't even greet you and focus on what they're going to play on YouTube on the tv mounted on the wall."}
