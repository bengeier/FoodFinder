{"text":"We recently visited Touche on a Saturday evening.The restaurant was empty except for one table at 9pm. We were seated and then the waitress ignored us for the next several minutes as we watched her joke around with the bartender. She finally came over and took our order from the the very limited choice of martinis we saw on the menu. My husband was happy with his Sex in the City martini but I felt there was no alcohol whatsoever in my Marilyn Monroe martini. I feel certain I paid $10 for a few ounces of peach juice. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places on College that seems interchangeable with a bunch of other ones. Been to one to you've been to them all, I guess. 

This one was a little nicer though because the staff is pretty friendly- was quiet and when they told me there was no specials that night....they brought over free jager shots to make up for it. So.... that was nice."}
{"text":"came here on a friday night, and the atmosphere was awesome!! the martinis and the samba band made it all the more fun.  Couldn't stop dancing to the beat!!!! though speaking spanish is helpful, it would have been better if I understood POrtuguese a lot fluently...the staff were fun and very accomodating espeicially when it was packed.....definitely a place to go...its small, and fun!!!"}
