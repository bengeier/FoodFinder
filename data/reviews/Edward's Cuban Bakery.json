{"text":"Well I really appreciate Cuban food, love it but was disappointed with this place on so many levels. The amount of time we had to wait for our food- was 35 minutes. It doesn't take that long for a Cuban sandwich. This place was not crowded enough to wait for such a long time. There was one other couple eating and of course another person waiting forever for his food. The other thing is that I specifically said no mustard on my sandwich and it had mustard. The sandwich was good once I used a napkin to get rid of the yellow globs on each side of my sandwich. My friend ordered a tamale and it was bland, as I was offered a bite. Then the the papas rellenas is what really disappointed me! This had absolutely no ground beef inside! I took a picture of before and after I sliced it open- looks good but where's the meat? Where's the taste? No garlic or peppers- it was a fried mash potatoes ball- yep and it was something that I told my friend oh she's going to love this! Wow, yeah I didn't know that it was going to be missing ingredients and taste. Also, be prepared to use your Spanish in this restaurant, not English. 
Your best bet is to drive 10 more minutes to 43/ Peoria for the best Cuban food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went for the first time a few weeks ago and it was nice to have a Cuban Pizza like in La Habana. The croquetas it's a good place and as expected when you're starting out things can be a little rough but when I was there the wait was fine, the girl at the counter was nice, and the food was great. It was perfect to satisfy the nostalgia of eating a Cuban Pizza and Croquetas and the Batido de Mamey was DELISH!!!!! YUMMMY!!! or shall I say MUY DELICIOSOOOOOOO :)"}
{"text":"Terribly bad pizza I really wanted to like this place but no. Soft undercooked dough had to get a burger for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is okay.  Haven't tried their pizzas but as far as Cuban food goes, not impressed.  Some of their items taste homemade - which is great - but very inconsistent.  The one item I keep going back for is their Guava pastry and it's a big hit with regulars because every time we go in, we buy the last ones if they haven't already sold out for the day.  I thought I had a sweet-tooth but all the other pastries I've tried are WAY TOO SWEET for me.      

They use a Keurig type of machine to make their espresso for their \"cafe con leche\" which tastes good but then I wondered why they take the milk in a separate styrofoam cup to the back... turns out they have to put it in the microwave to warm it up.  So that was the last time I ever bought it.  

I plan to go back to try their pizzas.  I've been told they taste just like they make them in Cuba.  Other than that, I'm still looking for a good spot to satisfy my Cuban food cravings."}
{"text":"Great little spot for some Cuban coffee and pastries! Will definitely come back to try the Cuban Sandwich!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I work around the corner and I've found myself eating here over five times in the last month. Every day there's a new special, whether it be specialty Cuban sandwiches, tamales, or Congri (which is an amazing Cuban specialty that consists of rice, beans, and pork) LOVE LOVE LOVE. The pizzas take a little bit longer than most of their other foods, but on average I'm in and out in a matter of 45 minutes. Not to mention that the service is phenomenal. The girls working the counter are super attentive and the cook herself came out to check on how the food was tasting. This small little mom and pop restaurant is exactly the kind of place I love stumbling across. I definitely recommend. My favorites on the menu are the Hawaiian Pizza, the Tuna Pizza (yes, it sounds odd but it's surprisingly delicious), and the stuffed potatoes. Make sure you ask for one of their imported Cuban beverages!"}
{"text":"I had some leftover pork loin from New Years Eve and decided to get real Cuban bread to make a Cuban Sandwich at home.  I ran over to Edwards and got a couple of excellent loaves of bread that made awesome sandwiches.  While there, I also picked up a coconut turnover (can't remember the actual name) but it was great.  Incredibly flakey pastry with a delicious filling.

Very friendly people."}
{"text":"This is a new Cuban Cafe in the valley. Run by cubans. The croquetas were amazing. The tamale was really good. They have basics, Cuban sandwiches and pizza cuban style. Yummy traditional desserts. Try it out. Super casual, no table service. Order at the counter, eat at one of the high tops. Enjoy! Your fellow cuban stuck in Phoenix!"}
