{"text":"I love the food, and Americanized Chinese food is a favorite of mine, specifically Lo-Mein and I am very picky, and theirs is wonderful. We love to order from here, it's quick, easy and high quality. They chicken and beef are both clearly a decent quality meat, and so far everything we have had has been wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write many reviews, but the service here is amazing. They're always prompt and extremely nice. I think I've come here so often that they recognize me now.  Their food and prices are hard to beat when it comes to Chinese take-out. The Mongolian Beef usually serves me well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My daughter is picky when it comes l her lo mein hands down one of mine and hers fave! Clean and staff always friendly. They know me as soon as I order!"}
{"text":"we've been regulars since they opened. never disappointed. they know our order when we walk in, and are always super sweet to us and our son. they've watched him grow since I was pregnant, and I live that they always send a little treat for him (cookies)"}
{"text":"This place is the ONLY Chinese place I will go in the area. Great quality food, great service, the three people that are always working are so friendly. We come so often that they recognize us. Recently, my mom got a gift of really nice Chinese tea, but we couldn't read the package, so we took it in to ask them what it said and they were so helpful in translating. Best Chinese food in the area- hands down!"}
{"text":"Regular carry-on customer here.  Have ordered many different menu items and have never been disappointed. I like that they will customize my order when I ask."}
{"text":"NICE PLACE  We had a lovely dinner here and the servers/owners were very pleasant. The decor is stark, to say the least, and the food was good, but not great.  Our best dish was the Curry Shrimp (#92) which was very good. The General Tso's Chicken (#S10) was merely okay.  This is a nice little take-out joint, although we happened to eat in.  Food - 3 STARS Location - 3 STARS Ambiance/Decor - 2 STARS Value - 4 STARS Service - 5 STARS"}
{"text":"They would get 5 stars from me but they discontinued their lunch buffet. It was good and fresh and always busy."}
{"text":"Okay, so the second time I order GT from GG, it was not as good.  As in, \"won't be back for a while\" bad.  However, decided to try some other menu items recently, and it paid off.  Crab Rangoon is a little devoid of filling, but decent overall.  Hot & sour soup was pretty good, and the Kung Po Chicken was one of the better KPC's I've had in a long time.  Only complaint was that it was a tad bit greasy, but the mix of ingredients was too my linking.  Everyone else seemed happy with what they got, so we'll be giving GG another try when we're in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a total hidden gem in Elyria. You wouldn't think much of the place when you first walk in but, the food is very good!  The Kung Pao chicken was tasty & spicy. They used all white meat which is a huge plus. The fried rice was really good as well as was the veggie egg rolls. I also ordered the fried donuts which you can never go wrong with that.  The service was good & fast. The young lady working there was really friendly. I like the fact you get a freebie (2 liter of pop) if your order is over $25 & if your order is over $30, you get a free order of general chicken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and they've never disappointed me! My husband loves their General Tso's Chicken, and I've enjoyed both their Sweet and Sour Chicken and Cashew Chicken. Wonton Soup was really good too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Golden Ginger is now my go too Chinese food place. The service is fantastic and the food is top notch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here about twice a month. The service is prompt and the food is very reasonably priced, and never disappoints. It's also conveniently located next to a family video so we typically rent movies and have a date night in!"}
{"text":"I choose to pick up lunch here after reading all the rave reviews for this place and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. I was really excited for the orange chicken, and steamed dumplings I ordered. I thought fifteen bucks was a little pricy but if it's good Chinese then who cares! Sadly this was not good chinese.  The chicken was extremely dry, to the point of being hard to chew, and the sauce was awful. It didn't have any orange flavor, instead it tasted salty.  The dumplings were OK, but we're extremely doughy, and bland. Finally the fried rice that came with my meal (it was an extra $1.15 to get fried rice instead of steamed) was not fried rice. It was white rice with soy sauce poured over it. The only thing that was good about this meal was the dipping sauce that came with the dumplings. Save your money and go else where."}
{"text":"Standard \"(fill in the blank) Wok\" food.  All the American favorites.  They have no authentic Chinese menu selections, but they had a Maifun (rice noodle) dish that they were able to customize for me.  If you like the American Chinese standards (Moo Goo Gai Pan, General Tso's Chicken, etc), I think this place would be great.  The ingredients were fresh and freshly prepared, and my noodle dish came out delicious.  Just be prepared: none of the staff speaks English."}
{"text":"I wish I was an actual writer so I knew which words to use to explain to you how absolutely phenomenal Golden Ginger is. I legitimately cannot eat Chinese food anywhere else now. Once you get accustomed to eating Golden Ginger every other place tastes like runny dog food with rice.      First of all they are faaaaaast. I order when I'm already on my way there to pick it up. They tell you 10-15 minutes but a 2 person order is usually ready in 7. They've never in 5 years gotten my order wrong, and the two ladies that work up front are super nice.      The place is really clean and you can see the entire kitchen. For a restaurant in Elyria that's a huge achievement.     The food is EXCELLENT. I've eaten quite a few things off of their menu and have yet to be disappointed. I usually get the General Tso's chicken. It's rich, sweet, and spicy on top of their fried rice that is moist and has a smoky aftertaste.      Most importantly the prices are perfect. Unless you go crazy you're not going to spend over $10 per person.      If you are craving Chinese food and are a broke Elyrian, such as myself, Golden Ginger is the only place you want to be."}
