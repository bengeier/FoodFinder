{"text":"Cheap, convenient, local. I don't mean local in terms of locally sourced - if you're of the Chemex-and-tofu set you'll hate this place. But this is an old-school Pittsburgh establishment, and the prices feel straight out of 1990. I come here for lunch about once a week. The hot dogs and kielbasa are amazing and a meal won't set you back more than $5. As long as you don't mind reminding the cashiers that you got a drink or that you ordered kraut on your dog, this is a wonderful place to grab a bite, and a really great way to experience the North Side."}
{"text":"This place is great, I didn't know a hot dog could be so good. The beef hot dog was bangin', the chili sauce was bangin', the fries were bangin', the prices were bangin'. Their only flaw is they get a little flustered when busy. 4/5, would eat there again."}
{"text":"A nostalgic treat. You especially should try their chilli dog, the best in the city.   This place is definitely old school, and the prices are reasonable.   Featured in Rick Sebak's 2013 Documentary, North Side Sandwiches (under the name of Steve's New York Hot Dog Shop) the restaurant has a new owner and name, but still delivers a classic hot dog."}
{"text":"It's hot dogs, french fries and soda. They do one thing and they do it well. Hot dogs come in two kinds: pork and beef."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Had a pork and beef hot dog with everything. Had some fries as well. Pork hot dog was great. I preferred it over the beef one. Friendly service from the guys behind the counter. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Probably the best dogs in the city. Absolutely fantastic yinzer experience every time I go. Right by PNC Park grab a dog before a game this summer."}
{"text":"What a great find ! The service is very friendly with hard working and caring folks. They checked on me twice for a drink refill and if I needed anything else for my hot dogs. The Food quality, portion size and price is great. Ordered 2 pork dogs, fries and a drink for $5. Love watching the skills of the cooks making food in front of you. I will definitely be back, Try this place for step back in time, with great Pittsburgh City style and service."}
{"text":"the food is awesome.  its just way faster to slaughter your own pig, rise your own yeast and wait for your own potatoes to grow.  i would love to eat here again, its just faster to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are ok if made right.  Was in there today and service and dogs sucked.  This place can't compare to Steves Hot Dogs......those two Greek sisters who owned it before had the best service and dogs.   Too bad Nana's couldn't take after them.  I've been to Nana's several times always to find the same slow service.   I'm done...no more going to this place."}
{"text":"Very good chili cheese dogs and fries. Very friendly people. Lovely owner. Gives little hugs to the kids and chocolate kissrs"}
{"text":"We play softball up at Fineview and stumbled upon this place needing a snack between games. $2.75 gets you a giant, amazing, greasy bacon egg and cheese sandwhich. We came back between games a few weeks later, after talking it up to the team, and planning on ordering for them, but we missed breakfast! They graciously offered to still make the sandwiches for us! Thanks Nana's :) We'll be back!"}
