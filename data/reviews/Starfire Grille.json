{"text":"On separate days, my wife & I visited the Starfire Grille (we're non-golfers).  She had a French Dip sandwich & I had the AYCE beer-battered cod.  
We were pleasantly surprised & satisfied by not only the quality, quantity, & pricing of our choices, but we also found the outdoor seating to be scenic & comfortable given the venue.
We're planning for Sunday Brunch next...stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly great and our server Tom just couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Great bargain and everyone commented that the food flavor was amazing. A great find. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Scottsdale!  Food is really good and reasonable!  The service is the best!  Daily specials except in summer, and good fish & chips on Friday.  They have limited breakfast in the mornings for the golfers, but on Sunday they have a really nice brunch  It's small but enough choices for most people.  Omelette station, eggs benedict, pancakes, huge sticky buns , fresh fruit and lots of other choices.  For $14.99 including beverage it's a winner!!  When the weather is nice the outdoor patio is the best place to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"The food and service at this restaurant are amazing! The food is always hot, so tasty! They really do a wonderful job here... The chef is so good! We have turned friends on to this restaurant who do not golf. Yes this is a golf course however the restaurant can stand alone. Keep up the good work chef Andy!"}
{"text":"A \"STAR\" is born, and is on \"FIRE\".  Seven of us went for the Friday night 'Happy Hour\".
Fast, friendly, effective service.  AND NOW for the WOW!  Rave reviews for the 'CHEF'.  
Everything each ordered was spectacular.  The walleye fish fry, the veggies & hummus, the chicken wings, the polenta fingers, the quesadilla, and so on.  Plus, they take good care of the taps, because the beer was bubbly and fresh tasting.  As much as my years of experience has made \"FLO'S\" number 1 for myself, in all honesty, the STARFIRE grille is a heavy competitor.  They have earned a repeat performance."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and friendly staff. Some of the best food I've had since moving to Arizona last year. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Love the setting. Beautiful views of the course. I enjoyed the omelet bar. Made to order. Very good. Pancakes were fluffy but just okay. Potatoes were okay. Service was excellent. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. Coffee was fine. Might consider returning."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not thrilled with the decor. It is in a golf club resort but it is open to the public. We had the beet and goat cheese salad which was good. I wood opt not to have the chicken with it."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant right up the street from my house. Right on the golf course so you get beautiful views from the restaurant. Food is very good, made with care and very reasonably priced. Friendly attentive staff that is there to serve and help you out with everything. They have a great Happy Hour M-F from 3 to 7 and daily food and drink specials every day of the week. Plus a Sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas on Sunday. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood."}
