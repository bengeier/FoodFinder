{"text":"I've been at this restaurant a few times and have tried most of the menu.  The food is consistently superb.  I'm very particular about my Jamaican food and this is definitely IRIE!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mainsha at Dufferin, I especially love their $3 chicken combo and $2 on Tuesdays. This place used to be a Mainshas from what I've been told so I went there one day to try it out with utter anticipation (since it's practically in my neighbourhood as opposed to driving to Dufferin).  Let's skip the decor and atmosphere because we all know and expect it to be lacking with these kind of places. I'm all about the deals and good comfort food when it comes to Jamaican cuisine. The special of the day was fried chicken so I ordered a small. Not only was the portions smaller than Mainsha, but the chicken was pretty much burnt, the rice and peas (yes it's called peas...) was mushy (worst kind) and the chicken tasted like it was fried in 6 month old oil. I felt sick after eating this small portion that I went across the street to buy a shawarma from Shawarma Empire to erase any unwanted tastes lingering in my mouth.   Why 1 star? I ordered the special of the day and a small (to be exact) which should have cost me about $4. My bill upon leaving -- $6 something. My fault for not brining it up to the owner, but how hard is it to remember the price difference between a small and a large? I am not a complete food snob though, I will give this place another try (and hopefully a better review) and maybe order more authentic Jamaican fare. We'll see..."}
{"text":"Authentic Jamaican food. Mainly take out.  I have had the jerk chicken, curry goat, curry chicken, oxtail and the red pea soup. All were amazing! I was also surprised by the low prices and big portions when you order a large.  If I had to describe the place in 2 words it would be \"comfort food\".  I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"I've only had the Jerk Chicken special (which is discounted on Mondays and Saturdays), but it is plenty good. Every time I have it, it comes out great. I've been to other places where the same dish has been good at times and bad at times, but Tenny's has been consistent to-date.  The jerk seasoning is well balanced and produces a wonderful aroma and taste. The meat below is appropriately juicy. Overall, it is a great use of ingredients that are spicy, but not too much.  The rice (with beans) that the chicken sits on is pretty good. They pour a healthy serving of some spicy broth onto both the rice and chicken (most of it soaks into the rice) and that just adds to the greatness.  The portion is quite a lot if you order the large, and I'm a fan of a filling meal. It also works great split up into two meals.  In terms of cons: we have never wanted to dine in because it looks fairly uninviting. Very few seats and tables with furniture that looks second-hand, and while the gentleman there is nice, he is always watching horse racing. Literally every time, it is all he watches... so yeah, we've always ordered it to go.  Also, it has only been a year, but the price of the specials have gone up twice in that time. I know what inflation is, but this is rising far beyond the CPI. EDIT: August 2012, make that 3 price increases in only like 14 months.  I'd recommend going there, but note that it's just based on one dish. I'll amend my review if I try other things. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a shot as it was my local Caribbean joint, but boy was I disappointed.  This place is a hole in the wall, as in a DOT.  It's a small place tucked away in a little neighbourhood strip mall.   Service was  quick and the food was in front of my face before I could even order.  I had the Jerk Chicken special (which is discounted on Mondays and Saturdays), but it is plenty good. Every time I have it, there was one measly piece of jerk chicken left.   Expect to feel like you are in a Rum Shop, gambling and sports blaring on a black and white television in the center of the eating area.  Parking is limited to about 10 spots, but the mini-strip/plaza is rarely busy."}
{"text":"Great place, Awesome Food!  The Ackee and Saltfish is the BEST at this place.  Even the other dishes here are really good.  Lots of tasty food for lickle price. Best combination for me.  My fave spot for West Indian Cuisine in Scarborough"}
{"text":"What a deal! Everyday there is a special at Tenny's Jamaican Restaurant!  Monday - Jerk Chicken Tuesday - Fried Chicken Wednesday - BBQ Chicken Thursday - Stew Chicken Friday - Fried Chicken Saturday - Jerk Chicken   Small ($3.33) / Large ($5.75)  The nice old gentleman was so kind, packed my large order Jerk Chicken with Rice and Beans ($5.75) with so much rice, Dark Meat Chicken and Cole Slaw....  Chicken was rubbed with Jerk spices but the spices was more on the sweet side. Chicken was tender and meaty and the skin so tasty....   The portion was so generous! I have leftover for another meal, one of the few rare times I look forward in eating leftovers!"}
