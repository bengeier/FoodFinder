{"text":"Each dish we ordered was the best we'd ever eaten. Amazing food. Great little place. Our new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I went their today and I ordered Alfredo sauce with penne and mushrooms.The taste was so bland. The appearance looked as if I didn't have any flavor to it at all. The mushrooms tasted sweet, like they just dumped it on top of the Alfredo sauce and let the heat cook it. I couldn't even eat it.They didn't even have garlic bread wasted 30 dollars on a dish that was never worth it. How did they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"The hot bread and dip were really good. Other than that nothing else had flavor or tasted very good. We were looking for a place to have dinner and this was one of the only places open so it really was a miss for us."}
{"text":"Italian, hardly. Tomatoes and cashews in a chiffinade of romaine lettuce, store bought ceasear dressing salad for appetizer, dinner was slab of burnt, frozen patty veal parm with store bought diner sauce, the wife had frozen ravioli with tons of bay scallops and store bought sauce.  If you got drunk at the bar it might taste good. Sit away from the loud piano."}
{"text":"Wow, what a delicious meal! I was a bit skeptical at first, but we were greeted by Rachel who was very friendly. I asked if she had any suggestions and she recommended Pollo's Pasta and Blanco's Vodka Cream Sauce. We ordered one of each along with an order of the wings. An order of hot bread was delivered right away with a great red pepper dipping sauce. The wings were unlike any other. It was a bbq based sauce, but indescribably unique. Our entrees were also excellent. I would prefer to write in greater detail, but am a bit rushed. Go here, try it. A little more expensive than Olive Garden, but twice as good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to eat at this restaurant after reading the reviews. We ordered our food he got a Caesar salad which had cashews??? no big deal. We got the bread which was pretty good and then a cockroach crawled put of the bread on our table. We cancelled our order and got out of there. Won't be back."}
{"text":"On each of our vacations, my wife and I spend one evening at an Italian restaurant for a \"romantic\" meal, and so far we have had good luck.
Today we had probably the best Italian food so far. I had Lobster Ravioli. It was covered in Vodka cream sauce, with several small scallops, and a jumbo shrimp. The sauce was done perfectly. The raviolis were aldente, just the way I like it.
My wife had Chicken Parmesean with linguini. She said it was one of the best she's had. 
The portion size of the Lobster ravioli was just right. I am a large man, and I was full at the end of the meal. The size of the Chicken Parmesean was also large, my wife brought home half.
Service was very good, and quite friendly. Next time we are in Glendale, we will return."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service. Wine selection is very diverse. Great place to hang out and meet people or go out in a date with.  One word to describe the bread sauce: unique. You simply will not find this complex taste anywhere else. Finally, the chef is super personable; I simply have yet to hold such a good conversation with a restaurant chef/owner."}
{"text":"I enjoy occasionally trying out lesser known, lesser reviewed eateries and based on the last review, I expected some decent pizza. I would have even settled for edible.

First of all, the place was deserted during lunch hour. Secondly, one slice of their 13\" pizza has to contain the recommended sodium intake for an adult human for a week. I'm unaware of current FDA guidelines about grease intake, but however high they are, Polo's surely comes out ahead. Their crust is so tasteless that it's just a waste to (at least claim to) use a wood-fire oven. Miraculously, the pizza somehow survives the firing process without the signature dough bubbles and uneven char that you receive from a wood-fired pie. Sauce tasted canned, but at least they added a fistful of salt to it in order to mask some of the cannedness.

You can see the cheese, but the flavors of salt and grease overwhelm the flavor of the cheese. It becomes more of a textural thing, I suppose.

Salt + canned tomato sauce + grease + salt + somehow defying the laws of pizza physics + salt + grease + salt + grease + salt = No, thank you."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was fabulous. Server was friendly and very attentive. I had the chicken saltimbuca and it was pretty good. The chicken breast was a tad overcooked, but not terribly so. The penne pasta was a perfect al dente and the sauce was quite flavorful. The bread was nice and hot. The cannoli was also very good. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food!   The chef penne special (I forgot the name) with goat cheese and carmelized onions WAS AMAZING!!!    Surprisingly, pizza was okay.  Definately worth a try."}
{"text":"I am offended as both an Italian (from New York!) and as a customer that this restaurant exists. 

I should have seen the red flags fly when the restaurant had only one table and the football game on the TV on a Saturday night. Foolish me. 

It started out decent enough, although for an empty restaurant the service was painfully slow. Should it really take 10 minutes to bring 2 glasses of wine? The bread and red pepper dipping sauce was fine enough, not amazing but it was tasty. We lorded the eggplant rollatini for an appetizer. They should really note how excessively large their portions are. Our appetizer could have easily been dinner for two, and no, that is not a selling point. It was lukewarm, but again, tasty enough. The marinara was basically crushed tomatoes saturated in garlic salt with some basil thrown in. My grandmother is rolling in her grave as I write this, I'm sure.

Then came the worst part - the entrees. Two heaping bowls of sauce came out. Somewhere in there was my chicken and shrimp carbonara and my boyfriend's lobster ravioli. There had to have been at least 4 cups of store-bought sauce in each bowl. Within a few bites, the sauce had already started separating - how appetizing! The chicken in my carbonara was clearly frozen grilled chicken strips (perhaps Tyson?) that had an unpleasant after taste. The shrimp was slightly undercooked and still had their tails on. Normally, this would be fine, but when there is so much sauce to navigate through, grabbing onto a tail is not ideal. The peas were extremely over cooked and mushy. Somewhere was my bacon but that was too coated in sauce to find. My boyfriend's lobster ravioli was also overwhelmed with sauce. The dish also came with shrimp and scallops but again, the over abundance of sauce made differentiating between the two impossible. 

To make the scene all the more sad, there was a man playing piano who for some reason decided to use the microphone to say he was going on a break. That would have been fine, however we were the only customers in the room at that point and only made the situation awkward.

I'm convinced the only reason their portions are so large is so they can charge $12+ for an entree without feeling guilty. $50 down the drain - I couldn't even stand the smell of the leftovers and promptly threw them away upon returning home.

To salvage what was left of our evening, we were forced to go to the grocery store and buy some Ben & Jerry's and beer - Two things we know we're getting our money's worth for.

Word to the wise, stay away!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way home from the Glendale Glitter and Glow Block Party.  It was 9:00 and there were about 12-15 other people there (one large group and one smaller group).  The large group seemed to be a group of \"regulars\" so we thought that was a really good sign!

The bread with the red pimiento dipping sauce was good - my husband loved the dip and we quickly needed a second dip.  We started by sharing  the hot antipasti special.  The eggplant rolatini and the stuffed mushrooms were very good.

For a main course, my husband had the South Beach pizza which had mozzarella, goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach, peppers.  I wasn't in the mood for pizza or salad, and the entree menu is not that extensive.  I decided the chicken & shrimp carbonara pasta as I liked the sound of the ingredients but didn't really want a cream sauce.  The chef instead used all the same ingredients but cooked it in olive oil and garlic.  There was a lot of garlic, but it was very good.

As the other two reviewers said, the portion sizes are very large and we both brought home left-overs. 

The waitresses were very nice and friendly and even thanked us by name (from the credit card) when we left.

Overall, I thought the food was good value and would definitely stop in here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  The bread is awesome.  I order the Polo's Pasta over and over again because it is SO good.  When I want to try something new I just taste a bite of my husband's order because I know I will be disappointed if I don't order the Polo's Pasta (best I've ever had).  When I find a good thing, I like to stick with it.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The waitress was a bit short with all of us.  After awhile she seemed to lighten up.   The food was pretty good for the price.  I had the classic margerita pizza and thought it good.  It is a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant, small but cute. Food is always good from sandwiches to pizzas! Great place for drinks & food! It's a must try if ur in Glendale or near by.. stop by and try it for yourself soon! And the whole strip mall has been remodeled and looks great!"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night around 7 on a Glendale Glitters evening and was surprised there was not a wait. We were sat immediately. The place was smaller than I expected but we got a table in the back and were pleased to not feel crowded. I enjoyed the ambiance, the lighting was dim and there was a man playing piano in the front of the room. I always enjoy some live music, and the pianist was talented and was perfect background music for the evening. We ordered the eggplant for an appetizer, and my boyfriend L tried out the tequila coffee. It was an interesting mix but he enjoyed it. The eggplant was delicious, I couldn't get enough. There was also bread served that was fresh out of the oven and soft. For dinner I ordered the chicken parmesan and L got the pesto. He polished his plate off but I was somewhat disappointed. My plate lacked the flavor and taste I was hoping for, it just seemed somewhat bland. It was good but not great. The service was excellent, we never had empty glasses or empty bread baskets. Overall a very good experience. I would definitely go again just for the eggplant itself!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I was not going to this place sooner than when I finally did. The owner and staff are so nice and work hard at making you happy and to feel welcome. I also have a wine group and we have held several events here. They come through every time we are there. The food is very good and makes you feel warm and comfortable, and the wines were all good. We will definitely be back for more events in the future!! This is a great place for a dinner for two or with a large group...go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very cool. Decent food at a reasonable price. Very friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. Chef was a little heavy on the salt, but a pleasant experience none the less. Food didn't seem to be microwaved. There was a live piano and a candle lit table. It turned out to be pretty romantic. I was expecting children running around. It is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Very sad to see this place has closed. My nephew and I had gone in the other day, not realizing it had changed owners. Unfortunately, without Chef Polo, Dolce Vino  is like any other , run of the mill Italian take out. Nothing distinctly unique about it. The quality of food was poor and prices were high. We ordered a pizza and caprese plate. Both were tasteless. I wish the new owners the best of luck but I am on a mission to find where Chef Polo went!"}
{"text":"i love the caesar chicken salad, i can not get enough of it!!

great place, live music, good prices
what else can you ask for ina restaurant?

love it!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The bread dip is awesome. The old lady singing along side a piano player was a bit much."}
{"text":"I was just there for lunch on 7/18/14...NOT CLOSED!
The food was DELICIOUS!!  I ordered a sandwich for lunch and my friend ordered a pizza.  Both came with a side salad we cleaned our plates!  We were driving by looking for a spot to eat and this was a totally random choice.  I am from the east coast and have a hard time finding good Italian...this was a very nice surprise!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We started our dinner with an amazing Ceasar Salad. It was super fresh ,had cashews instead of croutons and fresh sliced tomatoes. Definitely the best I had ever have. Sliced warmed bread comes with a delicious creamy roasted bell pepper dip.  I had the Polos Pasta, which was very good.  My wifey had the Chicken Parmesan.  She said it was ok.  Chicken was nicely breaded and juicy but she disliked that pasta sauce was a bit too sweet for her taste. I gave it four stars because:for me the tables are a bit short for the average person and totally dislike the cheap grated parmesan cheese.  I know its a small place in a not very good neighborhood but prices are not that cheap to at least not offer fresh cheese. Made me doubt a bit about the freshness of the rest of my meal.   
Must add that staff is very friendly and attentive, and the live piano music just adds a lovely romantic touch to the moment."}
{"text":"This is one of those places for dining on good Italian-American comfort food in a relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant itself is in a not-too-attractive strip mall, but here my friend and fellow yelper John M. and I had a very pleasant dining experience. Friendly service, good food, good prices. Definitely not a busy place when we were there, but it certainly deserves a larger clientele."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  Restaurant inside was nice and clean, outside you need to overlook altogether.  Inside this place was a ghostown.  Being over 105 degrees out I was wearing shorts and flip flops.  As soon as I walked in I noticed they were going for a more upscale look to the place and my attire was looked up and down by our waitress before being seated.  Sorry, by the looks of the outside had no clue on a Saturday afternoon in a strip mall with no one else in the place I would have an issue with shorts.  Anyways pass that awkward moment, we were seated.  I had chosen the sausage hot sandwich on the lunch menu, and my husband the blanco pizza.  Nothing was suggested by our waitress, so I was hoping that was a good choice.  Food came out pretty fast because there was no one else in the place.  Food was bland, bread was to chewy like it needed to be baked more. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"OK here is the real poop. The food is ALL frozen even the shellfish. Ask your waitress. Don't guess and say it is fresh when it is not. They do try to give you some taste but not very successfully. The mozzarella cheese was gritty, the calamari was not too tough but they gave some weird sauce, probably dried tomatoes and some ranch salad dressing.

The main courses are all over or around some pasta. You cannon get a non-pasta dish. We had the very sad looking and tasting wild mushroom lasagna roll  I asked if there was anything not frozen and was recommended the sausage and pepper over pasta. I got that. The sausage was a nice supermarket variety, the peppers totally overcooked and the sauce tasted straight out of the can.
The Saturday night music was nice. I would only go back for the Thursday night jazz fest. and order a drink. Oh and with a 24 dollar wine I spent 104 dollars incl tip. that was a joke!"}
{"text":"Came here for some Italian fixed and we were not disappointed. I ordered the Fried Calamari and they were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside but soft inside. Next I had the Polo's Pasta. I love all the sauteed veggies in this dish, made me feel so hearty. My hubby ordered the Lobster Ravioli and they were delicious too! We finished our meal with the Mango Mousse Cake. They were Oh awesome and mango-licious.

I was reading some previous reviews and they mentioned about frozen seafood. Come on you live in AZ! What do you expect? 

Come try this place and we will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a crappy little strip mall in the sad part of Glendale Avenue. I stopped in one day around 3 years ago to discover it is a hidden gem.

The food is always exceptional. Fresh baked bread comes with every meal, along with a creamy roasted red pepper dip.

I've had both the pizza and entrees. Never been disappointed.

They have a full bar and a good wine list. I've never been there on a weekend, but hear it gets very lively. It's a family place so it just good, clean fun, with live piano and the audience joining in the singing when they know the words.

The only time it was too packed to get in without a reservation was Valentine's Day.

LOVE the wait staff!

Great food and service, and reasonable prices add up to a good outing for me."}
{"text":"Now called Polo's. It's quite a nice surprise in the neighborhood. Very unassuming. But inside they really pull off a good Italian cafe. The really nice touch is Mr Maynes playing some excellent piano on a nice little grand piano.
  The food is quite a treat. It's hard to imagine a trained chef in this location, but there you go. He has a unique twist at mixing flavors you wouldn't expect. The salciccia is a great showcase for Italian sausage, and the lasagna is uniquely excellent. And don't forget the cannolis.
  I come back regularly."}
{"text":"Ik first learned about this restaurant through groupon and wrote a review.  I've since been back, each time with guests.  Last night we went again. I can say without hesitation that this restaurant is just excellent.  The food is always good.  My wife and I cannot get away from ordering the vodka pasta and the blanco pizza which are a trip to heaven. We did however, once have the Greek Salad.  It was wonderful.  So fresh and good! The piano music which is on Wed., Thurs., Fri., and Sat. are crowning touches.  The waitresses are marvelous.  Rachael is supreme.
As I said, we've been here several times.  Each time with friends and all have really enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here for dinner 3 times over the past 18 months.  He comes to lunch here all the time.  We would come more often but we live in New River.  I would give this restaurant 5 stars but it is in such a worn out strip mall, unfortunately the mood is set BEFORE you come in.  However, once in the door, it is a wonderful, intimate place to eat for a very reasonable price.  The staff is efficient, knowlegeable and friendly.  When we came on the weekend  we were able to enjoy the pianist, Robin Maynes.  So nice to have a personalized element to this little gem.  The food really is exceptional and we highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Great dinner.  We will be back!    3 of us.  one had lasagna and 2 had the vodka cream sauce.   Tough choice.  Both were outstanding   We split a caesar salad that was also great."}
{"text":"The Polo Pasta was very good, the lasagna was lacking something."}
{"text":"This little restaurant has recently changed its name to NOSTALGI'A CANCIONE E VINO.  The interiors have been nicely upgraded with wood chairs, pleasant table decor and a very nice bar area.  Chef/owner and menus are the same.   A very nice wine list.

I've eaten at this little place at least 5 times with family and friends for lunch and dinner.  Every time my guests have been very impressed with the quality of the food, including a couple of my Italian-born foodie friends.  I particularly enjoy the 7\" personal pizzas offered on the lunch menu with the large green salad (choice of dressings).   The California Dream with mozarella, sweet Italian sausage and carmelized onions is my favorite.  I've had Italian food in many of the more spendy restaurants in the Valley as well as in many small and large cities in Italy.  IMHO, this little place can be proud of the quality and taste of its food offerings."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with some contradictions that fails when it comes to the cuisine. First the restaurant is intimate and tastefully decorated if you ignore the vinyl tablecloths and doilies. That's where the contradiction comes in...cuisine that is supposed to be higher end but there are vinyl red & white checked tablecloths and vinyl doilies on the tables, paper napkins, and bread served in a plastic basket. That should have been a give away that the food would be very under par. The food seemed either packaged or very low quality, or both. The saving grace for this restaurant was the wine, bread, and live piano music. Opt for some other Italian restaurant, even a chain."}
{"text":"If you want Italian and you live in Glendale, this is your best bet.  The only thing I've had to eat here is the lobster ravioli and it's just so good that I can't stray and try anything else.  I wish I could eat here weekly but my waistline wouldn't agree.  They make this awesome butter to go along with the bread, it's so yum.  You should check this place out, trust me."}
{"text":"Polo's is in a strip mall across from the infamous Pedro's Mexican food. There were an increasing number of cars rolling up as I got there so I knew it would be good. 

The interior is sparse and lackluster, sort of a banquet hall feel for some reason. It was clean but missed the charm some how. 

The staff was very nice and helpful, they appeared to be short a person or not prepared for the large crowd. 

I scanned every ones plates while walking to the bar and saw a nice mix match of entrees. Pizza, pasta, salads, hoagies etc. It all looked good. 

I choose the 7 inch Margherita and a salad with blue cheese. The pizza is a wood fires thin crust cooked to perfection. Topped with mozz and basil. The sauce was a tomato based but has decent flavor. It was a little salty but I liked it. The cheese was a little thin in places but it worked, the basil was haphazardly tossed to one slice of the 7 inch pizza but meh it is only basil. The pizza was good but not as good as Pizza A Metros. I hated to compare but I did. 

The salad was large for a side, with romaine, mushrooms, red pepper and tomato's The dressing was blue cheese but not a thick type it was a thin coating of a nice flavored dressing. 

The bottles sprite I had was flat, odd but still was OK. 

I would go back if in the area but there were also several other little places in the strip mall to check out first."}
{"text":"This may become my new favorite spot. Nice wine list, live music, great staff and the food is amazing! The bar looks pretty good too. Def coming back for more many times to come. The seating is great, the lighting is nice not too soft not too bright. My hostess was a hoot! Portions are great as well."}
{"text":"We now have a favorite Italian place in the West Valley. We happened to be here when they had a party of 30 for a Chamber of Commerce banquet (or something similar), but we got a table near the back and everyone was in a great mood. Great, friendly staff and beautiful restaurant.

Some unique pasta dishes here that you don't see everyday. I had chicken with tomatoes and pasta, but really I could have filled up on the bread without any trouble at all. What I couldn't finish of the pasta made great leftovers though. This was very down-home type Italian food, but done well and with great flavor. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have returned and found it as good or better than the first time.  Arrived for a moderately late Sunday lunch at 1:30-2pm. Service by \"Fred\", aka Fredrika, was attentive without being intrusive, professional and knowledgeable as to entire menu.  Glasses of tea and water never had chance to get empty, and the food was fantastic.  We ordered off the dinner menu for a couple of items that weren't on the lunch menu - no problem.  Started with the caprese appetizer which as advised by Fredrika, was more enough to provide a generous salad for 3 or 4, a huge plate of fresh mozzarella slices, greens, basic, and slices of tomato so good that I had to ask where the tomatoes came from as they did not taste like a grocery tomato - and they weren't as they were home grown by chef or staff. Not always home grown she said - but currently yes, and they certainly tasted it.  Next, I had the wild mushroom lasagna rolls and my friend the \"Polo's Pasta\".  The 4 lasagna rolls were massive, rich, delicious, and just oozing ricotta, spinach, white & Portobello mushrooms, complimented nicely by the rich  vodka cream sauce and melted mozzarella.  I also sampled my friend's dish which I think is my new favorite, Polo's Pasta: Sautéed spinach, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, Portobello mushrooms, goat cheese in a garlic and olive oil sauce with sweet Italian sausage, that has me very close to moving this to a \"5 Star\" review - and that  before the wonderful dessert which we took home to sample many hours later. The portions were as large as noted in all reviews leaving us with enough for an additional generous meal apiece. And then there was the dessert, courtesy of a Cordon Bleu student serving an externship at the restaurant, an excellent, moist, rich chocolate-chocolate cream, chocolate frosted cake drizzled with what I think was a raspberry sauce, artfully served even in the take-out box.  It too was excellent. My compliments to the student chef. After 2 visits and 2 exceptional food experiences, I can only conclude the over-the-top (or would that be more like \"rock-bottom\"?) review who claimed everything was frozen, nothing homemade, etc., etc., etc., had an agenda.  If this was frozen  - take me to your freezer."}
{"text":"We went for a family dinner, and everyone really enjoyed the restaurant - I will definitely go back.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The fresh bread came with a very unique and delicious homemade dip.  We split the pear salad - it was amazing.  I ordered the Polo Pasta - mmmmmm - and still have half for lunch tomorrow.  The kids devoured their pizza - crust and all.  Everyone raved about their food.  The only thing I found a little puzzling was - there is clearly a love for creating outstanding food - but the parmesan cheese was the kind in the shakers at the table.  It was decent quality, but I think the food was deserving of fresh grated parm as a finishing touch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good music & awesome service!!  The chicken spinach pizza with goat cheese is AMAZING, as is the fresh, made-from-scratch bread.  The vodka sauce is the best I've ever tasted.  All of the sauces are made from scratch - I asked. The waitstaff are friendly & offer great wine pairing suggestions.  Authentic & delicious.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"OPEN FOR BUSINESS!

Contrary to the headline, Polo's Italian Cuisine is VERY much open for business!  I was there on Friday, July 25, 2014 and the food and atmosphere were both top end!  The pianist was very good and friendly and was able to satisfy a wide range of musical requests .  The recently remodeled exterior of the complex is very nice and there is plenty of free parking. I great little known gem!"}
{"text":"I would normally give this type of restaurants 3-4-stars, but I was here on a Wed night when they have live music, which made my dining experience worth 4.5-stars!  Their food is pretty good and service is above average.  It is an authentic Italian restaurant with items you can expect and intimate atmosphere, a place to share a bottle of wine with someone and enjoy a good meal, but it is not a white table top type of place.  I would recommend going here on a Wed-Sat night when they have live music (outstanding entertainment), and I would recommend it as a date place on those nights."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love or at least like this place a lot considering I've just moved into the neighborhood.  My tastebuds & I were so excited to try this place after reading the rave reviews.  The place is very charming inside & I can appreciate the live music, however, I wasn't expecting the music to be blaring to the point where it ruined the meal & experience for me.  I think the hostess should let people know that there is I've music, especially mid-week (the entertainment started 10/15 minutes after we were seated) so we were slightly caught off guard.  Our server was lovely, however, the younger-ish (30s)  server lady seem offended that I mentioned the volume for the small number of people in the restaurant.  The volume was set for a packed house. The server responded with \"that's just the volume it always is\".  A second couple was seated next to us & moved less than 5 minutes into their visit. The severs seemed bothered that they moved on their own without being seated. But it was just so loud, so I could totally understand.

Still hoping the pasta carbonara & Alfredo would make up for it we stayed with high hopes.  The shrimp was fresh and very good however the pancetta you could barely taste and the Alfredo was a bit runny. 

Phoenix is really up & coming in w/places like The Parlor, Federal Pizza, and Pizza Heaven (which have really upped the ante in the \"to die for\" quality department.)   I was hoping to find that same atmosphere & deliciousness close to my new home. I'm bummed that my first visit didn't result in a 5 star review."}
{"text":"After my second visit to this fabulous Italian restaurant  I am sold that they are a diamond in the rough. It's not a plaza where you would expect to receive such great food, I would have expected less. But there is hope for the future of the plaza, I learned they are refurbishing the area and It has other great anchor food services.The food is A*, service friendly, and ambiance completely unexpected with a piano and singers 4 nights a week. I would call for  resv. as the popularity is bound to grow and it's a quaint little place, with a full bar if you just want to go to see the entertainers."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately. It is a smaller place with a bar capable of seating 15 or so and about 15 tables. 

I'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing. It provided a nice ambiance.

The menu consists of apps, salads, a few pastas, traditional entrees and pizza. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app and weren't too impressed. They weren't terrible, just nothing special. The entrees were a different story. My husband's mushroom lasagna was to die for.  Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of each ingredient. I had the veal parm and it hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading. Their marinara is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own. The portion was quite generous and was accompanied by spaghetti and marinara. Our only compliant was that they do not offer draft beers and their bottled beer selection was very limited.

While many traditional Italian dishes are not listed on the menu our server informed us that items like marsalas and piccatas are available upon request."}
{"text":"Some of the negative comments here have me confused. The guy who said there was only 1 table must have been smoking crack? Ok.... With that said, I have visited this place about 6 times and have ALWAYS walked away happy! The pizza is better than that place right down the street that was on Diners Drive in & Dives. The home made bread is just a little too good, I always end up eating too much of it and filling up before my main dish. Ignore the few negative comments and just try the place once and I promise you will go back."}
{"text":"Incredible is the only word I can think of.  The bread, dip and antipasta were delicious.  The bread dip, and I am untrained culinary wise, was way too tasty, could have eaten it all night and left satisfied.  The main courses were sooooo good.  Then the pizza.  There is nothing like this pizza.  We had the Italian Stallion pizza and it was heaven.  Took some home, heated it up the next day and it was still better than all other pizzas.  I don't know how the chef does it.  The price was right, better than right.  The service was super, I wish I could recall the young lady's name, but she deserves big time credit also.  We have been back and will go again despite a rather long drive for us.  This is Italian food like its supposed to be."}
{"text":"The service was slow, the food was dry and bland, we were seated for about 5 minutes when they brought out water, then another 5 before our drink orders were taken. They didn't have enough menus for everyone at our table (5 of us). The whole piano bar set-up was cute, but the music was about as \"blah\" as the food. The Caesar salad was very good, but nobody was very impressed with much else. We had the salmon, the mushroom rolled lasagna, greek salad, caesar salad, Ahi and Pinwheel special, and the seafood linguini. Split the check two ways, our half was $60 for two adults, one coke, two waters, caesar salad and two meals, our daughter only had a half salad (tip incl in the 60). A bit pricey for at best, a mediocre meal, and slow service. The bartender who also served our table was very nice, and did keep our glasses refilled which is why I give the second star, but the place just had a snail-pace feel, and we were hungry.

BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART: NO SOAP IN THE MEN'S ROOM. ALL NIGHT! I SURE HOPE THE EMPLOYEES WERE WASHING THEIR HANDS IN THE KITCHEN. At first glance, a cute little old-time, classy-looking joint. On second thought, I will not be returning.
Gordon Ramsay, I think I found your next project."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had since being in Arizona for the past 10 days. Friendly atmosphere and service was great. Chef came out from the kitchen to talk with us. Will come back and visit any day. Great deal for the price!"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious. The food is fresh and tasty! The wine list is good. The service is awesome! The atmosphere is quaint and adorable! I love the decor here too, basically love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Dont let the location fool you.

Do you want excellent, authentic Italian? Come here. The food is great. The prices are even better. 

I'd recommend the Linguini bolognese. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place last night for our friend's birthday dinner. It was great! The bread was fresh and the spread that came with it was addicting. I had the mushroom lasagna and my husband had the vodka cream sauce, we both agreed that we enjoyed mine much more. That's not to say the vodka cream sauce wasn't good, it was decent, but my lasagna was incredible!! The ambiance is nice and intimate, maybe a little too dark and a bit cramped for a large party. Fantastic for a date night, though.

The service was good. Not especially friendly but she kept the drinks filled and divided our checks up without hesitation. That's always appreciated. My husband went up to ask the piano player if the he knew if the trumpet player had a mute (an accessory for the trumpet that give it a brassy sound), and he seemed offended. Apparently the pianist wasn't familiar with this device and thought my husband was saying he wanted the trumpet muted as in to make no noise! Oops. He was also not receptive for my husbands request for some moody jazz music. Oh well, lesson learned that we will leave the piano guy alone. He and his ensemble put on a nice show, though at times the volume was a bit intrusive.

We will be taking family here and plan to return on our own!"}
{"text":"Ask for Rachel. She rocks!  Calamari is ok. Typical inland previously frozen but not chewy. Recommended entrées are the Polo's Pasta and Salciccia Pasta are the Bomb! Live music on Thursday nights. Rachel also know what's going on locally.  Good resource and excellent server!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! All three waitresses are very knowledgable, And friendly. Was very hesitant about visiting this restaurant when I moved to the area because it was in a run down strip mall. However I put my big girl pants o an walked in. I am so glad I did. The food is amazing (I usually go for the chicken saltimbuca), and hands down they offer the best tiramisu on planet earth. However, they don't have tiramisu all the time, only when chef Polo feels like making it. Sometimes he even makes special tiramisu, for example he made pumpkin Tiramisu last Halloween! My family, and I love this place and will go here for years to come!"}
{"text":"Would give 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Everything was authentic to Northern Italy cuisine.  Pasta with seafood, pasta with vegetables, and an entree salad were ordered.  Each had good flavor and seemed fresh.
if you check in using Yelp, there was a free mini-cannoli offer.

Ordered a pizza to go.  They did not have a standard Margherita, so got the Fresco.  Good flavor, but priced too high for the size.  $8.99 for the bare-bones Fresco pizza might be a good \"hook\" to get people into the restaurant.

There was an entertaining piano man playing when we entered (might have been Co-owner).  Nice touch.
If my place, I would extend the red paint, on the lower half of the wall, all the way up.  Thus would provide a warmer atmosphere and remove the stripmall feel.

overall good and worth the money when the piano man is playing...."}
{"text":"We went here for a romantic date night...and loved it. 

The waitress others have written about may appear to be a bit curt with her conversation at first...but after joking around for a minute she opened up and was very personable. Regardless, she refilled our drinks quickly, provided great menu guidance, and I had no complaints.

The food is pretty darn tasty. The bread with pimento dip was stellar! The pear and walnut salad was great. We also had a seafood pasta special and one other dish. 

The clientele when we visited seemed a bit older, and the piano player added to the ambiance of a restaurant of 30 years ago when dining was a bit more of an experience. 

We will be back, for sure!"}
