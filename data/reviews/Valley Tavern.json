{"text":"Well, we tried to go in at the tail end of a Browns game.  This place wreaked of beer and booze.  Wow.  Total locals hangout.  Stools around the bar and maybe one 2-top table.  That is it.  Tight squeeze."}
{"text":"By far the best local bar in the Valley. Great beer, good food, KENO, sports, special events. GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"The place is okay.. I've attempted to go there many, many times but unfortunately I leave rather quickly and usually feel uncomfortable.   It's a small place so when the door opens, everyone stares at you. Then you feel unwelcome if you aren't one of the regulars. Not only by the staff but the other customers as well.   Growing up in the area, I have always wanted to love this place but unfortunately it just has never happened that way."}
{"text":"Awesome place with friendly people and cheap beer!"}
{"text":"Great location.  Off in the cut.  I love places that used to be a house (RIP Tinkies).   Makes me feel like im drinking in the dining room at Aunt Geraldines house.  Cheap beer.  Nice people.  Only reason I drop it stars is all 6-7 times Ive been in there they play the new pop counrtry crap.  Not all people wana listen to pretty, perfectly quaffed singers who dont even know how to write a song.  Play some Slayer and Wu Tang.  Mix it up a bit guys!"}
{"text":"Don't bother stopping in if you aren't a local. The bartender was too busy on her phone to serve us, and it seemed like we were inconveniencing HER just to order 3 bottles beers and shots. When it came time to cash out, I asked for an itemized receipt to which we were told they don't provide. I didn't trust the vibe of the bartender to believe we weren't possible charged an extra drink or 2."}
{"text":"I have been driving past Valley Tavern for years. I always thought it looked very interesting because of the surrounding canal and valley area. The building itself looks historic. It is an old converted home. A classic roadhouse type bar that you may find way out in the country away from the commotion of the city. My friend and I were on the way to Gourmands today and decided that we may as well stop into the Valley Tavern. There is a sign hanging up behind the bar of hand drawn testicles with a dollar sign above them. I asked about it and she replied \"Dollar nuts\". They have mostly domestic beer offerings. The food menu is pretty small and focuses on wings, burgers and other fried things. My friend ordered the wings and fried broccoli, cheddar, bacon bites; all of which were awesome. There were very little reasons to go next door to Quaker Steak prior to my visit to the Valley Tavern. I hope to never go to Quaker Steak again. We discussed how lame corporate places are during lunch. Valley Tavern is the antithesis of corporate. This would be the perfect place to stop after watching a movie at the Cinemark at Valley View to fully digest the movie and discuss."}
