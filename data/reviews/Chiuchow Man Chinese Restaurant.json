{"text":"Delicious regional Chiu Chow food at very reasonable price.  Love their soy sauce duck.  The stir-fried Chinese broccoli with dried fish was excellent - haven't had such crunchy and sweet broccoli for a long time.  The white-cut chicken was just okay but the hot pig's stomach, sour vegetables, pepper soup was very good with big chunks of stomach and veggie.  

It's a small diner - would be cramped for a large group.  But small group dinners would be okay.  The menu is very reasonably priced - would be hard put to find something like this in Toronto for the price."}
{"text":"This place is a Gem!! The staff is supper friendly, the owners make us feel like family and to top it all up the food is excellent. You must see this place for yourself. This is the place our kids beg us to go to!!!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time and had an awful experience. Would NOT RECOMMEND this place. They do not understand customer service. Not only did they try to keep change to our bill (which was about half of our total), they lied about the amount of cash we gave them when we confronted them! This is probably why they only accept cash. DISGUSTING customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant.  If you're looking for chicken balls and chop suey, this is not the restaurant for you.  If you're looking for Cantonese food (e.g. dim sum), this is also not the restaurant for you.  However, if you're looking for authentic Chui Chow (a province in China) cuisine, you'll love this place.  Delicious food!  The four seasons green beans are fantastic.  The \"yu gow\" - dumplings with wrapping that is made of fish meat are delish, as are their dessert \"crystal buns\".  Price is on par with other Chinese restaurants in the area.  Tasty tasty place!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to dine here quite often. However, in the past year, we've visited Chiuchow Man several times and every time, we walked out feeling it's just not the same anymore...in terms of their food quality and taste.

My boyfriend's grandparents, on the other hand, are quite loyal to Chiuchow Man. Our group of 14 had dinner there last night. (Their biggest table only fits 10 so we had a second table for 4.)

To my surprise, the food was great. There were absolutely no complaints around the table. Everyone enjoyed the food, and did not stop eating until everything was wiped clean. The favourites were Chinjew Chicken, Deep-Fried Cod Fish, Deep-Fried Squid, and the Oyster Omelette.

Despite being quite a busy night (due to Mid-Autumn Festival perhaps), the service was quick and there was not much of a wait after we placed another order of Chinjew Chicken.

I might actually take my parents to try Chiuchow Man again. It has been a while since we last dined there, so...I'll see what they think of it now."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, so finding this gem definitely made me smile. I've came him a number of times and was satisfied each time. They serve authentic Chiu Chow food and a bit more, but they are sadly missing some of my favorite mainland and HK dishes. What they do serve is consistently flavor. Sometimes the meat was overcooked and came out dry and chewy though."}
{"text":"I had the signature dumpling noodles. It was not bad but not enough for me to crave for it again.  I also had the deep fried taro rolls. It wasn't what I was expecting and it was lacking flavours."}
{"text":"This family-owned restaurant has been around for years and they have the best Chiu Chow cuisine in Mississauga. But that's not a fair statement because they are probably the only one in town.  Nevertheless, their food is great. Small place and it's quite packed all the time. I have had their take-outs as well and they have large portions. I recommend trying their ducks and satay beef on Chinese broccoli."}
{"text":"Great value and pricing. However they did mess up our order. Good food nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Chiu Chow restaurant that I know in GTA.  It is the first time that I know during the busy Christmas seasons that a lot of the menu dishes are not served due to the time required for preparation and cooking.  The restaurant just wants the shortest possible time to have more turns for a table.   Those not available include Oyster omelette,  pot rice, Crystal balls dessert, ....

We order the Teochew Braised Duck with tofu and egg.  This is always good.  The saulted chicken with fried spinach is tasty.  Fried vege is average.  Since we cannot order our favorites, we start to order 2 dishes of rice - seafood fried rice and the Fukien Fried rice with a sauce on top.  Of course, at the end we have to pack as all are rice!

The taro dessert is a bit too sticky - too much corn starch!  So advise not to come during busy festive seasons"}
{"text":"Have been here for family dinners on a couple of previous occasions but specifically went this time to try their fish dumpling noodles. I ordered the lunch special, having squid balls and fish dumplings with rice vermicelli. An extremely generous and tasty portion; I couldn't even finish all the balls and dumplings (were given 3 golf ball-sized of each)! Only complaint was that they only had one server for the entire restaurant during lunch hour, so service was slightly slow. Nonetheless, a pleasant experience overall!
We also come often to eat the marinated intestine or duck, either alone or with noodles. Absolutely our favourite!
Take-out for this place is pretty good, and well worth its value. Although they have increased the prices slightly, you get a soup (our favourite is black pepper and pig stomach), half a marinated duck/steamed chicken, rice, and your choices of dishes! Yum, yum.

UPDATE: apparently the chef for the fish dumplings has changed and it no longer tastes the same, so refrain from ordering it!"}
{"text":"Food is rather typical, nothing too good or too bad. There are many better options in the area. The major complains are: 1. bad service, 2. slow service, 3. no service. We went 3 times and they never improve their service.

Oh and sticky floor. They could really use a Mr. Clean there.

Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"My family loves this place - the Chinese food is consistently delicious. I'd recommend the satay beef, the steamed fish, and chicken and seafood fried rice."}
{"text":"Very very good Cantonese food.  I have been going here for over 5 years.  Make sure to get the Peking Pork Ribs.  I like their lunch combo where you get three dishes for less than $30.  Delicious and cheap!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Chinese food options in this plaza, I think this place is my favourite. The lunch specials are a good deal, their fish noodles are delicious, and their XO turnip cakes are amazing. Seriousy, they're totally worth every penny - you should try it. Seriously large pieces of turnip in there instead of just rice flour, and the right amount of spiciness!

They have a few authentic dishes as well, the chinjew chicken is great and I quite like the eggplant flat rice noodles. Beware of greasiness though, it's definitely not the healthiest of options. 

The last thing to mention is their fish dumplings. These are the bomb - if you've never tried them here, I would highly suggest it. They have a great texture and the flavour is spot on. So many good dishes - I keep coming back for more!

Lunch specials come with a drink of choice (HK tea / coffee / soy milk, etc)."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the customer service is horrible. Every waitress literally tosses the dishes you ordered onto the table. With this kind of customer service, it's a miracle this restaurant has been running for years."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular restaurants. And judging from the crowd waiting to get in, others feel the same. We ordered our regular pork stomach soup -- the stomach was soft and didn't have an offal flavor, the broth has a very nice savory peppery taste. This is an excellent soup -- you should try it especially if you have never had pig stomach before. We had a wide variety of food -- everything from duck, to chicken, to fish, etc. Sorry I don't have the name because the patriarch of the family ordered in Chinese. Without a doubt, we would strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place a lot but have not been in a while so decided to take my parents there for dinner before they take off on their cruise.
We were all super hungry when we got there.  It might have been our hunger but we honestly felt all the dishes we ordered were fantastic.  The kitchen was swamped with orders so we had to wait a bit for our dishes to come out.  The didn't disappoint, even after all these years.
The restaurant is rather small so they fill up fast around dinner time, even on weekdays. (We were there on a Tuesday evening.)
If you want to get seated without having to wait, I suggest going there before 7pm.  I don't know if they take reservations but you can try."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place for quite long time. Food is still very tasty, waiting line is till long over the weekend. I love their rice noodle with satay beef (must have in my books and they never failed me on this one). If you go for lunch, lunch combo is always a good choice. We had a party of 6, went with the lunch combo with 5 dishes and added two fried noodle, total bill came in $80."}
{"text":"This place was average. The food was delicious but nothing extraordinary. It was a blessing that we had two canto speaking friends with us which made the ordering process go by so much more smoothly, the servers spoke English but things could be a bit confusing when it comes to asking questions. The food was impressively fast to get to our table. Must tries include the fish skin and taro fried rice."}
{"text":"I'd have to say that this asian restaurant is one of the best in Mississauga. I've been coming here since the days that I lived in the city which is at least 10 years ago so you know that any time a business has been around this long, they must be doing something right! 

You'll expect consistent service every time...friendly and efficient.

The cuisine is a different type of asian cuisine offering authentic dishes from the Chaozhoa culture which is from a unique area of China. I love the flavour of every dish but my favourites are the Seaweed with Fish Dumpling & Meatball Soup and their Pan Fried Turnip patties, both made fresh every time. They also have lunch specials so you can easily get a filling lunch for under $10 including a drink. I recently had the Thin Rice Noodle with Beef and Black Pepper and it was delicious. They are also known for their crab, marinated duck and chicken.

The ambience is also very authentic giving you that experience as if you were enjoying a meal from a restaurant in China.

I guarantee that you'll want to try this place as you walk by and smell the wonderful aromas from their cooking."}
{"text":"My parents and I used to come here after store closing as it was one of the few restaurants open past 10 pm in the Mississauga area.  This was about 10-15 years ago.  

Their entrees are good and the lunch specials are passable, but the best thing about this place is the price and their hot pot rice.  

It's anywhere between 6.50-$9.00 and you get a sizzling hot pot of rice, with meat-a-plenty and enough for two.

If you come here, you MUST get the hot pot rice and everything else is bonus. If you don't get it, then there are better places in Mississauga for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant for over 16 years. Came here recently for dinner. It was packed but the staff made sure tables turned quickly and customers were looked after. When I eat here, I feel like I'm at an old friend's house for dinner.

We were seated within 2 min of entering the door. Impressive! We ordered after 5 min and everything came out within 5-10min.

We ordered 6 dishes and all were fresh, hot and delicious. My favorites are fried chicken wings, eggplant hotpot, and stir fried giant clam sliced thinly with chives in OX sauce. Love these dishes! (I have tried most of their dishes and all are good.)

Great value for great food! Glad to see they've made some positive changes recently. Keep up the good work! See you again!"}
{"text":"Terrible waitress doesn't have any manners at all she was rude with us the whole time i don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Decent chinese food for Mississauga standards. Food came pretty fast and the service is standard. But the atmosphere sucks - the seats are pretty tight and the floorplan is poorly arranged (they try to fit in more tables and chairs than the space allows). Also, there are empty cardboard boxes and dirty dishes bins all over the place. If you just care about the food and not the overall presentation of the place, then go for it."}
{"text":"My friend decided to have dinner with me and his family since it was closeby his house. We ordered a few dishes plus some fried rice and noodle dishes. Overall, it was a cheap dinner and not too bad to try to find parking. You can also do your grocery shopping afterwards as they have a fairly big Chinese supermarket in the same plaza. Not too hard to find parking as well."}
{"text":"Went here based off n good reviews and it was fairly good. Soya sauce beef with rice noodles, chow mein, ginger beef was fairly good. And reasonably pretty Ed."}
{"text":"One of my fav places in the saug... The signature duck is always a must order. Otherwise I recommend the seafood dishes such as the seasonal tilapia. Cash only, however. There is a TD in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Have been to chiuchow man many times, and we never miss ordering the steamed pork belly with preserved vegetables. It tastes so so good and one time I could not help to take the sauce home lol."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here for dinner on a weekend and it was busy but no wait. All the dishes were excellent and flavourful. The tofu stew, bamboo rice, and lo shui appetizers were a hit. Will be back again for sure~!"}
{"text":"I love the cold dish there. The taste of the cold dishes likes traditional Chinese food. But they deep fired the chicken in the Lazijiding. It's weird taste. Traditional Chinese food won't do that."}
{"text":"I remember visiting this restaurant for the first time when I was a kid. Served delicious food for an affordable price. Reminiscing all the great past memories!  Today, Chuichow Man continues to serve amazing Chinese Chuichow cuisine and is one of the best restaurants in Mississauga. Every time I eat here, I am never disappointed.

The food is quick to come out and is steaming hot. The satay beef hofan is cooked perfectly with enough \"wok hei\" (Google for definition) and is authentic in its flavors. The service is average and the décor is boring (once you eat the food, you will forget about the negatives). 

Chiuchow Man is one of the best in the city. The food is delicious and fast. If hunger strikes, venture forth here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a quick dinner. We were seated and ordered bitter melon with beef, congee and salt & pepper prawns. The food came out super quick, service was attentive and the prices was very affordable. Their food delicious, not too greasy and authentic, they also give generous portions. This restaurant reminds me of something you would see in Scarborough, the decor is okay but the food is delicious.  If you are craving some Chinese food, this restaurant is one that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly service, uncommonly delicious food, great prices. Would recommend fish and salted veg (sour mustard greens) soup and eggplant with minced pork hot pot."}
{"text":"Lets cut to the chase. Food is typical chinese food here. Good. Not great. Ordered the lobster and a noodle wonton soup. The service was so slow. Took forever for the lobster to come. Like they almost forgot to make it. I wont return honestly due to the slow service. Not a knock against the food per se. I rather go next door to Chi Congee. Read this is 2.5-3 stars. BLAH."}
{"text":"Food here was average in terms of flavour and I'm not a picky eater. I will probably not go here again but maybe their other dishes are better?"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food like it was nobody's business ... So I called up my friend for a lunch date at this place I bookmarked. We ordered the lemon chicken, thin rice noodle with beef & black pepper and the Chinjew Chicken. To be honest it was aiight! After reading reviews I expected to be blown away but unfortunately it was mediocre Chinese food. The lemon chicken was good it had pieces of mango in the sauce with is different and the noodles were fresh and seasoned to perfection. Solid 3/5. Service was also 3/5. 

I'm not sure why it's so hard to find good solid Chinese food around square one. Anyways, I'm happy I was able to check this one off my bookmark list... Will I be back? Nope!"}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend came here when we were craving some really great authentic Chinese food! This restaurant as well as the other three units down are really amazing. We got the Cantonese chow mein, duck and some bok Chot. It's exactly as you would expect from an affordable Chinese restaurant. Pricing was about 10 dollars per dish. The place is smaller but they get the food out very quickly so the lines really don't take too long waiting for a table. However, just be warned they don't have congee. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Another OK restaurant at the Golden Plaza, has a decent selection for lunch items at relatively cheap prices (under $10) and good for dinner parties as well with great seafood combos.

I came here for weekday lunch with a colleague of mine and we got squid meatball and fish dumpling noodle in soup (added some fried fish skin for +$1) and the fried tilapia with corn on rice. The noodle was supposed to be their house special signature dish but I didn't find it to be too memorable. The portions of the toppings weren't very big and I've had better fish dumplings in the past. However, I'm glad that I ordered the fried fish skin on the side because I was curious of the taste and it turned out really good. My colleague got the rice and from the looks of it there were A LOT of rice. I swear the amount of rice there would be enough for 2 people, but there weren't that many pieces of fish there. 

As I expected the bill came out to be around $10 so it's a decent Southern Chinese cuisine restaurant to give it a try without breaking the bank. However, as I mentioned previously, they also serve a lot of seafood dishes and obviously those are a lot more expensive than the simple lunch dishes. And also unfortunately they told us it was cash only, not sure if it's still the case for dinner. 

P.S. terrible parking condition at the Golden Square parking lot, you've been warned"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for cheap lunch specials. For $6.75 I got a curry beef with rice dish and a cold milk tea drink. We usually get their roasted duck to go and it is good. Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Over the years this is the no.1 restaurant our family have been dining if don't feel like cooking. The quality of dishes are good and they are very quick with serving so it can keep the flow well. Highly recommend if need sth quick and descent to eat."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Mississauga. They have very authentic southern Chinese food. Every dish I tried here are delicious, some of my recommendations are:  The sliced fish and to-fu soup, marinated meat platter, fried noodle with beef, fried squid with salt. 

The restaurant can be a bit crowded, but the service is decent and dishes are served quickly. And the price is also okay compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Fairly good Chinese food at this restaurant. It has been here for a good decade and more. Service is adequate and the food quality is good for its price. The restaurant is small so you will feel cozy with your table neighbours but that is the \"Asian experience\". I would recommend their black pepper pork stomach soup. It is VERY unique and tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, but dunno why I never wrote a review!  So here goes...

1.  It's fast.   This is my version of \"fast food\" with no nonsense service.  In addition to the service, food also comes out quickly.  If you want, you can be in/out of this place, have a sit-down meal, in about 1/2hr.

2.  This is actually a GOOD Chinese place in Mississauga.  I've had this discussion before with other Chinese people and we're in agreement:  In comparison to other cities the GTA (Markham, RH), Mississauga is basically a wasteland for Chinese restaurants.  :(  If you're looking for good dim sum, go elsewhere!

3.  It's CHEAP.  Chinese people love a good deal and most of us, even if the food is really good, will steer clear of an expensive restaurant...unless someone else is picking up the tab.  So if you just want a quick meal, why bother going to Chez Pierre, when you feel satisfied with a noodle soup for under $5??

I usually get the same thing whenever I come here and it's the Fish Dumpling Noodles (wonton/rice).  The wrapping for the dumplings are made out of fish maw and it's delicious!  

A few years back, it used to be served with a coupla pieces of deep fried fish maw, but they don't do that anymore.  I wished that they would have an option to include that for an extra $1-2 dollars!  I don't even think it appears on their apps portion of their extensive menu.

Chiuchow Man's my go-to for when I'm in a bind, want something fast, but not McD's!"}
{"text":"We were actually going to dinner to a restaurant around the corner but we passed this restaurant and my wife commented that she hasn't had chiu chow cuisine in a while. So we decided to split our dinner at 2 restaurants. 

After eating our half dinner at the first place (which by normal standards was a full dinner, if I'm being honest with myself), we came here for dinner part #2 and got the Fried Lobster with Ginger & Green Onion, Marinated duck (Chiu Chow style) and Deep Fried Filet with Chili Salt (which turned out to be grouper filets). For greens, we went with the tried and tested snow pea leaves with garlic. Can't usually go wrong with that.

What we really wanted, instead of the fried grouper, was the deep fried pomfret fish. It has been ages since I've seen that on a menu but it was the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration and the restaurant was packed all night long. So, unfortunately they were all out. I give them props for even having it on the menu though.

The food turned out to be quite ordinary to le wife and my disappointment. The lobster had too much corn starch in the sauce. After cooling slightly you could see the huge gelatinous clumps of corn starch clinging to the lobster - but hey it's lobster so we ate it all. The duck was disappointing as it had a mushy texture to it which was strange and slightly off putting. Nothing special about the fried grouper either but it was salted nicely. Good drinking dish if you're having a cerveza or two. 

I'm not sure if we got the right dishes. If I lived in Mississauga, I'd come back here to try some of the other stuff but unfortunately we were only there for a day. Boy I really wish they had the pomfret. My mission now is to find it in NY."}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 3.5/5
Had a craving for rice, noodles and congee and decided to give this place to try. Unfortunately no congee, but added a new Chinese restaurant to the rotation.

Food: 3.5/5
Food tastes good, portions are good and prices are very good. I ordered a noodle dish (which was very good... sorry, don't remember what the dish was called), Seafood Fried Rice, and green beans with minced meat (which was a little on the salty side). Overall the food was above average.

Service: 4/5
The waitress I had was great. She was happily willing to provide recommendations. After ordering a noodle dish off the regular menu, she suggested ordering it off of the lunch special menu because it would be cheaper and come with a drink... that saved me about $2. Service is quick, was in and out of there relatively quickly.

Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Restaurant isn't very big and seating is a little tight. Whether you like it or not, you can see right into the kitchen. The restaurant is quite clean.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Limited parking shared with many other businesses
-Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Had dinner here, ordered:
1) chiu chow rice in soup (oyster and pork) $6.50 regular size - tasted very MSG like, but overall was decent. However, we found a small metal wire in our soup which made me reduce the rating to 2 stars. The waitress allowed us to either cancel the order or cook us a new one.

2) Fish dumpling with rice noodles $5.50 - average, but the fish wrap isn't as good as other places.

3) Duck noodles $5.50 - standard as well, wished there was more duck but reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"Love the write in dim sum.  The restaurant is small so carts are impractical.  Toronto is always a epicurean delight.  Chinese food is world class and certainly worth the 5hour drive from Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place does Chiuchow (Teochew) cuisine.  Foods were alright; prices were acceptable; service was standard.  The Marinated Duck appetizer was up to par.  The Pork Stomach Soup was very peppery and spicy.  My favorite dish was the Chicken with Chinjew Sauce of which the chicken was juicy and tender and the deep-fried leafy greens was interesting and made me feel like eating dried seaweed the very crispy way! Loved it! The complimentary red bean sweet soup dessert was waaaaaay too sweet though."}
{"text":"Food is fairly decent if u can stomach the rude waitstaff! Tried calling for reservation before I even finished the sentence of trying to reserve a table as I know sometimes wait time might be long, they just shouted no need to reserve and hung up! And of course when we got there we had to wait. They didn't seem to give a damn of the people waiting! They don't even want to give you a number! Had to flag them down for a number! Then when we sat down, another wave before we could find someone to take our order! Had to ask three times before they remembered our bowl of congee and bowl of rice! 
Eat here if everywhere is closed! Thank god I don't live on the west end, will never come back here again! 
So many good choices than to go to a place with mediocre food at best and horrible horrible slow service! Waitstaff looks like they worked at a funeral home! All with disgruntled faces! They don't look like they want to be there! My god!"}
{"text":"We have yelp to thank for finding this gem in Mississauga. Delicious Chinese food cooked fresh and hot within a reasonable amount of time. Came here first last December and have kept returning for more. Love love love the lobster chow mein, chicken in chinjew sauce, and sweet and sour porkchops.. and looking around at other tables makes me want to try all other dishes as well! Been trying out fake Chinese food in Toronto only to be disappointed. Would much rather go to Chiuchow Man for the real thing!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on our first night in Mississauga based on Yelp reviews. We waited for 10 minutes for our table. While we were looking at the menu, a waiter came by and said that the tilapia was on special for 12.99. We ordered the tilapia, lobster and  half a Chiuchow chicken. That chicken looked like it was starving! It was the skinniest chicken I've ever had. The tilapia was steamed and pretty good and the lobster was pretty good as well. Service was ok. Would return if in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food in Mississauga. Pretty standard menu. This as good as it gets for Chinese in Mississauga. 1 star off since it's cash only. Having payment options would be nice."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Friday night. It was my second time going back and I was quite disappointed by the service I received. The waitress had made a mistake on one of our orders, instead of putting down fried fish she put down fried squid. So that being said, when we got our order we knew it wasn't what we had asked for. I notified one of the other waitresses that happened to be closer to us and she went ahead to find the person that took our order. So she came to our table and told us we ordered the squid and not the fish and with no questions asked she just put all the blame on us, saying we were the ones that made the mistake and not her. As she was walking away she was speaking very loudly and rudely (literally shouting at her coworkers across the room) saying how we actually ordered the squid and it wasn't her problem. Regardless, they ended up making us the fried fish (which we had to wait an extra 20mins for). Overall, the food was not bad (maybe consider take out instead of dinning in) but the service is just terrible. I do not recommend this restaurant for people that want to dine in."}
{"text":"Above the standard! Love all the dishes that I ordered. Crispy fried fish skin is an asset! I love the black pepper soup so much!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent service.  Got some specialties here from ChiuChow province in China that you may want to try."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?

They are known for the soy marinated mixed duck platter which also includes slices of red sausages, beef shank and tofu to name a few items you'll expect to find in the platter. Also, the pork dumpling in fish mixed flour wrapper is also very famous here. You can order just the dumplings or the noodle with the dumplings. The Chinese sausage, marinated pork belly and taro fried rice is also very famous fried rice to order here. The rice is really fattening, but very delicious. 

Your meal always come with a complimentary soup. It's usually pork stomach soup with sour cabbage. Very spicy though because of the amount of ground pepper they added. 

This restaurant is good for a full out Chinese dinner or you just want to try some dishes that are from Chiu chow. Mostly the soy marinated meat platters are their specialty. 

LAST TIP?!

They only take cash here so come prepared with some handy cash or go across the street to the nearest bank in the same plaza. Combo dinners have complimentary dessert too!"}
{"text":"These numbskulls gave me the wrong take-out order and didn't realize it until 30 minutes later. They called me as I was about to reach my home to ask if I can come back to drop off the order they gave me by accident for the other customer. The manager sounded very eager to get the order back, so I braved the horrible rush hour traffic to switch the orders. When I got there, they just took the bags from my hands and gave me my order. It wasn't until they saw how angry I was that they even thought of apologizing. I can't tell if these people behaved the way that they did because they are dumb or just plain immoral."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves a different style of Chinese cuisine, the style like the name is Chiu Chow.

All there dishes are very good and I have never been disappointed.  

The service is always good.
 The servers are nice, quick and attentive.
The quality of the food is always  good.  It is never over or under seasoned.

They are famous for their noodle soup with fish skin dumplings.  Yummy!

This place one of my favourites and an easy go to.  Must try."}
{"text":"Like, Stephanie S., I too have been coming for years but strangely have not written a review for them!

They are consistently fast and tasty. Dishing out Chiu Chow cuisine like no other restaurant in Mississauga.

ATMOSPHERE: Fast-paced, cosy place. It's one of the many choices within the Golden Harvest plaza.

SERVICE: Fast and on-the-ball. Pretty standard temperament as other Chinese restaurants/joints.

PRICE: Average. Not too expensive and not too cheap.

FOOD: As mentioned, it's probably the best Chiu Chow joint in Mississauga and their food quality is consistent.

Some items I love:

Hong Kongers would especially enjoy the weekday lunch specials which includes one drink. They make a decent HK-style milk tea! 

I love their Fish Dumpling with Rice Noodles. It is consistently one of their best dishes. Great personal size for a quick lunch or dinner. The fish dumpling is really good. 

Their Chiu Chow rice (consistency is like congee - for you Canto eaters), in which they never skimp ingredients. It is always tasty and such a comfort dish.

I also like their \"crystal ball\" desserts. One order comes with 3 balls in 3 different flavours: taro, red bean, and lotus seed paste. Just a little sweet to tie off the meal."}
