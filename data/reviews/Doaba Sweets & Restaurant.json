{"text":"I have visited this place several times and never ever I have got disappointed.  Their Gobi and Muli parathas reminds me of home.  The Thali is awesome (Bhindi masala  is best) and superb value for the money.  The sweets are simply amazing.  Ambience is decent enough and last but not the least, the service is good, brisk and clean. Yeah, you would have to bear the Punjabi music playing on TV always! I repeat, ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"Food *****- Service* - Ambience* (extremely dirty tables) (Better for take out)  I would give this place a 4.5 stars overall, if not their super unfriendly and sloppy service staff and really dirty table area. Their staff treat customers like they are doing the customers a favor by serving food.  The glasses, tables and cutlery are not washed clean. The floor under the table is always strewn with food dropped by the previous customers, their menus are always stained with food.   Their food however, is one of the better Indian foods I have had in the GTA for such low prices. Their thali is very filling and has sumptuous quantities. Their curries are quite delicious. Being an Indian myself, I can vouch for the taste and quality of their food in comparison to authentic Indian food from back home  I certainly recommend  this place for revisits. But you gotta tolerate some very sad, long drawn faces showing complete disinterest in the business you give them and a very dirty seating area."}
{"text":"horrible customer service, no explanation to their unreasoning customer service. We asked for a take out and right after she punched in the order on the register, nothing else was done at all yet,  and on the spot we said actually we will dine in, the refuse because now we ordered take out so they can't use restaurant plates and can only use paper plates. We have to do take out and can't do dining. We have been coming to this restaurant but no more. Customer service, common sense and politeness is very important to run a business."}
{"text":"If you want to have parathas potato/radish/daal filled fried bread, or Kulchas, this is the place you want to go, if you want to have Saag with maki ki roti and Lassi, just like a village in punjab this is the place. The service is nice lots of vegetarian indian dishes and lots of sweets but the best thing is the parathas, especially on a sunday morning, have it for brunch... no lunch required...."}
{"text":"Visited Doaba on Sunday morning wanting to try Cholle Bhathure. I have not had good experience eating cholle Bhature in GTA. Coming from North India I like street style( not Haldiram types) Cholle Bhature and either u end up getting too bland ( or healthy as they claim) or too oily. However Doaba cholle Bhature happily surprised us. It's still not same as u get in Delhi, but certainly better ones in GTA... They were not oily and were not bland either... Didn't try anything else but this experience has motivated us to try Doaba more  will post more feedback as we try... But yeah if someone has any other recommendation for Cholle Bhature, do reply to me"}
{"text":"For the price, the food is good enough..The owner is pleasant to talk to.The Naans are especially good..soft and tasty.Not a bad choice to eat a homely meal once in a while."}
{"text":"We ordered the Paranthas here and they came out delicous. This is real a Punjabi breakfast, we told the folks there that we came all the way Chicago. They were very kind and patient and made us jalebi fresh (we still had to pay). I still am in Toronto for a few more days and will probably come at least twice more. Like I said again if you  are staying in Toronto this is the place to come to for a good dhaba style meal."}
{"text":"You should try out the Channa Bathura of this place. Its simply delicious."}
{"text":"Located in a strip plaza.  Food is nothing special, although channa bhatura is worth a try.  The young ladies working behind the counter don't really seem interested in serving customers"}
{"text":"Food was ok and service was really horrible these kids took too long to take my order. The order taker was not at all pleasant in taking order. Resturant has some cleanliness issues. good for a price point to certain extend but there are far more better restaurants to eat."}
{"text":"A homely restaurant for authentic Punjabi cuisine in Brampton. Driving distance for those living in Mississauage too.    Serves great Makki di Roti, Sarson da Saag to be had hot and fresh. Chole Bhature or parathas are great too if you are in a mood.   Sweets and savories are equally good : I used to do a takeaway of a box of dry gulab-jamun and samosas.   Given that it is a homely place, don't expect a great sit-down-and-eat ambiance."}
{"text":"the service was very bad and it's bloody expensive. one worker there was disrespectful and didn't acknowledge me once. she probably hates her job. also she has no social skills whatsoever. also they need food upgrade. and the bell is broken, so you have to ring it 5 maybe 18 times to get noticed."}
{"text":"Have had take out from here several times. The food is fresh and tasty. Great vegetarian punjabi foods and snacks. Great selection of sweets too. Sometimes the sweets look a little sad  but overall the food is great.  The staff are polite. The food is always ready to pick up when we arrive. No complaints. Great food at a great price."}
{"text":"We have been to this place multiple times in the past 6 months and can say this is a hidden gem for the vegetarians. All the food is fresh and the taste is very authentic.  Our favourites are the following  Gobi n Mooli Paratha Chana Battura Saag , Jalepeno paneer and Gujarati thali. The price and hospitality is excellent on top of yummy food and hence the rating. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is good..but let me share my experience.....I ordered 150 samosas for my office party. They packed samosas in an open box. Very poor packing. Poor packing , and den they were stingy on samosa chutney. Gave me just one container each of chutney. I immediately flipped, and fortunately, they gave me more chutney. But seems like they don't match chutney volume with order size. Or they just wanted to get away with giving less, in case I didnt notice....(Its not one time, but i have had numerous bad customer service experiences with them). I guess chutney saga made me write this review.hahah"}
{"text":"I went to do a take out for brunch. The restaurant is of a decent size with nice amount of tables to accommodate people eating in. The restaurant is Indian Punjabi  style so the menu and taste of the food is Punjabi. The have a lot of selection to choose from in the menu and they also have sweets/ desert section too. All though the sweets didn't look much appealing (compared to what I can get in the surrounding).  Now lets talk about food... I went and place 3 orders of Channa Bhatura, which included Chick peas cooked in authentic spices, Potatoes, pickle, & raw onions served with fried bread. Enough to feed 4 and half people! Over all the quality and quantity of the entire package was great and the food was hot as well as the Bread was fried fresh. The potatoes were blend but then again the dish is chick peas and fried bread and potatoes were extra.   I loved their packaging. They have this funky machine to seal the top of the package so there is no leakage as the gravy remains intact in its place. For this they got an extra star."}
{"text":"This certainly was worth the trek up to Brampton.   Came here to satisfy my craving for Idian style breakfast, especially the Alooh Paratah which I can not find downtown.  They offer a set dish, two paratah, yoghurt and tea - this was $6 so not too bad a price. It was a decent try, although a bit stingy on the actual Aloo (potatoe)  While i was paying i noticed they had another one of my favourite dishes in a plate combo. Saag with Cornflower Roti. Trust me this is soooooo nice.  I order that for take out for myself and a friend and had for dinner later that day. Tasted great and can not wait to go back for some more.  The restaurant itself has decent seating, but it does get busy pretty quick and the take out wait times are pretty long."}
{"text":"We had dropped it for a heavy breakfast, the shop was still not fully open. We ordered Chola-Bhatura and that was as tasy and fresh as it can get!"}
{"text":"Love this place's paratha combos! Just like home made paratha, felt like having good at parathewali gali in Delhi!   Good food for cheap price!"}
{"text":"Calling all vegetarians and you carnivores that want a change, Doaba is 100% vegetarian. Doaba is in my opinion the best vegetarian food in Brampton.  Great thali for $6.49 (naan, rice, yogurt, small salad, pickles and a choice of three dishes). Highly recommend the Kofta and shahi paneer and the naan is fantastic!.   Good selection of paratha's and kulchas all served fresh. I had the channa bhatura today ($4.99) and I guarantee you will be impressed.  Now after such a rave review you might wonder why did not give Doaba 5 stars???  In a works out is because of the service, or lack of! If you are dining in you have to order at the front and then they will bring out to you or if you are getting the thali they will ask you to choose your mains. Its not that they are rude just ambivalent..........unless you get the one guy who always looks depressed?  Almost forgot, if you want to go into a sugar induced coma they have excellent indian sweets and this is my favorite place for samosas (3-$1-takeout)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Picked up two thalis yesterday. Worst Indian food ever. The shahi paneer type dish had canned tomatoes and no flavour. The other paneer curry tasted onions and again no flavour. Never again are we going again. Even if it is free we are not going."}
{"text":"So we have not done an Indian breakfast in a Punjabi restaurant. Was a few minutes away and we hadn't tried this so last minute decided to stop by here. A few friends had recommended this as well.   It was not busy and we quickly ordered a Paneer Paratha (stuffed flat bread), a Gobi (cauliflower) Paratha and two plain rotis and some Chole/Chana (chickpeas). The rotis and Chole did not have any dairy (butter). We requested that the order be rushed, but good things do take time and in this case it did. The combo meal comes with 2 parathas of your choice, yogurt and some pickled carrots and raw onions. The parathas were fresh from griddle and were spicy and were hot (temperature). Had we known, we would have ordered milder versions. But they were amazing. Nicely filled and dough soft - melt in your mouth. Would have preferred to have the Chole instead of the yogurt.   The rotis and Chole as well were absolutely delicious. The rotis were very well made. Even though we requested to butter on it, I can just imagine.   The combination meal comes with chai tea and was thoroughly enjoyed by my daughter.   Amazing meal. Will definitely go again with some more time. For less than $8 + taxes. A good deal!"}
{"text":"It's a no frills attached kind of restaurant-lots of fresh mithai, Indian snacks and freshly made food for specialty Indian breads and a hot food bar.  So I happened to try this place by accident as I was passing by Brampton and was craving masala tea.I yelped and they popped up on the top of the search list and I decided to give them a try.  So I went in with the intention of just getting a tea but when I walked in after seeing so many ppl ordering and eating I decided to try their food too.  I ordered their veggie thali which is $7.99 and mind you it's huge I could never finish one on my own also I ordered makai roti along with masala tea.  Everything that comes out from the  kitchen is freshly made and delicious.Because of their huge turnover everything is prepared fresh.  It's a good place for some cheap Indian food and snacks.They offer chaat too and I'm thinking of trying it the next time I'm there.The food options there are quite a lot and pricing is very reasonable.  The service here could be a hit or a miss but in general in my three visits I found it to be average.  There's a lot of parking in the plaza."}
{"text":"My world has been rocked.  I have eaten lunch at this restaurant about 7 times now and it has only yet begun.  I shall sum it up with one word:  Consistency.   Delicious hot table items here my friends.  Not your standard veggie fare floating in puddles of ghee.  The dishes here are pleasing to the eye and ever so taste bud tantalizing.  Oh my goodness!   True about the the sad sweet table but forget about that.  I urge you to Dive fingers first  into the most delicious Saag you will ever taste in your entire life.  It keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Doaba is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant-- the food is amazing and the quantity is large.  I got the paneer kulcha and it tasted just like the one I got in India. The kulcha was well cooked and the panner was seasoned perfectly. The deserts that they had were delicious. I got the milk cake and the gulab jamun, and both were not overly sweet. This a great place if you want to experience great vegetarian Punjabi food!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood takeout restaurant. This is pure vegetarian restaurant. They have some good combination of food specialities from Northern and Western India. Makai Roti and Sarso saag (Corn Flour Roties and curry made out of mustard plant leaves) is my favourite.  Even eating their is a great idea if you care about taste buds more than ambiance."}
{"text":"I call myself a carnivore and generally consider vegetarian food to be rather boring. However after visiting India where more places are vegetarian than not, I've learned that Indian vegetarian is awesome! For me Indian is all about the gravies or curries. The beauty of vegetarian is you get way more of the tasty gravies for an incredibly good price. The picture of the meal I attached was $7 and change. It was delicious!  So I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Indian cuisine, even if they consider themselves a carnivore like myself! The sweets are also very yummy."}
{"text":"Love this small vegetarian restaurant serving North-Indian food. I visit them for their lunch combos, simple and delicious. They have Indian sweets which are decent. Their Chana Bhatura is something not to be missed."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout for the halwa puri and channa batura. The takeout for these comes in tray with onion and carrot as well. At first the food tasted good, we all enjoyed it. However 2 out of 3 of us that ate had a stomach afterwards. So now I'm a bit weary about this place. Perhaps I may give it another try sometime? Perhaps."}
{"text":"Great North Indian food for vegetarians! Pure vegetarian restaurant. Lunch combo curries taste great. Parathas and chaats are also tasty"}
