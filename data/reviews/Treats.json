{"text":"Came by for a short business lunch. Place is small and sits about a dozen people max. They have soup and sandwiches.  Coffee and tea. Prices are reasonable  considering  its inside a corporate building. They have different types of bread for those looking for healthier options. Overall nice little joint plus plenty of parking outside the building. Don't expect anything fancy here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good for snacks and lunch.

I work in the building so it's convenient since we have a parking situation going on. 
Prices are a bit $$ in general, but decent depending on what you order. 

Coffee/Tea available & refrigerated beverages. No hot chocolate or other hot drinks.

Try their cookies, made fresh daily & so soft!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff helped me order a tuna sandwich, chicken gumbo, and cornbread. Lunch was yummy. The place toasts your bread automatically. I need to try more of the baked goods the next time I'm there."}
