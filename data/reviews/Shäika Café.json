{"text":"I love Shaika for their comfortable chairs, the choice of drinks, the mix of people who hang out there, the seating capacity,the numerous electronic outlets, the decorated walls of local art and the events that they host. It's a very homey type of cafe which is the type I gravitate towards. Just look for the string lights outside if you're looking for this place at night. 

Just as a warning: If your intention is to get work done, it can get quite loud in the evening when they have events, so I'd recommend bringing your headphones."}
{"text":"Shaika is a really relaxing place to be at and study. It has like a artistic decors wich is really nice to look at and it gives a really nice atmosphere to it. 

I tried only the JusyJamba and Boom Shakalaita wich are smoothies. Both were really delicious. I wish i can also desserts and food because they look also delicious. So i will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I don't come here enough. This is everything that makes Montreal warm and fun and the park across the street adds so much pleasure to the already creative energy. I made a few sweet business deals here and some pleasure-filled romantic relaxation times and work sessions."}
{"text":"The foods not all that great. I mean its o.k. The staff are a little strange I must say..not rude..but a little strange.The people that go there are o.k. They have live music some good some crap."}
{"text":"This is a cafe with a definite community vibe.  It has a great vue of the park and a large patio. 

The food is pretty good. I'm  not usually into display case sandwiches but I've heard good things.

The soup with a bagel seems like good value for money

They serve beer and cheap wine.

They have little concerts and poetry readings and display local art.  Thats all really cool

Lots of seating area for studying.  Not only 20 somethings but also families, older people, teenagers.  Really a diverse group of people go here which is great.

Wifi is free

I just really like this place

i do hate it when the panini grill creates a smokey environment though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee, relaxed vibe.

Vegan/vegetarian friendly. Cool art on the walls."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Food is average. Good place to read a book."}
{"text":"Love the place!!!! great choices and friendly people I love making meetings for great coffee and treats and feel comfortable and at home. The terrace is faceing giroud park and they have amazing entertainment. Great choice if in ndg day or night."}
{"text":"Love Shaika! Such a great atmosphere and really amazing staff!

Went last night and had the Harvard sandwich with ham, guacamole, cheese, onion and it was so delicious!

There was a live band which was really nice. 

I will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely local coffee shop with very comfortable chairs. 

Shaika has large windows overlooking the Notre Dame de Grâce Park. There are several small tables on one side of the entrance in the large corner area by the windows. On the other side of the entrance, there is a built-in table which is a peaceful working spot particularly on a snowy day. There are also a couple of high tables and they have outdoor seating in the summer. 

The staff are very friendly. The pastries and sandwiches are ok, including vegetarian and vegan options. They make nice lattes. They also display local art."}
{"text":"Mon café préféré à NDG...thé Mighty Leaf, café Santropol, excellent Chili Vegan, exposition sur les murs, programmation de musique live....

Même si ce café-restaurant est très loin de chez-moi j'y passe régulièrement tous simplement par ce que j'aime cette endroit. 
Simple et chaleureux idéal pour se perdre dans un livre, ses études où pour terminer une critique ;-) 
La sélection de café, desserts, sandwichs, smoothies, bagel ... est suffisamment étendu pour que chacun y trouve son compte.
Un bol de Chili Vegan avec un bagel, et un café le Montréalais du Santropol et bien voilà je suis heureux.
Les employés sont super sympathique et choisissent une musique d'ambiance extra....
Les résidents du quartier fréquente le Shaika avec assiduité. 
L'essayer c'est l'adopter..."}
{"text":"Shaika Cafe has an amazing community vibe complete with Gallery and event space inside and a patio with a view out. 

The staff are always amazing and there's so much to see and do whether you're in or out making it a great place to spend your afternoon. 

Food is spot on, healthy with lots of Veggie options and always extremely fresh. If you are looking for an interesting space to get some work done, Shaika is great for that as well, its generally quiet without feeling constrictive although quiet thankfully quits when the live music starts (some evenings). Service is efficient and always with a smile. :)"}
{"text":"Shaika is an excellent place to get some work done, see some live music, or make a new friend. It sort of depends on where you sit and how much you look around. The coffee is by Santropol, so you can feel good about drinking it, and it's very consistent. 

The staff range from cooler-than-you-hipster to just plain nice, but they're all easy to get a smile out of.

The live music is usually good, plus they have slam poetry nights and jams. The crowd, however, can be a bit rude.

Excellent food, albeit kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Thursday night, we thought it would be nice to go have a tea and get some work done at a cafe, and we saw on here (says the same thing in their website) that they were open til midnight. Plus they serve beer/wine so we were pretty excited. So we made the long trek via STM bus only to get there and have them tell us that they close at 8pm. I typically love this place so this was super disappointing."}
{"text":"Great coffee place, with beautiful decor, choices of tea, and deficits vegetarian pesto wraps. Mmmmm! 

I enjoy the art they infuse into the place (painting exhibitions, live music sometimes). 

I just get the feeling the place is becoming a little mainstream, but I suppose that happens when many people like a place :)."}
{"text":"Relaxing place check
Awesome service check
Yummy food and coffee check
Homezy atmosphere check 
Cleanliness check 
Good music check 
Soy option check 

And yes I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been many times over the years and am never disappointed.   In the winter it's cozy and a little quieter, in the summer the tables are out on the sidewalk and it's vibrant and interesting and just a great place for excellent coffee and tea and light snacks and people watching."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to try the food yet, but I had a nice, frothy cappuccino here. They've nailed the cafe ambience with a good amount of seating and great artwork, plus I hear they have wifi, which is a big plus! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite coffee shops in the area. I love the chilled out atmosphere, ambiance, interior, menu & service all 5*! 
I usually go late on a Sunday morning and each time have had a great experience. The staff are so friendly and put a lot of effort into the treats they serve. I always go for the chai latte or hot chocolates as they are frothy and creamy until the bottom of the cup, just the way I like it. The cookies are also very delicious, all freshly baked in store along with many other tasty treats (they even have red velvet cupcakes!)
If you are looking for a hip independent coffee shop with a relaxed environment, this is the one for you. You could spend hours there and enjoy every moment!"}
{"text":"I've been to Shaika a few times throughout last year. It is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for me: coffee is agreeable, but a bit pricey. And the pastries are kinda subpar for Montreal (in variety, flavor and freshness)... It is fairly spacious with outside seating in summer. The location is not the most accessible/lively (~15min walk from vendome metro station). 
What brings me back to this place is the unobstructed view of a beautiful park through the large windows. Thanks to the view, shaika is particularly peaceful and  enjoyable when it's snowing in winter or if you sit outside on a pleasant summer day. 
So not the best cafe in town, but one of the best places to enjoy a warm cozy cup of hot chocolate on a stormy winter day :)"}
{"text":"The décor is pretty, the chairs are comfy, and I really like their coffee; I drink my coffee completely unadulterated regardless to cut down on sugar and fat intake, but with these guys I actually enjoy rather than endure it, and (quite refreshingly) it doesn't arrive at absurd tongue-scalding temperatures. Good tea selection too. Never had the food, but it looks swell.

Can't say I care much for the service. It's not incompetent or rude, but it's astoundingly apathetic. Strictly functional. I don't mind toooo much, though; people leave you alone."}
{"text":"This has slowly become a second home to me in the last few months since it's my HQ for design tutorials. 

So qualifications for good second home material:

Free WIFI: check
Comfortable seating: check
Electrical Outlets a'plenty: check
Featured artists and art on the wall: check
Awesome Staff: Double check
Delicious Sandwich Selection: Check
Open past 9pm: Check
Coffee? OH YEAAH


On top of all this, they have cool shows from time to time, and super nice of the staff to bring food to your table for ya. Also for the vegans/veggies out there, they don't leave you out here."}
{"text":"Intimate place that still offers spacious seating.. Great grub and perfectly creamy chai lattes. Used to frequent for their live music nights, great spot for studying or meeting for coffee."}
{"text":"While I have passed this place several times, I had never gone in before. I have
posted previously about Café TWIGS and little did I know
Shaika is like a TWIGS for NDG. It has a very artsy feel to
it and I ran into two people I know while being there. I love
NDG for being able to run into friends no matter where you are.
I enjoyed a delicious Vegan wrap- Housemade hummus, grated
carrot, cucumber, mixed greens and snow pea shoots in a spinach
tortilla. It was delicious. They also offer a wide
variety of food from pizza and sandwiches to wraps, soup, cookies,
muffins and bagels. They also serve alcoholic beverages and
smoothies and offer WiFi. At night, they usually have performers
who do live music from an assortment of genres. I will
definitely be returning to enjoy this cafe again. You can
also take your meal to go and head right across the street to enjoy
Girouard park."}
{"text":"I discovered this little coffee shop by chance while walking on Sherbrooke with my husband one night. It seems to be one of the only coffee shops which remain open in the evening during the week (closes at 21h from Sun to Mon, 22h Tues to Sat) on the west side of Décarie, and so we decided to strop by.

A double espresso (for him) and a mocha (for her) later, we found ourselves quite satisfied by the quiet and comfy atmosphere, warmed up by good-tasting coffee. We liked the colorful \"hipsterish\" decor and the cushioned seats were very comfortable. It was overall relaxed and welcoming.

I like and recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood coffee shop/small performance space. I have not been here for the spoken word shows or poetry readings but if you need a place to while an hour away, get some work done or read a few chapters uninterrupted, this is a great spot to do it. Doesn't have the snootiness factor of Westmount, the trendiness of Monkland Village nor the hipster man-buns of Mile End or the Plateau. It just has a super laid-back, come-as-you-are vibe. Food is vegan-oriented and they also serve alcohol (beer, wine, sangria, cider) . The servers are also really friendly. Lots of plug outlets too for your laptop!"}
{"text":"Shäika Café est un paradis qu'il m'a pris pas mal de temps à découvrir. Je dois avouer que la raison pourquoi ça m'a pris du temps à y aller, bien que je n'entendais que de bonnes choses, est le fait que je devais m'y rendre à vélo et une super côte qui monte sans jamais arrêter se situe entre mon chez-nous et le café. Finalement armée d'une voiture, un beau dimanche matin, j'ai décidée d'aller y faire un tour.

Maintenant que je sais ce qu'est Shäika, vous risquez de me voir monter la grosse côte parce que j'ai vraiment aimé l'expérience. J'adore le décor et j'aimerais bien prendre possession de quelques unes de leurs chaises pour ajouter du style à mon salon. Les petites tables sont parfaites pour les étudiants et professionnels qui ont la chance de passer une partie de leur journée dans des cafés.

Le café comme tel est très bon. J'ai pris un petit latte qui m'a réveille juste comme je voulais et qui a bien balancé mon carré au Rice Krispie. J'ai eu la chance d'apercevoir quelques repas plus complet, et la prochaine fois je compte y aller pour me commander un belle salade fraîche. 

Tout ce qu'il me faut, c'est le courage et des cuisses de fer pour monter la mosus de côte avec ma vieille bicyclette!"}
{"text":"Deco d'artiste paumé.. menu varié, service souriant, qq tables ici et là , ferme à 10pm, clientele plutot etudiante, wifi disponible."}
{"text":"Cozy and cool cafe located in NDG. I have been there several times for coffee and their chai latte. Good spot to go if you live in the area and want to support smaller coffee shops. 

They also hold various events such as comedy night and concerts which I intend on attending one of these days. Last but not least, they also exhibit and sell local Artists work which make it a more interesting spot than the typical big chains :-)"}
