{"text":"Not far from the house so we thought we would check this place out...still working on there service I'll give them an A for effort , there prices pretty much fall in the general Mexican food restaurant range maybe a slight over . Very clean and nice setting,  biggest draw back for me was your dinner doesn't come with any flour or corn torts...that puts your meal another  $1.50 more , not sure if we will go back..."}
{"text":"It took two attempts for my order to be correct and three on my wife's. Took long enough that we got her order to go. Kept telling us they were swamped and training staff, but I believe they have been open for a few weeks. On the positive side the food was tasty and due to the poor service the meal was comped. Question if I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Frank & Lupe's opened in Ahwatukee! I'm from New Mexico and love that style of Mexican food. I've been going to their Scottsdale location since I moved here in 2004. The food is delicious, chips and salsa great, and of course the margaritas are amazing! I'll be there frequently!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk to this place!  Very authentic New Mexican!  Call before you go since hours may differ based on their soft opening.  Los Dos and Arribas, there is a new kid on the block!  Try the Frank and Lupe's enchiladas!  Really hits the spot.  Green chili has a kick, so be warned! Also liquor license not in place yet..."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes when I walked in...friendly staff and nice decor.  The complimentary salsa was very similar to tomato paste.  I ordered  two appetizers; Mini ,Chicken Chimichangas , recieved shredded beef. Four of the six mini chimis were burnt.   The ground beef nachos looked appetizing,  zero flavor.  The Jalapenos in my Margarita didn't even have flavor...I ate the Jalapenos straight, still zero flavor.  Prices are high for flavorless food."}
{"text":"First time here and probably my last.  I really wanted to enjoy the food because the place is pretty nice.  Bar looks nice as well however from the looks of the menu it seemed I was doomed from the get go.  But I kept an open mind and went through with it.  Chips are solid however the salsa is tomato paste.  I ordered the Guadalajara tacos (ground beef).  I was worried from the menu so I didn't want to do anything crazy in fear of over spending on food I wasn't going to like.  Tacos came in flour tortillas with the usual fixings.  However the key to these are the ground beef.  The beef was bland and almost zero flavor.  Dry pretty much.  Usually you want to use a sauce to moisten the meat but this was non existent. Maybe a pico de Gallo on the side would help but that was not provided.  The margarita was $10 and seemed more like a $4 Applebee's drink.  Rice and beans plain along with the Chile rellenos that definitely weren't impressive.  I tried really hard to find something positive about this place but I couldn't.  I say this with a straight face but I woulda been better off with chalupas from Taco Bell.  It's not often I say that but this place disappoints.  Canned food, but a nice place to look at and at least the music was good.  Hope you guys do better because you know you are skimming on things big time."}
{"text":"very disappointed in our take out meal tonite. 
very skimpy portion, chicken was not seasoned, salsa very watery.
We would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am so happy this restaurant came to Ahwatukee. It's delicious and each time we've been, the service was stellar. Their margaritas could use a little more tequila. But other than that, I haven't had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious. It's pretty cute inside as well. Very family friendly, which is important to us as we have a 13 month old."}
{"text":"First time there we were sit down right away but we sat there for a long time with no service. We had to go ask for a server and finally one showed up. We finally received our drinks and placed our order. No chips or salsa until about the time we received our food. Then we had to ask for napkins and silverware. We were never asked for refills on our tea and soda. The food was fair but because the service was so bad we will not go back."}
{"text":"Such a massive disappointment tonight.
First off it must be said, I love the food here! The Scottsdale location is very tasty stuff. 

But the complete breakdown here tonight between management, wait staff and the kitchen forces me to almost give it zero stars. I have only a few times  walked out of a restaurant  but I had to tonight. let me explain...

We Arrived starving around 6:30 and immediately by chance saw a buddy (who also enjoys the food) who tells me  \"oh man, get ready to wait\". We laughed a bit about it , with me thinking maybe it was isolated, but sadly he was correct.  

I looked around and observed several tables with long faced people frustratingly waiting. I felt that \"uh-oh\" gut alarm go off. My buddy told me they had just waited 30 minutes...........for dessert. 

We got iced teas quick enough (but with only a few melted cubes in the glasses, a major pet peeve of mine. It's called ICED tea folks!). After the teas it was almost 20 minutes later before our order was taken and FINALLY chips were given to our table. 

Around this time is when I really started to simmer, because just a few  minutes earlier, two gentlemen had come in,  immediately got their order taken, received chips and had margaritas!! they had been in their chairs less than 10 minutes. 

At almost 30 minutes in we finally ordered (simple dishes, nothing crazy) and while waiting we and others watched in disbelief at those same two older guys had already received their food ahead of all of us and were half way done! they  had somehow  leap frogged ahead of us all and were already in the home stretch with their meals . Very frustrating. 

a good 45 minutes in now.... our chips were long gone ((never once refilled) and only once did our waitress ask us how we were doing. Keep in mind the place was steady but there was no wait to eat. the place was not super busy. 

The two older guys were now long finished with their meal and were now finger drumming their table waiting for the bill. It was obvious around us that others like us were frustrated, hungry, and feeling forgotten.

It was around this time that our shocked faced waitress suddenly stutter stopped in her tracks next to our table  and said  \" omg... did you not get your food?\" 

Wow. The \"are you serious?\" look on my face must have been obvious as she quick stepped it back into the kitchen area. Did she really now just notice this?? Are you kidding?? I was done. It was closing in on an hour into this fiasco.

My wife gave me the \"don't embarrass me\" face as I laughed , slowly and calmly stood up and told her \" we. are. leaving. \" and out we went, never getting  our food. I was torn between laughter and anger. 

This experience was beyond bad and completely unacceptable. If you are this unprepared to open then why open at all? this place has a 30 year history , much of it sadly comes with  many stories less than great  service. How? Why?

Frank n Lupe's  was a much anticipated new place to eat in our community but what a disastrous way to start out. Very sad that the word now will get out and that they have started by putting themselves into a bad service reputation hole. I am personally extra disappointed because like I said, I really like the food. 

But this place has miles to go before I waste any more time here again."}
{"text":"This is my first visit and I enjoyed the comida from my native northern New Mexico. Love that we had the option to choose blue corn tortillas! A taste of home for me."}
{"text":"Ok I will only say this , if you attend the bar, attend it !!  When you serve cheap wine don't charge 8.00 per glass when you pay 2.99 per bottle ! Won't lie food was amazing but not sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Should have read the yelp reviews before we went.!! Very disappointed. Went with my husband, we are both Arizona natives who love Mexican food. Service lacking. Food took awhile...30 minutes for a taco and chimi? Only 4 other tables had customers. Taco was greasy, had no cheese and had grilled onions on it. Shredded beef chimi was ok but bland. Salsa was a bit sweet and not flavorful. Hot sauce was watery. If you like real Mexican food don't waste your time"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something that is consistent, has great flavor, and isn't going to kill your wallet, this family owned and operated Mexican restaurant with a decidedly New Mexican style menu is a great place.
Tonight I had a beef burrito with beans and rice, with the burrito done enchilada style with a red sauce. The beef inside was fantastic, shredded with a nice flavor and wonderful seasoning.

Something completely underrated? The mixed drinks from the bar. This isn't a hipster craft cocktail bar, but their bar does what it should: they make great margaritas and the Mexican beer is ice cold and plentiful.

The staff is always friendly, management is always on the floor and I have never seen it dirty or tables and not cleaned immediately after people depart. 

Enjoy. It's not fancy, but it's yours and it's local."}
{"text":"Tried this out on a whim.   Service was slow.  Salsa was bland.  Food was greasy and missing flavor."}
{"text":"We decided to try Frank and Lupe's tonight. I tried the Poblano chicken enchiladas. They were delicious! They were not like normal enchiladas with all ingredients inside. The enchiladas are layered instead of rolled and then topped with chicken and yummy poblano cream sauce . So flavorful!! Their homemade chips and salsa are great! My husband had the 37-carne asada burrito with surprise inside!...... a fried egg! He loved it! 
The restaurant also had a good atmosphere! Glad we went!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Friday afternoon for Happy Hour and we ordered the nachos with shredded beef and he brought our nachos with ground beef, the server told me I ordered that and I say no I didn't he asked if I wanted to send it back I said no just because it took so long the first time and we also ordered the mini taco basket, the tacos were about 2 inches long and flat as a pancake, and they looked like those frozen tacos you heat at home, none of this even had any type of spices had to dump the watery salsa on there. Not good at all. I'll stick to Valle Luna on Ray road. They know what Mexican food is"}
{"text":"I / we have read several reviews regarding Frank & Lupe's here on Chandler Blvd. 

Let me say that the service we received from Daniel the bartender was nothing short of outstanding. 

The appetizers were delicious, conversation engaging and again, the service was spot on."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was terrible. There wasn't any silverware for a while as they were cleaning it.
We waited forever as they were short staffed after we sat down."}
{"text":"Located in Socorro, and myself still on the hunt for the best New Mexican style restaurant, I'd thought I try this spot in Ahwatukee out. So far I have found 2 places in Phx that do not disappointed. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. My wife and I sat at the bar on a Friday evening for drinks and dinner. The bartender they had seemed overwhelmed, and unable to keep up with the service (Nice guy though). Drinks took about 10 minutes, drink order was wrong, and the wait to get his attention to order food was also pretty long. Food was pretty good, I ordered Frank's Enchiladas, but kinda small portions of sides though (3-4 spoonfuls of rice and beans?). Really looked forward to the sopapillas, but when I asked for them I was told they'd come out after dinner--uh oh, red flag. Being from NM, I was hoping for puffy/crispy sopapillas with the dinner so I could create my own stuffed ones. After all, the #9 is a Stuffed Sopa plate. I was brought the flat ones, which is okay; except they were undone & doughy. After waiting 15 minutes for the sopapillas to come out, my food was also now cold. I kind of just stopped there and asked for the check, which took another 15 minutes. It could have been a one-off night, I know the restaurant is still new, but that's probably my last visit. On a positive note, the drinks were made well, staff is friendly, and chips and salsa was pretty good."}
{"text":"Well, I have wanted to this place out....and I dud today. Empty restaurant....yet took a while to get service. Servers busy chatting it up at the bar. Tried the #5 plate.....red enchiladas were pretty spicy, beans were whole, not mashed....kinda unusual. But nothing wrong with them. Tv and Mexican music too loud. Am I in a sports bar, night club, or restaurant? Nicely decorated. Overpriced in my opinion= $12 for a few corn tortillas, sauce and cheese with beans? Hum, interesting, wonder if this place will succeed and stay the long run? I am not cpminv back, whoopie for me."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location and we were anticipating a great dinner. The restaurant ambience lacks imagination. It is very clean and sterile with a hint of old New Mexican decor. We ordered the 2 taco plate and poblano chicken enchiladas. The ground beef in the hard shelled tacos was very dry and had a \"gamey \" taste. The large dollop of hot sauce was a little too much. The enchiladas were served with the chicken pieces on top and green poblano sauce poured over the whole enchilada. I also had the margarita which was not frozen and overpowering with tartness. Overall our experience was less than anticipated but par with most restaurants in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"After reading many of the previous reviews I was a little skeptical to dine at Frank & Lupe's. To my surprise the food was actually very good. My daughters and I decided to give it a try. Friday night at 6pm and only had to wait about 20 minutes or so. We were sat in a corner spot the restaurant was quite busy. Bus boy came around to bring us chips and salsa which were very good and a round of water since the waitress was backed up. Only after about five minutes our waitress came by to take our order. Decided to try the cheese crisp which came out quicker than anticipated and it was very good. We ordered the beef flautas , chicken toquittos, cheese enchiladas with Poblana sauce and a Chalupa.  Since we had to wait a bit, the waitress brought us a basket of sopapillas and honey  to end our meal on a sweet note. Everything was delicious with just the right amount of heat. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We eat lots of Mexican food, at many different restaurants around Phoenix. And it sounds like the complaints of the other patrons, who have visited before us, were heard by the management. They definitely implemented changes to make this place awesome. The food, in a word, fabulous; service excellent! And \"Shell\" the bartender/server/hostess is wonderful. Definitely give it a second chance!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight. The queso dip came in a regular take out container. The dip should been places in a cup like take out container. Not flat. When we got it home it was nothing but a layer of cheese that we had to scrape and eat with a fork. You do not and should not ever eat dip with a fork. Also the dip was placed in the container while hot so it burned holes through the container and grease was all over the box that was underneath it. My mans dinner was not at all what we expected. It was a taco salad like entree rather than what we know as a Chalupa. I had rolled tacos and they were ok. What was even more irritating is the lack of resourcing the employees. The hostess told us that it was her first day. She was at the hostess stand all alone. She had no one help with her  there at all. The server that brought our food to us said \" I'm sorry I'm literally running around here like a chicken with my head cut off.\" I'm extremely disappointed in a restaurant treating their employees so badly. We will never return just based on that alone.

UPDATE: In direct response to Diana P. Your response tells a lot. I'm glad that if in fact you did share this review with your team. However, I believe you have me mixed up with another disgruntled guest as we never dealt with a male. And in no fault am I placing on your staff at all. Let me enlighten you a little on me. Just because I feel you don't follow where my heart truly is. I have previously worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years. 8 of those years I worked at very well known and respected restaurant in Arizona. What I saw would have NEVER occurred while I worked for them. To put your server in a position to feel overwhelmed to a point where that is expressed to a guest is not ok. That is clearly a lack of communication and training due to poor management. Also, there is a lot more that goes into being hostess than standing and greeting guests. Perhaps the reason why your server was overwhelmed was that the hostess didn't know proper timing with seating. Going on a short wait, five to 10 min could have prevented this all together. But that was not the fault of the host but again lack of training and communication. It's very honorable to have a restaurant stay in business for 37 years and you should be proud. That is why I think it's very important to spend the time and hear your guests rather than put them down with words of sarcasm, so your Ahwatukee location can grow and become what your Scottsdale location has. But that cannot be done without the backbone of your company. Your servers, bartenders,hostesses, food runners and busers. It's not about building a resume, it's about building a family. I will always take with me what I learned from my 8 years working as a server, hostess, bartender and in take out. That is what family's teach you. How to be great. #istandwiththefrontofthehouse"}
{"text":"Open for lunch only until next week. 
We gave them a try during their soft opening and had a chicken fajita burrito and fish tacos. 
The burrito was average. The fish tacos came in limp corn tortillas and the filling of as a little greasy. 

I loved their beans, salsa and home made chips but wouldn't order the fish tacos again."}
{"text":"Wow. Two appetizers, 2 bottles of beer and 2 margaritas for $70!!  We were shocked. Not going back.  Nearby places have better food for 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"We just went to this restaurant with 4 adults and 4 kids 11 years and younger (2 families). We were told the bill couldn't be split, but they could take 2 credit cards at the end. The waitress was not nice or accommodating in any way. We got our bill after dinner and it was $160! They added 20% gratuity. The service was terrible and the only reason I gave 2 stars was because the food was actually very good. We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! New fave in Ahwatukee!! Wonderful service. Food was great and the margarita was good and ooohhhh the salsa!! Ask for the hot one, so good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I think it took them a little while to get it figured out but it was awesome tonight. Please give this place a try if you haven't been in a while.  Great local ahwatukee spot 
Try the #8. It's the bomb"}
{"text":"We are 'dying' to get some better Mexican food options in Ahwatukee. I was excited to try this new place out! That being said I left here disappointed. The restaurant was clean and nicely arranged. The staff was friendly. But the food. Well, it came up short. I ordered the Chile Relleno plate for lunch. It's was barely warm and not terribly good tasting overall. The beans were 'ok' and the rice was bland. We ordered Guacamole and Beans appetizer and they forgot to bring it out. They did remove it from bill (of course) and then comp'd and additional few bucks as well (not necessary but nice). All in all I had higher hopes here. But a not so good first impression. Ya gotta get that food thing right."}
{"text":"The beef tacos were perfect for me and the chips and salsa were great! Looking forward to many more great food experiences."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this restaurant out since it opened so my wife and I decided to stop in for a late lunch.  A very pleasant surprise indeed.  The food here is of the New Mexico variety (which we love) and so was being compared to our favorite places in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.  The first test is always the salsa and the house margarita.  Both were fresh, home made and very tasty.  We ordered a combo that included a tamale, an enchilada, shredded beef taco and rice and beans, and an enchilada plate, that included a stack of 3 enchiladas with an egg, rice and beans.  The red sauce was definitely New Mexican, properly spiced and delicious.  Even the rice was delicious, which we rarely end up eating at most Mexican restaurants.  All in all Chele, our server,  provided excellent service and recommendations.  Can't wait to visit for happy hour.  
The only thing preventing a fifth star was the price of food and drink.  Not used to paying $13 for a house margarita ( although as mentioned they were very good).  With a single margarita and a combo plate for each of us we paid $78 ( including tax and tip). A little more than I expected to pay for lunch.  Even so, we will return and recommend."}
{"text":"Careful ordering chicken, twice I have gotten uncooked chicken, once in a chimichanga and once in another dish.
The service isn't that great but when the service and food are both good, about every third or fourth visit, it's really good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!! 25$ for 1 greasy chili rellano beans that were terrible and some bland rice. Chips and so called salsa(pato tomato sauce with cilantro thrown it) The thing that really upset me was 3$ for an iced tea and never checked if i wanted a refill . i even shook up my ice to try to get someone's attention but to no avail. Sopapilla was a pile of uncooked dough in the middle soaked in grease. I literally soaked the grease off my 1 rellaño with napkins,that i had to get myself. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Frank and Lupe's Scottsdale location for years.  There is something very comforting about their food.  Since I live in Chandler it was rare that we would make to their Scottsdale location.  When we found out they were opening a new location close buy we had to stop by.  I had the Enchiladas Poblanas and they were so tasty  A great balance of flavor.  You get a lot of flavor and food for the cost and the service was great.  Things to consider when visiting Frank and Lupe's new location, they just opened so there is no alcohol yet but I was told it was coming very soon. The food is very filling and the chips and salsa are great so you will leave full.  Ask for recommendations,  the staff knows the menu well and will guide you to something great.  I know there is a lot of Mexican restaurants around but try Frank and Lupe's, their food is based on New Mexican styles recipes which add something different. you will like it."}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food that was barely warm. Loud. Every server was trying to make their own drinks at the bar while food sat and got cold in the back. When we ask for somebody to bring us more chips and refill our water they told us they didn't have time"}
{"text":"We visited Frank and Lupe's as we were excited they had opened in Ahwatukee one mile down the street from us...(we used to live in Old Town Scottsdale and visited the one there) we were pleasantly greeted and given a warm welcome.  The restaurant was full to capacity and our waitress still had great customer service...I ordered the chicken enchiladas...they were far above my expectations!! It's SO nice to know we finally have a family restaurant that serves AMAZING Mexican food here in Ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife went to this place for the 1st time. When we walked in there was a sign that said to please wait for a table, but we were never greeted by anybody, so we went to the bar where the bartender was not there. We ended up waiting for about 10mins to get a drink and a menu. We almost left, but decided to stay. So once we finally spoke to the bartender, she was very nice, but the service was horrible. The food on the other hand was probably the best Mexican Food I have had in a long time, it was AMAZING. I will come back and order for carry out next time just because the food was amazing, but they really need to work on there service. After we were done eating we then sat and waited about 15mins to even ask for the check. I had to finally get up and track down one of the servers to ask for the check. The whole time the bartender was standing behind us having a full on conversation with 2 of the servers the whole time and we never saw her again for the rest of the night. We would have had at least 2-3 more drinks if she stayed at the bar or was a little more attentive. I will come back for carry out for the food, but until they fix there service, I won't be eating inside the restraint anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in Ahwataukee. I recommend the ceviche and the fish tacos. I used to go to the Scottsdale location,
the taste is just as good. Great for a large group or if u have visitors in town"}
{"text":"Food is very good and the men's restroom was very clean. Also the decor was very nice."}
{"text":"Being a person from New Mexico I might be overly picky about New Mexico cuisine. This just did not measure up. It was not a particularly busy night, but the wait staff had problems keeping up. The food was not good at all. I could not eat the Chile Releno. It was salty, greasy, and had a fishy taste. Enchiladas New Mexico style are flat, not rolled."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, ambiance is great and the chicken enchilada poblano that the waitress recommended was amazing! Try it - #8!"}
{"text":"You know when you go to a restaurant and they have food poisoning on the menu but you really decide on not ordering it...BUT, they decide to give it to you anyways. Well, that's what happened at Frank and Lupes. It was official reported to the state. It goes without saying we will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"So happy to see that Frank & Lupe's is Now in Ahwatukee. Their poblano enchiladas &  cheviche are the best. Had a great time and even though they were super busy the service was great."}
{"text":"Well we tried it and unfortunately did not like this place at all! Don't waste your time or money.  We came in for a late lunch and was met with a terrible aroma- not sure what it was from, but it continued downhill from there. 

The 3 of us split 2 meals - steak fajitas and their poblano enchiladas. The steak was horrible- tough and no flavor. The tortillas were pretty good, rice was hard and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. Pinto beans were tasteless. I could not eat it at all. Very poor quality ingredients in my opinion.

The enchiladas looked interesting and is supposedly one of their specialities, but it was average at best. The chicken was not inside the enchilada but rather on top? The sauce didn't have much flavor but overpowered the dish nonetheless. Service was ok, not great, not horrible. I would have expected outstanding service since we were 1 of 2 tables and they just opened! To top it off, the bill was $35 for 2 meals and 2 sodas. Sorry to write a bad review but I felt like we had the share. Maybe it was a bad day, bad meal choices but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I think the food is reasonably priced- possibly a little on the expensive side, however the portions are massive and I always feel like I got my money's worth. Service is attentive and kind, I have a special diet and they're always extremely accommodating. I have been here many times already and I literally crave their food- I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great beef tacos, awesome chimichanga, churros to die for, delicious ceviche and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course)."}
{"text":"First time here was pretty good.  Tonight, second time, terrible.  Brought friends and regret it.  Too busy for servers.  Forgot some of the drinks. Two orders for people with food allergies - messed up.  Mole tasted burned.  Fajitas bland and not sizzling.  None of the food was very hot.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Frank and Lupes hosted an event for our company. The service was incredible!! Very impressive staff. Quick service. The food was amazing! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in AZ. Fun atmosphere and good music. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not worth returning.  Food was very unimpressive. 

There are so many Mexican restaurants in the area.  This one does nothing to set itself apart."}
{"text":"New location for Frank and Lupe's!  We loved their cute layout, great service, warm welcome and extra generous happy hour dishes.  We wish them the very best in their new location and will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time tonight.  We started with Margaritas and chips & salsa.  Chips were homemade and fresh. The salsa was some of the best I have ever had.  I had #8 Chichen Enchiladas with Poblano Sauce.   My husband had #37 Carne Asada Burrito for our main course.  The food was very flavorful. Some of The best beans we have eaten at a restaurant.  The real deal! The staff was friendly and attentive.  It was overall a good experience.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to give this location a chance, even though there were less than stellar reviews locally and here on yelp. 

With that being said, please take care of customers. Our \"Host,\" didn't greet us, flung our menus on a table and walked away. To top it off, the table he wanted to seat us at wasn't level!

When asked to be seated elsewhere due to the table, he asked, \"Why, is it crooked?\" There are too many choices close to us to dine at, why spend money here when it's not appreciated?"}
{"text":"They charge for chips and salsa! You get one small bowl of chips and salsa, but don't ask for another because you'll be charged! I mean, if you're going to be in the Mexican restaurant game.. you've got to realize that people come first and foremost for the chips and salsa. Stop being so cheap and just give your customers' a few more chips to enjoy! While on the subject, they also charge $2 for a side of sour cream and $4 for guacamole , which also is ridiculous. 

My bean and cheese burrito left ALOT to be desired... It was filled with soppy beans, and the outside was sprinkled with a small amount of cheese. Again.. looks like they are trying to cut corners and go on the cheap.  

We are so in need of more authentic, quality Mexican in Ahwatukee! Bah, I guess I'll keep driving to Espos to get my fix:)"}
{"text":"Amazing margarita! Check out their happy hour specials. #8 Poblano sauce enchiladas are phenomenal. Great staff and service."}
{"text":"Wow so unlike the location in downtown Scottsdale. The #5 I had tasted nothing like the old town location. Egg on top was well done when asked overeasy, and it took 40 min!!! Very bad management and quality control. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Give this little place a shot, tucked in the south east corner of chandler and 48th street.  This is my second visit, the first visit i had cheese enchiladas with a poblano chicken cream sauce over the top rice and beans.  Delicious!  Today i am having the tamales, since i never had tamales, i cant compare them to anything however, to me these have a delicious nice flavor and some heat.  I like the way they do their beans and their rice.  Today is Wednesday and the service is spot on.  Pleasant staff and very courteous.  My friend is eating shredded beef tacos and she cant stop raving about them."}
