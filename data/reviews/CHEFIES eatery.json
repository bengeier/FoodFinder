{"text":"Hidden gem! Fantastic food, great service, friendly environment. Steak and egg wrap for breakfast or pulled pork sandwich for lunch. Many options and can't go wrong with any of them.  They make a great egg and veggie croissant too! Had new sausages today...incredible!"}
{"text":"2nd visit, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Restaurant is small but clean and cheerful, what you'd expect for a sandwich place. Staff is really attentive and friendly as well as hard working. Had a jerk chicken sandwich for lunch, was good, not as spicy as I would have expected, but prepared with care. Prices are reasonable. Recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Just on word wonderful. Food , the staff , owner . Quality and quantity of food and loved the customers , great  environment. Only wait time and lack of seating capacity but hey that tells how  Good is the restaurant it is worth it please keep it up"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service today. We ordered simple breakfast food and had to wait over 45 minutes for it. Our drinks were empty and we were starving. Nobody came to check on us at all. Once our food did arrive the server was rude and defensive about the long wait, not once sincerely apologizing for the extremely long service. Food was good, but they really need to work on customer service and figure out how to make and serve a meal within a reasonable amount of time. Based on the attitude of the server/owner, we will not be returning. Such a shame. Had to pay full price for sub par service."}
{"text":"Love coming here! If you're looking for a super greasy breakfast, don't come here. You're gonna get a freshly served up breakfast minimal grease and that's the way I like it!  I've never had a breakfast I didn't enjoy there, service is great too.  You do have to wait a bit for food, but only because it's being made to order.   I did try the jerk chicken sandwich and found it a bit underwhelming, not as much flavour as I had hoped for.  Seats here need to be replaced, they are just not comfy. That would be my recommendations to the owners. Other than that I stick by my 5 stars."}
