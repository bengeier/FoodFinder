{"text":"This lil neighborhood spot is my new favorite spot for tacos! Have been here several times and have only had the street tacos so far. The carne asada and carnitas are recommended. Service is good. Give them a try for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Mom & Pop run restaurant with plenty of space inside, a covered patio, and great food. The fare covers breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's delicious! Artful presentation and served hot.  The variety in the menu goes the extra mile; they really put heart and soul in their cooking."}
{"text":"My family and I would get together on Sundays when we all had the same day off, not too crowded great prices, wait staff was nice.. They are now closed on Sunday but we still go on other days"}
{"text":"Wow! The best original mexican food in all of Sunnyslope. The menu is a great variety of favorites at a reasonable price. The AL Pastor quesidilla was amazing.  The salsa is made with pride and care with fresh ingredients. Don't simply drive by this great family independent business, stop in and see for yourself what this resturant is all about."}
{"text":"Cheese quesadillas are like a box of chocolates. Wait. Life is like a cheese quesadilla. Can I have a side of guacamole? Actually, I think theirs comes with it. So I guess Forrest Gump can learn a thing or two from Old Las Jicaras after all, eh?"}
{"text":"Was not all that busy, but the street tacos were amazing! Great service and very fairly priced. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I was super hyped before I came since I saw like a million perfect 5 star reviews. It was OK, definitely not 5 star review status. I had the trio enchiladas, and they were pretty good. We also had some Al Pastor tacos, which were pretty good too.   Food came out quickly, and the wait staff was prompt. Everything about the service makes me want to give it 5 stars, but the taste was not there for me.   As an added bonus, there is a Mexican hot dog stand just outside the place. Not sure how that works..."}
{"text":"Incredible service, the street tacos and huevos were wonderful. Had sides of rice and beans that were enormous and so tasty. I had the leftovers boxed up and they threw in free chips and salsa. Love this place!  The restaurant is spotlessly clean including the restroom."}
{"text":"extremely good food! great place, great folks running it! not fancy but straight up good food served by nice folks. you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Super cute little place! Not much on atmosphere but this is about the food, not the fluffy stuff anyway! Great prices, attentive staff, reasonable prices. I couldn't finish my chicken chimi so I asked for a to go box and my server was happy to box it up for me and she also included a small bag of chips and some salsa for me too. How sweet! I'll definitely be back for a horchata (which wasn't too sweet) refill!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Mexican food!!! The shredded beef burrito with green sauce & beans/rice on the side is EVERYTHING!!! I could eat this everyday!!!! The staff is great too! The owner is so nice!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Had breakfast and dinner there today. Everything we have tried so far has been delicious.  Friendly service, fast and great chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Best Menudo! We moved here from El Paso, Tx and was looking for a place that sold Menudo. We tried a couple of restaurants around town but it wasn't like we were used to back home..we found it here at this place! Owners are wonderful and the menu is awesome!  Its our regular spot to get mexican food just like back home is El Paso!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Great service. Street tacos are the best. Take out food is well executed as well it's our new go to place!"}
{"text":"i'm currently obsess with their breakfast  machaca burrito. i been having one almost 2-3 times a week. its a really small place but really good food. plus the customer service really good super friendly and smiling :))."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy this place! The tacos are really good and the food always tastes really fresh! The staff is also very friendly. I do believe Las Jicaras is closed but Las 15 Salsas has replaced it. The food still tastes the same though! Very fresh and very good!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. We saw it from the street and stopped in for lunch. Very good luck. Great enchiladas and cerveche. Inexpensive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent! Had one of each: asada, al pastor, adobada, carnitas, pollo. Service excellent. Best street tacos I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Good salsa and chips. Food was good. Husband (steak) and son (chicken) loved the street tacos and we all had some of my chicken/steak fajita (meat was slightly overdone especially the steak compared to the street taco meat). Very affordable with many choices on the menu. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, had the red chili stew.  Wonderful good flavor, and plenty of food.   fast service.  I will be going back."}
