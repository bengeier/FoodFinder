{"text":"Great new Thai Cuisine Experts 3rd Location came to Lisgar Dr 7/11 Gas Station Plaza. Food was so fresh you can feel right away. Best customer service and super clean. It's 100% Halal Thai Food. Good luck Thai Cuisine Experts."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came for Mother's day at lunch. They accepted reservation and were open for lunch at 2 pm on Sunday (many Thai places are either not open before 4 pm or don't accept reservations).

We had Pad Thai and chicken cashew - both mild. It was one of the best non spicy Pad Thai dishes I ever had. I liked the Chicken Cashew too - in particular because it was not breaded. We also tried chicken satays which was also very flavorful. The food was prepared fresh as we wait in the kitchen area but there were no lingering smells after that on our clothes. Prices were very reasonable. We paid around 32$ for Pad Thai, Chicken Cashew, and chicken Satays, and had leftovers for home.

The place was clean, nicely painted, well maintained and without overwhelming Thai d√©cor which is a plus for me. The waiter was friendly and helpful in our meal selection.

The place is 5 minutes away from Cineplex Mississauga and it's really suitable for dinner before movie or lunch before Sunday afternoon movie.

We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place!! Customer service is amazing. Gentlemen behind the counter is super helpful and genuine. Food is fresh and made quickly. Green curry chicken is one of the best in all of Mississauga."}
{"text":"This places promises are lot and under delivers, I don't know who's been awarding these people, yeah their food is half decent. I've had better thai food at so many places. Their food tastes more indian than thai, and the place is run by some indian people. People considering this should check out huang and chang thai restaurant at dixie and eglinton, that place is ten times better than this. I'll drive there to have their food any day of the week."}
{"text":"I'm not expecting fresh, made-on-the-streets-of-Bangkok flavour when I go to or order from Thai restaurants in the GTA, but of all the cuisines we have in our super ethnically diverse country here, Thai probably has to be the worst represented. 

I don't say this because there aren't enough Thai restaurants, but rather because there aren't enough good Thai restaurants.  The majority are franchises, run by Chinese people, or in this case, Indian people.  What's wrong with that?  Doesn't taste the way it should, that's what!

I used a 40% off coupon from TasteAway to pick Thai Cuisine Experts over Moonlight in Bangkok because it had a lot more reviews.  My $63 bill became $37, and I thought I'd be scoring big time.  Man, was I wrong.

What arrived was not even $37 worth of food from any Asian take-out place.  I ordered spring rolls (they were supposed to have all kinds of funky stuff in them, but tasted just like any other from a Chinese place), Penang spicy curry seafood, green curry beef, seafood Pad Thai and beef basil noodles.  

The portion... dayyum.  I actually swirled a spoon around in the green curry, and for a moment... thought that they had given me a vegetable version by mistake.  After a solid 10 seconds, a few sorry-looking pieces of beef appeared from the depths.  Which, by the way, weren't deep.  I honestly cannot say I have ever seen a smaller or more cheaped-out on portion.  The same applied to the Penang spicy curry.  A few measly scraps of seafood, and one... count it... one shrimp.  The beef basil was almost all noodles, and the Pad Thai was the only dish that had a reasonable amount of protein in it.  

Once I got past the disappointing portions, I gave everything a taste and found that while nothing was authentic, or even close to it, I rather enjoyed the taste.  Perhaps it had been a while since I've had Thai (or an approximation of it, like in this case), or that sometimes things can taste good without being authentic, but it was alright.  Not full redemption good, but I didn't have to find something else to eat.  I guess that's a plus?

Of note, the beef was cooked well, the seafood (what little there was of it) was not overcooked, and the basil had a great flavour in the noodles.  And while eggplant is not something I eat often (or remember liking), the 3 pieces of eggplant in the green curry were delicious for some reason.  The Pad Thai noodles were not bad (not too sweet like some places), but had some fishy overtones that didn't quite go down that well.  The peanuts they provided us were not crushed enough, lol.  

Would I order from these guys?  Can I get a heeeeellll nooooo?  Not even if $37 was the regular price, and pigs would certainly need to take flight at the regular price of $63."}
{"text":"you get what you pay for. the food is average, but i found my green curry chicken to have a bit of an after taste."}
{"text":"Have you checked this place out yet? If you are in Mississauga you really should!!

Here are (in my opinion) the top three dishes:

- Beef Pad Thai 
- Golden Curry Noodle 
- Coconut Soup with Shrimp 

Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I visit often, they have about 3 locations now and they are only growing. The food is great at all three locations!!

My top three dishes:
- beef pad thai
- golden curry noodle (with any meat of even vegetarian)
- Coconut soup with Shrimp

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great new Thai place in the neighbourhood!  Highly recommend. Enjoyed the Panang Curry and Phad See Ewe tonight and will be back again soon. Fresh and tasty with friendly service."}
{"text":"AT LAST!  It's great to see a friendly new establishment that uses FRESH ingredients!! Not your traditional prepackaged and/or filled MSG dishes.   

They are willing to convert any of the dishes to a vegan friendly one without sacrificing taste and quality!  And as a vegan, it's amazing to know there is a place to go to without concerns or doubts about cross contamination. 

The owner is not only friendly, he makes an admirable effort to remember your name, diet, and also suggests dishes you may like.  

They really go the extra mile! Hopefully it continuos and doesn't fade away as I have seen in the past.  Considering this is their 3rd location and with no corporate office, I'm sure it will continue. 

We'll gone and good luck!"}
{"text":"I've had it before at the Erin mills location and the pad Thai was never this dry and tasteless. Couldn't finish it, it'll probably end up in the trash as what the other reviewer said."}
{"text":"One of the few good Thai restaurants in Mississauga. Small joint but amazingly good. Best part they deliver."}
{"text":"Really good Thai fried rice. Yummy cashew chicken.  Got take out. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch with some colleagues and ordered the Thai Butter Chicken. There aren't many seating areas and space is a little cramped so either go earlier to beat the lunch crowd or grab take-out.

My order wasn't bad but won't be memorable either. I couldn't say what was so \"Thai\" about my butter chicken and also can't say my butter chicken was very... butter chicken.

Overall would probably not return."}
{"text":"I went to Thai Cuisine Experts for the first time on my vacation from California. I ordered fried rice  with a combo. They made my food really fresh and made it on time which. I recommend you people to go check it out.  Co-workers are very friendly makes you feel like home."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. Although this location is mainly a takeout they have and few tables. 
We ordered takeout but we got delayed picking it up and but then the kids (and I) were famished. So we asked if we could eat there. The guy at the counter was very accommodating and even reheated our food. 
Food was delicious too!!! So glad to have a halal Thai restaurant around!"}
{"text":"Very overrated. Food is average. Service is average at best. Go to Spoon & Fork instead (on Lakeshore, east of Southdown)."}
{"text":"Average. That's all I can really say about this restaurant. I ordered a pad Thai and it was better than a few other places that I have eaten pad Thai at, however, it wasn't as good as a my favorite location in Hamilton. 

The quality and quantity of food was decent for the price (a little more on the expensive side). 

The restaurant was small so I took the food to go. The cashier seemed moody (older gentleman) and wasn't very friendly or welcoming. 

Overall, I think this is a mediocre restaurant and might or might not visit it again."}
{"text":"Ordered the papaya and mango salad along with the cashew chicken.

It's a small place in a strip mall that has about 8 tables.  Order up front pay and have a seat or get takeout if you prefer.

The mango salad while not traditional in the Thai sense was still tasty if a bit too salty.  The papaya was sliced into thin spaghetti like noodles and there were chunks of tomatoes along with fresh cilantro, ripe mango, cashews, and peanuts in a light dressing.  My SO's cashew chicken was ok although the large chunks of unpeeled orange in the stir fry was a bit weird.

Putting the word \"expert\" in your name sets expectations that are tough to meet.  A decent fast food court meal is probably more accurate with friendlier service than what you get at a food court."}
{"text":"Thai food after a long crave .. the food rocks though the spicy levels are more of Canadian standards, than the Thai. Overall since it was the first time, we were lucky to have menu recommendations from the owner himself. The Penang curry, Basil rice, noodles, and the stir fry were the star. The Tom Yum soup needs to have more kick. They do not have a dining area due to technical constraints, but we had enough space for 6. The focus of this location is deliveries. I would agree with other yelpers giving them a 5 star rating for their food quality and flavours. The staff was very friendly and particular about how we liked the food. With such attention by all members of any restaurant will certainly make them a success story."}
{"text":"I have only tried the chili chicken here. Its pretty good but this place is mostly for like takeouts and the foos takes at least 15 minutes. Plus the chili chicken was kinda pricey for what you get. Plus this place doesnt look like 100% authentic thai joint."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I got the seafood basil noodles which are to die for! 

I was wary of this place due to its low rating but don't let it fool you. The food they serve is some of the most authentic Thai food I've had in a long time. I'm also picky with my flavours as I expect punch and this definitely delivered. 

Next time I go - I plan to try the massaman curry which is quite hard to find. 

If it helps - this place is halal."}
{"text":"This place just opened up three weeks ago in the old Quizno's location at Grand Park and Burhamthorpe.  

I came in just before 11:30 on a Sunday because I was hungry and ordered the Panang Coconut Curry with chicken. It was 10.99.  

Atmosphere: It's okay.  It's kind of a mix between self-serve and a la carte, though I think they are trying to mostly cater to take-out as I saw a few people doing that.  It was clean though.  

Food: It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either.  It was middle of the road.  The flavour was slighty spicy (I asked for medium), but I thought it was a bit watered down.  I would have preferred more coconut milk in it. On the good side, there was plenty of chicken.

Verdict: I'll probably come back if I really want Thai food, but I'm not itching at the chance to go back either."}
{"text":"I have been working in the offices of this Plaza for a while and only recently tried this place.  What on earth was I waiting for?

Delicious thai food served quickly by an owner who cares.  He always speaks to everyone and his restaurant is open and inviting.

The Chili Chicken is spectacular with crispy veggies and jasmine rice.

You can order online and pick it up moments later.

Pricing is amazing and the food is better."}
{"text":"The place was just meh. Came to dine in on a Tuesday evening and we were the only ones. I was craving Thai food and we were in the square one area so I decided to finally try this place.

Food came out in a timely manner. I got the golden curry noodles with chicken and my friend got the chicken pad Thai. I actually ended up liking his dish better and he liked mine better. The curry was a bit too thick to go with noodles. I probably would have liked the golden curry as a dish with rice better. The texture with the noodles and curry started to get too mushy for me. My friend wasn't crazy about his pad Thai but I liked it better than what I got. I thought the pad Thai was pretty ok. If I lived in the area I would get the pad Thai again. It's a huge serving and can feed two people easily.

I thought it was weird they serve water in styrofoam cups. Less dishes to wash I guess. I agree with other reviews. This place seems more like a take-out place rather than a dine-in. I probably won't come back, as there are better Thai places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Chicken Phad Thai was really good and the peanut chicken too! Small place but its clean and not expensive!!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Yes the portions are really large but quality and taste aren't good.   The pad Thai tasted \"off\". There was a good amount of chicken but it was super dry and tough.  

The woman taking orders and payments was down right miserable.

Do not recommend"}
{"text":"First time ordering but will not go with them again.  Had a combo for two with chicken pad Thai, red curry with chicken and spring rolls. 

The spring rolls were meh. Tasted like grocery store frozen section.

The red curry was ok. Pretty good flavour although a ton of coconut milk makes anything taste decent.  Not much in the way of ingredients beyond that. Maybe three green pepper slices and some peas and onions. Not a lot of chicken. 

The pad Thai was terrible. Again weak on ingredients (very little chicken, bean sprouts, scallions). The only flavour that came through was fish sauce. It was overwhelming and pretty gross. As a component fish sauce is great. When it's the only thing you can taste not so much. 

If a Thai place can't do a decent pad Thai really can't call themselves experts. Will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Viewed side by side, this place would be indistinguishable from the Quiznos that was here before it. Yeah, it looked just like a fast food restaurant. The entire setup of the place was exactly the same as when my mom used to get me Quiznos famous prime rib or chicken carbonara sandwiches. Zero points for the interior.

However, once you get past the fast food/takeout vibe, the nondescript menu, and the uninspired pictures of their dishes, there's actually some decent Thai food here!

I ordered the chicken pad thai, which came up to about $12.50 tax-in. While I wouldn't consider myself an expert in Thai cuisine, I'd say this pad thai rivaled some of the offerings I had in Thailand earlier this year! Their \"spicy\" was reasonably spicy - doesn't hold a candle to true Thai spicy levels but it's definitely a respectable amount of heat. It was a traditionally prepared pad thai with peanuts, beansprouts, green onions, chopped carrots, and lime. There was a large portion of chicken given as well, which to me justified the $12.50.

This place could have spent thousands creating an ambiance comparable to the Thai restaurants of downtown (Pai, Khao San Road, etc), but at the end of the day, they're a fast casual Thai restaurant in a downtown Mississauga strip mall bordered by Pizza Pizza to the left and a physiotherapy clinic to the right. Maybe they just knew their market."}
{"text":"I pretty much concur with most from the other Yelp reviews on here this new place has potential but its going to need a lot of improvement.
 Soon as I walk in I like the open kitchen but it looks like high school kids working the stoves. It was empty for  Thursday evening.  I didn't get a good feeling but still I like supporting new local business.

 I tried the chicken pad thai.. Not that flavorful or great the quantity was just average for the price of $11. I might repeat in about 6 months if I  see more people inside and they have improved otherwise I would avoid. The Mississauga square one area is surely lacking a good independent Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Hadn't found the right Pad Thai until I found this place.  Use to get take out from the original restaurant but this is even better!  My favourite place to get Pad Thai in the GTA!  The lunch Pad Thai special for $10 I've bought for dinner because it can serve 2-3 people easily!  Freshly made with great tasting meats and sauces/spices...staff there is incredibly friendly and do a great job selling their product and it's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced, 14$ for seafood pad thai after tax and it wasn't even good, it was very average. Service wasn't the greatest neither."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this location. I ordered via telephone for pick up and the person on the phone said the food would be ready in 25 minutes. I arrive at the location in 25 minutes and continue to wait for another 30 until my entire order is ready. Some items were ready and sitting for nearly 30 minutes as the food was not all prepared at once. 
One item I ordered was chicken wings. While the portion size was good as the person, whom I believe to be the manager, had to move chicken around to close the lid of the box. Unfortunately he did this with his bare hands after seeing him take cash, answer phones and do other things. 
So after about an hour my entire order is ready and I prepare to pay. I pay via debit. As I'm loading the food into my car, the manager runs out yelling at me that I didn't pay the full amount. Apparently he entered the wrong amount on the debit machine and now I have to go back in. 
A nice gesture would have been to take a little off the remaining balance considering the wait and the error. I ask the manager to consider this and he tries handing me someone else's order, that I've seen sitting out for the entire 30 minutes I was waiting.  
The food was decent. Not up to my typical standards but not overly. 
However, due to the rudeness of the manager, the terrible customer service I will never return to this location. I've been to many other Thai Cuisine Experts and have never had an issue."}
{"text":"Wow well i used to come to this place a few years back and the food was great ..the pad thai was perfect ..but i got it the other day for the first time in maybe 3 years and the quality was Terrible !! What happend ?? In fact All my friends were very disappointed after I told them about the pad thai ...don't i look like a fool ..very poor quality ."}
{"text":"Had the Pad thai with chicken, it was exquisite. The staff were very friendly & gave great suggestions on how to make the food even better"}
{"text":"Going to a restaurant means to enjoy food with hygienic conditions. After we paid for our lunch meal, the lady who took the money started preparing a salad with bare hands without gloves. And the kitchen is dirty you can see it while they are cooking. The mango salad was not a real Thai mango salad. The red curry was not good and a bit bland, but the green curry was nice, but when our food was ready, the lady did not even inform us our food is ready. That is because we told her to wear gloves while preparing the salad. So I suggest going somewhere else for a good meal. My intention is not to write unnecessary bad reviews as I know it hurts the restaurant, but I feel cleanliness and professionalism is very important for healthy reasons."}
{"text":"I loved their Pad Thai and their tofu and veggie coconut curry. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it. It tastes fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Last night I ordered from Thai experts online, it took 2hours which was ridiculous. I called after an hour and 15 minutes to find out the status and the woman that picked up said she has nothing to do with the orders so she can't help and hung up on me. I had to call back 3x until someone finally answered. Their service is really terrible! I'm never ordering from them again. 
I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, chicken satay and spring rolls... the pad Thai wasnt terrible but it wasn't good either. The spring rolls are the only thing that was good"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the best part is that they have super convenient and affordable delivery"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this place! I've been a recurring customer for a very long time and this place always satisfies. 

Granted there may be better Thai joints in the area that I haven't explored, but this certainly trumps a commercial place like Thai Express. The pad thai, tom yum soup and red coconut curry are note worthy in particular.  

Seating arrangements aren't that comfortable, in fact take out is sometimes the better option in that regard. Prices aren't competitive, a touch higher than what you would expect from a place like this. Nonetheless, I do visit this place often for a cooked-in-front-of-you Thai meal."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed an outstanding Thai dinner.  I had the Thai Stir Fry with a Seafood Medley and it was perfect.  I topped of with Singha Beer and must recommend to anyone who likes Thai.  As a bonus,  i enjoyed great conversation with the 2 gentlemen running the restaurant.  No hesitation, this is a 5 star......"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Pad Thai, look no further!! Location is good and price is fair. You get a very big portion for what you pay and you'll love the food here. I also recommend the peanut chicken."}
{"text":"Have if a try as I saw it was a new opening... I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again... But if I was absolutely desperate? Maybe?

I definitely wouldn't have peanuts in it... I thought when I was asked if I wanted peanuts in my golden curry it was more the ground up type...alas no. It was full on sized garlic flavoured peanuts. And although I am a girl that does appreciate the sentiment bigger is better... In this case it almost made the food unpalatable . I also like coconut sticky rice and they definitely didn't have that sadly."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and fresh tasty Thai food! If I lived closer I'd be a regular. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer. The minute you walk in , you are plastered with all these \"awards\" and \"accolades\" they are supposedly receiving. However, what I fail to understand is : who, and more importantly, why?!?

We went around 7 pm,. and the place looked quite busy. We walked upto the counter and were told to sit and someone will come to take our order. Ten minutes later, we ended up walking back upto the counter, and ordering food. Were they apologetic? cosmetically, yes. We ordered food and drinks, come sit down. Ten more minutes pass, no sign of drinks. OK - so we walk upto the counter again to PICK UP OUR OWN DRINKS. You know...this is supposed to be sit down food?

Anyhoos, 40 minutes later the food arrives. And, OK, the food is not bad but its not GREAT either. Its normal thai food, and yes, it tasted more Indian than Thai to me as well. The joint is run by two Indian guys and they could care less we existed. Both were busy filling take out and delivery orders...We eventually finished our food, walked upto him again (after waiting for another ten minutes for him to bring us the bill), got our own takeout boxes, boxed our own leftovers, paid him, and left with a major foul taste in our mouths.

Now I look back and wonder..why the hell did we not just walk out after he failed to bring us our drinks? 

My hunger got the best of me today..hope it doesn't get the best of you. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I had been home sick all week and the rest of the fam was out one night. I was tired of soup and tea and remembered about the \"skip the dishes\" flyer that had arrived. I went online and Thai Cuisine Experts were the only Thai place.....there were a few sushi places and the multi menu axia, but Thai is my favourite so I went with them.
I contemplated between fried rice and pad Thai but eventually went with the pad Thai ($11.99) and added tofu.
The flyer had a $7 off coupon if you spend $15 so I added spring rolls (3/$4.99). There was a delivery charge plus I added tip for the driver.
The food arrived and it was steaming hot. The spring rolls were large, not the mini ones some people give. They were crispy but the inside was mushy. The sauce they sent with it was too gingery for my liking.....
The pad Thai was dry, brown and tasted awful. I took one bite of the noodles and tofu and could not eat the rest.
I presumed my taste buds were off with my illness and put the rest in the fridge for hubby to have the next day. Hubby did try it the next day and without me saying a word, he confirmed the pad Thai was just awful. It finally all ended up in the garbage and that $7 coupon did not make me feel any better about it"}
{"text":"I came here around lunch time but it was not busy so no wait. There is not a big menu with lots of selection like you find in other Thai restaurants. This is a quick serve type with food that is what you'd expect for quick serve."}
{"text":"This place is more of a takeout than a dine-in place. I was a little shock when I came in, I thought it looked like a clinic or a washroom. It is fairly plain inside.

The food was not too bad. A little too greasy and not flavourful as what I'm used to getting for regular Thai food. One plus side is, the meal was large!

In all honesty, I don't think I'll be back in this restaurant. The ambience, no music and the food didn't leave a lasting impression. That is too bad since there is a need for a good Thai food in this area."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon: 

Service is decent- more of a fast food thai experience than a dine in place 

Not too pricey so the food is on par for what you pay for 

Would recommend the red curry!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try!!! My husband and I ordered for the first time today (through skip the dishes app) and were pleasantly surprised. Our order consisted of shrimp crackers with peanut sauce, spring rolls, chicken pad thai and chicken red curry. All of the items were incredible. My only complaint would be to include a larger portion of peanut sauce with the shrimp crackers ;) as the sauce goes fast and it's super tasty! We are very happy to have discovered this hidden gem in our neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"The Pad See Ew, Chicken Pad Thai and Fried rice here are AMAZING ! I absolutely loved it, the flavour in the food is like magic! They have awesome lunch special deals on the daily and the portion sizes are generous!! The place is very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Completely flavorless pad thai, and contained a piece of metal (although admittedly I was thankful when I pulled it out of my mouth to discover it was not a fingernail as I suspected). Never again."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The red curry, though tasty, was extremely watery! With barely any meat in it but mostly big pieces of peppers and peas... The pineapple fried rice tasted ok, nothing special. The curry pad thai was also just ok. Again not a lot of meat, lots of veggies. They also gave us a peanut dipping sauce with our shrimp crackers, but it tasted really off and we prefered to throw it away.  The only good thing were the thai chicken wings."}
{"text":"The food is great and priced reasonably. I recommend the green curry and the Tom yum soup. Good for all weather."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chicken Pad Thai bar none!  It's a small restaurant located in a plaza among other restaurants.  I was skeptical at first when a colleague of mine recommend I should try out their Chicken Pad Thai.  Most of the chicken pad Thais I've had from so claimed \"authentic \" restaurants were always a disappointment.  Either their pad thai sauce is too salty or way too watery.  This place has it down pat and it's always consistent.  Their portions are huge which will definitely fill you up.

In terms of service, the ladies that work there hardly ever crack a smile nor do they offer the best customer service but I always get mine for take out so I don't really care.  As long as my pad Thai tastes good, its all good to me.  If you easily get offended by poor customer service, I would advise you to just shrug it off.  If you love pad thais, I would STRONGLY recommend you hit this place up asap!"}
{"text":"I recently got a new job in the Sheridan Plaza on Leanne Blvd and decided to sample the delights of the restaurants neighbouring my work. As a huge fan of oriental food I made Thai Cuisine Experts the my take-out choice for my first day at work. The variety of options on the menu were decent, I decided to go with the Chicken Pad Thai with a side of Jasmine Rice. 

So after taking a look at the menu and making up my mind, I approached the register where the cashier stood with the most miserable look on her face to ask me what she could get for me. I replied telling her my  order and that I would like it for take out. After making my payment, she informed me that it would take about 5 mins. 

As I waited, I was praying that the food would compensate for the quality of service I had just received. Thankfully, my prayers were answered as I chowed down the delicious food. It was well prepared and seemed fresh. 

It is unfortunate that the quality of service didn't match the quality  of their food I would've rated them a 4 Star!"}
{"text":"We felt like Thai food for dinner so I decided to take a chance and order from Thai Cuisine Experts - which I ended up regretting.  We ordered chicken pad Thai and chicken green curry.  WE WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR OUR FOOD - I called several times and each time the person picking up the phone reassured me the driver (also the owner) would be there in a few minutes - only for another 40 minutes to go by. When the driver/owner finally arrived, he told me I waited almost two hours because \"the roads were bad\" ...considering our food arrived at 7:40pm and the restaurant is about 10 minutes away, this excuse was just  unrealistic. If I knew it would take this long I would have NEVER ordered from this place. He didn't offer a discount, phone call or anything in lieu of the ridiculous wait to redeem their customer service.

The food itself was nothing special & not worth the hassle.

THIS WAS A FIRST AND A LAST!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. The green chicken curry was amazing. The portion was a perfect size for lunch. The person who took my order asked me how spicy I wanted it and I chose \"spicy\". It had a lot of red pepper flakes, but was not over the top spicy. I will definitely return and probably order the same thing."}
{"text":"Love the Thai food here! SO good. Service isn't the best and the prices are a bit high - but food is yummy and they deliver"}
{"text":"This place is getting quiet disappointing and with each visit the amount of food they serve you for the price they charge is getting a bit ridiculous. 
Last few times I have ordered their dish,they literally gave me 7 pieces of thinly slivered chicken with oversized vegetables. And NOT worth the money. I'd say save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I heard this place has good curry meals. I tried the  chicken panang curry. It's about $11.00 per order. 
There are 3 levels of spicy heat to choose from: mild, spicy, hot. If you don't like spicy food then it's better to request NO SPICE because a spicy mild order can be quite spicy for others.
Parking at the plaza in front of the restaurant is huge.
The staff or owner is very friendly and went the extra mile to make his customers feel important. 
Every time I visit this resto, I will try other curry meals."}
{"text":"Ordered take out: 
Shrimp pad Thai for 12.99 and chicken basil Thai noodles for 11.99.
The portion size is huge! 
But there was no flavour to the shrimp pad Thai. It was dry, mostly just tasted like egg. Very disappointing.
The basil noodles were better, but still not worth it. It was oily but had more flavour than the pad Thai atleast. 
Would I go back? Definitely not! I'd rather order from Thai express at the mall."}
{"text":"Went there to grab a quick snack
Ordered spring rolls and some fried calamari
I was watching the last fry the calamari in the deep fryer. Upon being done, she transferred the calamari into the to-go container for me. During this transfer process, one of the round pieces fell on the floor. She didn't realize I was watching and she bent down to the floor, picked up the piece and put it in the container. I caught her and told her that this is not acceptable. She tried to give me a reason that the floor was clean. Then after the embarrassment, the cashier got her a fresh stock and she dried again. I was ok with that but if I wasn't watching, I would've been served a piece from the floor. Ewwwww outright disgusting!"}
