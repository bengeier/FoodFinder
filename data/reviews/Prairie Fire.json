{"text":"I went in to get a chia latter today like I have for awhile now. The coffee or the service has ever been great, but today was just not good at all. The cashier was rude when I asked for my chia, there was a lot of people so she might have just been flustered, but that's the job.  Next the woman making the chia made me a small instead of a medium, she realized that and took it back. When I got the chia I ordered it was cold and it was about 1/2 inch empty. I took the cup back and asked the older woman ( who I presume was the manager) and she was mad and even yelled at me to tell me she had no idea what this was if I wanted to remake it. She made the second chia, this time it was hot, but now it was about an inch empty.  

The service was bad and the coffee was a tip off. This is the last time I get anything from there."}
{"text":"This is, first and foremost, a campus cafe. As such, one should not come expecting gourmet coffee and snacks. That being said, compared to other campus offerings, it's really not bad at all. There's a great selection of coffees, which are generally decent or good. The cafe snacks are less reliable and tend to be dry and bland.

The ambiance is great. There is a nice little fireplace, a neat old piano (that is occasionally being played), comfy seats, and nice jazz or classical background music. Sometimes the staff is a bit grouchy (it's mostly students, so don't expect warm, happy greetings during finals), but sometimes they're quite friendly and happy to chat. I definitely feel comfortable recommending Prairie Fire to my friends and family."}
{"text":"As a coffee stop, Prairie Fire is okay.  Their coffees, especially their specialty coffees such as lattes and mochas etc don't really have that \"coffee\" taste that I'm looking for.  So for me, those drinks taste a lot more like sweetened milk.  Overall, they have a nice sitting environment though, with tables and comfy armchairs."}
{"text":"I'm here at least three times a week so I can't really give this anything less than three stars. I don't know very many people who come here for the wine or tapas. I do know during the lunch rush there's a small selection of food items, e.g. juice, soymilk boxes, baked goods, and Badger Market sandwiches in the grab and go area. 

I recently figured out that they'll do iced coffee in my thermos, which is a relief since it's better than the regular drip coffee. An extra shot of espresso (red eye) will do the trick if ice isn't your thing. 

Thank the marketing gods for those incentive punch cards."}
{"text":"I'd say this coffee shop lived up to the requirement. :)

They had pretty much every coffee drink you would expect as well as different milk choices including Soy.  Had the sugar free syrups as well as the fresh whipped cream.  I had mostly flavored drinks like Salted Caramel Mocha and Carmel Macchiato (sp?) so I'm not sure if the coffee was super quality as it is hidden by all the other flavors, but it did the job and service was friendly.

If I need a pick me up when at Wisconsin-Madison University, I'd come back here."}
{"text":"The Regular Coffee is okay. The Lattes are okay. And the cappuccinos are also okay. All in all, just okay."}
{"text":"Though its a cute and convenient location, I'll never be visiting this coffee shop again. The cashier, presumably a manager, forgot to give me my change. When I noticed and informed her, she didn't believe me and was rude and very reluctant to give me my money. On top of all that, the coffee was not good and the chai latte I got was downright gross. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Convenient place to grab a quick bite. Coffee and some bakery items are fine. Tried their lemon bars today. Tasted like raw egg. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Prairie Fire is the combo coffee shop / wine bar at Union South. Featuring Peet's products and Wisconsin wines, it's a cute little corner to grab a drink. While giving an unofficial tour of Union South to some alumni, we decided to get drinks to go before heading out. 

The staff was really friendly and waited patiently while we dawdled and asked questions. One of us decided to get iced coffee, and was pleased to find it was actually pre-chilled and ice-free, keeping it from becoming weak and watered-down. My friend and I went with Frios, their take on a Frappucino.

I asked if the Madagascan Vanilla Frio was caffeine-free like its Starbuck's counterpart, and the girl told me it was a coffee drink but that she could make it with decaf. I can't have any caffeine, so I said no thanks, but she then offered to make it with no coffee. Awesome. It was pretty tasty, but the mix was clearly concocted with coffee in mind to balance it out. 

The other drink was an Oreo Frio, which the girl was quick to point out was a misleading name as it contained no Oreos, but was rather a mix of chocolate and vanilla syrup. When the person ordering responded with \"oh,\" the girl quickly offered to crush up some Oreos and blend it in. He passed, but it was awesome of her to try to make it right/into the drink he expected when ordering something with Oreo in the title. 

It wouldn't hurt for Prairie Fire to add some descriptions to their signage, but since the staffer was kind in answering our questions and told us upfront what to expect it isn't a necessity."}
