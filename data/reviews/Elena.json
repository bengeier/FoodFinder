{"text":"The last restaurant so far on notre dame west - good vibe - nice setting for pizza and pasta and a few good beverage plus open late and on Sunday"}
{"text":"This is some good pizza. I got the classic margherita and it was delicious. The only thing that I think can be better again is the dough, it being a bit more airy (this is just me being whiny and nit-picking). But everything else was great, especially the sauce to cheese to dough ratio.  The service is quick and good. And the decor is very nice too, very minimalist chic (this is me trying to talk like I know shit). Would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambience.  Delicious new addition to the neighborhood of St-Henri. I had ordered the gnocco fritto as my appetizer and the margherita pizza as my main. Best thin crust pizza I have had to date. I will definitely be returning in the near future.  I highly recommend to book a reservation online before heading there."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends to have dinner. What an amazing Room, design stand point alone this place was beautiful, Spacious and sleek which created a buzzing ambience. Food was amazing from start to finish and they had a great wine selection. Will definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Overall elena is a fabulous restaurant in St Henri. I was a bit thrown off by the location (a bit far from other well know restaurants in St Henri) but the restaurant is beautiful and a great size (even for groups). The food was also really good. The kale Cesar salad was fantastic and the seafood salad was perfectly balanced in terms of flavour. The pizza was ok but I found the sauce a bit sweet for my liking and the I also tend to like my pizza slightly more cooked. Plan on going back. Totally recommend it to others"}
{"text":"Went there last night. On Notre Dame but West of De Courcelles in an area without many new restaurants (for now), which makes it quite easy to park. Decor and vibe very cool. Food was excellent, had the Kale salad (simple but really really good), Margherita pizza which was great (think Bottega but a bit thinner), pastas were very solid and tasty (medium in size). Also had the Dorado which was very tasty but would have been nicer if deboned and served by the wait staff. Service was friendly and efficient. The only negative (and the reason for not giving it 5 stars) was the music, quite loud (and I don't mind loud) but didn't love the playlist....some sort of techno-disco-funk type music. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I tried out this restaurant a month ago with a friend for an early supper; getting a reservation for a table is a challenge, let me tell ya! Located on the west end of Notre Dame street, the location was a surprise to say the least, considering this area isn't exactly chic for a restaurant of this caliber; the sleek modern decor and retro design touches make for a very beautiful space and great laid back feel.   We opted for the suppli al telefono (rice croquettes) as a starter and both loved the moist croquettes and delicious tomato sauce; the pecorino cheese added a touch of savoury to the sweetness of the dish and the execution was bang on!  We ordered two pizzas for our mains including the margherita and diavolo. If you can impress with your simplest pizza then you're laughing; the crust was perfectly chewy, thin but not flimsy, so it holds those generous toppings perfectly. The pepperoni on the diavolo pizza was delicious and there was the perfect amount of heat to really give that pizza a kick, although my friend found it a little too much. The mozzarella and the sauce were perfect! I haven't had a good slice of wood oven pizza like this in a while! We ordered the cannolis and a cherry financier for dessert and both were amazing, although the cannoli with the pistachios and honey were really unique and out of this world tasty!   This spot is a great addition to the strip and is definitely my go to now for a nice casual evening in a great space, good service and of course, delicious pizza."}
{"text":"On habite le quartier et on a voulu essayer ce resto dès la première semaine d'ouverture. On a été accueilli chaleureusement par Ryan. Un chic type, qui nous a prit le temps de nous renseigner sur son resto. Un excellent cocktail et quelques minutes plus tard nous avions déjà une table. S'ensuivit un excellent service, de la bonne bouffe, nous avons prit les pâtes, une pizza, et une entrée à deux.  Tout était excellent, prix totalement abordable, joli décor. On est vraiment enchanté qu'un aussi bon resto ouvre aussi près de chez-nous.  Encouragez les resto locaux et restez loin des chaînes populaires, pour que d'excellents restaurant comme Elena puisse prospérer!   PS : Il y aurait même des rumeurs de terrasse pour l'été!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with the service. Did they tell us there was two different menu's??? Did they tell us we had to make reservations at the main restaurant ?? Did they even tell us there was 2 restaurants?? I give them a big fat ZERO!  My friend was taking me out for my bday and called to make reservations, she asked for the terrace but they don't take reservations which is ok, being the first time we called you'd think he'd tell us the options. He said it was no problem to get a seating, but he didn't mention it was for downstairs!!! Did we know??? The icing on the cake is I passed by Tuesday night to ask if a reservations had been made,the guy just said for sure she must have made it didn't want to bother to check!! I took his word for it, Big mistake, she hadn't & showing up and explaining our ordeal they just let us leave with a sorry!! I will NOT recommend this place, sorry !"}
{"text":"This place was quite busy on a fri at ten pm. This place is fairly new. I was excited to try it because I love pizza and I've only been to Nora Gray once but I really enjoyed it.   We sat at the bar. We got the gnocco fritto to start based on the barmaid's recommendation. It's basically three pieces of warm, fried dough with toppings on the side. The dough was like  an unsweetened donut but in the shape of an eggroll. It's empty inside. Next to it was a meat that was similar to a thick salami and then another meat similar to prosciutto, and then marinated eggplant. It was very good. You can put all the stuff inside the dough.   Then we had the diavolo pizza. It was a bit long for them to make it but it was worth the wait. The barmaid recommended the mushroom pizza and the margarita pizza but we wanted something with meat on it. The diavolo pizza has pepperoni, tomatoes, chili peppers, and mozzarella di bufala. I added spicy oil to make it even spicier. I paired it with a montepulciano d'abruzzo red wine. It was super dry but once it was aerated it was so good!   Mmm i will definitely be going back!   I like the vibe and the decorations. There's a white brick wall and a marble looking bar. It was very zen."}
{"text":"When I heard that the group behind Nora Gray, one of my favourite restaurants in the city, was opening a second restaurant, I got excited. When I heard that it would based around pizza AND be in St-Henri, closer to my neighbourhood in the Point, well that made me very happy indeed. For many months, we heard online about details of the upcoming space until eventually Elena opened up. Reviews were very positive to start so I found myself there for a relax Sunday date night hoping that I had found a great pizza place to enjoy.  For a Sunday night, Elena was certainly busy! The space is a sparse modern vibe - lots of whites and grays. The lighting is mostly ambient and indirect - a strong similarity to Nora Gray but the size and colors of the space make Elena less intimate compared to its sister. The interesting element of the space is the serving counter in the middle of the room used for alcohol, olive oils, salt, pepper, wine glasses, etc. It adds a interestingly retro element but the modern style of the table fits the look they have going.  The menu is small but covers more than just pizza. There are also some salads, some entrees, some meats and pasta options to enjoy! We decided to start with a plate of Gnocco fritto - basically fried pizza dough puffs served with housemade red wine sausage, mortadella, soppressata and marinated eggplant. I found the soft pillowy texture of the fried dough nice but the real treat of this dish is the homemade charcuterie. Nice and rich across the board - I was a big fan of sopressata and the sausage.  For mains, we had a desire for pizza so we stuck to pizza. My fiancé went with the margherita - tomatos, basil and mozza di bufala. I went with the Bianco - potato, pancetta, onions and kénogami cheese. Elena does Napoletana-style pizza - the dough is lightly chewy, the crust barely charred and pillowy. There is no crunch to the bottom. The pizza requires you to fold it because it will not hold on its own. Based on that style, Elena nails the dough - if you are expecting a crispy base, you will not get that here. I enjoyed the chewy pillowy texture immensely.  However, we both had issues regarding the topping on our pizza. For the margherita, my fiancé found the tomato 'sauce' very thin and watery. It felt like the pizza should have had more tomatoes than it did and thus the balance between the cheese and tomatoes felt off. In my case, I liked the flavour of the Bianco but I also felt like there is a lack of the quantity of the toppings. When I compared to other Napoletana-style pizzas places in the city, I feel like I got more toppings on the pizza than this. It is a subtle thing but we both left feeling slightly disappointed in our pizzas.   I love Nora Gray so this visit was a bit of a letdown for me personally. It was fine but given how highly I rate Nora Gray, fine is not what I was expecting from their pizza. I am now very interesting in seeing what I get while in Naples this summer on our next trip because I wonder how close Elena is to traditional pizzas and how what I have had locally impacted my enjoyment of their pizza. Pizza can be a very personal experiment so I'm sure Elena's pie will satisfy many but for the moment, it is not my preference.  Cheers!"}
