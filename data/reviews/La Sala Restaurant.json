{"text":"Ein absolutes Highlight. Kleines feines italienisches Restaurant mit sehr leckerer Speisekarte.  Das Preissystem ist denkbar einfach und fair. Alle Desserts  kosten zum Beispiel 6 Dollar. Alle Appetizer 12 $. Main und Second Piati 20 bzw. 24 $. Finde ich eine klasse Sache.  Der Service war ausgezeichnet. Sehr aufmerksam und wirklich von Herzen freundlich.  Das Restaurant wirkt innen wie ein Wohnzimmer mit offener Küche. Sehr gemütlich als wäre man bei Freunden zu Gast.  Die Speisekarte ist übersichtlich, was für mich immer ein sehr gutes Zeichen ist, da man davon ausgehen kann, dass die Zutaten frisch sind und selbst zubereitet. Für jeden Italien Liebhaber ist was dabei- außer Pizza- und das ist auch gut so .  Tolle Weinkarte mit schöner Auswahl an Rot-, Weiß- und Roséweinen."}
{"text":"Amazing!   The whole grilled Seabass was the best I have had. We are from California so are no strangers to great food from the sea.  The rest was delish as well with very reasonable prices.  Highly recommend to all and will be back here on the next trip."}
{"text":"Heard about La Sala from locals who had seen the restaurant in passing. We decided to try it out while at the Jazz Festival. Service was impeccable and attentive, food was outstanding and well presented but most of all cooked to perfection and delicious, as were the desserts. Decor was calming and elegant.  Prices were very fair and we received a warm welcome from the owner. We'll definitely be retuning customers and I highly recommend this restaurant.  In bocca al lupo!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love La Sala, and have been coming here for years. Last week my husband and I hosted our wedding dinner here for 30 guests, and everyone was raving about the food (note, at least half of our guests have worked in the restaurant industry, at least 3 were once chefs in upscale Toronto restaurants).   We offered a reduced menu of the black cod, lobster risotto, cornish hen, and butternut squash ravioli. I personally sampled all of it, and everything was delicious. If I wasn't the bride I would have probably drank the juice the cod was dressed it - delicious. My usual go-to at this restaurant is the seafood linguini, and we'll be returning soon so I can get my fix.  We were beyond impressed with the professionalism in organizing our event with Hameen, and the staff on shift that evening. We had our event on the second floor, which was beautiful and intimate. Gus was our primary server, and he was flawless. Thank you for making our day so special!"}
{"text":"We live near by and decided to check this place out for our Friday date night. Reviews looked awesome, and the menu had so many vegetarian options which is key for me. We called and were able to get a 9 pm reservation (we called at 8), but generally I think they are fairly busy, so calling ahead is the way to go. Overall, food was awesome. My husband had the taglietelle with beef, and I had the gnocchi. The only thing that kept this from 5 stars was the service. I feel bad because maybe our server was having an off night, but he really wasn't on his game. We only got bread when another server offered it to us, and there was just a general sense of being flustered...but everyone has bad nights sometimes. Still, not enough to keep us from coming back because the food was great, with good portion sizes and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Mit einem Wort: Hammer. Tolles italienisches Restaurant mit gehobenem Ambiente, sehr freundlicher und professioneller Servive, kleine aber feine Karte und tolle Weinauswahl. Gemuese aud den Punkt gegart, die Vorspeise (goatcheese) ein Traum und dann auch noch eine tolle Bruschetta als Gruss aus der Kueche aufs Haus. Auch das Dessert sehr gut und dabei sehr fair kalkuliert. Waere ich ein local, dies waere definitiv eines mei er Stammrestaurants, wenn es mal etwas feiner zugehen darf."}
{"text":"Ate here again last week and it was even better than previous times. The service was excellent the atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. Only one thing I would change and that is the lighting it seems a little bright.  The shrimp appetizer is delicious, I could eat the sauce with a spoon its so good but the best is dipping your bread.  I live in the area and it is so nice to finally have a restaurant like this in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We must have caught them on a day when their a-team was unavailable. Sometimes when that happens, I will skip the review until I can come back a second time. But in this case, the impression they left was too deep for me to want to revisit.  Of the two appetizers, two mains and two desserts that I tried, only one item - the shrimp appetizer - was a hit. It had six or so smallish, tail-on shrimp resting in a very nice lemon and paprika sauce. From there, it went downhill.   The roasted peppers and bufala had all the described ingredients assembled side by side on a plate, with none of them being particularly noteworthy.  The seafood linguini was one of their higher priced mains, but I would have been disappointed at half the price. The seafood was scant and rubbery and felt like it was shaken out of any supermarket frozen seafood mix. The pasta sauce had an unpleasant ammonia note in it.   The tuna steak was an extremely generous portion with a large helping of veggies.  Although the puttanesca was excellent, the tuna itself was flavourless. Tiramisu was completely unrecognizable. Served  in a bowl of mostly whipped cream, I could not detect the slightest hint of coffee.   But the thing that really prompted me to write this review were the sounds and smells of the restaurant.  At no other restaurant have I ever felt so much a part of the dishwashing process.  The clanging, the banging, the buzzing and whirring sounds loud enough to compete with our conversation and close enough to let us smell the dish soap was an expected bonus that really took us feeling closer to the art of dish cleaning.    Chef, on your nights off, you need to either close the shop or leave the place in better hands."}
{"text":"Did a takeaway from here for an anniversary dinner at home. Had the romaine/fennel/kale salad, the pappardelle bolognese, the risotto spinaci, the lemon rosemary chicken and tiramisu. Everything was delicious and they even included a container of Parmesan for us. Will definitely be back and I highly recommend this restaurant. Delicious food and friendly people. Reasonable prices for a nice restaurant too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were four people and a Newborn. Thanks to the host we got a table for dinner even though we didn't reserve. The service was fast and the staff friendly and on task including the kitchen crew. The dishes were all delicious and authentic. My Gnocchi were outstanding."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot! We have tried pretty much every dish on the menu since moving back into the neighbourhood last year. While we might have our favourites, Chef's creations are all excellent! LOVE the squid ink risotto! Only thing I might say is that there could be more wine by the glass choices"}
{"text":"So we moved out of The Beach to Leslieville this past April, mainly because the food scene is non-existent, everything closes around 9pm and you have to deal with tourists and traffic during the warm months.   Then this place opens up.  What a great little restaurant. The husband and wife team were like Italian friends who have you over for dinner and spoil you.  So party of four: we had 2 kale/fennel salads and 1 arugula/caprino salad.  Entrees: veal scaloppine, grilled calamari, shrimp, pappardelle bolognese.   Dessert: 2 tiramisu w/4 spoons. 2bottles of Chianti & great company.  From start to finish, delicioso. I know that's not Italian, but hey, I'm from California.    Now we have a reason to come back to this area.  BTW Toronto, your Italian food kicks butt!  Last thing, they close at 11pm. Say what?"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant over 5 times. I really like it because it's classy and the food is delicious! It's suitable for children that are well behaved ;) its small and cozy . My kids LOVE the pasta dishes. The chef is Italian so the dishes are authentic. Last night I had the very delicious shrimp appetizer made with garlic, smoked paprika , lemon . The staff is friendly with good service.?Definitely eating here again"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here last month. Beautiful atmosphere. Like eating in an Italian living room. The whole place is warm colors and hardwood details. The wine list was reasonable. I had a bottle of Chianti for under $40. The food was the centerpiece. It is broken up under different pricing categories. I had the grilled calamari and it was perfectly cooked. The husband is the chef from Italy and his wife a gracious hostess. This place is a welcomed addition to Beach eateries."}
{"text":"We went down for my wife's birthday and we had an amazing meal.the service was fantastic.Theresa was a great waitress and a big shout-out to Stephen who made our night.we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This has now become our favourite little restaurant. The staff are so warm and welcoming. We have been here 4 or 5 times now and we have had Audrey as our waitress a few times.  She is amazing...her recommendations are spot on!  The food is out of this world....I have never been disappointed and I have tried quite a few entrees. The portions are great and the prices are quite reasonable.  I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"When this restaurant first started it was excellent, the Italian owner and chef and his wife managed the restaurant. They sold it and it was not the same anymore. It went downhill.....it's sad. I will not go back there again ...."}
{"text":"Great service and food at reasonable price!  Chef is from Rome.  We had Father's Day dinner there with 2 teens.  Squash stuffed ravioli was EXCEPTIONAL, grilled calamari was best EVER.  I will also agree with the other review, tiramisu was best ever and I've eaten it all around Italy and seriously the chocolate torte was crazy good.  I have no connection to the restaurant but I hope it succeeds, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is simply amazing!   The owners, staff and decor is very comforting.   I had the gnocchi which tasted like little pillows of heaven haha.  My boyfriend had the arrabbiata with sausages and he said it was also delicious.  Generous portions and reasonable pricing!   Will definitely come back and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is intimate and the staff are warm and attentive. I was trying it for the first time and was pleased with my experience. They brought a well prepared and generous slice of bruschetta for each person at the table, on the house. I shared the shrimp appetizer and we both loved the rich garlic laden juice shrimps are served in. Next was the gnocchi, which was perfect for sharing with my friend who shared her lobster ravioli. We both likes the gnocchi but thought the cheese was too stiff and would have blended better with the gnocchi if softer. The ravioli was well prepared but far too salty for me. That is my only complaint. Everything else was very enjoyable and. Reasonable prices for what I had.  I plan to return to this little beach gem on Waverley at Queen."}
{"text":"We waited at our table for 15 minutes, waitress looked us a couple times, tried to flag her down at least for a water. No luck, the four of us walked out, not something I've had to do before"}
{"text":"Cute, cozy resto in the Beaches. Amazing food and service. We ordered the beef carpaccio to start, followed by the butternut squash ravioli and pappardelle bolognese. Both pasta dishes were authentic and delicious! For dessert, we had tiramisu and the Sacher torte, which is just a rich chocolate cake. Of course, this was entirely too much food so we had leftovers for a late night snack :)"}
{"text":"We have been to La Sala a few times and the food is consistently delicious. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and attentive service. I have taken one star off because the chef seems to be a bit short tempered. I've witnessed him berating the manager at the front of the restaurant. Unprofessional in many ways."}
