{"text":"The cabbage rolls, pierogies, and croquettes we have tried have all been delicious.  Also love their potato salad.  It's very different than what I've had before, but it's rich and delicious.  A nice compliment to the food we've bought.  We also enjoy browsing the shelves for a treat of delicious chocolate, or European cookies.  The prices are reasonable, considering the food is all home-cooked and high quality.   The store reminds me very much of the German deli I used to regularly go to with my Oma when I was growing up."}
{"text":"Love this little Polish market. Delicious desserts and the frozen perogies are wonderful, so many varieties to choose from."}
{"text":"Damn, you hafta try the cabbage rolls and the perogies from the Little Polish Market.   It is worth popping in and checking out this traditional polish market.  And while you are there, pick up some cabbage rolls and perogies for dinner.  You will come back for more."}
