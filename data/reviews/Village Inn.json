{"text":"Just got to this location and brought my family from out of town. First impressions, restroom is a mess! Will give more details after meal is done...

update* 
Service is a little bit better. Waitresses looked super tired, probably from working long hours... She is polite tho. Wait time for our table was ok... Not too long."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on July 23rd, 2015.

I actually went here, primarily at least, to use a coupon for a free slice of pie with adult entree purchase. When we walked in, it was quiet and there were plenty of tables available, with one group paying for their meal at the counter. I stood there for at least three minutes waiting for a hostess to seat me, which is ridiculous considering there were multiple staff members roaming around doing, well, nothing.

After sitting down, our waitress came over and took my drink order, which was promptly filled. She returned and I placed my order, the Ultimate Breakfast, featuring pork sausage, bacon, ham, and a small stack of pancakes. To my delight, she asked how I wanted my eggs cooked, though eggs weren't even listed in the description for the Ultimate Breakfast. I waited for my food for a bit, and it was very tasty, though the ham steak was very tough. Nothing beats a bit of strawberry syrup on those pancakes! Afterwards, I ordered a slice of the Chocolate Caramel Delight pie, which was absolutely to die for - a great way to end a rather blah meal.

Overall, this Village Inn met my expectations. The waitstaff was not the best, but certainly acceptable. For a national chain, the food is pretty good. I would definitely come back if I had a coupon or if I was looking for a budget breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great place for any meal and menu with a lot of selections ... for breakfast available all day and night (I highly recommend the VIB Village Inn Breakfast where you can select eggs, potatoes, toast or pancakes, french toast, meat of choice including turkey sausage), lunch (I love the adult grilled cheese and tomato soup), or for Friday all-you-can-eat cod fish! Very nice staff and ask for Joey - a great server!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ and I've only been to a couple of Village Inn locations (this being one of them). I've had my fair share of diner-type restaurants in California; being that we have Denny's and Norm's in abundance over there. I'll have to admit though, this Village Inn. has good food like most I've tried but truly stands out for their fantastic customer service! I've been here on three different occasions and all have been pretty consistent (food and service). One other thing that I like about this location is that it's one of their newer restaurants and I personally like \"new\" and they have FREE WiFi to boot. Oh and I almost forgot, try their new iced coffees... they're pretty good!"}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot and now it seems something has gone wrong. My husband and I stopped by at 8PM-ish on a Saturday night. The place had maybe 5 tables full of people with over 2 wait staff and yet our service was horrible! 

We ordered our dinners and when we got our dinner salads the lettuce was so brown I couldn't even eat it. Which really disapointed me since I like their ranch dressing. The waiter never came back so we couldn't complain - the next time we saw him our dinner was there. By that time we were already speaking to the manager letting her know we were leaving and wanted to pay for our drinks and just cancel our order.

The manager was very nice and apologetic - she took care of our drinks and we left without eating. The manager's reaction is th eonly reason I gave this 2 stars instead of only one."}
{"text":"food and service both great. i really like their french dip"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there on a very hot afternoon wanting a refreshing milkshake.First off,my wife worked Flagstaff V. I.,before she had a stroke.Second,I work at RedMountain Tire&Auto.The hostess,waitress,or whatever she was,asked if she could help us.I replied that we wanted a milkshake.She leaned over the counter and pointed across the street,and said \"theres a DairyQueen across the street there,and they can make you a milkshake,if thats what you want. I was rather shocked, because even at 5min before closing time did my wife turn a customer away. Needless to say,my money went to Dairy Queen. Thank you."}
{"text":"Servers,and pie are great.....everything else is lukewarm, tasteless and definitely overpriced.   Sad, as we would love to have a good restaurant near our home..."}
{"text":"The food is about what your expect from a typical diner/restaurant. The pies are good but not the best. Service has been good but slow. The servers always seem to have too large of sections to take care of efficiently. The front end staff seems to vanish when needed. A server finally seated us when there wasn't a host in sight. Then when it was time to pay there wasn't anyone at the cash register. Because we are honest people we waited around for her to show up so we could pay. Has a nice quiet atmosphere which is good."}
{"text":"This restaurant showed an inappropriate, grisly, graphic HLN TV program during our entire meal. The program showed close-ups of autopsies and murder victims with blood spattered body parts. Not very appetizing. We moved to another table farther from the TV, but the show was still in our sight-line from that table also. The manager was \"too busy\" to change the channel. The situation was doubly bad because we we there with our grandchildren."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried steak was way over done and reminded me of a Salt block I would give to a horse. Restrooms and overall restaurant were clean. Isaac was courteous but I felt rushed when I left the check at the same time he brought our food out."}
{"text":"Not a bad place considering the area. I went here with a couple co-workers as they were craving pie. So that's all we had and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I always used to go to this location but recently they have been taking so long to seat me. Even if I was waiting before everyone else they all got seated before I did. Some of the waitresses are also very rude and roll their eyes when I ask for something extra. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service - about 45 minutes for a nearly empty restaurant, missing ingredients in the California skillet that wasn't corrected, sides not coming out with the meal, a cheeseburger my burger addicted son wouldn't eat, flecks of cheese in his applesauce, and overall disappointing food that was served as ordered (not a significant percentage of out total order). I gave up mentioning problems to our server, and the manager on duty did give us a discount when I went to pay the check after I mentioned a few of the issues, but looking back at our receipt it turned out to be half what she told us it was going to be. We are just glad to be done with this experience, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service sucked. Waitress kept rushing us and wouldn't come back to refill our waters or give us our ranch. And the one of the girls who we tried to get her attention that wasn't out waiter, she was rude too. The hot coffee was cold too."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. It's only good food if your a senior citizen. The waitress appeared to be on something for she kept forgetting things when I'd ask. My fries were very old and obviously put into the grease a second time just to be warmed up. Only coming here for the pie for now on."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good but the last time the service was bad,  they messed up our order and said they were going to take a discount off our bill but didn't.  I will go to a different one next time!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! I came in specifically for a lemon supreme pie for my mothers birthday tomorrow. I got a chocolate as well. The cashier was bagging them up and dropped the lemon supreme face down on the ground. He said he would check in the back. Nothing in back. Arent these things just frozen anyways?! Theres gonna be a delivery of pies before they reopen? I mean its 11pm already.I have to come in on a  busy saturday morning to pick up a pie. This is what i was trying to avoid in the first place. He didnt offer to save me one in the morning or take a dollar or two off of the other one or anything. Ive been in this business..... train your cashiers better on how to handle things like this."}
{"text":"Got the build your own omelette with carnitas and tomatoes. It was very good. The pancakes that came with it seem smaller than they used to be but that's good because I never finished them anyways. The waiter Jorge was awesome on top of everything before you even had to ask. :-)"}
{"text":"Visit #1 Extremely poor service. The waitress was rude and obviously poorly trained. She dropped the food and drinks off at the side of the table, was a bit sassy, frowning, and never came to check on us or ask if we needed anything else. As someone who has worked in the service industry, I know its not that hard to at least pretend you like your job and do things right. My friend's icecream had hair in it, the mocha I got was just an iced coffee, and another friend's sprite was extremely watery. To top it off, the manager wasn't even apologetic and seemed completely unconcerned with our less-than-enjoyable experience. I eat out frequently, and have of course had some crappy servers and food, but this was one of the worst.


Visit #2 Tried it again to see if maybe it was just a bad day for them... Was still really let down. My friend received her pie that had whipped cream in the picture with no whipped cream. Upon asking for some, she was informed that she would be charged $3 for it... She then pointed out that it was on the picture, which the waiter then went on to argue that it was something else. However, he did go off to ask a manager afterwards and bring her some whipped cream - free of charge. We both got this lemonade drink with blueberries in it. The blueberries were shriveled and seemed very old + tasted weird."}
{"text":"We normally love Village Inn. This location sucks. Food came out burnt, service took forever to fill drinks, cooks came out to glare at us when we complained about the burnt waffle. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. There's an IHOP or Black Bear diner down the street on Baseline. This joint isn't worth it the time and aggravation. Wouldn't be surprised it flops in the first year or 2. Management didn't care at all about this place."}
{"text":"I like the menu options at here for breakfast. We go about once a week. The service is good and the people are friendly. The manager says hello to people and seems to really care if you are happy. I have never had the pie because the meals are so filling, but they look yummy."}
{"text":"Food was good. The service is poor. The restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The first time the waitress spilled food on me and with no apology. I returned again another time just to appease my daughters. Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs. But my real gripe was the glasses. They were filthy. All of them. I couldn't use them, they just put me off. The inside of the glasses had this build up of grime and dirt on them.  I won't be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Went here to village inn for the first time, and it was awful. Had to wait 10 minutes for a waiter to come and ask for our drinks. The bathrooms were not clean and smelt super bad. Ordered a diet coke and a sandwich dipper. The meat lovers dipper with soup. Which was suppose to have Texas toast, Swiss, cheddar, carnitas, bacon, ham and a honey mustard sauce, along with tomato basil soup. 15 minutes later I get my meal. NO BACON. If it was a $6-$7 meal it would have been okay but a $10 meal and they don't give you the bacon. Then I confront the waiter about the sandwich made improperly. He says he'll fix it. He leaves and comes back with some bacon on a plate. Like seriously dude?! You can't remake my sandwich? Plus it wasn't even that good of a sandwich. Worth $5. And now i have been waiting 20 minutes for a second diet coke. This restaurant gave me the worst service ever. Denny's has crushed village inn. Denny's has excellent service and clean bathrooms! To conclude, I will never come back to village inn. Worst restaurant experience ever."}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I decided to stop for a quick bite at Village Inn.  Last time we were here last year was terrible. Service and food were bad.  Tonight it was a different story.  Our waiter Aaron was pleasant and funny.  Had a great sense of humor in fact all the servers were so nice and happy.  The manager, John, stopped at all tables and would get anything if you needed.  Such a turn around.  We will be back.  Great food and service and the pies are wonderful."}
{"text":"WHY YELP DOESNT HAVE 6 STARS FOR AWESOME PLACES, SUCH AS THIS PLACE???!

I was going to just hangout at Denny's or McDonald to finished up my paperwork, but my best friend thought I deserve better, so she yelped for a nicer cafe for me. Being in Chandler,AZ. , most places closed down by 9pm, but...
 she found this! THIS gem!

I ordered their special for under $8, 
I got the cheese omelette, bagel n cream cheese and out of the world orange blossom crepe. If you like your dessert sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this crepe is perfect!

I got their pies to go, not revealing the flavor, because I wan't to make sure they won't run out on me on my next late nite rendezvous *evil smirk*
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS
If you are full before you eat the pie, you must, YOU MUST!!!, get their pie to go, otherwise you will regret it for the rest of your life; well not really, just until your next visit.

Also, they serve your drink in real glass, That in itself deserve an extra half stars on top of the six stars I intended to give them. 


SERVERS (Patrick and Donna)ARE VERRRRRRRRY NICE"}
{"text":"Good food and service but .... the back of the store on the outside smells putrid.  Overwhelms the experience here.  I feel bad for the neighboring stores and customers."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. The food was extremely disappointing. My husband didn't finish his meal because he thought it was gross and my daughter had a hair in her grilled cheese sandwich. I have paid less for a much better breakfast."}
{"text":"Listening to a waitress talk about her kids going number 2 to the people in the booth behind us was unpleasant, and so was the manager standing on top of us trying to apologize."}
{"text":"We thought we would try a different village inn since we love the one on MC kellips so much.  All I can say is go to the MC kellips one much nicer atmosphere and everything else.  Read my posts on the MC kellips restaurant."}
{"text":"Must try this place we get great food and service.  Kids eat free on Monday and Tuesday, free slice of pie with your meal on Wednesday.  I watch for coupons now for them because they are worth it can't use them on above mentioned days but we do on the others.  I can still get free pie everyday if I go in between 3pm and 6 PM and order off their special dinner menu, and I can use a coupon.  This place has become our favorite place.  You need to go when Linda is managing everything runs smooth, our favorite servers are Rachel, Debra, and the rest are good but they go above and beyond.  My only complaint is they need to put Linda on Wednesday I think things would go better."}
{"text":"First off, I gotta say I love village inn. I regular 3x a week at my normal store. So this rating is for the service. 

All I wanted was to order the funny face meal for my teenage kids. I asked them to charge me whatever, just to please make it happen.  So it's 3 chocolate chip pancakes. Two eggs, two bacon, and a blueberry. I'm know this can be done a la cart or from the VIB menu. But it is on the kids menu.

However, the manager Dxxxxx, began to argue that she could not make that dish at all for no amount of pay. She then proceeds to tell my children they are going to get the two eggs and two bacon and two pancakes. She ordered for them. We decided that we were going to stay and eat in the spirit of fairness.


She is the checkout person and I mention the food was good, the waitress was good but I am having a hard time leaving a tip as I am very unpleased with the experience. She begins an argument. Her argument is that the kids wanted the dish she ordered for them, that they were not insisting on a funny face. Well the argument is easily resolved when she asked the kids what they wanted and they said they wanted a funny face.

Everything was good, but the lady was just probably having a bad day. However, it's never ok to let your bad day impose on others. Also, restaurants are in business to make money and should take full advantage of a willing and paying customer. It's always uncomfortable to to eat a meal after any kind of confrontation, hence the one star review."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm easy to please! They have a good selection of pies and I always have to have a slice when I'm here. Key lime is my favorite and one of the many choices that they have. I've come mostly on the weekends and it's a popular location. Luckily it's bigger than it appears.

Prices are the best part of coming to village inn. You can enjoy a nice meal, desert and coffee without breaking the bank. Service is quick and you're in and out in not time.

Hands down breakfast is the way to go no matter the time of day. Bacon, eggs, pancakes and grits are all on point. I can't speak nearly as much for the rest of the food because of my main points above."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Husband and I wanted to go somewhere we have never been and was a little different. We ended up going to village inn, not expecting much more from it then a \"dennys experience\" but it was way better!! They had interesting new things on the menu that were unique to village inn. Such things such as a cuban pita or multiple different twists on an eggs benedict. Which was cool to see. Also they had AWESOME pie and signs that you receive a free piece of pie on wed with any purchase so I will be back for that. So food was great. Our server was quick with the refills and great with the service. Also we went on a Saturday and the there was seriously only about 10 different parties of people. Which I personally like not being over crowded and feeling like you have the place to yourself. All in all if your looking for a diner with something different that is clean and quick or a place to hang out with your loved ones while you eat, this is a great place. Also try the pie! :) we had coconut cream YUM!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was extremely cold we asked to be moved where we were not in a draft. They said no they would adjust the temp. They did not adjust they did not come back to table till food came. We asked to move again and they let us. It was still cold but not as bad. There was at least 30 empty tables yet many people waiting on lobby. Food was average"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this village inn. We go here at least once a week for their honey mustard pita club, there is nothing like it. The service here is awesome. We have never had a problem. We also get a pie to go and some times go just to get a home made pie. The sugar free apple pie and French silk are delicious. I would recommend this village inn location to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We were unable to recieve a text promotion for free pie but the server and manager were able to get it for us anyhow. Everything was excellent! We definately recomend dining here!"}
{"text":"Went here over a month ago, just now getting around to writing the review. The food is okay and the staff is very nice. It was a good place to go to after hanging out with my friends."}
{"text":"This place is great to come to for a late night dinner after a nite out.  The food is okay and the service is decent."}
{"text":"We went to Village Inn for breakfast on Mother's day.  We were pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The staff did an excellent job of seating people in an efficient manner on a very busy Sunday morning. The waiter was very pleasant and both meals were perfect for an affordable price. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We sat in the larger booths in the middle of the restaurant.  There was a lot of old smashed food in between the cushions.  They must have wiped food and crumbs into the cracks for a long time.  I would suggest picking up cushions after closing and deep cleaning.  The booths are also showing wear and tear.  Two of our orders were messed up and sausage undercooked and a bit pink inside.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We are used to snappy service and a clean restaurant at VI. This VI had neither.  4:30  on a Sunday afternoon shouldn't be too busy and in fact there were maybe 3 parties in the whole restaurant but getting waited on was a challenge.  Forget refills on drinks!  And I actually had to walk into the kitchen to tell the staff that we were ready to order pie ( which I'd already alerted our waiter that we wanted).  Finally got waited on by another server who was taking over for our waiter who was on break   We got our desserts and our bill which included about 3 items we hadn't ordered.  We brought that to the attention of our waiter who was back from break and acted like he had caught it and had corrected it. NOT.  We had to wait  for a new bill.   That's just my commentary on the service.  I won't bore you with the cleanliness issues.  The staff and apparently the management aren't interested in making money.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The revamped peanut butter pie is amazing !!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here several times with my wife. The service has always been excellent. Never any problems with the food. Nice and quiet; no screaming kids. Village Inn has potato pancakes, which is one of my comfort foods. We usually take home a couple of slices of pie.
It's Village Inn, and on many days that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent and always very good. Today was packed and we were told it would be 20 minutes to wait. They sat us in about 10 minutes which was very nice. Colin was our server and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Coffee bitter. Not sure how they stay in business. Still waiting as I write this.  May just stay for lunch and order now."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, terrible food. The menu pictures are very misleading. Only thing that was even somewhat appetizing was the pie, get it to go. I will not return."}
{"text":"Came for pie and coffee with my lady! The pie was excellent, the coffee was hot, and the server, Isaiah was superb!"}
{"text":"Great food & awesome service. Went on a saturday morning and was pretty busy but was worth the wait. The wait was only less than 10 minutes which was impressive. Tried the chicken strips and the quality was fresh. My favorite drink is the strawberry limeade although refills are not free for that one, I order it every time."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the single worst restaurant meal I have ever been served. Hands down. I am here from New Mexico where Huevos Rancheros reign supreme. This morning I drove 5 miles to specifically order VI Huevos Rancheros. My review: 1) eggs ordered as over medium were over hard. I think there was just one.
2) Half the plate was one giant flour tortilla folded three times making it impossible to cut through.
3) other half the plate were underdone hash browns....literally still white in color.
4) Green Chile pork was tepid, watery, tasteless and not one shred of pork in sight.
5)beans consisted of chopped up precooked Pinto s surely from a can. Literally cold, watery, and with no flavor.
THERE WAS NOT ONE SINGLE REDEEMING COMPONENT ON THE PLATE.

The issue is systemic. To label this as Huevos Rancheros is an insult to Hispanic culture. Their recipe needs to be rewritten, their cooks need to place value on using authentic ingredients, the cook needs to understand the dish he/she is preparing. Huevos Rancheros is more than the three slices of fresh jalapeños garnishing that plate. No second chances here. Never again."}
{"text":"I am not usually one who complains, but my recent visit could be best described as nauseating and unpleasant. I received my order of scrambled eggs and cheese and it was obvious by taste  smell and sight that the cheese was contaminated with mold. I brought it to the attention of the server who sincerely apologized and sent it back to the kitchen. The assistant manager then came back to our table with my scrambled eggs (no cheese as I didn't want to take my chances again) and she dismissively stated that she checked the cheese and it \"looked fine\". To top the  whole experience off. When we went to pay for our meal the cheese was still on our bill which I clearly did not eat. When asked to have it removed from the bill, her response in a condescending tone was \"your total is $XX.XX minus your 79 cent cheese\". Why would a customer even have to ask??? The bottom line is this assistant manager and the business could benefit from her attending some kind of customer service and professionalism training. The rest of the staff was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The food was fine. However, the service was awful. The place was not busy, but the waitress did not come check on us one time. We waited for our drinks to be filled for the entire stay. The food was just blah, prices were definitely a rip off. We were right in front of the cashier and there was a freely available staff that was inattentive."}
{"text":"When you go here go at night and ask for Stacy she is also some best server I have ever had oh and the food was good and the pies are the best"}
{"text":"This is the best place to be for food, pie, and service. The night staff is awesome maybe we should try coming in the day time DO NOT go anywhere  else for pie by the slice or a whole pie."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. I'm always impressed with the staff and service. One of the servers recognized us from a visit months ago and stopped to chat... Nice! Had something new in the menu, Nashville Skillet. It looked great on the picture, but not so much when I got it. Taste of onions was to overpowering and the eggs seemed \"juicy\". I ate it, but wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"We enjoy this VI very much! Service is always  friendly and food is served hot and tastes great! Our favorite Server Colleen is now a Hostess, so things can only get better!"}
{"text":"This place always closes over 30 minutes early due to some made up plumbing problem. It's absolutely ridiculous the employees can't manage to just do their jobs until close."}
{"text":"Girl waitress wouldn't let me order from the kids menu because all I wanted was a smaller portion. What difference does it make? Rude."}
{"text":"Eat there once or twice a month great food and service. The pie is super although the free pie on Wednesdays brings crowds."}
{"text":"Best place to eat breakfast any time of the day... service is usually fast. Cheyenne is the best server at this location. Ask for her."}
{"text":"Great food, good portions and good prices.
I love several of the menu items here, and the staff is always friendly.

Late night menu (after 10PM) is stripped down quite a bit, but what they don't tell you is that if you know what you want from the regular menu, you can order it anyways."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday morning around 8:30, got seated right away then got ignored. We knew what we wanted so menus was down on the table. And we waited for someone to bring water or coffee and take our order...
A couple walked in 5 minutes later , seated 1 table away from us, and they were greeted by their waitress right away and served coffee and juice and the waitress proceeded to ask them what they would like to order. 
I guess since the waitress knew their name that made it OK and we were still ignored.
And we were still waiting. So we got up and left. 
We will go back to our regular Village Inn on Northern and the 101 from now on."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here and want to compliment all the staff and management on everything from their customer service to cleanliness of the establishment. Not to mention my food is always at proper temp and just the way I ordered it. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at a Village Inn but my first time eating at this location. The company was great but the food took a while because it was a Sunday and it was very packed. The manager was very friendly and so was the rest of the staff. The waiter was super kind and answered all of our questions. 

I ordered the Rio Grande Skillet, with over easy eggs, grilled chicken, and pancakes on the side. It was brought to our table after about 15- 20 minutes of waiting. Although the chicken was cooked perfectly, the portion was little and you can barely taste the flavors underneath all of the green chili. It was kind of a mess under two eggs. I also had a side of hash browns and that was probably the best part of my meal. I also had the French Vanilla coffee that was quite delicious as well. If I ever decide to come back to Village Inn, I'm not going to order the Rio Grande Skillet again. I'm much more satisfied with their side of hash browns and a coffee. 

My party was in a rush and we were all too full for a slice of pie so we'll definitely come back to try their variety of pies."}
{"text":"We were dying for a good, hot breakfast and we really enjoy Village Inn breakfasts!  Came in famished, got seated quickly, got food ordered right away....yay!  Then we say there for 30 mins.  Yes. 30 mins.  I waitressed for 10 years and I know that means your food is sitting  under a heat lamp getting lukewarm and hard.  When the food came it was cold.  The hash browns were like cardboard, the steak burned, the eggs cold.UGH!  WE ARE STARVING!  When we told the waitress she asked us to cut into the steak....like we were lying although the side facing up was charred and burnt.  We asked if we could get new hash browns and she substituted bacon for the steak.  We picked at what was luke warm...we were hungry!  15 minutes later the hash browns came and we were headed out the door.  The waitress obviously told the manager we were pains in the ass because the lady who rung us up did not make eye contact and as the manager passed my son saw her roll hers eyes at us! ROLL HER EYES AT US FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT ICE COLD, LONG AWAITED FOR FOOD AT THE TUNE OF 36$. I will NEVER visit another Village Inn.  We were treated horribly and never returning has nothing to do with the food.   Hello IHOP, you're our new best friend."}
{"text":"This is a good village inn, clean with good food and service, I come here often. Free slice of pie on wednesdays."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.Food was great and the service, Danny was superb! Wednesday free pie night is usually a hit when in the mood for awesome pie. Was a little sad when I found that they no longer have the awesome cheese soup...lol ;)"}
{"text":"So, I was going to give the VI 2 stars... but then I realized I would be messing up my rating system since I only have 5 stars to give.

I got there at 6 AM, and I was the only person in the restaraunt. I don't mean there weren't many people, I mean I was literally the ONLY guest. This is an important item which I will explain shortly.

I ordered the Denver Omelet, and it took forever for me to get my food. When I did finally get it, the omelet was runny and practically egg soup all over my plate. The pancakes tasted like they were burnt and stale, completely dry and disgusting. I'm the only person in there... I could see messing up someone's order when the place is full, and you're rushing to get out orders... but when only ONE person is in there, how could you possibly mess up eggs and pancakes?

While I was eating, the waitress set up another table for 4 people with coffee cups and glasses of water. So I wondered if she had regulars coming in that she expected. She spent more time catering to the table she was setting up than she did checking on me/asking if I needed anything. In fact, she changed the channels on the TV's and setup the other table the whole time I was eating and only checked on me as the other guests got there, and I interrupted her for a box to-go. I threw my food away as I walked out... I'm not really sure why I asked for a box.

Absolutely terrible food, terrible service. I will never go to this VI again... I've heard \"you've been to one, you've been to all of them\" - but this is by far, the worst one I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Service was poor. I got eggs over easy and were done correctly. The pancakes were awful. They were the thin and doughy, the sausage patty was under cooked and pink in the middle. Probably the worst breakfast I've had. Would never eat there again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the multi grain pancakes this morning, service was great as well."}
{"text":"Good old feel good food. Can't believe they were open on New Year's Day. Plus we got free pie. Good game!"}
{"text":"Apparently the owner's family was dining there so he's carrying around his infant granddaughter seating people, and his 5 year old grandson is playing host by giving people their menus and silverware, and that every time someone walked by the front counter the boy would immediately ask if they're cashing out. While some people may find this cute, I found it unprofessional and it made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, good meeting spot for business right off the 101 ramp. The food is typical chain, but good enough for all to enjoy. Good pies for take out!"}
{"text":"I don't really like breakfast foods, but they do have a good selection of other options.
I prefer this over Ihop and Dennys.
Prices are reasonable and the service is very nice.

I like their multigrain pancakes. Soups are okay.
Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"First off, I waited for my booth and then was promptly seated. Then I was told I had to move to the back because a high chair wasn't supposed to go in the certain area. 
Then we get to our table and it's dirty.
They cleaned it. We ordered drinks and food. Asked for a class of water 3 times before It was brought out to us. I asked for a refill on my tea my glass has been empty for some time now. Once I got a refill there was no ice in the tea, it tasted like old tea.
The waitress was nice. And the food tasted fine it came out in a timely manner. 
Not a bad place to eat. But they need to up their staff some more"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to this establishment to dine in on a Wednesday evening. I was super excited because I had just gotten off of work, and I have never been during free pie night. We sat at our table for 15 minutes waiting for our waiter. During this time we did not get any acknowledgment. Not even a single greeting. The place was not busy. There were only two tables with customers in our section. The wait was fine. We were just upset that we didn't get any acknowledgment. We ended leaving to eat at the Chipotle nearby."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the valley.
I got the big country skillet, my kid ate free. Food was really good.  Hot, fresh, and yummy! At first glance i thought the portion size was wrong but, i was wrong. It was plenty of food. Our server Angie was really nice and prompt. I will come back fridays for fish night!"}
{"text":"Since Marie Callender's across the street closed- I've been sad. But Village Inn is still here! I LOVE their strawberry crepes! Today that's what I had for brunch- along with coffee, orange juice, bacon, poached eggs and a tiny bowl of fruit. They offer free pie on Wednesdays- but I was so full today I had to decline. Village Inn also makes GREAT French toast- with REAL French bread! Yummy! Sorry Norm- I forgot to take a pic of my meal- I was so hungry I just ate!!"}
{"text":"This location is CLOSED. It's an empty building.

I am only putting one star up because I have to in order to post."}

{"text":"I'm in agreement with other Yelpers, a great place for a huge breakfast at a reasonable price. The 1/2 lb. chicken steak with eggs and pancakes was well worth the $9 or $10. Our waitress was a pro and seemed very pleasant. It was a packed early Saturday morning and our food did not take more than 20 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever with dumbass security. Security seem to think they are all tough harrassing you and accusing of stuff, meanwhile i wonder they even got a high school diploma. Hope these dumbasse all get fired."}
{"text":"Arrived @ 10:30 on a weekday.  Half the tables were empty. However there was a long line and a 20 minute wait due to not enough servers.   You lost a customer."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times very happy with the food and service will be back soon! Great pies!"}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast, lunch and dinners. Fabulous pies! Prices are low and affordable. Highly recommended for anyone and great for kids. Usually not crowded."}
{"text":"Had. A craving for breakfast for dinner. Service was good and the food was yummy. Satisfied customer here."}
{"text":"Great place to come to get eggs benedict as well as a variety of other tasty bkfst favorites!!
The wait on a Sunday morning can be a bit long due to after church traffic...but it's well worth the wait, I feel.

The staff is friendly, the food is VERY yummy, and their service time is pretty quick, even with a full house.

We frequent this place quite often, and I felt it was finally time for a review.

I will say that the egg on my eggs benedict could have been a little runnier...but...with the stuff that's been going on with eggs lately, Ill pretend they were trying to do me a favor and keep me from being sick....rather than the chef just overcooked them.  Regardless, it was still very yummy, so I'm not upset.

Definitely recommend for breakfast!!  Haven't been for lunch or dinner OR pie, so I can't comment on those items!  :-)"}
{"text":"I've visited the village inn this past weekend for the first time and I was blown away by the food. I was expecting a Dennys/IHOP service/food, but I was happily wrong. The portion/quality of all of the food was substantially better than it's competitors, even the fruit cups. The service wasn't dramatically exceptional,  but enough for me to give a 15% tip. Both my fiance and I agreed that this will be our go to breakfast joint rather than our usual dennys. Although the price is slightly more, it's well worth the price and a much better buy comparing it to the competition. As we paid for our meal, I told the cashier who happened to be the manager that it was our first time and we loved it. He thanked us for the compliment and informed us of the specials and deals going on every day. He seemed pleased and asked us to come again as we walked out, which is a simple yet hard thing to find nowadays."}
{"text":"The food and service is OK, but the free Wi-Fi is a great bonus for those late night study/eat cravings."}
{"text":"agree with others reviewers. basically a Denny's perhaps slightly better.  got free pie with our meal which is nice.  great for kids, casual.  breakfast all day.  food was ok, espcially for the price.  waitress was very nice and friendly (it was christmas eve)."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say, I love Breakfast! The Chicken fried steak and Eggs are to Die for, the Gravy tastes just like Home, And the the cherrie crapes are just wonderful, There's nothing bad I can say about Village Inn, the servers are always very friendly and helpful, And some locations are open 24 hrs, so that makes it even better...."}
{"text":"I went with my friend.  I just moved to AZ. I really enjoyed the service,  the grilled cheese sandwich made a little different.   The tomato soup was delicious. ..I wished I had got a bowl instead of a cup. They had nice looking pies too but I was able to pass on them!
Will return soon."}
{"text":"Loved the friendliness. Stacey, my waitress, was great -- a perfect mix of knowing when to give me time and when to check up on me. Food was really good for the price. Management checked in while I was there as well. Place is clean and attractive. Top notch for this chain!"}
{"text":"I have so much to say regarding the service I have gotten at village inn. Have you, the reader, ever sat down at a restaurant, and thought to yourself \"wow, doesn't this place look like Dachau in the 1900s?\". Well ladies and gentleman, if you haven't, and are looking to experience it: village inn is the place for you my friend. 


Now let's talk about the food. I ordered the hot tea. Now let me tell you, I'm super used to shitty tea. But. Never. Have I ever. Experienced an atrocity quite like the tea served here at village inn. It came is quite possibly the shittiest cup I have ever witnessed. The cup literally gave me autism. Next on the list of gripes. The entree. I placed an order for the 1/2 lb of chicken fried steak. What I was served was, what I believe to be, a fricasseed cat pancreas. It tasted like poverty. 


In conclusion: fuck village inn

{"text":"Breakfast was good and waitress was nice but hostess had issues with our check. I had the VIB with the parfait as an extra side. Noticed I was being charged for 2 additional sides, Parfait and Crepes. Explained to the hostess the the crepe was included in the VIB, she somehow did not know her own menu and insisted it was extra. We asked for a manager and she quickly knew what the issue was and had her take it off the ticket. We had a coupon and were told by the hostess it could not be used since our food was \"comped\". At this point I started losing my patience and asked for the manager. She went ahead and said she'd honor the coupon. We didn't realize until we left she turned around and charged us for the \"extra\" side!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a senior citizen restaurant. Have only had breakfast here and it has been good. Lots of choices and on Wed you even get a slice of pie that you can eat there or take it home. Their pies are very good. Prices are reasonable and food ample. Check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Growing up I was a big fan of this chain, but as my taste buds have grown up, I'm not as big of a fan. I still and will always love their pancakes more than any others. I'm a fan of ultra fluffy and light pancakes and they deliver every time. I'd skip anything else on the menu though."}
{"text":"We have stopped going here because the food  preparation became inconsistent and on one visit we heard the staff using the \"F\" word  when they were talking to each other. Also, when we contacted management, she said she would send us a coupon for a free meal to make up the bad food and unprofessional staff-but we never go it. Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Seated right away. Service was very attentive. Had buttermilk pancakes which were tasteless and lukewarm. Too bad it wasn't pie Wednesday, then I would have had something decent to eat. Spouse had ham and eggs over easy which also were cold. Hard to imagine food temps when the place was not crowded."}
{"text":"Yuck, my husband found a hair in his French toast. The potatoes were frozen packaged potatoes. You can see the kitchen on the way to the bathroom. The kitchen was a pigpen and the bathrooms were dirty. The whole place was in need of Cleaning. I'm sorry I looked up its reviews  and thought it was going to be better then Lione Spur. It wasn't good."}
{"text":"I live in Downtown Phoenix, closed on Northern, nearest one is this. This Village Inn is excellent, along with the one on Power and Main in Mesa and the old Downtown Scottsdale one. When I am near this area, which is once every 3 months, me and mom grab lunch here first because we love it and I usually order grilled cheese and fries, then we go to Bell Towne Center, mainly Toys R Us, then go home. This is a good place to go for lunch, I'd recommend it. Waitresses are good here.
Phoenix locations :

{"text":"Economy must be picking up!  Got here at 9:30am and there was already a 20 mn wait.  We love this VI.  Have been going to it for about 4 years now.  Some of the same servers are still there.  That should tell you something about the place. Also the same GM, too. 

Thus place is Run very well.  Service and food are both really great."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely hands down one of the best diner restaurants I have been to in a while! Last night my family and I went to dinner at the Village Inn located on Signal Butte. We were seated immediately, and had our drinks within seconds. Tammy was our waitress, and she was great! Our food came out within twenty minutes of ordering. The food was hot and was delicious! I rarely give five stars but the service that Tammy delivered was above and beyond my expectations and the food was phenomenal! I will be back and I will continue to bring in family and friends! Thanks Village Inn, and thank you Tammy for a wonderful family dinner :-)"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast a few times. Thebservixe was excellent and the food was great. The only complaint I have is there should be more strips of bacon.  Other than that fantastic"}
{"text":"My french toast came out cold my sons came out cold Reversi did not too far from the kitchen has been the area where they cut ties and watching them in the kitchen standing there eating instead  I've taken care of the customers. I tried to flag down the manager she acknowledged me and then just walked into the kitchen. We have had the server in the past and she rock it tonight was horrible,"}
{"text":"Standard Village Inn fare that you find anywhere.  The service can run from excellent to mediocre depending on the servers on shift that night. 

Tonight was not one of the good examples.  The server never refilled my tea or bothered to check in with me after serving my pie. 

The other  clientele ruined the atmosphere for me.  The management did apologize but having to hear the other customers loud negative comments about me, Blacks and \"Mexicans\" doesn't do much for decompressing  after a long day at work.  

Even though the bulk of my visits have been acceptable I'm not sure if I'll return to this location anymore."}
{"text":"This place has delicious breakfast food, best I've had in the valley. Hashbrowns and their pies are so good! Would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"I recently started eating there and loved it so much I am now a regular.   I have read some recent reviews and don't understand there complaints of slow service because I have gotten fantastic service since day 1.  There is sometimes a wait this time of year but well worth it. I mean what great restaurants never have a wait.  They serve breakfast all day and far exceed any experiences I have ever had at Dennys IHOP or cocos... We'll never step foot back in one of those other places...village inn for life"}
{"text":"Poor service. Old instant tasting coffee.  Had to ask for a rag to wipe off food from seat.  You would think the hostess would have offered some type of apology and wiped the seat herself but rather she handed me the rag and watched me do it.  By the time the food came we were so cold that all we wanted to do was finish and leave so we could warm up.  Food was ok at best.  Would NEVER go back here for any meal!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Our waiter Jason was very inattentive and rude. He ignored our table until we had to ask for him. Then he filled my husband's ice tea but not mine. We had to call him back to get mine filled. Service not usually this bad."}
{"text":"Typical dinner food with a few exceptions:
-Fish-Fry Fridays are amazing!  Endless fish n chips, all hand-battered, very delicious!
-Free pie on Wednesday.  They always have two special pies and then all of their fruit pies to choose from.  I go every Wednesday with my grandparents for free pie.

The waitstaff is very professional and friendly.  Even though my grandparents have been going to this location once a week for 8 years, they are given the best service and treated very sweetly."}
{"text":"If only I could give negative Stars. Stopped in for late night pie and coffee at about 10:45 with my husband. Huge Mistake. Only one other table occupied and they had their food already. We ordered 2 coffee's and one slice of fresh Strawberry Pie and one slice of Strawberry Rhubarb Pie a la mode. The waitress Pamela said she would have to brew a pot of coffee and it would be a few minutes and that was fine. 

We waited and she walked out of the back in about 5 minutes with the pie. One slice of Fresh Strawberry and one that looked very suspicious and far too dark to be Strawberry Rhubarb. It was some kind of berry pie. Waited until she came out of the kitchen again and called her over. When I pointed out the mistake she apologized and did go back for the correct pie. In the mean time she sat down our pot of coffee and my husband poured both of our cups. We both looked in disgust as the coffee had what looked like spoiled creamer floating in it. Yelled for Pamela who was almost back in the kitchen and had her come take this \"freshly made\" coffee away. Finally another carafe of coffee and the Strawberry Rhubarb pie came out. 

By this time my husband was completely done with his pie had not even had his coffee yet and was totally disgusted. He called the \"manager\" over who was actually acting as hostess and cleaning display cases and floors. Before he could express his disgust she immediately said \"Oh we figured out what was wrong with the coffee\". The coffee pot and carafes are beside the salad dressings and I looks like that carafe lid had fallen in ranch dressing. She and Pamela both looming over the table smiling and laughing. Her comment \"But we did make it right didn't we?\" My husband and I looked at one another and just gave up at that point. We paid almost $14.00 for two pieces of pie and two coffees. Both pieces of pie were very small and the coffee could have made us ill if we had put cream in our cups first and hadn't noticed the dried salad dressing floating. The manager gleefully rang us up as we left, did not offer any discount off the order which we didn't even get to eat together. Steer clear of this late night disaster."}
{"text":"A year later and nothing has changed.  The service was slow.  Nearly impossible to get a drink refill even after asking 2 people 3 times.  The food was cold in the middle. Looks like Village Inn has become nothing better than a Denny's."}
{"text":"Great service!  The food is good.  But the real reason I continue to go here very frequently is the awesome service."}
{"text":"This company lies with it's marketing, and tells their employees to say \"Oh well!\" to customers.

As a family we visited this restaurant on a Monday, where they have posted on the windows that kids eat free on Monday and Tuesday. So naturally, we went! This was our first visit, and it will be our last. After our meal and we paid, I noticed that only two of our kids meals were free (we have three), and we were also charged for their drinks. I confronted the manager about this, and his response (as well as the host's) the company automatically takes off the discount, they cannot change the receipt. The free meals are only per adult entree, and beverages are not considered \"food\" HAHAHA WHAT??  This \"rule\" is NO WHERE in their marketing, and the waitress neglected to tell us this information. I argued they must honor the customer because the company lied, they stupidly stood in front of the computer for about half an hour trying to figure it out, and then finally they were able to get it done. 

A company that lies with it's advertising and a manager who doesn't know how to correct their mistakes...yeah, we won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and awesome customer service Love the strawberry crapes and the pies are to die for."}
{"text":"The waitress was a sweetheart. The food was terrible. You think a cook could cook an egg  .not here in glendale . The worst breakfast in 50 years"}

{"text":"Didn't have to wait too long. They had football on which is cool. Our waitress was fast and friendly. The country fried steak, eggs, and pancakes were delicious and all entrees were eaten all up! Thank you."}
{"text":"Second night in a row trying this location.  Order was not right either night.  Takes forever to get food and service.  Suggestion: hire new employees or the doors will be closing soon.  Everyone around us did not seem happy with their orders or service."}
{"text":"Food was soggy & cold when I got it. First time eating at a village inn and I was HIGHLY disappointed. I always see lots of cars at the other restaurants no matter what day it is, I pulled into this one and it was completely empty.. Now I know why. It took two staff members to get my food for me. I'm not one to complain but i was really disappointed. I was really wishing it was better! Maybe ill try another one!"}
{"text":"I've grown up eating in this restueran but we ate there yestuerday and was really bad. To start our waitress looked like she picked up her clothes off the floor they were wrinkled and look clean. I had gotten breakfast biscuits and gravy country fried potatoes and bacon your gravy was watered down the potatoes were from a bag and we're over cooked there was nothing about them that said fresh country or good. They need to go back to the old way of doing things because they've really gone downhill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A good place for a filling breakfast with plenty of offerings at a fair price. 
The staff is usually very pleasant and efficient. 
We have eaten here several times and will return."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with a village inn and I have maybe once been as irritated with a place ad I was with this place my experience was bad enough I felt like writing a review
We got there and it didn't have too many people but it took like twenty minutes to get our food ordered then we sat and waited for an hour. The group next to us had the same problem and the manager was setting up a table personally with food that didn't even have people sitting in it yet we had a time frame to pick the kid up from school told the manager and she went to the kitchen then went back to setting up the empty table with food. The food got there but at that point I was so irritated I went to the front left the food and told them this was ridiculous and wasn't paying for it just on principle won't be going back to that location"}
{"text":"We love the VI in Grand Junction so stopped here in AZ for breakfast. Manager who seated us never made eye contact, in fact his back was to us while he was speaking. Waitress clothes are messy and dirty, bathroom is filthy. So far no one looks happy to be here and we haven't even got our food yet. OK, food just came with a small smile. They get two stars. * food was good but at check out Manager still didn't make eye contact or smile even though we tried to be chatty."}
{"text":"We \"were\" regulars every Wednesday for free pie with the mother in law..... I can not believe how bad the service is there any more, in fact the last time we were there apparently there was some confusion on who our waitress was and everyone just kept walking past us.... Trying not to make eye contact! Many times before that the service just was very poor,  to top it off  when they asked how every thing was as I paid I informed them of the terrible service and her response was, it's so busy on free pie night.... Trust me it wasn't busy! keep in mind this was over a month ago there wasn't a snowbird in town! 

I will have to find a new place for us to meet up with the mother in law. Will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"Really good food at very good prices. We always come here on vacation, for breakfast and for dinner. Huge selection! I've enjoyed pancakes, eggs, grown-up grilled cheese (yes, that's a menu option), cobb salad, and more. I really like their food and the prices are excellent. It is a family restaurant so it can be noisy and there can be a wait, especially on weekends. Definitely recommend if you like good value! They also have good pie and Wed. is free pie day for fruit pies only."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Portions were small. 1st pot of coffee I got was cold. Took 10 minutes to get Hot coffee. Ordered egg whites, sausage, home fries, Buttermilk pancakes and grits. After waiting everything was cold except the grits. I had to wait for a complete do over. When I finally  received  my order the portions were smaller than the orginal order, but everything was hot.  I would only recommended this resturant if you aren't to hungry and have plenty of time to kill. Prices I were too high for the portions they serve. I guess they need to do that to give a free slice of pie on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"I like coming here but you need more pie selections besides fruit pies and pumpkin on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Oh where to start. I went there Easter Sunday, a young male waiter FINALLY came to my table to which I ordered a diet coke. He FINALLY comes back, but with a regular coke so went back and got me a diet one-no straw. When he came back to the table(and NO it was not busy at all) I ordered \" I would like a cup of broccoli soup to start, and then I'd like the sirloin steak, medium rare with my side dish being the green beans \"Well he is attempting to write it on his pad of paper and asks me again what I wanted to which I repeated it, and also asked for a straw. 10 minutes later I get my straw-and 10 minutes after that IT arrives. On the plate was a cup of soup that was slopped all over the sides and on the plate, a steak and toast soaked in the soup) To which I asked \"where are my potatoes/gravy and green beans?\" He answers oh sorry ma'am we are out of green beans, uhm would you like something else? And you just found out now when bringing me my plate? I will take broccoli then. OK ma'am I'll find out about the potatoes. I have no steak knife, no crackers for my soup, never did receive steak sauce. So I went to the front till and told the 2 people that were just standing around there, that my waiter is awful and could I please get a steak knife, and crackers! When all was said and done, I had a small plate of potatoes with gravy, a cup with broccoli, a cup of soup, and a plate with a steak and toast on it. Nothing like over working the dish washer!! I was never approached as to how my steak was (which was raw) or if I wanted anymore pop. At the till the manager or whoever he was, said he'd take a couple dollars off!! Like seriously??!! I said don't bother taking anything off and be rest assured I WON'T be back. The worst experience I have ever had in America. Usually the customer service in the USA is impeccable, but not this time."}
{"text":"I come here a lot as I work nights until 7am, the food and service is great. I would have given 5 stars but the restroom is always filthy, I've stepped in piss going in and washing my hands after ordering."}
{"text":"I just placed my order after being seatted and waiting 20 minutes for the server to take my order. Haven't been here for about six months but this place has changed and not for better, will not be back. Used to be a great place to have breakfast, when the food arrived it was good except for the fact that the sour-dough toast was not toasted."}
{"text":"Best pies ever! The menu is delicious as well. Ever location I've visited has always had friendly servers who were very helpful."}
{"text":"WAHHH WAHHH WAHHH

do you hear that? It's the sound of me crying.

Wanna know why?? VILLAGE INN THATS WHY OH MY!!!.

anywho, went out for a night on the town and ended up at village inn tryin to get sum of that young money pie. So I order a slice of apple... mmmm apple. right? WRONG?
cause I take one bite of that darned pie and started choking!!! I ran to the bathroom to see what exactly was stabbing me in the throat and it turned out to be the pie brush bristles!! not 1, not 2 of em, but 10!!! I basically took a bite of some cinnamon flavored hair bristles. 

I complain to the waitress and she brings her manager out. Guess what her managers solution was?
\" IM SORRY MISS WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER PIECE OF PIE?\"

NOOOOOOOOOO I DONT WANT YOUR BRUSH INFESTED PIE YOU IDIOT.

urghhh. thank god barney was on that night or else my night would've been completely ruined."}

The waitress was also very quick to come to our table even though they were extremely  busy! Must try, i will be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this Village Inn location. I ate here the other night because I had a pie craving and my boyfriend was hungry for some type of breakfast meal. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess and then greeted by our not-so friendly waiter. As we reviewed the menu our waiter came back quite soon asking if we knew what we wanted to order, and we asked for a few more minutes to decide, he seemed very   displeased by our need for more time. He then came back saying \"Your menus are closed so I am assuming you are ready to order\" I don't know if this was meant to be friendly sarcasm, but I sure did not appreciate it. I ordered their banana cream pie and  my boyfriend decided to order the VIB which seemed like the best deal for someone who wasn't looking for a large meal. So, for his VIB he chose french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and a side of fruit. We asked our waiter to bring us an extra plate with the meal so we could share if the VIB and to bring the banana cream pie after we were finished with the meal. So the meal came, and the food was okay. The french toast was kind of soggy and really bland, the fruit portion was so tiny that it was almost laughable. The bacon was alright, it wasn't too crisp, but at least the scrambled eggs were good. After we finished eating, we didn't see our waiter for awhile, but when we did he came with the pie and took our plates away and said nothing. The pie was okay, I don't know if their pies are made on site, but it was nothing great. There was hardly any banana flavor in it which was quite disappointing. I have eaten at a different Village Inn and tried their French Silk pie and that one was quite delicious. It could just be the type of pies, I don't know.

To sum it all up, the service was under par especially for how empty the place was at the time and the food was almost as bad as the service(not including the kind hostess of course). I will choose to try another Village Inn in hopes for better food and better service. This one is definitely off my list."}
{"text":"I was craving pie and beer after watching fireworks on fourth of july. It was about 10:30 and the Village Inn closed at midnight so I listened to yelp and decided to pick up some pie here. The manager was really friendly and I decided on the strawberry rhubarb pie. The pie was soooooo good. Better than Marie Callendars! I definitely plan on coming here on a wednesday to try out the other pies for free! YUM."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast! Restaurant was clean. Food was perfect! Best of all was the service! Amy served us, she was great! Checked on us often and was very personable, not just for a good tip either."}
{"text":"Excellent service, hostess extremely organized, great value and a great menu. We arrived on the value skillet day and were advised of the exact wait, seated and served coffee immediately until waitress available to take our order. Only scrambled eggs was great a positive time saving approach and food arrived quickly and hot. Fast clean up by staff."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to this location. The last time i was there a server put her finger in the air towards me and told to me shh because she was talking to another customer. And all i did was raise my hand up and said excuse me. She did not have to act like that. She could  of politely said hold on one second and i will be right with you. Didnt not had to shh me and and put her finger in almost in my face."}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied with the service I received here at Village Inn. Since the moment we sat down our server was very rude while I was feeding my son from his plate she picks up my boyfriends plate and then continues to pick up mine. I wasn't even finished at all. I still had a good portion on my plate that I was enjoying until she took it away. I told her I wasn't finished and she tried to hand it back to me after piling it on a bunch of dirty plates of food. After that I didn't want it anymore so she just walked away. She should of asked if I was done before she decided to take my plate away."}
{"text":"just an update.. still the most tastiest,most juicy double bacon cheeseburger in phx with onion rings!!"}
{"text":"WoW factor!!!! I never go out for just coffee because lets face it we get the eye roll from the wait staff because you are taking up a table. Not the case here. We showed up to have coffee only when Tim our server welcomed us. He was on it!!! He made sure we had ample.... everything. At one point I noticed we were out of regular sugar and I figured oh well. Tim popped up and asked if I needed more sugar. I have not been to a village Inn in over... well It's been AAAA LOOOONNNG time. I look at it this way, anyone that would be so attentive to a couple drinking coffee has earned a chance for me to try the food. I will let you know when this happens!!! Until then thanks Tim, it was great. ohhh The coffee was great as well :) 
 This is my Rayalistic view."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfasts I have had. First of all the eggs are very good they are soft but they need a little bit more salt. Bacon was so good it had a sweet taste to it but it was not bad. The country potatoes are great they are just a little small I prefer cocos country potato's. The waffle was not good it was hard but not good only the middle tasted like a good waffle hope everyone else likes this restaurant too"}
{"text":"My first time in a Village Inn Restaurant, my experience was fenomenal. I was getting full ,but we made it on time.Two weeks ago I went for breakfast with my wife I asked for the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes and a Belgium Waffle , my wife got her favorite breakfast Omelettes .. One thing that I always look for is the service that makes a difference .My Belgium Waffle was very bad , it had a sour taste to it. The Batter had spoiled ... I told the waitress that the waffle was very bad, the only thing she told me \" Oh I let me check the Batter maybe it's bad, but  let me get you a slice of pie and will not charge you the Waffle nor the pie.\"  She was awesome , forgot her name .. gave her $ 10 tip for caring for the customers.. overall very good, be there early there is a reason why it get's full..... check it out."}
{"text":"If you reserve pies here, know that there is no guarantee you are actually going to get them. The Sunday before Thanksgiving I made a reservation for 2 pies. We arrived on Thanksgiving during our pick-up time to be told they had no more of one of the pies we ordered. What is a reservation good for then? Terrible customer service experience and a waste of time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast VIB. Food okay but service slow, very slow. Only one waitress, no host."}
{"text":"Huh, would have thought there'd be more reviews of this place.

Ok, I've been to this Village Inn loads of times as I am not someone who eats at usual times.  The food here is GOOD.  I don't go as often as I used to as I live further south now but still make the trek on occasion of need for post-work meal so it does inspire.

I think my favorite thing about Village Inn is  the food quality does not go down in the overnight hours.  Many of their competitors in this absolutely do.  Yes, the items available are smaller in number but they do them right.

In addition there is pie.  Lots of flavor choices for whatever is tickling your fancy.

The only downer is that when you get up to pay you often have to wait a few minutes for someone to decide to come and take your money.  I wonder how many walk-outs they must have not having a staff member required to be at or in sight of the register at all times.

Being off the i-17 this is an awesome place to meet people up!"}
{"text":"Food tasted ok but took an hour to get and was cold. Like hell will be next time I go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who our server was, because I'm awful at remembering names, but this dude was stellar! He was outgoing, hasty, knowledgeable and thorough. This gentleman seemed to actually enjoy good job and enjoy conversing with willing customers. We will absolutely by going back to this location in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been here for pie on a Wednesday a few times before, but I finally decided to give Village Inn a try for dinner. It was about what I would have expected. They have basic comfort food much like Denny's. I ordered a Reuben sandwich which was not bad, but I didn't care much for the Caesar salad. Personally, this is not the type of place I would pick for dinner again, but I would come for a slice of pie as their pie is good. On Wednesday they give you a free slice with any purchase, which is awesome. I get it with a slice of milk."}
{"text":"This is our first visit ever to a Village Inn. We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the restaurant and the friendly staff. Our waitress was attentive and our drinks and food served in a timely manner! The two of us were happy with our breakfast orders; the food was very good. I am a \"sticks and twigs\" eater and my partner prefers traditional breakfast food. We were not disappointed. The portions are large so I took leftovers with me. It was nice that the manager spent time talking to the patrons, making sure everyone was being served and their needs were met. 
We will come back to this location!"}
{"text":"The past three times I came here I had bad service. I tried this place again yesterday and the service was awesome. Bo was my server and he was awesome again today. It definitely makes up for the last bad three experiences I had at this place. I was almost not going to come here ever again.

Thanks Bo."}
{"text":"Another restaurant that's a slight step above something.  This one is a slight step above Dennys.  And I'm not sure if this is the one on Recker and McKellips or Power and Main.  The latter is even worse..."}
{"text":"The cooks are on point!  The Manager, not so I good I think.  If you come here, the staff is a little off.  They are way too comfortable and will start some super weird conversations with you.  The main reason this is a 3/5 is that they only sit like 1 party for every 10 that leaves.  You'll look around at 20 dirty tables.  Yet the lobby is full of guests waiting to be seated. 

You guys have the hardest part down, the food!  Get your act together and this place would be great!"}
{"text":"From the time I walked in service was no good. All it really takes  is acknowledgement and basic manners. The old biddy hostess didn't even look at me when she took my name down wrong, how do you confuse Monique with Marie? The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday morning. The food took forever. My server was nice, not as attentive as she could have been. Waited til my food arrived to get a refill. Food was good not good enough to come back. They can thank the old biddy in the front for starting the snowball that the average staff couldn't recover from. They get a star for the food and I will give the actual server a star."}
{"text":"Nope, not coming back here again.  Didn't get half off the items I ordered, didn't want to stick around and even sort it out when I was charged for them anyways.  

Just not that good.  Skip it."}
{"text":"I decided to try something completely for Dinner and had the Smothered Breakfast Burrito with Carnitas. It was UH-mazing!!!! Compliments to the Chef. So much flavor and the green chili was excellent. I'm going to get this every visit now. 

The portion was huge. I don't like too much spice so I ordered the burrito with no Jalapeños. It still had a good amount of spice but nothing overpowering."}
{"text":"I am very happy to say today we went after church and this time was a COMPLETE about face from our last experience.  We were promptly greeted and seated, very warmly and affectionately.  We were waited on by Bobbi Jo and she was fantastic.  She promptly brought  our beverages and was extremely pleasant and happy. We were practically greeted and smiled at from everyone in the place and the manager John made it a point to bring out food and thank everyone for coming and he came over to ensure our experience was fabulous. He had shared with us how he JUST took over this location this week.  AFTER our meal I  shared with him about my previous review and he said he had a note about it. He uses my experience as a coaching tool that is never to happen on his watch!  After this experience we will be here a lot more often!  Thanks for an amazing meal and restoring our faith in VI!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Village Inn in years & didn't have the pie this time (sadly). The hostess was sweet & service good. Breakfast was ok. Nothing to write home about nor any complaints."}
{"text":"Tuesday ~09:00, No/Slo Service 
Seated in 2-3 minutes 
Drink Order in 18 minutes
Food order in 22 minutes
Waiting Waiting...
Thirty-Eight minutes informed hostess of our departure."}
{"text":"Decent food with borderline ghetto service. 

....think Dave Chappelle's \"Pop Copy\" sketch with slightly better corporate training."}
{"text":"It's totally understandable to give this place 1 star reviews as restaurants like this can be hit or miss. When we go we always ask for Darlene, and she always uses one of the 2 cooks for our orders. We tend to go on the weekend around lunch. She knows what we like and how we like it, and will champion our breakfast  requests before it makes it to the table. 

The sweet iced coffee drinks here aren't anything fancy, but after about 3 of them you are borderline delirious due to the amounts of sugar and caffeine coursing through your system. Pies are always delicious, and we tend to get a slice to share between us after breakfast. I mean, really. It's PIE!

While I tend to think of Village Inn as more of a 4.5 star diner, some of the staff can be either overwhelming or lethargic at times, so we always ask for Darlene because of how good she is. In the event you do ask for her, be descriptive about how you want your order. She takes notes and will follow through. The staff are otherwise very friendly,  the management always has a smile, and my meals are always predictable. Just the way I like my diners to be."}
{"text":"I took my wife there for her birthday and immediately we were greeted by a wonderful server who had a ton of personality - she took our order and we waited 25 minutes in a freezing cold restaurant - we could tell they were not well organized and the servers look upset at the kitchen - when our food arrived i order the ultimate skillet and the wife a simple club with fries - the potatoes came out burnt the server knew it and I was missing one egg - she reluctantly placed the food knowing it wasn't the best product - but because we had waited she gave us our order - she came back to fill our drinks and then she said the foods bad isn't it - we agreed and she hen placed the order after another ten minutes we walked out - the manager didn't even argue or offer anything in consultation! If a breakfast house is not packed then there is a good reason!! DO NOT VISIT this restaurant!! Make corporate clean his place up!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love breakfast and were excited to try a new place! We went there for the 1st time and it was a very good experience, we had a great waitress, she got our drinks out right away & our food was out before we knew it & it was great! The past two times we went we haven't been happy. We went today & had a younger gentleman as our waiter, we ordered coffee & chocolate milk and it took about 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We were so upset we were packing up our things to leave right as he came with the drinks. Our food was out pretty quick after we ordered, my bacon wasn't cooked all the way through, our eggs weren't good & kind of hard. Unfortunately we thought maybe we'd give it another shot, but after this we won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to participate in Free Pie night as my dad had reached his latest weight loss goal (ironic right?). Our service was pretty good. Our waiter laughed and joked with us ever so patiently as my dad let out some wonderful \"dad jokes\" and she was very polite. I was not at all impressed with the food! I ordered breakfast for dinner and my bacon tasted as though it was the pre-cooked style you buy at the store and just microwave, my hash browns tasted like they came out of a cardboard box, and my french toast was just a joke. Hey, at least the egg whites were good. I couldn't tell you if it was just the time of day (around 9pm), or just the quality of the food overall. The dessert was good though. It's hard to mess up pie!"}
{"text":"This place has a good bit of something for everyone. It is a chain restaurant so there isn't necessarily that local touch but the place was inviting and clean. Out waitress was on point and was very attentive. Definitely gonna be coming here often :)"}
{"text":"Fast lunch service and an amazing chicken salad! I would reccomend this location to anyone. Our server never let me run out of tea and was a delight the entire time. Also....free pie on Wed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot. They are always super friendly and go the extra mile to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"We love this place, and have been here many times for breakfast. This morning we had such a great breakfast, served by a wonderful server.. Her name is Sasha, and she is an amazing waitress, and better yet, an amazing person. She has a great sense of humor and is a very sweet. She is a Village Inn KEEPER!"}
{"text":"This service was ok. The food has not changed in the last 15 years i have been going to any Village Inn so i have to give the credit for consistency in length of time and accross the country. 

Only 3 stars because our waitress was not attentive.  She rather talk to this cute guys she was into instead of twnding her tables.  Several people, including me, had to get up from our table to get her for service."}
{"text":"Food is good, pie is delicious. Buttttt I've been here 2 Sunday's in a row and both times they have been understaffed and incredibly slow. On Father's Day half of the tables were open but people still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated simply because they were understaffed and couldn't serve all the tables. It feels like the restaurant runs at half capacity at all times."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for food and is was cold and biscuits were hard as rocks!  The gravy had pink sausage in it and was so salty I couldn't eat it    Server didn't check on us at all    Never going back here.  Absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"The service is great and when it's busy, they do not make you wait long to be seated.  We had Darby(I hope I'm spelling her name right) as our server and she was great. Such a sweet girl that goes beyond what is expected and made sure our table was taken care of. The food was delicious and I can't wait to go back. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Was there awhile back. Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review-   On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out.   When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie.   Literally.  I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece.  Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked.  It was the consistency  of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place.   Im not making this up.  The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old.  What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old.  The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks.  I was floored.  I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there.  Da did they think I wouldn't notice!  Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake.   They didn't want to loose money so they sold me it to instead. And they are famous for their pies.   What a laugh"}
{"text":"Me and my wife come here a lot and all the servers treat you like family. Also the manager always makes sure everyone is satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Other than the kitchen screwing up a 2 ingredient, marginally-portioned omelette, the food was greasy and mediocre at best. Considering this, the menu is well overpriced. I will not be returning to this or another Village Inn.  I recommend against patronizing this chain."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Fried Steak today.  It was not good.  Cooked so hard it was hard to cut.   Tried to eat it and then left most of it.  The Manager asked me how my meal was on my way out and I told him not good.  He didn't seem to really care.  Also the gravy taste like throw-up.  The only reason I give them a 2 is because they have good pie.  I've eaten at other Village Inns which were better.  I won't return to this one ever again."}
{"text":"I can't give this place any stars.  I picked up a French Silk pie on Monday, 11/27.  I should've known better than to listen to a non-baker who encouraged me to try this particular pie.  I had served it to friends we had over for dinner and I usually bake all my desserts.  After the baking frenzy of Thanksgiving, for once I thought I could take the easy way out and opted to buy one.  At $14, this was the worst pie I ever tasted and I was totally embarrassed that I had served it to my guests.  It looked frozen when I picked it up, the crust wasn't even slightly brown and the filling and cream were bland.  There was no chocolate flavor at all.  I'm glad I didn't waste any money going there for a meal."}
{"text":"Totally disgusting experience tonight. They had a chicken fried steak dinner and my steak was hard, the gravy sitting on top was dried out and the potatoes were cold. And to top it off there was a woman feeding her \"assistive poodle\" off her plate and she even asked for and received a bowl of water to give to the dog. Yuck! How appetizing is it to think that your dishes might have been used by a dog? I asked to speak to the manager but he was too \"busy\" and never bothered to come by. Of course when I left I was able to speak to him at the cash register and his excuse was he did not know she was feeding the animal at the table or that it was given a bowl of water. Hint there \"manager\" when a customer asks to speak to you, make time to do your job."}
{"text":"This was our first time here we ordered French dip pasty melt and a grown up cheese sandwich all of our food was excellent. They asked if we were ok and if we needed anything so excellent service also"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday (11/11/15) Veterans day, shortly after 5 and was promptly seated with my family. We were given menus and told our server would be right with us. Sat for 10 mins and saw the servers at the tables in front and back of me. Even saw the manager (a friendly lady that spoke to the older couple in front of us and the ladies in back but I assume they knew each other since she stopped by a couple times to chat). Skipped over the people sitting with menus closed and no drinks on the table for over 10 mins. Finally the young man that seated us came back and asked if we'd been helped. Umm no after nearly 20 mins we hadn't.  Oh so sorry, I don't know if Stephanie knows your her table, I'll send her right over. After waiting another 5 mins with no show we got up and walked out. Also told the young man to let Stephanie know not to bother. To which his half hearted reply was oh,ok. Really? I understand they were busy but nothing more than usual.  Very disappointed and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Another re-write for another restaurant going from good to bad. Sigh.

I have been going to Village Inn my entire life. Growing up in CO to moving here in AZ. Where I live there are only three locations. Out of those three I now have to add the two closest ones as places I can no longer go to get a good meal with good service. I have to say after giving you my patronage for over 40 years, I will not be coming back.

Yesterday, when my husband and I visited the restaurant in Mesa, AZ, palace we go almost bi-weekly, we had a horrible experience. It was semi-crowded for a Saturday morning around 10 am. It took us about 10 minutes to be seated. Not too bad. Once we were seated it took another 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our order. Then once they took our order it took another 45 minutes plus to get our food. An entire hour and a half after we arrived we finally got our food. Then when we got our food it was not fit for human consumption. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros. It was burnt and not very flavorful. I had the VIB, (french toast, bacon, hash browns & cinnamon apples). Hash brown were cold and burnt (how that happened I have NO idea) and the french toast took another 10 minutes to get to my table then the rest of my meal. So that totally threw off my order of eating the items. Everything was cold and just tasted off. Not sure if it was the long wait or a bad cook. If any cook. 

I must say we were highly disappointed. When we were paying our bill I complained and they just said sorry, we are short on cooks today, and smiled. They did not care. No apology, no \"Sorry you had a very bad experience and we will be loosing you as a long standing customer, how can we make things better for you so you can return?\" They would not listen to any criticism or ideas to better themselves. 

I had been there on other days when it was slow, but never in my life was it that slow or bad. This makes me upset because I need to change my reviews online for this used to be perfect breakfast spot. And I need to go find another place to spend my money.

They also changed up the VIB options to much less to choose from. You can now create form that menu anything else that is already listed in the menu for a bigger price. 

I hope they can do better for future customers. But this time Village Inn lost a long standing one."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month if not more. However, no longer will that be the case. Deciding to go here for my birthday breakfast we come in and get seated in the back by the kitchen. Being an non-average looking couple, we expect that seating placement by the kitchen to be from places who really don't want us there. I should of used my experience to know this was the first red flag and leave. Took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks. I guess its really hard to see an odd looking couple in the back corner by the kitchen. Finally the manager comes over and asks if we were served yet. Nope. So he took our drink orders and came right back with our drinks. Then we waited. And waited. And waited.

Finely our waitress comes over and takes our orders. Being my birthday I was really craving crepes. Its something I only get on special occasions. I was really excited to get them. It was closer to lunch time so my husband ordered a sandwich. She took our orders and left us to wait. Wait, wait, waiting. Bummer the service is so slow today. I was in no hurry so I could wait. Bet those crepes are going to be great!

About a good 25 minutes later, our waitress comes over with my husbands sandwich. And before she places it on the table she informed me that there are no crepes left and will be an additional 15 minutes before they could get any more and make them.

Wait, what? Ran out? On my birthday of all days? Couldn't you have told me that 45 minuets ago? Before we put the time in the sit there and enjoy the Village Inn kitchen ambiance? Really? 

My husband refused his sandwich and we left. So disappointed. On my birthday too. Sigh."}
{"text":"this place was very busy but we were seated right away. because of how packed they were it did take a while to get our drinks but our food came out super fast. our server Nicole was a good server. didn't really get to chat with her but she did do a good job and considering it was busy I understand that. I have no negative experience other than the drinks taking  a while to come out and getting refilled"}
{"text":"I give this joint 4 stars because I love VI pie! The service here has always been courteous and quick but the food hasn't always been the greatest. It's just greasy spoon but nothing beats a pie run to village inn late at night! I come for the pie and I always will!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Village Inn and was ecstatic when one opened in Surprise. Food is excellent and service is great even when busy. There is a nice old time diner feel to restaurant and feels very comforting."}
{"text":"For some reason they keep sitting us in the same spot with the same waitress.  She never gets our meal correct and always makes us wait forever.  Management does not come around enough to see if everything is ok.. I am sure they are aware of the issues and would rather not hear it anymore:)  We usually go with our two kids, by the time we get the food, the kids have gone beyond their \"I have done my time\" in ther seats.  We can never get out of there in less than an hour and half with her as a waitress."}
{"text":"Of all the breakfast chains, VI is always my favorite. Prompt service, pleasant waiters/waitresses, delicious food, plus pie. Can't beat pie. 
I always get breakfast, the chicken fried steak skillet is my favorite, but the new chicken-bacon-avacado hash is superb as well! 
I've been to many different locations, and always have a great experience. If you can, ask for Beth. She's super sweet!"}
{"text":"Being from Virginia and never having been to a Village Inn, I have to say we had a very good time on Easter Sunday. Our server, Tracie, had on bunny ears, and had that 'back east' quality that all of us 'transplants' are constantly look for. All of her recommendations for breakfast were exactly what we all wanted. All of us 'old' people just accept that when we come in as a group and have to have separate xhecks, the waiter is going to hate us. Not her! She just wanted to know who was on what check. Some of our food came out wrong, or incomplete, but the manager, Liz? Was right on top of it. So thank you Tracie, and Village Inn. We will be sending all our friends your way"}
{"text":"First and last visit today. One word sums up the experience...UNDERWHELMING. There are so many other breakfast options that are better (the Good Egg, Perk, Scramble...hell even IHOP is better) I'm just saying."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday for the all you can eat wings.... I'm not sure what's in the sauce, but all I could taste was a very strong flavour of vinegar. Wasn't for me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great village inn very friendly great service. The manager was awesome the waitress  was awesome too very sweet."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! Filthy, the staff are scumbags, our order took over an hour the first time, another 30 minutes the second time because they screwed up the first time, and the manager was totally unapologetic... I haven't had service this bad in years, it really just takes my breath away!!!"}
{"text":"If I had the option to leave no stars, I would. I understand it gets busy, really I do, but to only have one server on the shift is just ridiculous. My husband and I went in a lady let us know it'd be about a 30 min wait, which was fine, but there was no one in front of us. Then we got seated, got our drinks ordered then they were brought to us and we were told a server would be right with us, 20-25mins passes and still no server, so my husband and I just got up and left. Definitely not pleased with tonight's service. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. I recommend the huevos rancheros. And kids eat free Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Tried this place twice, not a fan. First time I ordered biscuits & gravy with a side of mash potatoes, the gravy tasted like dog food out of a can, you could tell the potatoes were instant mash potatoes, and the biscuit was basically just powder. I never thought I would find a place worst than Dennys but I guess I found it."}
{"text":"Food was good however when I walked into the restaurant it smelled of old mop water. Glasses smelled like dirty dish water, still sticky tables. Not sure what the problem is with this store but they need to freshen up the place. Maybe some air fresheners, change mop water or I don't know the smell of fresh baked pies.... just sayn'. I come here because it's convenient, decent price for decent food. Service seems good."}
{"text":"Was seated as we first entered. Waitress was friendly and professional. Food can out in correct amount of time. Food was hot and cooked to order. Better experience than Ohio. Will return."}
{"text":"I dropped in randomly on way to airport, when visiting Phoenix. I wanted to avoid chains, but that is getting harder to do, and this place at least had a local feel even though it is a chain. While I was there, the waitress I had greeted at least 2 people by name, so that's a good sign. 

The French toast was very good, with a vanilla flavor. The coffee was also good, although I tend to like mine not too strong, so maybe it would taste weak to Starbucks regulars. What I really liked was that I got a thermos of coffee for myself, so I could top off when I wanted. The service was good, waitress friendly, and it was a pleasant breakfast experience. There were also some awesome looking pies at the counter, but I was full and it was a little early for pie. =)"}
{"text":"Skip this place http://www.redmountainteaparty.com/actionitems/517meeting.html

Disgusting"}
{"text":"Holy moly they have free pie! I mean seriously any place that gives out free pie is tops on my list. Even if the atmosphere is a wee bit dated. The staff makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in north Phoenix. The staff are always friendly, the service is quick, and the food is great. I live in the southeast valley, but if I'm up north in the morning, breakfast at the Village Inn is a welcome reward!"}
{"text":"I thought Village Inns were all nighters like Denny's. 
This one apparently isn't. Closes by midnight on
the weekdays and 2am on weekends. And the late
night menu is REALLY stripped down. Pretty much
all that's left is deep fried bar food appetizer
type stuff. The main edible food choices are the
sandwiches. Lots of parking - part of it belongs
to the Tutor Time next door though. Of course,
that only matters during daytime on the weekdays. 
We were pretty much the only ones in the place
but somehow they still messed up our order. It was
very quickly fixed without a fuss so I give our
waiter props for that and for having a very good 
sense of humor. Food was just ok. The fried stuff
was too greasy for my taste. The sandwich was
passable. Had one of their limeades. Blech. I've
had cough syrup that tasted better. I Will avoid
that stuff completely from now on. One of the things 
Village Inn is known for is their pies. Wednesday 
is free pie day or something like that. They have 
a large selection of pies right at the entrance if 
you want to get a pie to go. If you come right around 
their closing time, sometimes they have pies that they
are not allowed to sell but instead can only give
away for free or else throw out - I guess going past
their sell by date. So if you really like pie, keep 
that in mind. ;)"}
{"text":"Their skillets are the best. It was hot and fresh. Lots of toppings as well. the waitress was attentive and even gave us a drink to go. Great job!"}
{"text":"I love the location off of Gilbert. They are ALWAYS on point.  But this location sucks! Plain and simple.  1st they don't have enough servers for their tables.  They told me they leave multiple tables open so that their servers can catch up, how about you hire more servers.  2nd, my waitress has been here twice and still forgot my creamer.  3rd my potatoes came cold and with absolutely no salt or pepper. My bacon isnt cook right  and, My waffle was sauggy from way to much butter.  The service here is horrible. 
DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"My server sucked. 
Got seated.. waited 10 minutes for her to acknowledge my presence. At which time she took my drink order, coffee. Waited another 10 minutes, which she took the time to greet many \"regulars\", I'm guessing.  She brings the coffee and takes my order. Food arrived pretty quickly, brought by a different lady. I asked her for a water and Cholula. After a few minutes the first server shows up sets down the water, Cholula and the check and walks away, saying nothing. No one checked to see if everything was ok. The table directly next to me stayed dirty for the duration of my visit. Seems that maybe she should spend some time clearing tables and trying to attend to the customers already in her area, rather than making sure that she greets the regulars."}
{"text":"Holy geriatric festival!  After being scared off by the Sunday morning waits at Orange Table and US Egg - we were off to Village Inn. 

Who would go there, I pondered?  Apparently, a lot of people, including the entire cast from the film Cocoon.  

Average wait that Sunday morning = 30 minutes.
Average age of patrons = 68.  
Oxygen tanks = optional.

This is probably the classiest of the IHOP, Denny's, Village Inn trifecta of 24-hour breakfast mediocrity.  And in case you're wondering this is the same thing (different name) as Baker's Square in California.

So, you know the pies are the bizzomb.  But I digress.  I decided to not go there this time.  I was ravenously hungry.  So I decided to focus on the main course, not dessert.  Being a little skittish on the breakfast after having a queasy chicken fried steak one time, I decided to play it cool on a club sandwich and fries.  How uncomplicated can that be?

The club was average.  It did the job, and our 50-something waitress (let's call her Flo) was charming in a nostalgic way - being effervescent and telling knock knock jokes."}
{"text":"OK, I feel like I am admitting something dirty when I say.......
I like this Village Inn. It is close to home, cheap, and I've never had a bad meal there. 

My brother and I went there when he was in town last month. As we are pulling up we notice a guy sitting at a folding table by the entrance with a clipboard. Oh crap, I am starving and just want some breakfast, but I have to get through the hurdle of some annoying survey/petition guy. I am not against petitions, just ask me to sign things after I've had a few drinks at the bar, not before I've had breakfast. My brother says he just tells them he's Canadian. Brilliant, I love my brother. So ask we are walking in the guy asks if we are registered to vote. Without missing a beat, I said yes, in Canada. The guy says he likes Canadians.

So we made it in and they showed us right to a booth. I sat down and hit my special purpose on a hard piece of metal. OUCH! My side of the booth had absolutely no cushioning where I sat down. Maybe a gigantic regular sits there every day and has worn down the cushion. Who knows? Anyway I scooted all the way in and the other side was padded. After all that drama we got down to the business of ordering. I got strawberry banana French toast, and it was great. The service was decent, and the food was good. 

I didn't get to see the cast of Cocoon that Thomas S. did, and I am kind of disappointed that no one let out a loud embarrassing fart while I was there. We would have been rolling. All the random stuff that happened kind of made breakfast entertaining.  

I left satisfied, and I would probably go back at some point in time."}
{"text":"Alright, I hope I don't offend anyone, but this place is polyester pants city come Sunday morning. You WILL be waiting for a table on Sunday morning if you come here... but then again, a lot of places have the same thing. This one might be hot-n-heavy because of Cornerstone Church down the street?

Anyways, I've stopped by here after work (I work night shift) and had some breakfast. Service was nice, quick, and easy. The servers didn't come by too often, which I sometimes hate at other places (Just let me eat, yo!).

I am a bit partial to Ihop, though, but really you can't go too wrong here."}
{"text":"The Village Inn in Surprise sucks. The waitresses are fantastic but the new manager needs to learn a thing or two because customers are his bread and butter. Oh I get it, if he holds the line on expenses, he probably gets a bonus. But really! 

Today I found they no longer wrap spoons in with the folks and knifes in a cheap paper napkin. How heck do you stir coffee or tea whatever without one? Oh sure you can ask your server to bring one, but I'd rather have everything set ready to go while my server is taking care of getting my food order to the cook and brining it hot to the table. 

And if you order oatmeal it comes with brown sugar only. WHAT? Who eats oatmeal with out additional accurtiments like raisins or walnuts nuts? And don't get me started on the mini size eggs that are served, I think they must be from miniature chickens grown someplace in Littleput land.

I have been going there for breakfast with friends for about five years now, it time to find someplace that cares about the quality of it's food and customers. As it is the coffee price is outrageous for tasteless black water they call coffee. 

But waitstaff is terrific they seem discussed with the ridiculous changes that leave the customer shaking their heads with \"What's wrong with the management."}
{"text":"We've had breakfast there a few times before and found them to be ok, a pretty good value.  So we decided to use them for a picnic breakfast for our club. We ordered breakfast for 30 people at a agreed price. When we arrived at the picnic we found the trays sparsely packed.  We had to give each person 1 Tablespoon of scrambled egg and barely served 30 people 1 piece of bacon, 1 sausage and a large helping of potatoes.  It was quite embarrassing.  I called to complain and the manager never returned my call. Poor business practice.  Never go there again nor will any of our club members."}
{"text":"Love going here! My friends and I will usually catch a movie then get dessert at this Village Inn. Their pie is amazing and I'm always trying new ones.

I also LOVE their Grown Up Grilled Cheese. The bread alone is like eating a wonderful cheese-it. And dipped in their superb tomato soup? Whoa, half a sandwich is never enough!

The servers and service are also worth mentioning because they have always been great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for dinner.  Probably, old fashioned but I like the food and love their pies!  Fun \"date\" night."}
{"text":"This place is crawling in roaches. I was given a menu that had a dead roach stuck to the back of it.  As I was sitting at the table I seen a roach crawling across the table. I really don't want to consume any of their food. I can't imagine how many nests are in the kitchen if they are just crawling on the dining room tables. The staff is nice."}
{"text":"First the good:  this place is spotlessly clean.  Service is attentive.  However, they only get three stars from me because I prefer to eat vegetarian when I can.  The only way they would allow me to do that would be to buy each individual vegetable as a side, and that would have been very costly.  Why would they not offer a four item veggie plate like Cracker Barrel?  So I had 1/2 sandwich with a salad and water to drink.  My friend had a regular meal and a tea.  We each had one slice of pie.  The bill came to almost 35 bucks with tip.  I was floored (mostly because I am a cheap b**tard!, but really because it just wasn't a great value for the money.)  Food was very good, I will say.  Unfortunately, I won't be back.  I do drive by that location a lot and it is usually empty.  Sadly, I can see why.  There are much cheaper alternatives in the same area that are just as tasty."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. They recently changed their menu up :( but still good. I came in recently late night to order some food with some friends. They were having some technical difficulties with my order so they asked if I would get something else and they covered the difference :) and then gave us all three of us a free piece of pie of our choice. How excellent. And the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"For those waking up hungry as heck in the morning and craving eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and etc. Village Inn is the right answer. The menu isn't meant just to feed ya, it's to fill you up just right. About half the menu for breakfast comes with a side of pancakes and everyone gets their own coffee pot so no need to worry about refills. This place will satisfy any morning cravings, this will be my number one spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"A month ago - a year ago - three years ago - this wold have been 5 stars.  Attentive staff, good menu, good food.  My favorite at VI has always been the club sandwich.  It was thick enough to have to hold with two hands and bite in from the side; I was never able to chomp down on an entire wedge from the front.  Until today... The sandwich was very skimpy.  It may have been this visit.  I will try again, and add a comment if it is not any better.  Charge me more, but don't skimp!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by this restaurant last night. The server was excellent, very nice, and really attentive, BUT the food was not good. The first order of mash potatoes had powder residue in them so a second order was brought. They were not much better. The roast beef was tough. We had chicken too on top of the Mac and Cheese. The chicken was chewy and fatty. Didn't even complain at that point!  Why!? We were thinking about getting a piece of pie and taking a pie home but after the dinner, we could not imagine that the pie would be much better even though the pictures made them look delicious. The best part of the meal was the onion rings and toasted garlic bread. It is really sad that their food product is not better (or their cook!). We will not be returning. I gave two stars for the service and a good tip for the server. She tried!"}
{"text":"Our server, while she was taking out order, explained that she was watching the parking lot because a \"regular\" was coming by to show her his car.  After that, she took another customer's order and about 5-10 minutes later, another table's order.  She refilled our water and disappeared.  About 30-35 minutes after we ordered, our breakfast finally came out and it was cold.  The other two tables' food came out immediately after ours.  Obviously our order was done 10-15 minutes before she brought it out, sitting there getting cold while she looked over her friend's car in the parking lot.  My husband complained, so she popped his food in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm it up.  Yum.  We did get a 20% discount because of the problem, so that is good that the guy upfront is empowered to do that, but definitely we are done with them.  Too bad because manager was really nice one time when there was a mix-up with the pie gift card."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best place in town for breakfast.  The staff is attentive and the place is clean.  Food is decent and portions are good.  I'm not sure why Surprise doesn't have a decent breakfast place for just good old omelets and what not but Village Inn is the best so far.  Its way above Nick's on Reems and better than IHOP and Dennys.  Now if Tailgaters would serve breakfast, I'd be in heaven."}
{"text":"The service here is usually pretty good and most of the staff friendly. The manager lacks personal skills and is extremely condescending if you approach with an issue. Had a bad experience and won't be going back. There are plenty of places in Surprise that appreciate customers and customer loyalty. Thankfully we have family restaurants like Nicks."}
{"text":"It's been years since we dined in here, but with a recent poor experience with ihop we decided to try a takeout order with Village Inn. Everything was great! Customer service, food, and speedy pick up time. We will order from here again!"}
{"text":"This was xmas day and not much else was open.  The place wasn't very full so I got coffee pretty fast.  It was only a third of a pot and luke warm.  I initially had one waitress who got me the coffee and told me another waitress would be serving me.  She never showed up and the first waitress finally took my order.  I got the five cheese omlet, and it was ok.  

I never was asked if I wanted another pot of coffee.  But it was xmas so.............."}
{"text":"Good food but slow service.   Much cleaner than J B's across the street.   But J B's does offer biscuits and gravy as a side.   Village Inn does have pie slice Wednesday which is nice, but on that day they will not give you your AARP discount.   I live that they give you a carafe of coffee.    I had an omelet and it was cooked well."}
{"text":"Food was fine; service was sooooooo slow.  Waitress and manager appeared very unconcerned, even when I complained.  First, the waitress never came; I had to ask for one. Then she took our drink order--waters. We did not get the waters for 20 minutes!!! We got our eggs and pancakes (after I asked for the manager) 45 minutes after we sat down.  (People who had another waitress got their food 15 minutes after they sat down.)

The older lady across the aisle told me that she had to go find the waitress twice.  And the poor lady had an oxygen tank.

If your waitress seems really slow, ask to be reseated in another section."}
{"text":"Most Village Inns are decent places and food is consistently good. This location however, I DON'T  recommend for take out. The dining room only had less than 5 tables when I arrived but despite calling my small order in 20 mins ahead, I still had to wait another 20 mins for it to be ready. So obviously the order wasn't put through when I called in. They dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Service by our waitress Megan very attentive, ensuring her area is clean. Food was very good, too full for pie today...next time for sure. The 'only' item was the water, had an after taste to it. Filtration might help."}
{"text":"I love Village Inn. This location is better than the one by the hospital. My gf and I come here on date night. We had a fav waitress (Justine), but she has moved on. We will miss her, but Taylor served us tonight, and she was awesome! Nearly all of the wait staff are super friendly and easy going. I've never been disappointed with any of the food, except the Hollandaise sauce, and I'm just picky about that. There is not usually a long wait. My gf and I prefer to grab the early bird special, because the restaurant is quieter and not as busy. My only complaint is that I always have to send my hash browns back because the cook only browns one side. The key lime pie is a spiritual experience."}
{"text":"Good food but a bit difficult to find if you are coming from the south. Yelp map is VERY confusing!"}
{"text":"Prior experience has been pretty good. But this time was terrible. We got a banana cream pie to go. The banana cream was a cheap vanilla pudding with banana chunks in it. They apparently thought they could mask it with the banana and the pie was expensive. Will not do that again!!"}
{"text":"Are these Village Inns all dirty? Napkins and food all over the floor. Lady's room the same. Really needs a cleaning and face lift..too bad because it is hard to find restaurants open after 8pm. Food was just ok, we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The server was good the food was good the restaurant was so dirty in the plates  needed to be thrown away they need to close this location if that's the best they can do don't eat here I'm concerned what's going to happen to me tonight for meeting here"}
{"text":"Will not be eating here again. Floor is filthy. Restrooms need attention. Food was good but cold"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at Mimi's Cafe, we went to Village Inn.  Very promptly we were seated, our orders taken, and the appetizers were delivered.  We had hardly eaten half of our soup/salad, before our entrees arrived.  Very good food, nice portions, and prompt attention by the waiter, Jamie.  Our drink glasses were never more than half full, and he visited us several times to check on our needs.  He also was very knowledgable of the menu offerings, and informed us of the specials during the week and the pie specials.   We'll be back, Jamie!!!  Thank you for a very pleasant experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area but stopped in for breakfast last weekend.  This seems to be a chain, a little like IHOP.  Breakfast was fine. I had scrambled eggs, fruit and yogurt.  They have coffee, but nothing like a latte.   Spouse had the pancakes and reported that they had a texture that reminded him of cornbread.  
The space is quaint/cute and I hear that you really have to try the pie (free on Wednesdays) so maybe next time we will!"}
{"text":"I love going to this location! The severs are always very friendly and prompt. The food is always great, I suggest the French dip! Jenifer is especially a great server! She is always so happy and makes the experience even better!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here before going out for New Year's since we had a buy one get one free coupon. It's always so cheerful in here. I used to be an interior designer, so I always look at colors and architectural features. I love the combo of colors they utilize. Bright oranges on the booth seating with a brown fabric with blue and gold designs on the back. The lighting is also cool- brushed silver. Ok, back to the important stuff- food! We got the ultimate skillet with chorizo and the ultimate burger. I really wanted to taste the strawberry crepes so I ended up substituting it in for the pancakes for a little bit extra $. The burger came with 2 fried onion rings on top. Service was great and Robert the server helped me out in making a decision between the crepes and the French toast. Aaggggg I was so hungry! Still waiting for food, will write more after I eat. 

Ok I'm back. Oh my God! The first few bites of the strawberry crapes were amazing I could hardly stop myself from eating all of it it came out before the rest of the food which was the skillet in the burger and I already had it have gone by the time the rest of the food came it was lovely. The inside cream was smooth creamy sweet on top they had strawberries and some whip cream. The skillet was also amazing it was basically country fried potatoes with chili on top to Friday eggs cheese and sour cream. I would never ever thought to put chili in the skillet but it was great! The burger was huuuuge! I could not get my mouff over it. Literally and seriously. Next I am getting the peanut butter pie at Roberts recommendation, and he's been accurate so far! 

Ok I'm back. Wow on the peanut butter pie. It had crushed Reece's peanut butter cups. I even got a bit of ice cream on the side which ended up being the perfect side. 

To wrap things up, the food was amazing and so was the service! I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare.  Hostess and waitress very friendly and quickly seated.  We were there for lunch and the place was not super busy but I though our wait for food was long considering we ordered sandwiches.  I had the half sandwich, soup, and pie for $7.49 which seemed a little steep for Denny's type food and atmosphere.  My wife had a turkey sandwich which was $8.69.  Most restaurants run lunch specials and this was it so not impressed.  The chili was very common and could have come from a can, doubt it was 'homemade' , the Reuben was good as was the turkey sandwich but all in all, will not go back, too many restaurants with better food and better prices."}
{"text":"Super good food. Really kind friendly service, busy on Wednesdays. I suspect on Wednesdays there  busy because of free pie."}
{"text":"Took family that was in town from Mexico to visit my 91 year grandmother that's in the hospital for breakfast. When we were seated family spoke Spanish. Asked the waiter if he spoke Spanish, he said yes but was told by management that he was not allowed to speak Spanish because someone complained that it was offensive. REALLY! We live in  AZ people, there's a casino across the street. Never has this happened to me. We will not be returning. Just sharing this because I know a lot of my family and friends go there to eat also."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. This is a regular breakfast spot for my dad. Decent breakfast. Good service. We got a couple slices of pie to go. I had key lime, it's not very good..."}
{"text":"Stood and waited for 10 minutes before anyone helped us. After being seated we waited another 20 minutes and no one came to help us so we left. The restaurant was not busy, the servers were standing around chatting, and there was a terrible sewage smell wafting out from the kitchens by where we sat. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was SO GOOD. It's really nice inside and has a very well laid out menu that is easy to read and choose from. All of the staff was so nice and friendly and they even gave us a 20% off coupon for our meal. Didn't get to try the pie this time but will definitely be back and will try it then. 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"I heard that you can tell if a restaurant is any good (or clean for that matter) simply by their bathrooms. If that was true, this place failed big time. I was sat down, and after I ordered my food, I went to the ladies bathroom for a minute.. wow. Unspeakable dirty lady 'messes' that someone didn't clean up in the first stall I went to. Almost threw up in my mouth.

Waitress is friendly, but strange... she'd ask me a question: \"How do you like your food?\"... \"Need a minute?\"... But not bother to wait for my response before walking away. Hmmm... 

Should have left the place instantly, but decided to give my Roast beef sandwich a try since I already ordered it--(and would  an ass ordering and leaving immediately). Good, but small and soggy. Just an average sandwich with onion rings really. Maybe if I went for a much more 'delicious-looking' breakfast item I wouldn't have been disappointed. Maybe I would have more positive things to say if I wasn't so traumatized by their restrooms."}
{"text":"I'm not a Village Inn fan, but a friend of mine was in town and we went there to catch up over some pie and coffee.  Last time I was at a Village Inn was about 3 yrs ago for breakfast, and never been to this one.  It was extremely clean, service was spectacular, and the server actually knew the menu.  Only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 because the food is fair, not great.  I would go again."}
{"text":"HUGE shoutout to this Village Inn!! After our Monster Jam show on Saturday we stopped here to eat and while in the booth a BUNCH of my bank cards and gift cards fell out somehow. They actually contacted one of my clients who's business card was in my stack of card to get in touch with me!! I am so great full for the honesty and that they had the integrity not to take anything!! When on this side of town we will definitely be hitting this place up again for a late night breakfast! PS if anyone is looking for a realtor Amanda Lilly Pinkerton is amazing and Carrying her business bring good luck"}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down, waiting to be seated with my wife. The manager, or whoever was seating people, came half way over to us and said, \"welcome to village inn. How many in your party?\"

I'm sure this is what he's supposed to say but he said it extremely rudely and without a smile. When I told him we had two and wanted a booth, he dismissively and, with a tinge of anger, said he'd have to wipe a booth down first. I told my wife, \"let's go,\" and we went to paradise valley burger across the street. I'm so tired of crappy customer service. If you get a customer service job, smile and be kind to your customers. It's literally THAT EASY. 

P.s. The two stars are for how the food usually is... I actually kinda like the V.I.B :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided we wanted some brenner the other night and choose Village Inn. We came in and the hostess was nice and immediately seated us and that's the only positive of this night. It took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table. The resturant didn't appear to be that busy, there were several empty tables.

We ordered our drinks and before we could mention the food she left the table. We finally got to order our food almost 20 minutes after we arrived. After we ordered the waitress never came back to check on us and the wait for a waffle and french toast seemed awfully long. Finally the food arrives and it all looks great, but no drink refills offered even though our glasses were empty. 

And now the worst part of the evening, our food was cold. Not ice cold but definitely sat for a while. Cold food, empty glasses and we could not nail down our waitress. Finally the manager comes around and asks if everything was alright. We said the food was cold and she asks us if we tried to send it back. We said no, but we tried to explain it's because our waitress never came back to our table or even the section. No apology, no offer to discount the meal she just walked away. 

Pretty unbelievable experience, I was really surprised at the low quality of service and just the general treatment of customers with complaints. The Village Inn is definitely on my list of resturants too avoid."}
{"text":"Good food!!! good service. Bummer their fresh peach pie is no longer going to be offered, now only their baked peach pie, which is just ok. The grilled cheese offering are great! The Parisian grilled cheese was good, but their Club sandwich is always a bit hit!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the Cobb salad last time I went and it was perfect. Can't forget the pie! Also, great service."}
{"text":"Staff is not friendly, service is poor and chef can't even cook eggs the right way. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Service here is awful! Waitress brought out our food and check and never bothered checking on us again. Good luck getting a refill."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning.  Everything was great.  I am on a special diet and our waitress was more than. accommodating."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit at 9:00 PM on a weeknight. There were six of us looking for somewhere to eat where we could sit down and talk and have a late dinner after a very busy day. The village Inn filled that need. It was clean if somewhat dated looking. I'm sure it was the style in 1970 or so. But ambiance was not the low spot. The wait staff was efficient But the food, well, that was not memorable. It wasn't bad per se, but it wasn't good either. It filled the hole in the stomach but it wasn't the least bit tasty. This was the opinion of most at the table, my daughter said average. We left with the hungry feeling gone but certainly no feeling of satisfaction either.  It wasn't bad but we definitely could have put our dining dollar to better use."}
{"text":"I love a breakfast place that has healthy options and free pie :-)"}
{"text":"We came here because we figured it wouldn't be busy; we were right. 

But, to our amazement, the food was really good. I had an extremely flavorful cheeseburger that was as good as any burger I have had in Phoenix. 

Thankfully, herd instinct will keep the masses flocking to lesser establishments like Lenny's, In-N-Out and Lucky Boyz so we can have Village Inn practically to ourselves."}
{"text":"Been here for over an hour. They were not properly staffed and the manager on duty is a self loathing fool. They had the poor girl up front running all over. They need to fire people for this stuff. Didn't put peoples orders in to the kitchen. We had plans after dinner so we had to leave before we got the meal and now we have to box it up and will have to eat out of plastic boxes in our truck. I guess we can't expect to just come in and eat and go when we planned out 1 hour and 45 min in advance. I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"My review is totally opposite from Dianne S.  from a couple of years ago.
We recently fled the V.I. at Northern and the 101 because the food was never consistent.  

I enjoy a good Patty Melt a couple of time per month after a late afternoon or early evening outing at Desert Diamond Casino.  I thought I'd found it at the V.I. on Northern, but after a dozen tries I was ready to throw in the towel on Village Inn.  Until by chance I found the V.I. on Grand Avenue.

Our past 3 trips have been perfect.  I like my Patty Melt on Sourdough, and Parmesan Crusted with a decent serving of grilled onions and they haven't missed yet.  Unlike the Northern location where I never knew what to expect.  From barely grilled rye, (oops, I forgot to tell the cook), or more grilled onion skin than onion or no grilled onion at all.  While my changes to the typical menu preparation are not extraordinary they are well within the doable parameters of a decent grill person.  

Why the big difference between these two identical chain eateries?   The simple answer is the manager.   Tonight it was Cindy.  In addition to chatting up the customers, she was also clearing tables and busing dishes.  Her work ethic must have be rubbing off on the staff as well, as the place was darned near spotless.

{"text":"Hmmm... Where to begin?

This was my first and last time eating at a Village Inn. The waitress was extremely slow, and basically slapped the receipt on my table without even asking me if I wanted pie, which I did. I think the food at McDonald's is much better. 

I ended up paying the bill and going to Dairy Queen for dessert instead. And actually I got better service at the Dairy Queen drive-through window"}
{"text":"Clean, open, bright. Being a chain restaurant,  nothing here is different than any other VI: the menu is always the same. However,  at this location, we found the dining room to be more open & bright. Good location, easy to get to. We stopped in only 2 nights ago for supper, as the first monsoon storm was threatening rain. Inside, it was quiet. Clean!  Our server was Grace, a very pleasant, friendly lady. She treated our granddaughter so well that on Sunday, our granddaughter wanted to return to the restaurant because of Grace. Good food, good price."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and service has gotten progressively worse. Our first 2 times we had a GREAT server....friendly, listened to what we ordered and anticipated refilling our drinks. They were not pushy, did not rush us, and actually looked and acted as if they liked talking to people. We had two different servers on these 2 visits. 
The last time we came, our server came out about 8 minutes in to us having our food, and asked if we wanted boxes. We were nowhere near that point, and in fact, intended to get pie. Our drinks were empty, with no thought of a refill.....I wouldn't mind (to save from wasting) if my server were to ask if I'd like more to drink. After we finished eating, we were basically ignored and had to flag our server down to get our pie. 
Tonight, I ordered a southwest salad with no avocado. Hubby ordered a salad and an omelette.  Both salads were brought out together...mine with avocado all over... no biggie, I can take it out. However, the omelette was forgotten altogether, and the drinks were empty---again. 
     The manager seems nice. Very friendly, and visible. I'm not sure if the servers are instructed not to refill drinks unless customers ask for it or if that is just the 2 servers we happened to get the past 2 times. 
We won't be going back to Village Inn in Chandler on Alma School."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, nice and clean store. I like coming here for lunch on Wednesdays, because you get a free piece of pie 10am-10pm."}
{"text":"If you want to get served by a waitress that is completely smashed on the job this is your place! I dined here with friends on a Sunday evening with 3 toddlers and this woman REEKED like booze. She was slow, obviously, messed up all of our bills, and It took at least 20 minutes to get our bills figured out. Our meals came out at different times, and you could tell there was a hot mess going on in the back kitchen. All kinds of yelling was going on.  I think they took their Sunday Funday too far at this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 stars just for their pies alone.  I have never dined here but have come by many times for a pie to take home.  The pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving was OUTSTANDING.  Blows away the pies at the usual grocery stores in Gilbert.  Very short line the day before too.  Sweet."}
{"text":"We come here all the time!  Lots of late night coffee and pie runs!  This is my designated eat breakfast anytime place to go.  The service is usually fine, food has always been good and love the selection of pies.  A pretty good mix of characters frequent this location and if you like to people watch you are in for a chuckle now and then.  The waitresses have always been friendly and one used to drive my wife crazy because she was overly friendly to me.  I loved it, we could order same type of pie and mine would be double the size with a wink after serving.  Coffee is always fresh and ready to go.  The cooks nail breakfast all day, every day....then again I akways get breakfast.  I like the 2-2-2 as perfect size without making you feel miserable to finish everything.  If you remember the bands Cranberries or Sixpence, you will hear the song \"Kiss Me\" or Cranberries \"Linger\" if you are sitting at least an hour.  We argue who is who every time and have to look it up.  As this is close to our house, we will continue to come.  Only complaint I notice more and more about this location is some of the workers reek of smoking weed.  It was almost toxic checking out one night and can't understand why they'd let the potheads be the last person you meet as your leaving this place."}
{"text":"Went there today had garden veggie skillet, so did drew my buddy, potatoes were rubbery, not flavorful at all, got mine just Luke warm. Won't be back for long time, only thing I give my experience was service was OK"}
{"text":"Very bad service tonight.  Walked in and sat down, ordered off the VIB menu.  Waiter brought me water, no lemon.  Recognized no lemon and said he'd be back.  61 mins passed, no food, no waiter to check on us.  Still no lemon.  We got up and walked out and was confronted by the staff.  He said it would be right out.  Sorry, if it takes 60 mins to cook me an egg, there is something wrong.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here for 15 minutes already and despite there being 20+ open tables we are still waiting to be seated. Obviously they forgot to staff anyone even though there was a Cardinal game tonight.  Manager/host not only is not helpful but is not pleasant. Totally disappointed by this visit"}
{"text":"Tried to have dinner at village inn bad service. Server just don't get it. He is the last point so he should have looked closer."}
{"text":"Went to this Village Inn today at approx 12:30 pm. They took my name and waited to be seated. A party of 6 came in about 5 min after. I was seated shortly thereafter. I was given lukewarm coffee and water by the person who seated me. The party of 6 was seated close to me. They got their drinks, placed their order and I had yet to meet my table attendant. I got up, threw 2 dollars on the cashier's counter for the coffee and left. DO NOT COME HERE unless you want to be ignored"}
{"text":"Ok location. Clean for the most part. Very nice staff. Most of times cooks do a good job on my french toast but today unfortunately I had it look like2 small hairs on the edge of my plate I would caution to say they were eyelashes.At first I thought one was mine but when I seen the second eyelash that was no coincidence. The manager was very nice and they replaced my french toast. my french toast was free because it was Veterans Day so there was no reason for me to lie to point out the hair on my plate but overall Village Inn is a good place to eat just today was not the best experience"}
{"text":"We were heading out on a road trip from the Chandler area To Sedona, Arizona. We were all in a great mood, as we are about to have a long weekend/New Year's eve your vacation. We were hungry stopped at a local breakfast place called Village Inn. When we arrived, we were able to be sat right away. We just wanted something quick to put in our bodies to energize us for this upcoming road trip. We were greeted by our server almost immediately. I ordered a vegetarian, egg white omelette and the rest of the table created their own breakfast where you can choose your meat, your egg, your potato, and either a pancake or waffle. Our food took about 15 to 20 minutes to come out. The coffee was really disappointing. It tasted like coffee flavored water with really no body in it. When our food was served I was automatically disappointed and almost disgusted. They had taken my beautiful omelette and put an outrageous amount of red sauce all over it. The eggs became soggy and the sauce was nearly impossible to remove. It ruined my entire breakfast. I also added avocado, in which they gave me two slices of. I believe it was also brown. Everyone else's breakfast was ice cold. We all sent our breakfast back. I took a few bites of mine and sent mine back and told them I didn't want another one. I got a stomachache right away and I didn't eat for almost the entire rest of the day. Everyone else had sent their breakfast back to be remade because it was so cold. It only took about five minutes to come back out. Later in the day three out of the four people who ate breakfast there had massive stomachaches. I don't know what was in the food, if it was the way it was cooked, or if it was because we sent it back... Either way I definitely recommend skipping this place. It was an awful experience, not exactly how we wanted to start our New Year's eve road trip/vacation. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"Our waitress Carla was an exceptionally fast, attentive and efficient waitress.  Our meals were made exactly as ordered and they were very tasty"}
{"text":"I am a fan of village inn. It is another place that my family frequents for get togethers. The restaurant is very homey. When you walk in you can see their array of pies. Most times we get pies from here for special occasions. They are resonantly priced and they have a good selection. Don't forget that you can get a free slice of pie on Wednesday. They have a great menu that are always updating.

The skillets are always my favorite! I like the pancakes as well. 

The employees have always been great. Services has been pretty good as well.

This is a great location for them to be at. There has been a lot of development here and they must be doing pretty good. It's just down the street from our house.

I definitely recommend this place. You can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"Just back from a late lunch at Village Inn on McKellips. Food was good, and service was great. Server named Donald did an outstanding job."}
{"text":"How surprised I am that I enjoy village inn SO much! Just moved and decided to give it a try. I prefer small local owned business and no chain restaurants.
Well! It's updated clean and servers are sweet and friendly. It can be slow at times but not terrible. 
Their breakfast is consistently excellent, no matter what we order. Their hash browns being my favorite! 
My husband loves their burgers.
Pies? Omg I hate that I know they are so so so daing good. Ugh  and yummy! 
We get take out from here several times a month and never ever has my order been messed up, missing items or anything wrong.
Once a large group of us went in and the wait team was amazing!!!! Helping us figure out our iPhone haha good food and phone help.
They always send good coupons in the mail to use. Which we always forget but nice to know. 
Neighborhood places should be like this.
For the first time, this year. I ordered pies for thanksgiving and everyone raved.
Their key lime and apply being the best ones by far, just due to my own tastes.
Great job team. We appreciate you being our new neighbors!"}
{"text":"Waiters name was Matt. Seriously dude .. We ask for over medium and they come out all runny. Then we tell him and he argues with us and said they are over medium.. And he kept arguing trying to prove he was right... I know customer service and that's not cool.. I will never bring my mom here again.."}
{"text":"Every now and then I want Village Inn's Ultimate Skillet or a piece of pie.  I like this location,  it's always clean, fast and friendly.  I don't come here too often but I love the way they treat their regular customers.  On my last visit I couldn't help see the exceptional customer service.  When I was seated my server (Mike) was catching up with the older couple seated at the booth next to me.  After Mike took me order, the older couple told me that Mike is the best and they see him every week.  When the older couple was finished they waited for Mike to have a moment so they could say goodbye and get a hug.  I don't know if it was because they were older and reminded me of my late parents, but I found it very touching.  I really made my night.  

Now not only was he so kind to this couple but the whole time he provided excellent service to me.  My order was taken promptly, my drink was refilled before it was empty, and he repeatedly checking to see how everything was.

Not only was Mike great but the manager (Michael) checked in on me twice.  Michael also remembered the family that was seated a few tables down asking them how the kids sports are going.  Absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst meal I've ever had. The service was very good. The potatoes were instant even though menu stated that the mashed potatoes had the Redskins on them still.   The macaroni and cheese was ridiculously bland with absolutely no sauce on it.  The Shibata bread for the French dip was hard as a rock on the bottom portion. Chicken fried steak was not more suit all dry and hard. I cannot believe they serve food this bad and I'm not a picky eater."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! And priced pretty reasonably almost cheap actually! The server was terrific! She took all three orders without writing a single thing down and delivered us our food exactly as we asked for it! And food was brought quickly and hot!!

Definitely going back!

add on - The boyfriend and his BFF go often and are always happy with the food and service!"}
{"text":"1st off food was AWESOME! 

I called and spoke with Beanie and placing my to go order (Wed Oct 18th at 1pm) and also at the front desk when picking up my food and her sense of humor in customer service skills were above and beyond. She is super sweet & funny... THX YOU SO MUCH!"}
{"text":"First time I've gone for the VIB (Very Important Breakfast).  WOW!  Huge selection for breakfast and the food was quite good.  Skip the Dennys down the street for breakfast and come here instead.  Lunch, Dinner, and of course Pie is quite good.

Wednesday is \"pie rush Wednesday\" where you get a free slice with a meal.  Place is usually quite busy on that day, especially with the senior crowd!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Why bother to have a hostess tell you about free pie Wednesday when your waitress doesn't offer it! And when I asked she begrudgingly takes back the bill. Really? She also made me wait to take my order...I told her I needed a min to decide and I lost count on when she came back...I guess single people are not allowed! Bad decision since I pick the location for group meeting places for a group of 12 employees. ....who I cant wait to tell them why we will never do Village Inn!  So here is the kicker! The table next to me was large so guessing she was hoping to cash in? They all ordered a free pie with a drink! Haha....talk about Just deserts. ...out of 8 ...only 2 ordered food. Again. .a bad decsion!  So if you are alone don't go here. And if you are a large group go to the Pita jungle just down the street because that is where we will have our meetings!"}
{"text":"Gus and I drove out this way for some reason, I forget what we were doing. 

So we stopped at this Village Inn for lunch. 

Met at the door by a nice tall young man. 

We were then again greeted by a young lady changing the salt and pepper shakers. 

One more greeting was coming soon from our waitress. She was a very nice but not overly familiar, just like I like it. Her service was spot on. 

Gus and I each had a burger and to my surprise it tasted like a real burger. Mine was called The Works Burger which means it comes with stuff I never have on a burger. It was supposed to have a sauce on it, this was left off, not by request. I could have asked for it, but decided to eat it as is and it was good. The onion rings that came with it were also very well cooked, nice and crisp. Speaking of onions, although there are grilled onions on this burger it also has raw on the side. I often ask, who gets the nice piece of onion, well this time it was me yay. 

It was a nice lunch with good service and at a decent price. Simple pleasures."}
{"text":"We went late night for coffee and pie, I believe our servers name is Ivan, he was extremely friendly and made us feel very welcomed. 

I highly recommend this place, the only bad thing was that the coffee was a bit light."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I asked for water at the beginning of my meal and didn't get it until after I was done eating and had to go ask the kitchen for a glass of water. The food was cold and dry and took over 40 minutes for a simple order of eggs and bacon. Our server Rachel, didn't know what she was doing and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Great experience this visit. Seated quickly. Served quickly. Waitress was pleasant. Food was tasty. They were having a good day. Only complaint is that once the ticket is dropped they don't check back. And it was free pie Wed. Had to flag down a manager."}
{"text":"No waffle.  I want something different that I don't have at home.   Obvious the have Carbons tried it's on Amazon and real cheap.  99 ounces for $15.   I don't care to pay $4.00 for a half for kids or vip for a half at $8 it's a 13 cent item.   No value here go somewhere else"}
{"text":"That pie was incredible!!
We are in town on vacation and had to stop in for a second time before we leave town just to get another slice of pie. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This morning for breakfast my hubby and I were in the mood for French toast decided we should definitely come here. When we arrived we were immediately greeted and were sat right away. Server came by and was ready to take our order. The hubby ordered the strawberry and banana French toast without the white filling and I ordered a skillet with eggs, ham, sausage , bacon, veggies, potatoes and it came with an order of pancakes. By far one of the best places to have breakfast. The pancakes were delicious. And the best part is we literally had our meal within 10 min of ordering. Every time we come it is never a disappointment."}
{"text":"We asked for a booth where we could work.  We were sat by the kitchen where we heard multiple employees having inappropriate conversations.  The server came 3x in the first 5 minutes we were there to take our order making us feel rushed.  As we were finishing up our food I noticed the lady in the next booth looking at something on the wall of her booth it started to move and came over to our booth.  It was a cockroach.  We got up and left right away.  I told the Supervisor at the check out and she offered me $5.00 off our next visit.  So not only were we not able to get any work done because of where we were seated there were cockroaches.  Needless to say they can keep the $5.00 off as we will never be able to eat there again."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent customer service. Our waitress, Tina, was very personable. It was obvious she liked her job. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite and business meeting pie. ;-) It was a great experience and my server Scott was awesome! 

The food tasted great and we learned they have a new chef so he is definitely a keeper.

They were not very busy for a Tuesday night which meant we had great attention from Scott and the Manager.

If you are in the area and stop by grab some pie!"}
{"text":"Took 10 mins to get seated in an empty restaurant. Another 15 minutes to get our water and coffee. Fries tasted like fish. Biscuits and gravy were cold. And country fried steak tasted like plastic. In the hour we sat there. We did not see our waitress at all. And our water was never refilled. Never coming back to this location"}
{"text":"For a place that make pies you would think their coffee would also be at least tasteful. Even after we complain an they brought us a new pot it was still hoorible  This is the same both resturants in our area."}
{"text":"The food was pretty standard diner food, which was why we went there. Sometimes you just crave a BLT. For the middle of the afternoon on a Friday though, the service left much to be desired. No matter how many times I thought I made eye contact with our server, I guess I didn't because for the life of me I couldn't get a stinkin straw. I guess the older crowd needed more attention and that's fine. Let me personally recommend the peanut butter cup pie though. It really was a little slice of heaven. There was no way that I could have eaten it all myself though, as it was super sweet."}
{"text":"The sever Breanna does a great job! The Managment is friendly The Hostesses and cashiers are friendly!"}
{"text":"Norma, my 91 year old friend, goes here every Tuesday morning for breakfast with other residents of the care center where she lives.  She has raved about it for the longest time so I finally broke down and went with her.  It had been ages since I gone to a Village Inn restaurant and the thought really didn't appeal to me.

I had no complaints about how the french toast with banana and strawberries was fixed.  They certainly served enough of the toppings that no syrup was necessary-fine with me as the latter is much to sweet for me.  The servers as a whole were just nice-ready to serve a relaxed dinner-no hurrying you to finish.

No, it wasn't a gourmet experience.  I do realize that going to this restaurant took me back to a more carefree time in my life when we'd go out to eat before an evening at a play, maybe dancing, or whatever.  Just hanging out with friends, getting to be a little foolish, and generally having a server that could deal with it.  Maybe I need more of that in my life these days.  I will go back."}
{"text":"I picked up a coconut cream pie for my Moms birthday the other day. It was bland, and really lacked flavor or any good qualities. It was definitely NOT worth the $12 price with tax! I don't think we will be back for a pie any time soon."}
{"text":"Our family has gone here a quite a few times for breakfast and their Friday fish fry. 

Breakfast items can be hit or miss here but their lunch items are always yummy. For some reason, the lunch items are just much more filling and the breakfast items always leave me feeling a slight bit ripped off (due to price versus quality and amount). Weekend mornings can get crazy here so I try and shoot for a breakfast around 9 Am to avoid the huge crowd.

Friday fish fry is BOMB! The fish is fresh (not frozen) and never greasy and the breading is not over done, just the right amount of breading and always crispy crunchy. Weirdly, their Friday fish fry never really gets crowded.

The service is decent depending on which server you have. Most of their servers are really on the ball and very attentive but just like any other restaurant, there are a few servers that don't give a whole lotta effort. In my dozen or so trips to eat here, I've only had a bad server twice.  

The managers aren't very polished but they are very sincere and do their best to make the rounds and make sure diners are happy. A for effort! :)

Now if I could just walk out without looking at those darn pies.....!"}
{"text":"The meal I had is still rebelling against my stomach. Everything has an off taste and I would never go here again. Onion rings were perhaps cooked in last week's oil? Pot roast gravy tasted like paste. Summer camp food. Maybe people like that taste? Not me!"}
{"text":"Omelette was tasteless, biscuit crumbled on touch, waffle was cold, toast came without butter. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"There are times when we are just sitting around the house and I get this intense craving for a good piece of pie. It doesn't take much convincing to my son and we are on our way the Village Inn. I prefer the lemon meringue and the key lime but I havene't tried one that I didn't like. They'll even give you a free piece of pie if you order any menu item on Wednesdays. So go sit down with a good friend and have some pie before you die."}
{"text":"Went here for food on a Tuesday everything was undercooked hash brown pancakes french Toast it was not good"}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us."}
{"text":"Customer service is overwhelmingly subpar. The lack of teamwork between servers leaves customers sitting for 10 or more minutes waiting to even be acknowledged. The up side is I got to watch the majority of the first quarter of football including four rounds of commercials before Nick came to the table and said \"Aw you guys were sitting here and nobody told me\". So we put our drink order in and he disappears for about five more minutes and returns to the floor with the tray of drinks and stops at a table of patrons who were clearly his friends to chat it up. When he finally got to our table, I held my hand up and told him he could keep them because we were leaving to which he replied \"Aw, why?\". Clearly the lack of customer service is not something understood.

The previous time we stopped at this location for breakfast, the server was decent but the food was half cooked and still cold. 

Dennys is right down the road. Try there first."}
{"text":"We went to this Village Inn, for the first time, after the Packers/Cardinals game and although we were sat right away, the place was clean, food was good, I really want to talk about the server...
She was completely AMAZING.  Even though she was busy, she explained everything, gave her opinion on items and was right on making sure we had everything we needed.  I've been a server for over 20 years and she is one of the best I've ever seen.  If we ever go through Peoria again, we will be asking for SAMANTHA!  If YOU stop in, ask for Samantha."}
{"text":"FREE Pie on Wednesday!

This is located in an area populated with seniors & snowbirds. I meet up with family here. Enjoy the consistent friendly service and good food. Dinner specials for early birds. Good variety on the menu. Serves breakfast all day. Nice coffee shop/restaurant. Save room for pie!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for 6 years now.
They never disappoint. 

Food is quality, servers work hard to make sure your needs are met, and the overall restaurant is kept nice.

I've never had such amazing service over and over throughout the years.

I mean it when I say Village Inn is the. best.!!!!


(p.s. their hamburgers, chicken and salads are the best ever made!)"}
{"text":"Village Inn does a nice job with breakfast in the mornings, as well as lunch.

Our little group comes here once a month.  We've always enjoyed our food and the service is very good and friendly.  

Today was a good example.  One of us had the egg white omelet, fruit and whole wheat pancakes (see photo).  Another had the \"Pick 2 for $2.00 value meal\" (photo). while someone else had the Country sausage & eggs (photo) on a whole wheat english muffin with grapefruit juice.  Admittedly, the coffee is somewhat basic, but good.

As you can see from the photos, Village Inn does a nice business with the Pies and cakes.

The tab ran us about $8.50 each, before taxes and tip.  I would recommend looking for coupons in the Sunday Arizona Republic.  It works for us.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the VI on McKellips/Recker and it is always very good.  Today we went to this location at Power/Main.  The iced tea was horrible as if the dispenser  has never been cleaned. My eggs Benedict eggs were overlooked to hard boil.  A waitress was using a non-electrical vacuum to clean up the carpet floor next to us for a long period of time and it was very loud and annoying.  Won't go back..."}
{"text":"Service = terrible (our server walked up and said \"what do you want\")
food = mediocre (I ordered Belgian waffle meal with strawberries on top and they forgot the strawberries)

Overall the food was OK and value was moderate.  For some reason I didn't get ice in my drink which was annoying but not a big deal.

What was a big deal was the HAIR in my fiancés food.  When we complained it didn't even seem to phase the waitress.  No one apologized and the manager didn't even hear about the incident.  They didn't even offer more food but took the cost off the bill for her meal.  I've had this happen before and the manager came over, sincerely apologized and asked what they can do to make it better.  I'm really disappointed here.  Plenty of breakfast spots out there... Wouldn't make this my #1 spot again."}
{"text":"My second Visit, mid October, for breakfast,whatever for brunch. A Hugh Saturday crowd at 11:00am, still seated immediately, served drinks in less that five minutes,My daughter and grand kids, had varied breakfast,I had Turkey dinner special.. Everything was spectacular,well-seasoned and flavor packed I had a fresh,crisp salad,refreshing. Had a 20% off coupon doe entire meal, which actually paid for the tip!$40.00 for four, now thats a bargain, and I even got a slice of Pumpkin pie for FREE!."}
{"text":"My family has a tradition of eating Sunday breakfast together on Sunday morning. For the last few years we have come to this restaurant. Since we are regulars, they always have our table ready. Our regular server is attentive and knows our usual orders. The rest of the staff is friendly. 
We all look forward to Sunday at VI."}
{"text":"Stopped in Thursday morning. Like always the entryway between the two sets of doors had a sewer smell it's kind of normal here. But during my breakfast I could still smell it faintly. Except right next to the restrooms it got worse. To the manager or corporate......... plumbers can fix that it's what they do. 

I would have rated them higher if my corned beef hash was better. It was obviously from a can. Usually restaurants that make their own the various ingredients are diced and this was the consistency of canned as everything looked like it went through a food mill. The eggs toast and coffee was good.  The waitress was friendly as was Kylie the hostess. 

I think I am finally over eating amongst sewer smells. No more."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lite lunch after the Saturday Farmers Market at Park West.   Food is reasonably priced and flavorful.  What makes it a 4 star is the friendly staff and quick service.  And you can't beat a slice of pie for $1.50 add on!"}
{"text":"Went with family of five at 9pm. All food was cooked promptly and very well.  Wait service was also perfect.  Best meal of my trip."}
{"text":"Three stars for good service and massive portions of food. Deducted for the food quality.

I got a 1/2 pound chicken-fried steak with a salad, corn, mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. The steak was so salty I couldn't eat it! The rest of the meal was typical diner type stuff, maybe a step above Dennys. 

I did have a piece of pie and it was good but nothing really special. 

I will try them again for breakfast and maybe more stars.

UPDATE: added a star for breakfast. I got sausage, bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs, wheat toast. The eggs were perfectly cooked - harder than you think. The wheat toast was down-right yummy. This is the reason you go here!"}
{"text":"The potato breakfast crepe was....spongey.  I don't know if it is suppose to be or not but it wasn't very good.  The hashbrowns were slightly cooked on top, but the middle was raw.  The other plate we had was awesome! The straw banana french toast!!  Super good!!  Coffee was weak. Service was good, The reason for 3 stars and not 2.  She said she would get us a to go box for our uneaten plate when I told her I didn't like it (we ate one bite)she came back with a different bill that had the item removed.  That was very nice of her."}
{"text":"The last few times we ate here the service and food wasn't the best. Our orders seem to always get messed up. We decided to give it another chance tonight and I wish we didn't. Our waitress (Terrie) was horrible. We ordered soup and it took forever to come out. When we asked how much longer, her exact words were \"Every time I ask if it's ready she says that if it was ready it would be up.\" You'd think that soup would be the simplest thing on the menu but apparently not. We asked for a manager and he never stopped by our table. This was the last time we'll ever eat here."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and had received coupons in the mail for 20% off the entire check so I decided to check it out for lunch.  I was there on a Friday after noon, around 2pm.

The restaurant had a slight dish-water smell, but I would go back again. It was not crowded and most of the other people seated were 2-4 at a table.  Since it was my first time there, I don't know if that smell was a fluke thing or not.

The waitress was friendly enough and checked on me often enough without being bothersome.  She offered me soup, my choice that day was chicken noodle or clam chowder.  

I ordered the Grown Up Grilled cheese and fries, a chocolate shake and Lemon Pie. Can't say the grilled cheese is so great, as it had more tomatoes than cheese but it was good bread, not greasy.

I can say the the milk shakes are amazingly delicious and the pie was incredible.  They use real whipping cream and serve the shakes in a glass with the metal mixing cup so you get all of it.  Very creamy and very filling. 

The Lemon pie was really delicious and after getting thru most of my shake, I needed something to get me away from the sweet taste in my mouth.  Was pleasantly suprised how yummy the lemon was.  

Will definitely be going back, if nothing else for desserts or shakes.  Will order something else to eat or request additional cheese on my sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat"}
{"text":"We've only been here a couple of times. Both times for brkfst. Good service but both times, the food has not been hot. I hate it when the food isn't hot enough to melt the butter."}
{"text":"This is a great place too dine when you just want to eat and not spend a lot of money.  The service is terrific and the staff is very friendly.  I ordered a Ruben sandwich with fries.  The waitress said that you do not get enough fries with the Ruben sandwich so she brought out a whole large side order of fries at no charge.  That was awesome.  There selection of desert pies is also out of this world.  To top it off, they gave me a 10% senior discount.  With tip, my wife and I spent under $33.00."}
{"text":"Went here just to get a slice of peppermint pie since a friend posted a picture of it on facebook.

The service was super friendly and fast.  The pie was just okay though, I was really disappointed as I was looking forward to it.  Two slices of pie were small (though very rich) and the price was crazy expensive for to-go.  I believe $4.50 per small slice?

I can't imagine I would ever go back..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were sat right away.  Our server was very attentive which is a kind of novelty at this type of restaurant.  Our food came out rather quickly and my coffee never ran dry.  What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"We went to this location on Sunday around 6:30 at night. Restaurant was almost empty. I would say it took a while to get greeted since they were not busy at all. After our server took our drink order, it took even more time but we understood  7 people's drinks might take awhile even though we saw her talking and laughing inside of their kitchen. After we got our food, she never checked up on us for drink refills or if everything is still fine. She took her sweet time to give us bill and at that point, I was very disappointed about her service. I ended up going to ask a register lady for our bill. Her name is Ashley. I was willing to tip her good but she was not a great server. Again, restaurant was almost empty and the service we had wasn't right."}
{"text":"Hubby:  Close to house and I love pie so we frequent this location quite often.  Generally quick service and food quality is consistent.  Good place to sober up and drink coffee.

Wife:  ahh, I know why the hubby likes to go here!!! The flirty waitress sure spends a whole lot of time assuring that he receives lots of attention!  Other than that, we do enjoy coming here at all hours of the day!   Service here is great here for the most of part except when the waitress is hitting on my husband.  We love coming here for their late night breakfasts and pies!  We generally order their pecan and their peanut butter pies!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is. If you want something to fill your empty stomach Village Inn will do. Sometimes it takes forever for the food to come, sometimes the order is wrong, and sometimes the food isn't good. But it's not terribly expensive and it gets the job done. Come in with low expectations and you'll be happy. I will say that I do like the fish they have on Fridays. So if you want to try this place out, I'd do it on Friday's."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent place to get a meal without spending too much? Drive on by...

We stopped by this Village Inn thinking we might get a decently priced meal at a sit down restaurant. Though the restaurant was mostly empty (should have been our first clue), it took a few minutes for someone to notice that we were waiting to be seated. 

Once seated, we were brought menus and started looking for choices. I landed on the \"West Coast Scramble\", which was ostensibly made with cheesy hash browns, chicken, spinach and egg, topped with Hollandaise and avocado. The avocado particularly drew my attention, and when the server took our order I asked for that and a cup of red chili. The server asked if I wanted the chili brought it with the rest of the meal, and I said \"yes\".

My girlfriend wanted to order the meatloaf sandwich but was told they had run out of meatloaf.She ordered a beef dip sandwich instead.

Drinks were brought out and we waited for the meal to be brought out, which honestly didn't take too long. Mine was set in front of me, and the server asked if there was anything else he could get us. I noticed that the chili had not been brought out and asked for it. He stepped away to get the chili, and I looked at my plate. 

No avocado.

When he returned, I pointed out the missing avocado and he said he'd get it for me. By the time he returned, my girlfriend had already gotten nearly halfway through her meal. My drink was empty. And he informed me that there was no avocado.

I expressed my dissatisfaction as this was the deciding factor for my meal choice. He offered to make something else, which I declined because I didn't want my girlfriend to have to wait while they made something else.

He walked away and a few minutes later the assistant manager came to the table. She asked \"he didn't tell you we were out of avocado?\". Then offered a free slice of pie as compensation.

I took the pie, but her question annoyed me. Rather than just apologize and try to make things right, the first thing she did was throw her server under the bus. Granted, his service was not great. With only one other table seated in his station, and given the problems with the order, keeping my glass full should have been a no brainer. Yet I had to ask more than once for a refill.

But as a manager, you should know mistakes happen, and putting the blame onto the server for something he likely wasn't informed of by the kitchen is just bad form. 

My entree was lackluster at best. The \"Hollandaise\" was a yellowish sauce that tasted canned. The diced chicken was dry and the \"cheesy hash browns\" were on the form of a patty that was either sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time, or was previously frozen.

In the end, we paid nearly $30 for an unsatisfactory meal, below average service, and half-hearted attempts at resolving the dissatisfaction. For that amount of money, we had plenty of choices. We won't make this one again."}
{"text":"The waitress was good,  food decent...  the place was a mess, the bottles and coffee carafe alternately grimy slimy disgusting... wouldn't come back but didn't hate the place...."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out so naturally I have tried what I think are most all the \"breakfast\" joints in town but for some reason or the other, I'd never stopped by the Village Inn.  Boy, I am sure glad that I did!

Great menu, great service (Thanks Gina) and good rib sticking food.  Move over Good Egg, you have some competition."}
{"text":"Service is always good.  I have two elderly parents with disabilities and they love coming here for the good food and pie. As well as the staff are always nice and patient with them. The three of us have been coming for years. My favorite is the chicken fried steak breakfast. Big portions and tasty. Don't forget the pie on the way out..."}
{"text":"Service. Awful and slow.

Food. Mediocre.

Pies. Good. Get them to go."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast / lunch crowd. Told 15-20 minute wait and was seated within time told. Nothing spectacular with the menu.. Typical stuff- kinda small portion size, but not horribly expensive. Not really tons of flavor, but it was alright. My husband and I may go back one day.. But for now I'd rather have some hearty diner type food."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place one star is because I have no choice, there is no option to give 0 stars. My guy and I wanted a turkey dinner and the village inn is the only place that had one on the menu close by. We decided to go in and sit and eat. They never gave us menus, I had to grab them myself. The waitress didn't come to our table for almost 20 minutes (mind you, there was only one other table seated when we got there). We finally ordered our food which comes out in a fairly reasonable amount of time. As soon as I relax a little and begin to enjoy my meal one of the workers starts vacuuming, like 5 feet away from our table! You can see the dust start swirling around, which is being gross so I ask for boxes to go. The manager comes over and asks if everything is okay. I said no, that I think it's rude and disgusting to vacuum while people are eating. She apologized... We went up to the front to pay and the manager says, \"She knows better, I will have a talk with her about that. I'll give you 20% off of your bill.\" While she is patronizing me the girl starts vacuuming again! Now there are four tables seated. I give the woman a tight-lipped smile and leave. I will never eat there again. It's not like I expected four star service, but that's awful and then to patronize me while I'm paying. The discount was nice, but the woman was insulting my intelligence at the same time. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Great service good food for value! They were busy but turned over tables pretty quickly. The biggest challenge is the pay at cash register on the way out. We were 10 deep. That's a process that could be improved to a seamless approach."}
{"text":"Our regular place was closed, service was indifferent, I wasn't sure my food was correct and was assured that it was. Not asked if I was enjoying it. Left our bill with a $100 on the table the last 10 minutes of our meal. She never offered to settle check or inform us that they do not take $100 bills, waited for us to get up to register and said \"oh I need a manager\" (No big deal) enter the manager he began explaining about the reasons they don't take $100 bills all the while checking the bill through the machine but not quite taking it. So my wife offered up a card hoping to move things along...he gladly took it and processed the payment. Still talking about the rash of bad bills. Not once asking about our meal, service or satisfaction. I've been here before with much better service results. I will be back."}
{"text":"This location was very clean and everyone working there was really nice.
Our dinner arrived extremely fast and was delicious! The only thing we didn't get offered was to go boxes but other than that i enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"Yolanda is a very friendly waitress. The food is tasty and inexpensive. If you're in the Glendale area phoenix I highly recommend the Village Inn."}
{"text":"ROACHES!!! This place is FULL of roaches. Bugs were crawling on several walls and when it was  mentioned to the manager she became upset and told us she had already comped four meals and what is she supposed to do just close down cause of the bugs? She offered to give a free pie, auuuuh ...... Noo thanks! Then things just got worse when the manager double charged me!!! Ordered the Grown up Grilled Cheese which had two slices of processed sliced cheese and a strawberry shake where the milk tasted sour. We even heard the kitchen staff ask why the lemons were in with the hard boiled eggs."}
{"text":"It's late morning on a Saturday. My boyfriend and I are sat in a small booth next to us there's a screaming baby (just under 1yr), parents are doing their best to keep him calm but he's just not having the wait for his breakfast. The waitress came by and hands the parents a small bowl of fruit, on the house, for the baby he instantly calms down. That's the kind of service I've always seen & received here. The food is good, has a homemade kind of feel. And the pie you have to try at least once in a while."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast and the service was ok. I wasn't impressed with my dish as it had way too much onion for a skillet dish. I would give more stars for service except it was slow when we came in and the service was not the best for it being so slow."}
{"text":"A really OK place for a quick meal and the prices are very affordable.   My own choice was the meatloaf dinner.  This included a small soup,  mashed potatoes, a side, and a nice cut of meatloaf which was individually baked.   Our party of four total cost was forty bucks.

The premises were neat and clean,  the waitstaff was a hoot and cheerful. I understand Village Inns are individually owned and operated so it depends on how well they are run.

This particular restaurant is a keeper."}
{"text":"I would like everyone to be aware of the ATROCIOUS service here. The assistant manager \"Michail\" (or Michael) was the perfect example of Terrible Customer Service. Ive been coming to this place for years, and i can honestly say this will be my last visit.

As far as upper management, I strongly recommend that you consider letting this person go. Im disgusted by the way i was treated and something needs to be done."}
{"text":"My sister and I dined here for dinner this evening. We both had the all you can eat fish which was tasty. Wendy was our waitress and she was AWESOME! Great server with a wonderful personality. Caesar the manager is pretty awesome too. He wasn't there tonight but he's been on duty before when I dined there. Village Inn serves great food at great prices. Check them out!"}
{"text":"First off - the Waitress was great...!

Waited in line for breakfast along with about 8 other groups, while half the restaurant was empty...   Should have taken the hint.

There were five of us and all ordered a complete breakfast....   All of us had bacon in it, and all of us took one bite and never at another morsel (it tasted like it had gone rancid or was cooked in fish oil)   None of the meal was cooked correctly.. either burndt undercook, but at least it was consistent..   in that nothing was consistent.    The food was so bad tasting today that not one of us ate our meals, we paid and vowed NEVER to go back to this Village Inn.     

At the present time we all have stomach aches!"}
{"text":"Went to eat dinner sat at table for 20 mins no Waiter or waitress came by to take our order or even give us a glass of water but everybody else around us was getting served I'm wondering if it was because we were Hispanic and everybody else around us was White  anyways will never go there again"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant again. Under new management and it is easy to tell. Place was busy, wait staff were friendly and prompt, and there is apparently a new menu although we haven't been there in quite a while. Placed our order and just when we were thinking it had been a while, the manager came to our table and explained the delay which was they had run out of soup. We were OK to wait until they made more. Food when delivered was very good (we really like their vegetable beef soup). The manager came again and told us we would not be charged for our dinner as he felt the wait had been too long. We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"What a turnaround. From 2 stars to 4 stars. Tonight, big difference. Michael was our waitperson and made our dining experience wonderful. Food, excellent. Pie, FREE. I take back all those bad words based on my 2015 visit. So, four stars it is and we will return certainly before two more years. Just sayin'.



Dreadful experience. 
Waitstaff (Kat) did not know what she was doing.   Midway through the meal she disappeared.  Service was sloooow even though we said we had a timeline to be outta there by 7.  

Cook gave me a raw steak when I ordered medium.  Management (Brittany) comped my dinner but the damage was done. 

The soup was excellent though.   Not going back anytime soon for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on June 22, 2014 around dinner time, we been there about twice now at that location.  The first time we were there we enjoyed it and thought the food was great, but this time around was just a bad experience with a horrible waitress.  My boyfriend order a coke and I had an ice tea with a lemon in it, and the slice wedge lemon was old and smelled like it was sitting in a fridge for awhile uncovered and the coke was warm and flat and the ice was melting away already, but she did take the coke back and brought out a new one.  Than I ordered the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and it is suppose to come with a biscuit too, but instead I received Texas toast, which disappointed but ok with, however the waitress never even said anything why I received Texas Toast rather than a biscuit.  And my broccoli was cold and by the looks of it old too, did not taste very well either.  With my meal it was either a soup or salad and was not offered either and didn't even have the chance to tell her which one I wanted too.  So did not get my soup or salad. My boyfriend just had a turkey sandwich with a Cesar salad and the sandwich, which he said was ok. The waitress dropped our food off with the ticket and we thought that was rude and didn't say a word after. She never came back to refill his coke or my ice tea or even to check on us if the food was ok or if we needed anything and after we finished our meal we sat there for seven minutes until she finally came by and asked if we were going to order pies... umm yeah we wanted two slice of pies and with a new ticket she came back and seeing our cups were empty we hoped she would come back to refill our drinks but no. We ate our pies with no drink. We both sat there thirsty waiting for her to come by at least so we can tell her we would like a refill or water but she never did. My boyfriend did not finish his pie because he needed something to drink because the peanut butter pie was overly sweet and sticky in the mouth.  Hard to finish without liquid.  We were  disappointed, plus the other waitress for the table behind us was amazing she was great too bad she was not our waitress.  top it all off they were not busy and we kept seeing our waitress doing nothing and walking back and forth in the back doing nothing too and tended to another table more than us. And the other table was just one guy that was a regular there. We waited to see if she would at least stop by our table to check up on us but never did once so we just got up and paid for our meal and left!! Just horrible service and not so great food at this Village Inn.  It is not a very hard job to be a waitress and serve your customers and make sure they are satisfy and have what they need and drinks filled, but apparently its hard for her.  I was a waitress before and I can say its not hard to do that job!! So Stacy learn to do your job a bit better and maybe some more training at that too!!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Village Inn before. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. After visiting, I guess it's about what I would expect: a casual, family restaurant with a varied menu of typical diner/comfort food offerings.

It's your burgers, chicken strips, and breakfast sort of place. It's not gourmet, but it's not bad either. I had a chicken sandwich, and it was mostly tasty. And, once I sent the fries back for some fresh ones, those were really good as well. Oh, and the onion rings were flat-out delicious.

This wasn't the cleanest restaurant, but it wasn't hideously dirty either. The staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, this would be a decent stop if you're in a completely new area and don't know what's safe to eat in the area. That was our reason for stopping by, at least. I wasn't disappointed; still, I don't see myself returning anytime soon either."}
{"text":"Much improved.  Food was terrific, esp the skillet breakfasts.  Service is great.  A favorite for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to a Village Inn and it will not be our last.  The dinning area was clean and welcoming.  The service was excellent.  The food was very good, more than ample and delivered in under 10 minutes.  This restaurant jumped to the top of our Family Restaurant choices."}
{"text":"this place pretty much sucks the service was good the place is sterile but the corned beef hash had a very strange flavor and the side of hollandaise  sauce was watery and weird tasting."}
{"text":"This has nothing to do with the food, which is just ok, but with the \"hospitality.\"
I belong to a water group that goes out every month.  We have been to Village Inn before and had reservations.  We are usually about 20 people.  This month we decided to go to Village Inn again in August.  I spoke to a hostess on the phone less than a week ago.  She assured me that I could make reservations for the group and that they would seat us together, but the table would be in an \"L\" shape.  I said we had to problem with that.  I told her that I would need to call back after the group made the final decision.  
I called yesterday to make the reservations.  It was a different person on the phone.  I told her that I was calling to make reservations.  She asked for the date.  I gave it to her.  Then she asked for how many.  I told her 20.  She asked for the time.  I told her.  At this point, she said that they don't take reservations.  So why did she ask me all of these questions???  I told her that I had spoken to someone just a few days prior that told me reservations were accepted and how the table would be configured.  She said, \"well, the person was wrong.\"  We went round and round.  I asked to speak to a manager.   She informed me that she was the assistant manager.  I asked her if she would really lose 20 people and she repeated that they do not take reservations.  It isn't as though it would be at a super busy time of day.  It is 11 AM.  We are talking a minimum of $200 in sales.  
Oh well.  Their loss.  I know that I will never step foot in there again.  I also know that several of the people in the group are not happy.  I was asked today how come they made reservations for us before.  I have no answer except that the assistant manager didn't want the people and the money."}
{"text":"They have turkey sausage. 
I love turkey sausage. 
I come here when I'm craving non-pork/beef breakfast meats. 

I also come for the crepes. 

And the pancakes. 

And the omelets. 

And the coffee. 

Mmmm Coffee. 

Service is decent too."}
{"text":"We have always love Village Inn..but the last year we had had several customer services where we felt they were lacking extensively..  we haven't gone back for almost 6 moths...and decided to go there this morning to give it one last try. To our surprise... it was a complete turn around in customer service... warm greeting.. Happy faces and the manager John was amazing and restored our faith in VI... we will be back and will again sing their praises as we had done in the past. Great food..great menu and great service!!!!"}
{"text":"I still love their pie and food is pretty good. Service at this location is horrible though. Won't stop me from coming on free pie Wednesdays ... But def makes me think twice and cancel on it sometimes. And why does it seem like there is there like 10 managers and only 3 servers here?"}
{"text":"A nice place but a little outdated... Our service was good but they had trouble with the waffle machine... But it was remedied by the manager with pies to go. Food was good and service was great."}
{"text":"Military friendly with discounts, reasonably quick service of good food. If your looking for reasonably priced food or just breakfast late in the day it's a good choice. Pie is plentiful in the choice department as well."}
{"text":"I ate brunch here again today with a very good friend of mine. Kam was our server. He Excellent, friendly, professional & proficient!! I had eggs, corned beef hash & hash browns. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite Village Inn for years and it was a **** star in the past.  But in the last year, since the  Queen Creek location opened up, the cost has gone up and quality and quantity of food has plummeted. The loss of some great managers and servers sealed the deal. 

 We waited 35 minutes for our food...it was blah, uninspired, slop...and no one was in the restaurant.  

 I can go to RED ROBIN, order a Tavern Double with all the fries or salad I want for 6.99...

VI charges $8 for a burned half of grilled cheese and 2 tablespoons of chili.  $11 for a double patty with a tiny salad.

But the descent has been obvious for a year.  The new manager was pacing and looking at his watch instead of tracking our food and service...once I complained, he comped our bill.  But that doesn't matter, now.  The writing is on the wall and I am never returning."}
{"text":"Best pies in town. Caramel pecan silk supreme pie is heaven. The food is good as well."}
{"text":"I tried to like this place I did.. The food is good don't get me wrong but the service needs a lot of help! 
First time we went it took us 20monutes to get our check and the ladies that work the night shift short bob and white younger girls were just talking. 
Second time we went they kept talking and talking loud! There was an elderly couple next to us and we could hear everything they were talking about, how it's been awhile since they had sex and they can't remember eww gross they were pretty loud!! And it's always the ladies that work at night!!  
It's like stop talking and get to work!!"}
{"text":"Man, Village Inn... is the best.  Came here twice in the last two years (not from the area) and definitely made a point to come in on Wednesday for free pie, y'all!!  Seriously who can beat that.  

Had the strawberry banana french toast once and then a dinner entree another and they were all sooo gooood omg."}
{"text":"I met friends here for a weekday breakfast and had a nice meal. We had several kids, so the large circle booths are a great way to herd them. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the food was good. I had the Pick 4 combo - biscuit & gravy, bacon, hasbrowns, and strawberry crepe. The biscuit and bacon were pretty good, and the strawberry crepe was surprisingly good. Unfortunately, the hashbrowns were a little bland and did not stick together.

Add lots of coffee and good friends, and it was a good experience. This restaurant seems pretty new with bright colors and some fun signs on the wall. Overall, it was a nice experience, but I should have grabbed one of those pies. They in the case on your way out and are very tempting."}
{"text":"First experience at this location. I was not greeted the moment I walked into the door which I believe is because they were super busy. I did have to wait a while until someone put my name down on a reservation. Once I had my name down I only had to wait three minutes. I had to wait five minutes before someone came to take my drink order. I was fine with that because this gave me a chance to review the menu. Many options to choose from.

Reviewing the other tables everything looked hot and fresh. That is how my food came out."}
{"text":"I've had both breakfast and lunch here & it's pretty good.  Tasty food, reasonable prices (be sure to ask for 10% senior discount if that applies to you), and friendly servers who refill water as needed without asking and are good about getting special requests (non-cholesterol egg substitute, dry toast) correct.  The only thing that I don't like is that portion sizes seem to vary considerably from one visit to the next.  I usually order the same things, and my breakfast omelet and hash browns often fill a large platter, but on the next visit they barely take up 1/2 of a small platter.  Fries can be overflowing the lunch plate or look like just a handful & sandwiches are sometimes stuffed with meat and cheese and other times pretty skimpy-looking.  Overall, I like it, it's close by, parking is easy, and they seat people quickly, even when there is a crowd."}
{"text":"I only come here for breakfast, coming for dinner freaks me out a bit. Even if I come during dinner hours, its for breakfast. Haha. K so here is whats good: pancakes (or wonderful little pancakes as the hubby calls them), eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, french toast, hash browns and believe it or not, their strawberry crepes. I loves these crepes! I am soooo happy they have a meal (incredible VIB) now where you can pick pretty much anything you want for breakfast and can mix and match. The only thing that sucks about this that you cant order double of an item unless you add on a 5th item. Kinda dumb but I have been told that this is the way their system works. So our friend met us there one time and wanted to get 3 servings of french toast and then a serving of bacon. The waiter told him he would need to add 3 more differing items to his order in order to triple the french toast like he wanted. WTF? Anyways, this is a simple place to go for your basic breakfast at a cheap price. They also have great apple pie. Make sure to come for free pie Wednesdays!!!"}
{"text":"conveniently located, easy access to the facility. clean rooms, great service  what else can i ask for."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Village Inn in quiet sometime. I walked in and was surprised by the new retro theme decor. Love it! Seated immediately, Gina was my server, lovely woman. Fast service, good food. You can't beat the $7.99 special."}
{"text":"Went for the country sausage potato pancakes. Seemed to have forgotten to put eggs on it. Something just didn't taste right.  My other ordered VIB.  Took awhile.  They only had one cook in the kitchen.  VIB was done and then the pancakes came out. At least they where hot. :)."}
{"text":"Mostly due to the service.  Here goes.  Late night (july 3rd) we are returning from a day at canyon lake and not much is open this time of night.  We stop in - only 6 other people in the restaurant, but it takes 5 minutes to be seated.  Server takes our drink orders, and I ask \"Do you have a seniors menu?\" Don't know if I qualify but just in case I do - I wanted to order something with a smaller portion.  Servers response is \"Yes\", and starts taking orders from others at the table.  Ok - I should have said \"If you have a seniors menu, could you please get one for me\" to be more clear.  My bad.  So as she comes to me I said \"You said you have a Seniors Menu.  Can I see it\" to which she replied \"Do you want me to get it for you\" and I, of course, said \"Yes\".  She said \"I can do that but I think it ended at 6pm\" or something like that.  OMG ... It's like pulling teeth here!  I finally order Huevos Rancheros.  It comes on a flour tortilla folded up underneath the eggs.   VERY THICK tortilla.  Where's the traditional corn tortilla?  Impossible to get the server to come out to the table for a water refill or to ask for sugar free syrup.  I guess she was too busy now that there were 3 tables with a total of 10 people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a typical dinner place. Breakfast foods are good and priced right. The pies are good and Wednesdays are free slice of pie day."}
{"text":"I got the chicken fried steak and my friend got the biscuits and gravy. Both were decent. I ordered ice tea. The waitress said they were out. Really? Not a tea bag in the entire place?? Mmmm, strange. I would say they didn't feel like messing with it. Oh well. Just saved me $2.50 but I really wanted my tea."}
{"text":"I remember going here but in El Paso after coming out the club. This place here in Phoenix is close by me and the people that work there are very nice. I got the inncredible v.i.b. mean you can choose 4 different items. I forgot which 4 but I will tell you later tonight..I'm heading over there in 2 hours :)"}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes for a sub par cold breakfast. The waitress NEVER checked back in with us.  No-one ever asked about our meal, never saw the waitress again.  My eggs weren't cooked thru and I didn't eat them.  W
e're not eating here ever again. Back to our favorite TJ's."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite dining spots, breakfast in particular. The coffee and pancakes are on point. Love free pie Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place to go! Very friendly and polite. We have been here multiple times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and keep coming back! This review was for a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"My wife and I have become fans of enjoying an informal breakfast at Village Inn over the past couple of years in a clean and comfortable environment.  We're impressed with the variety and quality of the food, not to mention that the prices are easy on the budget.  

We especially enjoy this location here in East Mesa as the staff (Jennifer is the head Manager, Tara our hostess and Deb, our server) is great and we've become friends with them.  We drop in for an early breakfast in order to beat the crowd and enjoy fast, friendly service several times each month.  Enjoying an early breakfast has allowed us to make friends with the some of the staff.  

Tara always makes us feel welcome each and every time.  We're amazed with Deb's memory for details!  She never fails to bring us items that she knows we prefer.  We've observed her doing this for her regular customers as well which we find impressive!  Additionally, we appreciate how Jennifer (Jen) takes the time to briefly drop by our table to ensure we're satisfied with our visit as well as catching up with us.  She's hired a good group of people to make her location one of our favorite places to have breakfast.

Finally, we enjoy how the food (Chicken Fried Steak breakfast or the VIB are among our favorite choices) is consistently good tasting each time we visit.  Jen, great job hiring good line cooks!  

So, if you don't mind stopping in for an early breakfast, you may be pleasantly surprised by the friendly, efficient service along with a menu featuring a good variety of quality meals at prices that are  easy on your budget.

Hook 'Em!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing Manager! When he is there the faculty is clean and the staff is working quickly, very attentive to customers and always making sure the customer is happy. The facility is clean and the food is always fresh. I love this location. Thank you all for all your hard work."}
{"text":"We stopped into VI the night before Thanksgiving for a quick bite. I'll forgive the minor service issues because they seemed a bit overrun with people picking up pies for the holiday. Our waitress was great, on point with refills and such and very friendly. The food was good. The pie was good. The price was good. I'll give them another try sometime to see if the lobby problems were Thanksgiving pie created or not..."}
{"text":"Went for family breakfast.  Our server was the service captain, I think her name started with a K, it was 2 weeks ago.  Everything for the most part was just okay, nothing great.  She was kinda of slow with everything and thought she could remember everything, but couldn't even remember to bring lemons for water.  She wasn't the nicest either, kinda of that fake nice thing that a lot of servers tend to do, but would have been portrayed better if she hadn't been rolling her eyes.
Not crispy bacon means the bacon will bend!  I always ask for bacon that is not crispy.
There was a hair in my brother-in-law's pancake.  They didn't seem mortified or like it was something that doesn't normally happen.  For that reason alone, I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust..."}
{"text":"Another great dinner! Go see jenny she is the best waitress! Always makes out time tgere so pleasent!"}
{"text":"I hadn't seen a Village Inn since they left San Antonio many years ago. Hubby and I always loved their breakfast and desserts. We really enjoy their vegetable omelettes that includes multi grain pancakes among other sides. Huge and delicious serving made with quality ingredients. It was the perfect start to what we knew would be a long day at the office, often times missing lunch. Every holiday or sweet tooth for that matter we would get their famous pies, bought in all the way from Bakers square in Chicago. You have to taste them to believe it. Never too sweet, just high in quality, flavor and and love. Yes, you can taste that!

Having left another establishment for lunch we noticed village inn and decided to stop in for dessert. We called ahead, to our surprise Jacki answered the phone and told us about free pie Wednesday. Is this my lucky day or what!?! SallyAnn was our server and was very pleasant. She came over promptly to take our orders and they arrived just as fast. YUMMY!!! As good as we both remembered and now we had our two little ones in tow to enjoy the goodness too. We all left happy with full tummies. We got the apple pie with a side of ice cream. Hey folks even though it's free pie day, don't forget to take care of your server. They have to live on what you leave. So no change like the table across from us left after having eaten an entire meal with dessert. Come on folks. If money is tight, share dessert and tip your server!  We will be back. Staff was great and the restaurant looks clean and wasn't too busy.

To the manager, Jacki upsells and cross sells like crazy. Having been a business owner myself, I know what a valuable asset an employee like this is. So take care of her before someone else poaches her from under you. Good luck with the baby boy Jacki and thanks for your service SallyAnn :)"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible and we arrived late evening for dinner so there was hardly any customers. It took forever to get our food and the cook was not that great. Even telling the manager that we were not satisfied with two orders was not addressed and ignored so it was a complete waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service. 

I called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said \"Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?\" No, you can't. 

Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot lately because the food is way better than the Dennys I normally go to. The service here is okay but the problem is that they seem to be understaffed every time I've cam. The food is delicious but it takes a long time and most of the time I don't order dessert because everything takes way too long. I also don't like that they give me the receipt right as I get my food then they walk away and don't get back to me for refills or dessert."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. This location looked dirty and the menus were sticky.  It took about 30 min the get our food then after the waitress ignored us, no refills, didn't ask if we wanted desse  nothing. When I went to complain to the cashier she seemed annoying and explained that they were busy. Wish I could have read the reviews before I came here ."}
{"text":"Actually never ate a meal here. Stopped by for a piece of pie. We were on our way home and wanted to try their pies out. Always heard about them so wanted to to it out. 
I had the caramel apple, wife had the peanut butter cup. I was actually very surprise how good they were. We also shared a scoop of ice cream. That was also very good. Now the price for these pies are over priced, basically $5.00 per slice. First time at Village Inn, reminds me of Denny's or Ihop. And this location is pretty small also. Not sure if we're ever going to have a meal there, but might be back for another slice of pie?"}
{"text":"I didn't even make it to the entrance before the Manager greeted me and held the door open. Within minutes, I had an iced tea in hand and was on my way to taste central!! The food is always tip top, but the service is what made my meal more pleasurable. My waitress, Sunny,  has forever spoiled me by checking on me, myself, and I at least 4 times!! She was true to her name with her personality and by displaying service that really makes this place shine!!"}
{"text":"When you have a meal at the Signal Butte Village Inn, and you come to expect nothing but the very best.  The main reason that my wife and I patronizes this restaurant is because superior service and outstanding food is the norm.  Village Inn should be very proud of the way this location represents their chain.  I guarantee you have never seen a more outstanding group of people staffing a location.  You can tell that each one cares greatly about the level of service that they provide you.  I don't know what better place to take my wife and enjoy a meal than this location."}
{"text":"OK place to refuel or pick up some pie. Same caliber food and service as Cocos or Dennys. Great location for the MCC crowd or if you have someone you are visiting over at Banner Desert Hospital. Parking is great, but the traffic at Southern and Dobson is dreadful during rush hour. 
If you are not expecting some swanky dining experience, this will probably fit the bill with standard American fare."}
{"text":"We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!"}
{"text":"Waited for 40 minutes, then was told the computer dropped our order and should be out soon. We left hungry because we had to get to an appointment. My husband called and spoke to the manager, Donna, who said they had been having that problem all morning. She said she saw us sitting for a long time with no food, but the server told her it was coming out soon.  If you know you are having a computer issue and you saw a table with no food for that long in a nearly empty restaurant, would you not check with the kitchen to make sure the ticket was in and ask why it's taking so long?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service thanks to the manager All our breakfast food was on point my kids loved their food my wife loved it everything was good to go and the pies were to die for"}
{"text":"This place was a joke! My boyfriend and I went on Wednesday night. We have never been there before and wanted to try it out.  The server didn't tell us her name. I got a caramel Iced coffee and by the time it got to our table it was melted! Food was horrible and didn't have any taste. My boyfriend got a grilled cheese with no tomato and it came out with tomato. Even the pies were bland. Not returning there again. I work at a breakfast restaurant and I've never had such bad service. She placed the check right after she dropped the food and didn't check back up on us. Once again, not returning ever again.."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast, potatoes were blah,  crepe served cold and sausage had to be sent back vert dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Like most of the others say- go for the pie! I also had the adult grilled cheese and a cup of tomato basil soup. All were very tasty and hot. I had excellent service and am quite pleased with my meal. Light and tasty,  exactly what I came for, along with the pie."}
{"text":"While the waitress was very nice,  I couldn't have been more disappointed in our experience.  We were seated and waited approximately 10 minutes before the waitress came to the table.  Our server was rushing around but the manager and other waitresses stood around completely oblivious to the fact we had not been even approached.  Other people were sat directly beside and around us.  They were promptly taken care of by another waitress.  After we got our food (at the same time the people sat 20 minutes AFTER us) the manager came to the other table and asked how everything was, never coming to our table (directly beside the other table).  He walked away to the kitchen only to come back to ANOTHER table sat after us and asked them how everything was. He still neglected to come to our table. We finished our food and left never to be asked about our experience.  

Of interesting note - we were there with our two children who were being VERY well behaved and the rest of the patrons were of retirement age... Perhaps we didn't matter???"}
{"text":"\"Free Pie Wednesday\"

I enjoy eating at Village Inn on ocassion. I am always greeted by friendly staff, seated almost immediately, and the food at Village Inn has always been good.

Village Inn offers meals under 500 calories and serves breakfast all day.  I like the Mediterranean omelette, with sauteed artichokes, fresh tomato, spinach, feta and topped with avocado  and the multigrain pancakes are also pretty good.

If you visit Village Inn on a Wednesday you will get a complimentary piece of pie.  I have to admit I really like free \"pie Wednesdays\". 

All in all I believe Village Inn offers good value for your money, courteous service, reasonable prices, and short waits (except on Sunday mornings). If your looking for a quick and reasonable breakfast, stop by."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up a pie we ordered. We love their pies and order them occasionally to have for get togethers, parties, etc. 

This restaurant is your typical All-American place. This day, it wasn't particularly busy, which made it easy for me to get in and out with my pie simple. The holidays, this place gets PACKED and so does the requests for pie, so if you choose to order their pies for the holidays, be sure to book in advance because they sell out fast!"}
{"text":"Lots of options at good prices.  More creative menu offerings then, let's say, Denny's.  I also love the Wednesday free pie promotion.  I've had the Fresh Fruit & Chicken Salad and the Southwest Salad.  The salads were large and filling and the ingredients were fresh.  I've also had the tomato basil soup and it was all right but a little on the oily side.  Service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love this little place. They make no pretenses here. Great diner food, reasonable prices, fast service. And delicious pies."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row they lost my holiday pie order!! Freaking ridiculous! I can't believe they allow their staff to throw away money like that! Last time I order from them!"}
{"text":"Great for gluten free eaters! Not 100% on the tomato soup, but the dishes I've gotten were always fine (allergy has subsided with fixing other health issues).  Edit:: The wait staff is friendly, informed and always quick! Kitchen is great about special orders, putting things on the side etc. ambience is very casual, and OMG the pieeeeeee"}
{"text":"We always order pies at this restaurant when we go to California. The racers love the pies and they don't have a Village Inn in CA. 
I have never been disappointed while ordering or picking up the pies. 
Only once has their been an issue with our order. The management brought it to our attention and offered my husband an additional pie for the mixup. We are pleased with our experienced."}
{"text":"If looking for inadequate service and mediocre food this is your place. My husband and I go out to eat extremely rarely, so when we do our expectations are high. The manager-on-duty was a joke. I had to ask her to get off the headset and please listen to me. Will never EVER patron this establishment again. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"My parents took us here for Dinner. We didn't know it but from 3-6pm they offer specials that include a piece of Pie ! We all picked from the Specials and everyone liked the portion size and thought is was tasty too ! It's nice and clean with prompt friendly service . We would stop here again."}
{"text":"Always good good and good prices. They seem to always have great quality food. I never get wrong orders. The sandwiches are my favorite part but they make fantastic crush burgers too. Their pie is always delicious too!"}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast a few weekends a month with my boyfriend. Our favorite waitress is Teri. She is the best, so friendly, remembers what we drink, always smiling. There are plenty of healthy choices like egg white omelets, turkey sausage, and a wide selection of veggies. Sometimes I build an omelet, and other times I get the VIB, which is when you pick 4 choices of several to make your own breakfast for 6.99. Can't beat that. Of course they have delicious pies too....pecan pie...mmmm...

It's always clean, always busy, and I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I am posting this prior to food coming out, but am so disappointed already that they have set the bar pretty low. 
Today is Saturday and it is just after 7pm. We stopped in for dinner and our.
Service is extremely slow already AND not a single smile yet. We have seen 3 different employees and nobody seems to want to be here at all. 
Here's to hoping that the food is better than the service."}
{"text":"Went here late the other night to get a bite to eat...I thought this place was open 24hours...I was wrong, got kicked out at 3am...not quite kicked out but the manager kept hinting that we would have to go soon.

Would not suggest eating here...the service was OK, except the waitress got my order wrong. In general the restaurant was clean.

I got the turkey club sandwich...it was quite stale, and did not taste very good, the seasoned fries were OK my date for the evening got a salad...what else is new right...anyhow she ate it all so it must have been OK.

I have experienced better not very impressed with this location."}
{"text":"All you can eat fish and chips leaves something to be desired. The fries are not refilled, only fish. If you want good fish and chips hit up Fast Eddie's. I'll be back but not for fish and chips. I love Village Inn on most days."}
{"text":"Lovely friendly staff. But only took 2minutes to realize we were about to dine with dozens of bugs,. Please rectify this asap. Blinds were filthy too.
Pictures posted for reference.
Bugs on the inside"}
{"text":"I met a friend from high school here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast. The place was busy, but despite that we still had pretty great service.  The french toast was yummy and what you'd expect from a chain. The food came out quick. Since it was reunion of sorts, I was happy they didn't seem to mind us sitting for about an hour and a half while catching up.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Average finer food fare here. I come to a village or similar place with an empty stomach and get the ok service and average good. Their pies are really good except it would be nice if they had some sugar free alternatives. I will say the one thing that got me in a good way were the strawberry banana pancakes. They were very fluffy and the toppings did not take away from the hot cakes flavor."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant nothing special! I do love their pies!"}
{"text":"Tracey is the best this lady made us feel welcome on our first Visit to village in we use to go the other places but lately they seem crowded and that tends to have an dry people working, anyway village in is the new spot for our family breakfast on Sundays thanks again"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, everyone is so friendly, the food is always good. I will definitely be back, it's fast service too"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome for meals any time of day. Good food and good service. It has declined so much in the past few years that we refuse to go back, since every time we go it gets worse and worse. The remodel of the inside didn't change anything except the look of the place!"}
{"text":"My first time here at Village Inn and I'm not impressed, not to say I was looking to be impressed by the way.

So I ordered the Strawberry banana French toast because it looked delicious on the menu,  and since Starbucks never comes through on my request for crazy caramel,  I decided to order Village inns...it was called caramel lovers for Gods sake.

The French toast came out, and it was super soggy, I felt maybe they prepare this way because they're used to serving a crowd with false teeth, or maybe the chef piled on way too much strawberry syrup...well I'll never know but it was disgusting. 

The iced caramel lovers coffee was a sense overload with the first gulps. Extra sugary....but once you get adjusted to the sweetness,  you realize it tastes just like medicine. 

Village Inn is not my cup of tea, but to each his own. They get three stars because the food was pretty edible and although our wait was super slow, she smiled."}
{"text":"Love coming here, such amazing service, good people and yummy food. Breakfast time can be busy, but is worth the wait. Potato pancakes and waffles are so good And the pies are soooo delish. Cesar is an awesome manager always taking care of his customers and Ray is the best waiter full of laughter and courteous service. Love coming here, like visiting family every Sunday."}
{"text":"Normally this place is okay, so my friend and I decided to go on pi day (we assumed it'd be busy, we're patient people) and put our name on the waitlist with Shannon. She told us they'd call our name outside so we waited out front. After some time passed we went back inside and saw someone who looked like either a server or a busser seat a couple who had just walked in, then looked around at everyone waiting, crossed off a few names, and walked away. Then another guy in a purple button down who looked like a manager asked what our name was, we pointed it out and confirmed that our name was crossed off while we had been waiting either in front of the door or in front of the host stand. That guy then proceeded to seat other parties, not us, so we left. Even for pi day, that was some pretty poor service."}
{"text":"We had breakfast, ham steak, blueberry pancakes and bacon. Water to drink. Good food and good service,"}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast at this location this morning food was hot and ready to eat quickly I wish I could remember my servers name because she made sure mine and my boyfriends soda was filled at all times I will go back to this village in before I would go to any of the other EV. locations"}
{"text":"Spare yourself. There are so many places to eat in this area and Village Inn should not be on your list.

Ordered a to-go breakfast (first mistake) and the waitress who took the order apparently wasn't used to questions. \"Can you replace pork with turkey?\" \"Ummmm I don't know.\" Uh, what?

I ordered the steak (medium) and eggs and my order was a pile of blob, with well done steak, which couldn't be torn apart because it was made of rubber. BFF orders french toast... turns out to be bread with generic strawberry jam. 

It was so bad, we returned the order and went somewhere else. Don't lower your breakfast standards!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and we have been to this place a good couple of times, but our last experience has left us a bitter taste in our mouths. We get seated, we waited and waited and waited. We never had a waiter or waitress come by our table even to take our drink orders! I finally got pissed threw the menus on the counter walked out."}
{"text":"Way better than Denny's!  Great for kids too. 
Great coffee, service, and my young guys can have cheeseburgers for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The place is low-end, like Denny's. Not comfortable, not inviting. The food here is below average... I've never had a good meal there. I'd only eat there if nothing else was open around it."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Village Inn all my life. This is comfort food at its best. I always love their french toast and pancakes. At this location, the service has been pretty consistent and speedy, even when they're super busy. And everyone is generally nice."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. My daughter went in to get fries and pies because Wednesday is free pie night. We have done this on many occasions. She spoke to the waitress Veronica and she said it was no problem.  My daughter ordered 4 fries and 4 pieces of what was supposed to be free pie. She was charged for all of it. I called and spoke with the person that said they were the manager named Pam and she refused any help. I am livid with a company that would take advantage of a young teenager. When I called she was so rude and unhelpful and basically told me that my daughter needs to learn how to read. I will be calling the real manager Dan tomorrow."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner for my entire family from this location last night. Unfortunately I ordered the turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing, and the turkey had turned sour. 

The children ordered pancakes for dinner, and they were amazing, but the fact that management is not checking to ensure the food is not spoiled prior to serving, is more than concerning. 

Food poisoning can kill someone, especially children and elderly."}
{"text":"Coffee was crack in a cup but nasty tasting. The grand slam was half the taste of Denny's and the cakes were half the size
. The service was excellent. Thanks Brandon."}
{"text":"The food is good, service is solid, and portions & prices are fair to average.  The decor is also contemporary compared to a similar place like Denny's.

The booths don't allow for much privacy because they are so low.  If you are into eavesdropping you might like it, but I personally don't enjoy clearly hearing all the conversations going on around me."}
{"text":"I like having a village in close to where I live for times when I'm in the mood for breakfast, but don't feel like cooking it. They've recently updated the place to have kind of a retro/modern feel...new paint, new pictures, new booths - I like it! I don't really like their new logo, but I'm not there to eat their logo so I'll get used to it eventually. Also, they have free wi-fi here if that's important to you. 

Food is always good, love their pancakes, and a lot of menu items to choose from. I tried the new chicken ranch sandwich - yums! This place was pretty busy around Saturday 11am. I've heard they have a free slice of pie on Weds type deal, so maybe one of these days I'll check that out."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this VI for a while but recently went back.  New management has really turned this place around.  I went in only expecting a mediocre meal and left surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal.  Had an omlet, pancakes and a piece of pie.  I normally wouldn't give a place like this 4 stars but I was honestly impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, zero stars is not an option here!  Absolutely the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure if experiencing. Being that we were at Village Inn, my hopes weren't high to begin with, but our options in this area are limited. My coffee was cold, toast was not toasted, egg did not resemble a poached egg, the sauce tasted sour, avocado was brown and my potatoes were mush. In our time at the establishment, three additional tables had problems with their orders and had part of their bills compensated. The \"manager\" never once came to any of our tables to address the issues. Instead, he sat on the counter at the check-out...doing nothing. Save yourself the dissatisfaction of coming here. From a business standpoint, wow, the money they must lose at this location."}
{"text":"Came in for a meal at 3:12, at 3:37 we decided to leave. Nobody said anything to us or even brought water. It seemed like only one waitress was working every table, ringing customers up, and bussing her own tables. That's not her fault, that's the representation of poor management. Look at the times again and you tell me what should be done. That's so irritating. I think businesses that are ran in such manner should be shut down. Give a local company that wants to serve their community a chance to make an honest dollar. Because the actions shown here, our money isn't appreciated or even wanted for that manner. I'll be going to corporate as well after this review."}
{"text":"After a ditched effort trying to get service at the Haymaker, we arrived at Village Inn.  Say what you want about chain food, the service here is excellent, the value is great,  and food is consistent."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and amazing pies! The selection of pies will have you sitting there forever trying to pick one drooling! I want to come back to try them all!"}
{"text":"went to go have a late breakfast today and when we got there and got seated the waitress was very rude to us and when my girlfriend asked for 1 pancake she said you have to have 3 pancakes because for some reason they can't just cook 1 pancake? but i ordered the 2-2-2 breakfast and mine came with only 2 pancakes, so i don't see what the problem would be with cooking 1 pancake. plus the pancakes were cooked too long ,and since when does asking for chocolate chips cost an additional 99 cents? also we ordered bacon and it was VERY well done it was chewy and could barely eat it.  the eggs were not cooked all the way they were watery and when she walked by she didn't even bother to ask if the food was ok she gave us a dirty look and after she brought us our food she brought our check out with it. you don't think maybe i wanted dessert? very terrible service clearly this woman was in a bad mood and took it out on us. that is no way to treat customers because i'm never returning to the Village inn for her terrible service."}
{"text":"Very Denny's-ish. All of their food is very basic, not fresh, most things are frozen or from a bag. This comes out in the flavor.. Bleh. I prefer fresh ingredients, made from scratch everything, it just tastes better. Another tip for them, the silverware is the cheapest thing I've ever held and makes me cringe! Upgrade just a smidge on your silverware, it'll make a difference . I do like the concept of the VIB, this is an excellent idea.. I just wish the food taste made me dance."}
{"text":"Took our family of six for breakfast this morning and all of us have been sick. I say yes it's a great place to eat if you want to spend next two days in the bathroom. 
We will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"I like this place better than other dinner type establishments because it is never really over crowded unless you go on the weekend morning and than you can not go anywhere and not wait. The food is fairly priced and is typical dinner fair but its good and the service is typically good."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, some days are busier than others. Either way we have always had no issues with the staff. Food is decent and the pies are great."}
{"text":"My friend and I had s wonderful time and received excellent service at this establishment. Highly recommended. Food was good. Salad was decent. Server approached us at least six times and the assistant manager too. My friend was also very pleased."}
{"text":"I had probably the best service i have ever had in a very long time. Our waitress was amazing! I wish I would've got her name so everyone gets the chance to have her as your waitress. Our food came out perfect and tasted amazing! The manager was great! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have gone here for breakfast on Sunday morning for a couple of years and today was the first time we ever walked out. We sat for 25 min after our order was taken and the waitress never once came back to our table to let us know we hadn't been forgotten or apologize for it taking so long."}
{"text":"While the food is mostly good, the service is showing some slippage! Long waits to get your order taken, and I've noticed almost every empty table brimming with dirty dishes. Busser shortage? Then it takes forever to pay the check with one person both working the register and seating new guests. Which takes awhile because the empty tables haven't been cleared of dirty dishes! See, a viscous circle,"}
{"text":"Service was okay, though I'm slightly more picky than most. Not very attentive and seemed overwhelmed. The food was great, and the pie was amazing. I'll return"}
{"text":"Okay, I've had it with the total incompetence of this location and as I am a military man, I will blame the commander I.e. The manager of the store.

We arrived at 5:35pm...a party of two ahead of us. There were FOUR tables occupied...and the lady that greeted the couple ahead of us said: \"Could I get your name?\" He was startled...four tables? Her comment was \"we only have two servers.\"

This is the third time in 8 calendar days this has happened so it is a trend.  Better bet is to go across the street to Burger King...much better service."}
{"text":"Arrived for breakfast and had plenty of seating but still was told it would be 35-40 min wait. Asked manager why they would not seat customers and at least offer coffee or water, was asked \"where are you on the list\".  Tried to tell the manager that it would be nice to have a seat or be offered a drink rather than attitude. Manager explained that the kitchen is behind and if everyone was seated, it would take an hour to get the food out. 

Not sure how this is the customers fault that the kitchen is short staffed. Great hostess and wonderful waitress...horrible manager. Seen 4 parties walk out due to the wait."}

{"text":"The food is good. Our sever was training someone which was hysterical because she forgot everything. I got the $10 steak which I thought would be larger. It was good, however my \"side of fruit\" was a joke! A toddler could eat more. My son got pancakes. But no syrup, I had to ask for it. Really? I think I'll skip this place next time."}
{"text":"Food is okay. I like the potatoes over the hashbrowns and the eggs were good. Service was quick but my server didn't keep my drink filled. Overall, okay place."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. A little on the expensive side, but it's worth it. Nice waitress. My free pie text was denied but they got it for me anyway. Great customer service, and food."}
{"text":"There are so many better breakfast options within a 5 mile radius of this place. For the price, the food is just not good and the restaurant is severely understaffed. A 30-45 minute breakfast visit took almost 2 hours due to the wait to be seated and a long time to get service to order. I will skip this place from now on."}
{"text":"Ants at our table, moved to another table that was dirty, asked for lemon with my tea and received one slice that looked like it was already squeezed and had some black stuff in it. Ordered breakfast with green peppers and didn't get it. Fiancé ordered eggs a certain way and didn't happen. Disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"very slow service at 8:30 p.m..waited 10 min for a drink order from what seem was on of the managers...Who smelled like a she had been chain smoking for days. I did not appreciate heavy smell of cigarettes as my order was being taken. I will be going to our regular village in off power and Ray."}
{"text":"I was tossed between leaving a 3 star or 2 star review... The food was good but everything else was just Meh. Our waitress wasn't too friendly and had kind of a \"I don't want to be here\" attitude.
Also my Orange Juice was almost room temp (had to add ice), they did get us in fairly quick on a Sunday Morning at 9:30 which was nice."}
{"text":"Service was slow but finally ordered a long awaited the new ultimate omelette well after long wait again was finally served it looked okay but as I started eating the omelette was over cooked I seen this new omelette on tv recently that is why we came also no garnish on the plate I think I should have gone to Black Bear Restaurant in Goodyear instead I should have listened to my husband"}
{"text":"When you want a nice cheap fast breakfast on a Sunday night, this is the place to go. Always decent service, and the food is always great. It is clean, and I like that they have a TV on one side."}
{"text":"I like the fact that I can get scrambled egg whites, turkey sausage and then counteract that with a biscuit and gravy.  I do like their biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Got raw potato pancakes...sent back. Didn't get them til after I was done eating...server rude about it.  2 stars for the nutella cream pie."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Way way way better than Denny's and iHop. Wish they had one in the bay area. They have some awesome pictures and quotes on the way if you go in there you will get a good giggle from the table. 

I got the California skillet w/ turkey sausage instead of bacon because I don't eat pork anymore and no onions 

My mom got the fish sandwich with fries and coleslaw said is was amazing

Dad got a basic burger and devoured that in 2 minutes! 

Uncle that we came to visit with from Sunset city got the 4 sausage links, eggs and hashies and said it was good portions and tasteful.

He said he will be back every Wednesday for free pie!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went in here the first time in mid September about a week after my granddaughter was born at lunch time and we both ordered breakfast foods. The food was pretty good the service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime,  maybe try the lunch menu. 

We went back last night and had a totally different experience. It was late and we did have 2 children with us, the baby who is now 3 months old and her 2 year old brother. We had just been to the Phoenix Children's Museum for their free Friday night sponsored by Target and we were all tired and hungry. We came in here in the hope that we could get something to eat so we wouldn't have to cook when we got home. In fact we picked this place because it is a \"family restaurant\"  and we expected it to be \"kid-friendly\".   Wrong. 

The  little boy was understandably fussy so I appreciate that this was not something fun for the waiter but at the same time when you're in the service industry sometimes you just have to deal with it when things happen like a fussy 2 year old. We did the best we could to keep it under control. I ended up taking him outside twice to soothe and distract him. We ordered his meal first and asked the waiter could he please make sure that got put in while we decided what we wanted to eat and actually the 2 year old was fine once his food arrived (until he'd finished eating his fill). 


It took us awhile to order because of the distractions. I ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, side of onion rings, my daughter got a cheeseburger with french fries, he got some sort of chicken tenders Kids Meal with french fries, which we were all munching on because we were hungry. Because he was tired he started getting antsy again once he was done. I finally convinced my daughter to call the dad and have him come get the child so we could eat in peace. I waited to ask our server for a container to put the rest of the toddler's food in but he never showed up so I chucked the water out of a paper cup and put the food in there. I went up to the manager at the cash register to let him know I was stepping outside just to give the food to the mom and he ignored me and didn't respond, even picked up the phone as if he was making a phone call. Rude! I just didn't want him to think I was skipping out on the bill. 

The bottom line is that the waiter, Lyle, was  not polite to us. He was as cranky as the 2 year old. I understand it was difficult for him but it's his job to be as pleasant as possible to his customers regardless and we certainly weren't doing or saying anything to be rude to him. Obviously we were struggling just to be able to order and to read the menu. He let it be known he was not happy with us which I'm NOT used to. I'm used to a really nice waiters and waitresses and servers and just don't have a problem with people because I'm a nice friendly person myself. 

I pretty much always tip 20%, I mean it's been years since I left less than a 20% tip, I can't even REMEMBER the last time I left less than 20%. But last night our bill came to $ 21.89 and I just added added  $1.11 to the credit card receipt because the service was so bad.  

From the time he brought the food till we were done and sitting there waiting, it was 30 minutes and he never even stopped by to see if there was anything else we needed, and we could've used more napkins and water. 

The manager was also very unfriendly. I'm staying in a motel and eat out everyday so I know how servers and managers are supposed to act. This place has had several other reviewers complain about the service and management and I wonder why they don't heed the criticisms and try to improve. I know I won't be back, and neither  will my daughter. 

Mesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food, and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up. I've been the person behind the counter who had difficult customers and unruly children and I did my best to tolerate and help them out so they would leave with a favorable impression of my business and want to return. Nobody ever died from being nice."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Village Inn. What's not to like? A tradition in Colorado, but some say that hasn't translated well to Arizona. I disagree. Having dined at many VI units for years near Denver, seeing the familiar sign on Stapley today caught our attention immediately. 
We were not disappointed. Perfect skillets are a VI specialty, so of course I got one, the new \"Big Country Expert Skillet.\" Very enjoyable! The country gravy over the potatoes was seasoned to my taste right from the kitchen, which is to say it had a good sausage flavor, not overwhelming but definitely not bland. It came with pancakes, another VI specialty. Perfect pancakes are easy, but definitely expected, and these were fluffy, moist and cooked exactly right.
The Mrs. had strawberry-banana French Toast, which was also perfectly prepared. I tried them and ended up eating half. Sweet strawberry sauce, but not so sweet that you can't wipe the plate with your last bite.
Add in a great staff and we had one of our better dining experiences since moving to AZ.

Incidentally, I compliment the company on their decor at this location. This is easily the nicest-looking VI I've ever stepped foot in, and that includes many of their remodeled and new locations back in Colorado. They ought to use this as a template for future units and remodels!"}
{"text":"I have left this establishment in disgust twice now, today was the last visit, ever, to this establishment.

Previously my waitress disappeared so I had to stop eating my meal halfway through because I had no beverage. When she finally showed her face again, 40 minutes later, she dropped the bill and disappeared again..... Wouldn't stop to hear me so I had to leave to get a water in my truck.

Tonight, the Hostess(Manager?) seated us, she had a very nasty phlegmy cough. OK, I'm over it, we're seated now...... 
Nope, she pulls a chair up next to the table next to us to visit with friends and continues coughing with that nasty gargle sound, it was horrendously gross.
So we grabbed our stuff and moved 3 tables away. Done. 
Nope, she comes over in a really confrontational manner, \"Can I ask why you just moved?!?\". 
My response was, \"You are coughing non-stop with that phlegmy cough, in the isle at the next table and we don't want to get sick\"........ Her response insured I will never set foot there again.
\"I AM NOT CONTAGIOUS!! And you're now sitting in a new area and you have to now wait for your new waitress!\".
LOL!!!!!!! How the hell does she know she isn't contagious and who cares?!?!? If you sound that bad, stay home, or at very least steer clear of customers.
We got up and waited to pay for our drinks at the register, she got nasty with us some more so we just walked out.

I ate breakfast here several times in the past but quit a while back for several reasons.

But, it's done. Can't set foot in this building ever again......."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been coming to this Village Inn since 2008. We really enjoyed it. The food there is excellent (I normally eat their breakfast meals) and the service is good. I love the new look they have now. They remodelled the inside of the restaurant since last year. It looks fantastic. I love the new colors too. Great place."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Denny's until one day the hubby and I decided to try out Village Inn. Now, I'd much rather go to Village Inn over Denny's any day! 

 The menu has a lot of options and a lot of items that other places just don't have. I love their eggs benedicts and the fact that you can build your own breakfast from a variety of options. The food is very well priced and very good quality. My husband and I have a breakfast date there once a week. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have never been to Village Inn. I had always heard that it was comparable to another breakfast chain and make the conscious decision to avoid it. However, sitting at home debating on what might deliver in our area and the man wanted an omelet. So, I went ahead and ordered the Garden Veggie omelet and the Country Music Star omelet. I am very glad that I didn't get carried away because there was more than enough food. 
Granted, I did order through one of the delivery services and perhaps the menu isn't as descriptive as it should be however, each of our orders came with a side of hash browns and not one, not two but THREE pancakes! Now, maybe when one dines in there are options to choose from between pancakes or toast, etc. Receiving the pancakes was a delightful surprise. They were fluffy and delicious. 
The Garden Veggie omelet had fresh onions, fresh green peppers, fresh tomatoes, fresh (tasting) mushrooms, zesty Ranchero sauce which wasn't very zesty and mozzarella cheese. Though the menu states it contains low-cholesterol egg substitute, you could have fooled me because they tasted like eggs. The Man's Country Music Star omelet contained country sausage, diced ham and onions and was topped with cheddar & Monterey cheeses, country sausage gravy and chopped bacon. Where I had no basis for comparison since I wasn't really sure what to expect, the Man commented on how much better it was than he had expected. 
In my experience, the breakfast chain I was lead to believe was comparable always left me feeling crumby after eating and I can honestly say Village Inn fed me well and left me satisfied. Not too full and with a couple of pancakes for a snack later. I would like to mention that they did hold up incredibly well in the refrigerator, they did not become soggy and tasted great cold. 
When we have a hankering for breakfast food there are too pluses here: 1. they serve breakfast all day and 2. in our area there are delivery options available. I am so glad we gave it a try, none of it went to waste!
My apologies that I cannot review regarding the staff or the location but I will update at a later time when we do go in, although it may be awhile because I personally enjoy breakfast in \"bed\" and Village Inn has made that possible and easy."}
{"text":"Pie pie pie. Very good pie. They are not open super late, but open until 11 or so. Not great for big groups of more then 6. They are good for pie. So many kinds and always great. Pretty much the only reason we come here is for the pie. Lol"}
{"text":"I came in for a slice of pie because I heard they were very good here. Had the mixed berry pie and there was nothing special about it. 


I was really upset that the waitress dropped the check off as she delivered my pie. I found it incredibly rude and left with a bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!!!!! Don't bother with this Village Inn. The management is awful. There are too many other Village Inn's in the area to deal with the poor service. The one on Power & Ray is a better option."}
{"text":"We waited for over half hour to be seated, we asked what the delay was since everyone else was getting seated and the hostess had crossed our name off the list. Though we were sitting right in front of her. Even the manager Sharon did not question why we had not been called. They just kept seating everyone else. 
 Waiter Ken was a delight, and very friendly, he made up for the long wait, food was great, perfect portions and strawberry crepes were very tasty."}
{"text":"Village In Is Denny's GRANDPA! Lol. This place reminds me of a place I use to come with my grandparents after bowling night. Retro, dirty menus, random music playing in then background, lazy staff.... You know the type of place. The one that has the huge pie case that says \"world famous pie\" above it! And..... Don't Forget the super loyal geriatric following.  I was the youngest person in there by about 50 years! 
When I first walked in I knew I made a mistake. By the music playing, the desert case right in front, and the people that were eating.But... For all the folks that follow me... Know, I mostly try everything and everyplace.....at least once. It being in The same parking lot as my hotel might've had a little something to do with it. Anyway, the menu is mainly breakfast and I wanted dinner.... Should have known there too! But!! Why read the sighs leading you in the right direction  when you can plunge yourself right off the cliff... Lol. - sooo I went for the chicken fried steak mashed potatoes and broccoli. I will give it to them, everything was super crazy hot when it came out. It's one of my biggest pet peeve's my food has to be hot or it goes back. The food came out in about 10 minutes. The chicken fried steak was pretty good... But I assume it was already made that way and just need to be tossed into the fryer. The potatoes were instant, not fresh... But instant and the broccoli was in the microwave for about two minutes.Very hard almost raw. The mashed potatoes came with gravy and so did the chicken fried steak. It wasn't that bad, nothing out of order again but not that bad. The waiter seem to be nice enough, he wasn't very impressed I was sat in his section... Because I had a laptop and wanted to \"plug in\" meaning this section was the only section I could sit in! 
When I was ready to go, I sat there for about five minutes with my Credit card out waiting for someone to come pick it up. When the assistant manager came over to see how I was doing I asked if there was someplace I was supposed to go to pay for it. He said he would meet me at the front to have me pay for it. This just happens to be right next to the big huge pie case I mentioned above. While checking out the assistant manager asked if I wanted some to take with me? I said no, I was plenty full from dinner. He said to me \"I'll let it slide this time but next time you'll have to get some\". Apparently they have free pie on Wednesdays with any kind of purchase. He highly encouraged me to come back on Wednesday for that free pie. I'm pretty sure his prior job was a car salesman.. Lol. I mean the pie looks good enough to me, but not a single person at any of the booths or the table had ordered any... So I was not going to have two strikes out in one day! LOL
Maybe the breakfast is better? Maybe the pie is really good?... I don't know but I'll leave it up to you to decide."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had the best experience here. We've never been in before this visit and as soon as we walked in a gentleman was being rude to the front staff complaining him & his toddler could barely eat because the floor was sticky. (Very odd) As we were greeted and sat everyone was seeming sincere in their welcome. We asked if they had a newspaper stand and the manager actually went to McDonald's to pick one up. In this day & age customer service is hard to come by. This sounds silly but the staff truly touched our heart!! Plus the food was delicous 
Thank you village inn."}
{"text":"The customer service has gone downhill over several months not like it was when they first opened. Who gets seated almost immediately but waits 20 minutes for a server to come to your table??   My girlfriend and I just walked out we've had it!!   Secondly, it's out right ridiculous and absurd that they will not except coupons for Friday night all you can eat fish fry!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Village Inn around the country, and this was by far worst. After a waitress decided to help us and take our order, I decided on the pot roast. Food came and waitress left, mine was cold. Mashed potatoes seemed to be out of the cooler. Flagged down a bus boy to find our waitress, never happened. Grabbed a waiter, he took the plate. Brings it back and says \"I put it in the microwave\".  Not sure if he did because parts of the meal were still cold. If I wanted microwave food, I would have gone to the store it would have cost less.  Waitress finally comes back and asks if there is anything she can get us. I was hungry and had eaten most of the plate by then. Just wanted to leave before getting too upset at that point. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Overpriced and very small portions for what you pay and get. My son had to order two sides of hash browns. Tastes O.K. Not my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail and put it on my breakfast list.  Recently they have redone the interior in a pleasant mix of browns and oranges, but they have 4 turquoise table tops?  They offer free wi-fi but you better have a charged battery as I only spotted a few booths that had an outlet handy,

I had a Heritage combo of bacon, eggs, potatoes and pancakes.  It was cooked properly and quick.  I have visited 4 chain restaurants lately for an early Saturday morning breakfast.  This one was the best in service and quality/preparation of the food, well worth straying off of Bell Rd."}
{"text":"M and I have eaten at this location a few times.  The employees are always friendly, and the food comes out hot.  The location shares a parking lot with a large strip shopping center, so there is plenty of parking.  It gets busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  If you are with a larger party, expect to wait for a table.  2's and 4's seem to get seated pretty quickly.

Breakfast is my favorite thing to eat here.  The coffee is pretty good, too.  The place has been clean every time we have visited.   If you go for lunch or dinner, be sure to save room for PIE!  Yes, this location does free piece of pie on Wednesdays with purchase of an entree."}
{"text":"Village inn has done some cute remodels and I like the TVs! I feel like Travis and I have been prone to late night snacks more often lately and Village Inn always delivers.

Not gourmet but definitely A-OK!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for a long time.  The place got a face lift (nice, clean, and modern-ish.  I do not know if it was a holiday or what.  The place was slammed.  The wait for a table was only 10 mins.  Ok!!!  

Our server was terrific, she is spot on and quick.  It was awesome that all the servers chip in to check and help the customers.  We placed our drink orders and she is back quickly with the drink then got our food order.  

I got the chicken ranch sandwich.  Fried chicken patty, cheese, bacon, and ranch on the side.  It was pretty good.  My husband got the country skillet.  Another server bought out our food and one of the bacon strips fell off the plate.  She just laughed and said \"Opps it jumped.\".  She did not offer to bring him a replacement or anything and walked off."}
{"text":"All of these Village Inn are the same, but that is where the servers can stand out.  This location is very clean and laid out the same like the one in Avondale.  

I got the chicken fried steak skillet.  The chicken fried steak is good, the gravy has good, the fried potatoes cubes are nice and cripsy, and the scramble egg to top it off was good.  

The server was so busy, she was all over the place but we were still checked on."}
{"text":"Ah, good 'ol standby Village Inn, where else could I, a quasi-nut case get great food at such a late hour? 

The manager misses us when we are not there to envelope the place with our gloominess. The service is really great and the food is always good. This is a much better choice over Denny's because they are cheap and the food portions are better than Denny's. Good place to wander over to after coming out of Shirt's 'n' Things.

I recommend the pie. It's free on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Had breakfast here. It was food but was terribly mediocre. Staff was nice but I certainly wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in some weeks ago, about end of August after attending a funeral service on that side of town.  
The service was overall bad, and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend.  So we flagged down the manager to complain.  The result was that he explained that the district manager was there and the ice machine was done.
I was like thinking, my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him, so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me, but oh well, they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotion.
When we checked out, it took 1/2 hour to pay the bill, in addition, NO Pieces of Pie were comped out. Explanation -- the types of pie we chose were not in the free offer, although we had asked the server about the time limit on the free pie, I guess he would not let us in on the secret that the TYPES we chose were not free, and now, in addition to NOT getting comped as a nicety for the arguing, we weren't even given ANY free pie at all.  They gave us ONE free $2 iced tea.  
And TOOK an extraordinary long time to do this.  We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad, lol.
Overall, I would avoid this location.  There are plenty of other restaurant choices nearby when I am on this side of town."}
{"text":"Worst service. 
The host was to personal. 
My silverware was dirty and had food on it.
Don't think this place is safe to eat.
The waitress was not friendly and didn't explain the specials they offer. The waitress took 8 minutes for our drinks and they weren't even busy. The food came out warm not hot. She took a 30 minutes to bring the food. I think all their locations have gone down hill."}
{"text":"Village Inn has the BEST Chocolate French Silk Pie ever made.... I know nothing about their food and have nothing else to say, really.  

Oh wait, I do.  The kid with the cool blond tiped hair that served us the other night was really nice.  He seemed to be covering the whole floor with ease.  

Go for pie.  You're welcome.

See ya there."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived at this location to celebrate my daughter's birthday with dinner. We were seated after the manager set up a table for us. We were given menus and after waiting over 15 minutes our drink order was taken by the manager. (Our waitress greeted us and stated she would be with us in a few seconds. She walked off and disappeared in the kitchen and we didn't see her again). T
he manager brought our drinks out to our table and forgot one of the drinks, that is OK it happens as there were 7 of us. However, no one returned to take our food order. From where we were seated we could see people in the kitchen, hear laughter and watch the manager walk back and forth to the kitchen. 
Other people were waiting for either their food or drinks to be served. Others were like us, their food order had not been taken and they were looking around and making comments.
Finally, after nearly an hour we got up to leave. I waited by the front register so I could pay for the drinks. The manager walked up to the register and I explained that we were leaving and I wanted to pay for the drinks. He apologized and I paid $12.00 and some change for the drinks. He again apologized; I was nice, I didn't want to be rude or create a scene.
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Friday, Sept. 30th, my husband, my daughter and myself decided to eat breakfast/brunch at Village Inn. It has been awhile since we were last at a Village Inn location. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, whom seated us in a booth and handed us menus. Shortly afterwards our waitress arrived and took our drink order. We ordered coffee and ice water. We perused the menu as they have a nice menu with a big variety in which to choose from.
We ordered the VIB for breakfast. I chose the eggs over easy, strawberry crepe, sausage links and country potatoes. My husband ordered the cheese omelet, sausage patty, country potatoes and strawberry crepe and my daughter ordered eggs over easy, bacon, and fruit.
The meals arrived hot and cooked to perfection. Everything was delicious and fresh. 
Village Inn is quick to get the food out to the table. Our waitress was very nice, she checked back with us often and she made sure we were taken care of. 
The restrooms were clean as was the restaurant. Upon check out, our hostess was friendly and she asked us how everything was. This is good customer service in my opinion. 
We enjoyed our meals and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Village Inn is my go to restaurant for casual dining. The food is always hot and fresh. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. She promptly brought out our drinks. My family and I stopped in for brunch.
Three of us ordered the V.I.B. For breakfast and my son ordered the pancake breakfast with eggs-medium and bacon. I chose two eggs over easy, two sausages, hash browns and a strawberry crepe. My daughter ordered two eggs over easy, two bacon strips, fruit bowl and low fat yogurt. My husband ordered cheese omelette, bacon, home fries and French toast.
This location in Glendale is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to provide a American Apple Pie for our Independence Day celebration.  He asked for an \"apple pie\".....we were confused when we opened it to slice and serve it.... It was bright PINK.  It had STRAWBERRIES on it!  Whoever heard of apple-strawberry pie??  It was mushy and surely a disappointment."}
{"text":"My wife and I are retired and on a fixed income.  We eat out every day, and  this is one of the places we like to visit (Especially on \"Free Pie Wednesday\").  We know most of the Managers, Cashiers, and Servers by name.  The service is usually prompt, and the food is very good.  For Breakfast, we often split the \"Pick 4\" and for lunch we get the Ruben Sandwich, which my wife loves.  We are not big eaters, so usually take the free pie home for later on Wednesdays.   Another thing for Seniors - you must tell them you are a senior, but you will get 10% discount on your bill for most menu items (Just a few exceptions like the \"Pick 4\" and \"Lunchbox Favorites\" specials)."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner at 4:30 pm. I'm a senior and am alone in life. Was seated and sat for about 10 to 15 minutes and watched my waitress clear and wipe down tables with an occasional glance toward me. No greeting no offer of water or beverage just cleaning tables. Eventually another waitress came out saw me and asked if the waitress wanted her to serve me. I heard the conversation and asked the lady who came out to help, whose table it was? She admitted it was the lady wiping down tables. Since wiping those tables was more important than a customer I voted with my feet and am reviewing this incident from Chilis at Mesa Riverview. They respect customers here."}
{"text":"Food is good and you can have breakfast anytime what else could you ask for.  Service is okay sometimes faster than others but the atmosphere is pleasant enough. Friday night is all you can eat fish and chips and that I'd my favorite. There are many locations and that help. Is it a must try"}
{"text":"After walking out of Apple bees because of poor service, my guest and I headed over to this location, which is in the same parking lot as the Applebees. 
We walked in. Several people were seated, eating. We waited Abbott 3 minutes with No sign of any staff. There was no host, servers or manager. We looked around and saw the people seated all had food and were eating so it wasn't that they were waiting for their order. 

Awful service!"}
{"text":"I enjoy there vib breakfast awesome deal and there pie is amazing. Also have a good ranch chicken sandwich taste kinda like chick fil a. On Wednesday is free pie day it will be packed but very worth the wait for the Delicious pie."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come every Sunday morning for breakfast. I would recommend this place to anyone. They serve the food fast. They have some of the best pancakes I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"For the love of God, stay away. We were greeted with a frown and the look of disappointment only considering there was only one other family there besides mine."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and ended paying steakhouse prices. Example 2 coffees and 2 orange juices 12 bucks!!!  Really!!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food was good. However breakfast for 2 should never cost 33 dollars. Will never return."}
{"text":"We came on Christmas day and expected a wait so the 30 minutes we waited for a table wasn't a problem. Our poor server was dripping with sweat and running around like crazy. I'm guessing they understaffed.
 We put in our order and waited and waited and waited. My daughters soup came out about 25 minutes later. And so we waited again.It wouldn't have been a problem but every table around us that was sat after us was eating and were still waiting. I very nice I  called over the manager and asked if he could check on our food and expalined the situation. He came back about 5 minutes later with one of our meals and about 5 minutes later with another. The second was ice cold and was sent back when the third dish arrived. At this time before we had even gotten all of our food the manager dropped off our bill.  We were never asked if we wanted pie and considering it was christmas and free pie day we would have thought we would have been asked. But not a word from the manager, no even I'm sorry you food took so long. And we were so nice.  We even left the server a great tip. IStill no pie or return from the manager. I have to say I work as a server in the area and have never seen such rude management. 
 When I went to pay I explained that we were never offered pie or dessert and would have liked some the cashier seemed very short about having to get us slices of pie as the should have been done at the table. HELLO WE KNOW THAT.  It would take her a few minutes. We I'm sorry to have to have you do your job. Maybe she can talk to it with her manager who ignored us and dropped our bill. 
 Merry Christmas  ."}
{"text":"This is great place for a simple but delicious lunch. Portions are large and the pie is amazing. Service is good... They don't hover, but I've never had an empty glass, either."}
{"text":"Love this place. So good I've been here three times in the past month. Excellent food, excellent service, great all around experience. Heard they have great pie but haven't had the chance to try those yet. Will soon though!"}
{"text":"Tough choice to give only 3 stars, 'cause I like their comfort food skillets, the pies are AWESOME, and the servers are always pleasant. Unfortunately,  a tiny little roach jogged up over the bottom of my table just after I finished eating on Sunday ... and I just can't hang with that.
To make matters worse, when I told the cashier, she just thanked me for the info and said she'd tell the manager. I didn't expect a free breakfast, but an offer for a discount would have gone a long way.
I notice that another recent review mentioned roaches ... NOT  good for a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food. Great customer service. Not much to dislike here. We had to wait a long time for our food because I think they dropped it on the ground in the kitchen. The wait didn't bother me, but they remade the food, comped us the bill and gave us a free entree. Nice gesture. James was a great waiter as well. We live about five minutes away and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A flashback to childhood comfort food!

When I eat at this place, I feel like I did back when I was a kid. Hanging out late nights with family or friends while eating good comforting breakfast foods AND PIE :)
I'm back in a warm, homey kitchen, chatting and catching up with someone dear to me (now normally my kiddo!). She and I are both fans of the Strawberry Crepes :D

This is also the place I order all my Thanksgiving day pies from. Ohh soo good!

Pricing is reasonable. 
Service is friendly. 
I hardly ever have to wait to be seated. 
Parking is ample."}
{"text":"We decided to go and have breakfast at Village inn, the service was not that good some of my food was served to me on a dirty plate. The waitress did not write down our order it wasn't a surprise when she got it confused. We overheard two different waitresses talking about how crazy one customer was because they ordered coffee and they got Coke. The only good part of the customer service came when we were checking out the manager offered us free pie Wednesday which our waitress did not. We will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Went in for a late night meal after the Superbowl. Staff was super nice it wasn't busy the food was amazing and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Come here often with family.  It's close to home, never too much of a wait except Sundays and consistent in their food and service.  It's a chain of course so there are certain expectations that come with that."}
{"text":"Came in here on Wednesday evening about 915 all the way in the door and pass the podium before we were greeted by the manager and her friend standing next to her(Manager had sucker in her mouth, see pics)She called the young man from the back to come up and Seat us we were seated right away our server did not come from 5 to 7 minutes and then we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks.Dirty floors all around us, saw several hostess/servers walking around or hanging out up front near the register but nobody bothered to sweep or pick up the dirty silverware/trash laying on the floor.The restaurant I serve at has a rule that we do not get sat another table until our floors are swept and our tables are clean. Might be a good rule to implement here.Food is pretty decent, although I asked for no salt on my fries and my sons to ensure that they will come out hot and fresh and they may have started that way but set under the warmer too long because there were anything but. We will not come to this location again dirty and no one seems to care. Usually go to the one on 91st and Northern. Now I know why.How tacky when the manager is sucking on a lollipop during transactions. Stay away from here!"}
{"text":"Had the strawberry-rhubarb pie blended into a vanilla shake. Life changing! You gotta try it! Traci was our server and she was awesome! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"FREE PIE WEDNESDAY! Need I say more? Well it's free with any purchase. I've been in to Village Inn a handful of times now so I feel it deserves a proper review of their pie

So I've gone in for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and every time I've had exceptional customer service. I honestly can't complain. It relates to Denny's and IHOP but feels more relaxed and casual. At least this location is. 

Now they are famous for their pies which they have so many flavors of. For their free pie Wednesday it's not all of the pie flavors that are in participation but most of them and they are happy to tell you which ones. I chose the coconut creme pie for my free slice and it was excellent! Not too heavy and not too sweet. 

There's also a lot of old retired people that go in on Wednesday. So if you want to see couple goals go in on Wednesday and then get a free slice of pie"}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I went for lunch. I know this isn't relevant to my review, but it was on a Wednesday, and Village Inn is known for free pie on Wednesday. That however is not why we went. We were greeted very promptly by the hostess. For free pie Wednesday the place was remarkably empty. Perhaps this was because of the triple-digit Heat. Our server came to our table and asked for our drink order. She then came back and asked if we were ready to order. We did so. I have no idea of where she had caught the attitude bug, but trust me when I say she was pretty much lousy. Our questions regarding the menu were answered in a very terse Manner. The items that we ordered came with a selection of several different sides. Said server bulldozed right through our order giving us little time to state what we wanted to have. The interaction with her was non-existent. She did not seem to be having a great day, and did not mind acting as though she did. Okay, I get it. The best of us can have rotten days. However I know of few occupations that condone rudeness. Now about the food. My spouse ordered the revved up BLT, and myself chicken fried steak. My husband did not order a deconstructed BLT, however it sure look like it on the plate. My food, if that is what you want to call it was delivered cold to the touch. There was gravy on the steak, but it was like wallpaper. Since we were pressed for time neither one of us griped about the poor service or the lack of quality for our meals. But here is the good part! We went to pay our check in the front of the house. The manager was ringing up tabs. He asked how we liked our lunches. My husband stated to him that we found everything to be fair. Well the manager glossed things over never asking what the problem was or anything else as a matter of fact. So what is the point of asking how's something was or wasn't if there was no comment or feedback from the other side? This visit to this location was really a bust. I doubt that we will come here again. There is an upside to this otherwise Grim dialogue. It was free pie Wednesday!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences at Village Inn I've ever had. First off all of the following comments are not intended for our waitress (Terri), I feel she's doing the best she can with what she has to work with. With that being said the food was inedible, my patty melt tasted like it was cooked in 3 year old fryer grease and other than the taste of stale and nasty grease it had ZERO seasoning! My daughter ordered country potatoes and egg whites that resembled the plastic food you'd get in a kitchen set from Toys-R-Us, visually and taste wise (and at least those toys you get your money's worth)! But don't worry you can always go to the bathroom to wash the 3 year old greasy spoon remnants of oil from your fingers to try to forget why you're paying $48.67 for food your family of 4 really didn't even eat. NAH, that's a dream I was in, because the bathroom was so unsanitary between the soiled toilet paper, and vomit everywhere you decide that 3 year old grease isn't that bad after all."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer service! Management is getting worse and worse! 
I experienced bad service during a dine-in service and a pick up service."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning at Village Inn. I would rather eat here than Dennys anyday. I was excited to eat breakfast this morning because I was starving. I ordered the smothered chicken burrito without the jalapeño, not one for extra heat. I was rather disappointed when I started eating my burrito and I had hardly to no chicken inside at all. I needed the protein, so it was something I was banking on, but instead was left with scrambled eggs and potatoes smothered in Pico degio and green chili sauce. It was a bit of a let down, and left me disappointed. This was my only complaint with my visit today."}
{"text":"I don't know why I would go to this one, it's always busy and people working don't get my order right and the service is horrible I would not recommend coming here"}
{"text":"If you get Travis tip big he funny and nice guy and Michael help out cause I'm in wheelchair he moved stuff for me"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food always come out cooked great and the servers are all friendly. No complaints here. I always order the vib breakfast and it comes out in big portion unlike some other village inn. Their pies here are always delicious. I always order the whole banana cream pie and its always great."}
{"text":"Good selection of breakfast items, great service. However the three stars are for the quality of the food, not the best I e eaten. I'd take a Cracker Barrel anyway of the week."}
{"text":"My favorite meal would be breakfast, and this is my breakfast place. I've had lunch and dinner here which weren't as appealing! Lucky for me breakfast is served all day so I can get my favorites. Love the skillet breakfasts the best. While they never look as great as the picture (plating for looks seems to not be a priority here) the food is tasty. The coffee is really good and ask for flavored creamer if you enjoy that. They will always accommodate you in that way. I like my toast on the burnt side (just like Mom used to make) but my toast is always \"underdone\". The pies of course are outstanding and the waitstaff is always pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"This is the Third year that i have ordered Thanksgiving pies from Village Inn and the are very good at operating the pick up service for the pie. The pies were ready on time and fresh, no wait and at a very good pice. I will be the next year."}
{"text":"I went here on Father's Day morning for some breakfast after a late night. It was very busy, but we were seated within 30 minutes. My husband and I both ordered from their choose 4 items for $6.95. For the most part everything was decent except my biscuit was hard as a rock around the edges and my husband's french toast was served cold...the huge pat of butter they put on top was hard and cold and because they french toast was cold, it did not melt. I was ok with overlooking my biscuit, but the husband wanted some new french toast, as he should.

It took 20 minutes for us to get someone's attention about the french toast, and it was the manager on duty. We told her it was served cold, instead of asking if we would like a new one she asked if wanted a to-go box???? I said no, why would we want to take it? She then offers to heat it in the microwave...again I told her no, it ruins it when you heat in the microwave, and I said we just want a new one. She then insists that we take it home and just freeze it and then have it later because this is what she does. She says they are busy and it will take forever to get a new one. At this point I tell her we do not want it all and we just want the bill so we can leave. She deducted $2. I was very disappointed in the way she handled this situation, I tried to call a manager at the restaurant to complain about her and she picked up the line, when I asked for another manager, she hung up!!

** We did buy a Boston Cream Pie to take home, and it was delicious**"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. This place reminded me a lot of Perkins so I wanted to give it a shot. Oh boy I wish I wouldn't have. I loathe Dennys. I'd rather eat there than at village inn. Usually I don't say anything about food being bad, just make note never to return. I had to say something. My mashed potatoes were gritty and the gravy tasted really weird. The corn was ok but nothing special. Then I went to try the garlic bread and it had a hair on it. At that point I lost my appetite. My SO got the grown up grilled cheese. How can you screw that up? Bacon under cooked. It tasted like nothing. And the bread had no color. Took way too long for him to get a refill on iced tea. They did comp the meal which was very nice of them. Overall, just really bad food. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Like much of my latter scholastic career, about a 3.3 that could have reached a 4.0 on my scale with  just a couple details attended to.  This was our first trip to this VI on T'bird this mid-Saturday morning. Everything was good, the portions were satisfying without being overwhelming, the service was polite and friendly, and the prices as always for this chain, very reasonable. 
 Scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, grits, and strawberry crepes for me.  The scrambled eggs with cheese had shredded cheese more sprinkled on them than cooked within, but were tasty enough.  The bacon was a reasonably sized serving of good flavor, and the grits with large pad of butter were sufficient to satisfy Southern cravings, if not quite to perfection.   As to the strawberry crepes, Paris may have better but these were delicious, and at $8.60 with tax included, this was a perfectly fine meal for me, and my housemate sends his compliments on the French toast.

The place was near full when we entered, and full with a waiting line by the time we left.  Service was polite and friendly with a smile, and efficient.   The place was busy and my water glass went dry for a brief few moments, but on being tagged in passing, our server immediately attended and checked on our status again within a few minutes.  No problem in splitting checks and no delay or wait in receiving.  

This is a take-your-check-to-the-register place.  The register being right by that big pie display case stocked with all the salivation-worthy pies for which VI is known, but being well-filled, we were able to resist the take-out temptation. 

The line was about 5 deep but moved quickly. The young cashier was polite and efficient, and asked the right \"was everything alright\" questions and paid appropriately attention to my mention of the condition of the men's room. It was not \"bad\", but paper towel waste filled in-the-counter waste receptacle to just slightly overflowing, and two packs of still-wrapped paper towels sat in a plastic bag on the counter, along with a key-on-a-stick that just didn't belong there,  but the overall condition was basically clean and stocked with TP, hand soap, and paper towels, lots of paper towels - but lots is better than none.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this Village Inn in Mesa for probably 7 or 8 years, but a cross-valley furniture moving trip and decision to rendezvous in it's conveniently en route parking lot to collect a friend's tax docs while hungry(!) lead our full 2 car crew of 7 inside for a late breakfast. 

The place was nearly full, but we were seated quickly.  The interior had been refurbished sometime since I had been there last and looked neat, clean, and less worn on the inside.  The food was really really good all around, reasonably priced, and generous in portion. Service was friendly, efficient, and remarkably attentive considering the crowd.  The strawberry crepes my friend recommended were delicious, the bacon had a good flavor and did not have the slightly stale taste I've noted at two separate  places recently, and my eggs were a perfectly cooked over-easy.  Good food, good service, good value, and nobody walked out hungry.   I have certainly had much poorer service (and food) in much more fashionable and more expensive places. My compliments."}
{"text":"So, the man needed a banana cream pie. He's been asking for one for probably about two weeks, and he's very partial to pies from The Village Inn. Tonight on the way home I decided that I would get dinner from this Village Inn, and get him his pie.

The one- star is for the fact that there is no online ordering. Now, everyone knows that I am more loyal to businesses that let me order online with ease. Unfortunately, the Village Inn has opted not to jump on this bandwagon. I had to pick up the phone, like a caveman, and call in my order. \"Ooga, ooga. Turkey bacon avocado, ooga\". 

I ordered J's favorite sandwich, the turkey bacon avocado melt. He requested it with a side of fruit. I got a bowl of the chicken noodle soup, and a side of broccoli. Let me step back for a moment. I called and spoke to a gal named Tammy. At First, the way she picked up the phone, I thought she was going to be mean. I was on hold for just a moment, and when she came back, she was the nicest lady I think I've ever spoken to on the phone.

Fast forward my brief drive to the parking lot. It was clean outside and well-lit. The parking lot was absolutely full, so I suppose that's a good sign. I waited just a moment upon my arrival, with no greeter or recognition that I was there. However, Tammy soon came out of the back to greet me. She was just as friendly in person. My meal was ready as promised, and she took the time to show me each item, to make sure that they were to my liking.

While I thought the broccoli looked a little bit wimpy, everything else looked fantastic. And it all tasted pretty fantastic. Especially that darned banana cream pie! As far as comfort food Village Inn meals go, anyway. I would definitely order from here again. I just wish they would let me do it online."}
{"text":"Server was friendly but slow. It seemed like he had too many tables to handle. Only checked on us once and we got no refills on our water. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you could give this place one star!  The food and service were awesome both times I went.  Also, the specials are amazing.  I can get a great sit-down meal for about the same as grabbing something inhumane from a drive-thru.  Village Inn has made my list!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for almost a year & I'm glad to say we have always had a good breakfast along with good service. They always want to sell you a pie when your at the register but their not pushy.  This VI has been consistent for us."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and were seated right away.


Pros: clean setting, modern interior, good /fast service, healthy options(i.e. egg white omelets, 'low calorie' marked options on the menu, etc, flat screen TVs. We could see the kitchen from where we were sitting and it looked very clean.


Cons: no gluten free options. We had a sticky table when we arrived, however probably a fluke."}
{"text":"First of all I'd like to say our server was extremely nice. Very attentive and he even joked with us and out 4 year old daughter. 

I'm giving it two starts because the food's just OK. Maybe if we had been there for breakfast or to get some pie it may have been different. We stopped by to have dinner because my daughter could eat for free (she got a coupon at school). She had mac and cheese and a side of broccoli. The side of broccoli's literally THREE broccoli florets.

My philly cheeseteak was a new item on the menu and it was just OK. I mean, nothing really memorable about it. My husband ordered the tuna melt and he said he wasn't impressed either. 

The restaurant was almost empty and our food still took a while. I believe it may be understaffed. There was only one waiter and two tables to wait."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Village Inn since high school, and I must say it was better then I remember. The staff was good the food was great and the inside was a dope modern diner feel. Open 24 hours a day and definitely better then Denny's lol!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this location after we decided we didn't want to wait 30 plus minutes at our normal spot.  Service was slow at first.  However, once we ordered food came out in less than 10 minutes and was very good.  Pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews.  Pies look amazing!  We will be back.  Not crowded and hit right in."}
{"text":"I like the waffles and the hash browns here. Location is a bit far from where I stayed but still it was worth it. The price are reasonable and good. The place is neat. Still I am not quite impressed. To sum it up, just a so-so place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and tasty food. Their decor set the apart from other chain diners. While busy the staff was incredibly organized and everything was timely and efficient"}
{"text":"Went there on Wednesday evening for the free pie night.  The place was not real busy.  Service was slow and waitress acted like she would rather be someplace else.  She did not mention the free pie night; we had to ask about it.  We had to wait so long for her to return that I found the manager  to ask for a take out box.  Manager asked someone else to get a takeout box and the manager acted like she did not care.  Waitress came over a few minutes later and had a puzzled look on her face.  Neither the waitress nor the manager  seemed to notice very very slow service.   With that being said,  food is good for a neighborhood family restaurant.  I would not travel out make special trip to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to a Village Inn, but the first time I have actually ordered food.  Both trips involved bad service or at least service that was understaffed for the crowd.  My husband had seen a commercial for a breakfast skillet on TV that was apparently very enticing.  So we mapped out our chores for the day and found a Village Inn along our path.

Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but obviously frazzled.  He helped me narrow down our choices by answering our questions about the menu.  I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and rye toast.  The husband ordered a sausage skillet.  To our amazement, the plates that were presented to us a short time later, LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES ON THE MENU. 

This is the first time in Arizona that I received hash browns that were actually brown.  What a concept!! And not just brown on the top. Nooo, these babies were browned on both sides. Crispy, yummy and BROWN hash browns.  And I didn't ask for them to be cooked that way.  Every other restaurant in Arizona does such a pisspoor job of browning hash browns, that I've completely given up on asking for my potatoes to be done \"dark.\"  I usually end up with a plate of mushy potato shreds dripping with butter substitute.  Gross. I've come to the point that I ignore that the potatoes are even there.

But before my very eyes is a plate with the potatoes cooked just right, eggs exactly how I asked them to be cooked, tasty sausage links and two thick pieces of marble rye.  That's a lot of food when you plan on actually eating the potatoes.

My husband was equally pleased with his skillet.  We both couldn't believe that there was a chain in Arizona that actually had a decent breakfast, and that we failed to realize it until 5 months before we leave the state.  :("}
{"text":"12/12/14 just went here for the first time and its a new location.
Very clean and 60's style  decor.......you'll swear you're on the set of Mad Men !!
I had eggs, hashbrowns, bacon with 2 cinnamon pancakes for 7.49
Very well prepared and my fiances chix fried steak was great. 
Flatscreen tvs hanging as well. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Seems to have gone downhill.  Big employee overturn and not for the better.  Food is not consistently prepared and place is sometimes dirty looking (especially bathrooms).  The silverware is usually spotted or has food stuck to it and has to be replaced.  This should be noticed when they are rolling the silverware in the napkins.  Cooks are not very good.  Free pie is okay but have a feeling it is not fresh and the slices are smaller than when you buy a piece.  Lots of other restaurants coming to the area so Village Inn had better shape up or they will be going out like a lot of the others in the area. There prices are too high for many items and not worth it."}
{"text":"The service is quick. 
Servers know the menu. 
The prices are fare. 
Store is very clean and employees as well. 
The food was right the first time, served in a short time. 
Try the pie! Can't get enough of the cherry. 
I have read plenty of negative posts about this place and they must have read them as well because my experience was not like theirs. 
Will visit this store again."}
{"text":"Well.......we come to the Village Inn because it is \"just over the wall\" from us. We like to go to the \"free pie\" Wednesday after work and have a little meal and top it off with a piece of pie. If you want to partake in the free pie Wednesday then just plan about two hours because the whole experience lasts that long if you choose to wait it out. The service is EXTREMELY slow!!!!  I really think they have one server for the whole place. Never mind that they look at you and keep on walking by. If you want another glass of drink you will need to ask for it. I ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, hamburger patty and cottage cheese. I swear that they had to wait for the chicken to lay the eggs. Twenty-five minutes to make my meal???  Really???  I should mention that the restaurant only had about fifteen other people in it. So after I have eaten my meal now the will to wait comes into play. Twenty minutes after I finished my meal I'm still waiting for the server to come by and take my pie order. DENIED!!!!!  No pie for me. I finally get tired of waiting and go to the counter to pay my bill. I get the standard how was everything and I unload my opinion. Wow all the sudden I'm offered pie to go etc. I politely declined because all they ever have is Apple!!!!!  It's good pie but occasionally I want a different pie. The Village Inn advertises on TV about \"free pie Wednesday\" and says to get their pie of the month. Well maybe at any of their restaurants but not at the Goodyear one. I just hope you have hours to wait and like apple!!!!!  

It will be a long while until I go back. My time is worth more than a free piece of pie. Thank you Village Inn of Goodyear for making that clear to me."}
{"text":"Waoted to be assisted and no one even acknowledged me , in addition the resturant was dead .. this place was a rwal let down ...smh"}
{"text":"What's the deal with the pies at this place?  They peddle them like they are filled with liquid percocet.   I have never seen such a scurry of senior citizens to \"reserve\" pies.

I've been here a few times and I can say that the Veggie Omelet never does me wrong.  I usually try to add a cup of fruit or snack on my dining partners pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc...

Th wait staff is decent but seems a little pissed at the customers.  I can't blame them as this place is always packed and that means refilling grandma's coffee constantly.  

One day I will try a pie - it just may be the best pie ever."}
{"text":"We just got back from visiting Arizona.  One of the places we had (a late) breakfast was at Village Inn on 9490 W. Northern Ave in Glendale. The food was good but the service was AMAZING!!! Our server, Ginelly, was an impressive young lady.  It is rare that we encounter a person with such grace and personality as we did with Ms. Ginelly.  We enjoyed our meal a whole lot more because of the way Ms. Ginelly interacted with us.  What a wonderful person she is!  I later found that she was at the end of her shift after working one the night before to cover someone else's shift.  We absolutely couldn't tell!  She treated our family with such grace and she had so much energy one could not tell she had very little sleep the night before.  
If anyone reads this and goes to Village Inn at this particular location, ask to sit in Ginelly's section.  Trust it will be a treat for you!  Management would be wise to hold on to this person.  She has a very, very bright future!
Ms. Ginelly pushes this review from a 3 star to a 5 star rating.  Thank you for showing us your kindness."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I eat here even though it is close to my house. Pancakes have a funny taste. Country potatoes are plan. Coffee  carafe had a hair on it. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice people...

The food is okay, more importantly the staff is nice, friendly and helpful. It is the closest thing to a \"neighborhood cafe\" we have."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location. The waiter was wonderful and actively AND nicely answering all my questions, as this was my first time there. I ordered a side of egg and country potatoes and they were wonderful! I also had a slice of their chocolate silk pie and this was wonderful too. Overall I had a great experience, and everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Well hello newly revamped VI!! Very cute and modern. It moved it from 3.5 to 4 stars for that reason. I am not a person who is a fan of chains, more of a ma and pop type girl myself but when its done right, I've gotta give credit where its due. So I grabbed Easter brunch here because the other places I wanted to try was closed. 
I had the healthy banana stuffed, strawberry topped whole grain pancakes. Very good! I didn't need butter or syrup which is considered a victory in my book! My family had this and thats which they enjoyed as well. My cousin had a skillet which looked much better than what I had experienced at Crackers and Co the day before! My biggest complaints have to be the fact that they use Minute Maid oj and the coffee was awful!!!! Seriously could have been the worst coffee I ever tried to choke down!! But mmmm those pancakes! The server was friendly as well which made things better."}
{"text":"Went in to have dinner and got over looked by 3 waitresses and one manger,  never got helped for 10 minutes and left. I know restaurants can be busy but at least say hi to us. Won't go back. Went over to the Chinese restaurant across the street and had a great dinner. So I guess I can say thank you Village Inn for being bad."}
{"text":"Went here for coffee and a piece of pie after doing dome Black Friday shopping. Being that I am a big time fan of sweet deserts, I was looking forward to sampling some of their pie. I opted for the Oreo pie and my dining partners had the French Silk and the Carmel Pecan Silk Supreme. I decided to forgo the al a mode option because I a normally don't get ice cream when having cream style pies.

Overall the pie was just average. To be honest and this may sound harsh, but I liked the flavor and texture form Oreo cheesecake I have ordered from a popular fast food restaurant more than the cake I ate at Village Inn. The crust looked and almost tasted like the outer portion of an Oreo cookie, but was really dry and not quite there in the flavor department. The taste of the rest of the pie was just OK. The temperature was just about right and serving size was on par with most places I order pie from. On a good note, the coffee was very flavorful for a place that doesn't specialize in coffee and the waiter was kind enough to give us some of the flavored cremes.

Speaking of service, this was easily the best part of my encounter here. The waiter was really cool and explained all the different types of pies they serve. One of my dining partners wanted his pie without the pecans and the waiter made sure he received his pie per this request. He was very friendly and left us an entire jug of coffee so we always had our cups full. He came by a few times to check on us and provided excellent service. We were also greeted by the manager when we arrived and he also gave his regards as we were leaving. The girl as the cashier desk was also very kind and cordial.

The people I ate with enjoyed their pie and noted the great service too. I give the service 5 stars and rate my pie average. Keep in mind I eat out over 150 times a year and usually have high expectations when someone has hyped a place for their desert. Maybe I am being too harsh but I call them as I see it. Not sure if I will get a chance to write a follow-up because I was visiting Arizona during the holiday and would probably not go back here again even if I was in town. Too many other places to try and if I don't get my socks knocked off on a first visit when traveling, I give preference to trying new places."}
{"text":"Have not visited many Village Inn restaurants.   My new favorite place.  Supper clean.  Very pleasant greetings from the host to server.  Menus and food are fantastic.  The  \"Pies \" many choices wow !!!  Sorry \"IHOB\" you have lost one."}

{"text":"We went there the week they opened and they were okay for a chain.  After that it all spiraled downwards.  The last two times we had the same server (Stacy, I believe) forget the order after waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave us a free pie of our preference on free pie day.  The next time we were lucky enough to get her again, and she did not forget the order this time, but the drinks, besides that it took her a while before she got our drink order.  When we got our food she has her thumb inside the potatoes, and also holding a strip of bacon from my Sandwich,  My husband's open faced turkey dinner sandwich was okay, but the mashed potatoes were not cooked properly.  You know the instant mashed potatoes you get at the store?  This were those potatoes, without the liquid.  The flakes of potato were right there on my husband's plate.  After a second attempt, the potatoes were still very dry.  The manager dropped by and asked how our meal was to what we reply that they had a sad attempt at recreating mashed potatoes.  She was gracious enough to take his meal off the ticket, but the damage was already done.  Again, Stacy offered us a free pie of our preference (they only serve certain pies on Wednesdays, free pie day), to which we asked for just cherry pie (one of the free ones).  We decided not to go back to that one, even though it is around the corner of our home."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only averages 3 stars? Every time I've gone I've had great service and really good food! I absolutely love their eggs benedict with hash browns!"}
{"text":"I been trying to come here for almost 1 year. I was craving for some sweet stuff and they have  a good variety of pies. Oreo and my mom got the Pecan and caramel one. Good service, clean, and worth to try again!"}
{"text":"I was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair! 

Imagine you are out with your \"friends\" It's late OK very late or maybe early around 3am ish any way.. Your drunk and starving what do you do demand Waffle house or Jack in the Box! 

No such luck with this bunch, they pulled in to Village Inn. I am not a happy drunk at this point. I finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu. 

I decide on a patty melt with onion rings. I am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott. Then the food came and quickly I might add. 

Holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection. This was a damn good patty melt. I wanted to order another! I have been back 3 times since sober to get it and it is good. The onion rings I get with it are decent too. 

That is why they have a 5 star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get 4 snaps in a circle!

Damn Patty is like a monkey on my back now, Just gotta get my fix!"}
{"text":"First time here . We came for breakfast  and I have to say I had low expectations (think Denny's ) service & food was good . Prices were great . The kiddo menu was fan stadia Only complaint was the silverware was dirty . All 5 of us had a set of dirty (greasy) silverware . Coffee was tasty and came in a carafe so I never had to ask for a refill , that was awesome . We will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened, and hope it's a fluke. Not a clean table in the house. Food is taking forever. Saw people getting up and leaving from taking so long. No drinks on the tables. We come here about twice a month and have never seen it this bad. Not a familiar face here either. Where did all the good employees go?"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, normally for chicken strips since I wanted something different. Last time I was here I had a piece of pie and within minutes I ran to the bathroom and threw it all up. Something about it just made me feel sick."}
{"text":"All I can say is I'm very disappointed.  I had almost the exact same experience as I reviewed earlier about this location. Corporate management contacted me after the last review via email and I figured they would address the problem since the person seamed concerned about the review.  So I tried again yet got the same bad service.  I walked in, was seated immediately, the server took my order and brought the drink out promptly, all good so far.  The food came out with the check and the server vanished.  First, my order was not quite right but it was acceptable. Then my drink was empty.  I sat there for 20 minutes an no one checked on me or walked by. No drink refill, no table clearing.  I did hear her taking orders behind me at one of the 4 occupied tables but never even walked by mine. Once again, decided to just pay and leave.  So I stood at the counter for about 3 minutes waiting to pay contemplating just walking out.  The Asst. Manager ran out and apologized for the wait but at that point I'd had enough and a line had formed at the pie display.  I paid and left. I have NEVER not tipped but there was no way I was leaving any tip this time.  Sorry VI, I'm done and I don't recommend anyone visit this location."}
{"text":"Had a better time previously. They were out of almost everything from food to pies. The server took our straws because we did not use them fast enough. Server commented about having to work extra hours. Not the greatest time on Father's Day"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night tea and pie.
B Rating on wall. I understand why.
Service was a little slow to begin with.
One of the Pie plates was dirty with dry remains of previous customer. Enough said."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast.  They have a $6.99 breakfast deal, pick four entrees. I had a two egg omelet, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, and a 
yummy strawberry crepe. Very good!

Good standard fare and very predictable.  The servers are friendly and take good care of you.  Just a nice easy place to have a meal."}
{"text":"The server was super friendly. The food was decent. The major problem I had was the fact there wasn't many people in the restaurant and the host was MIA when we got in and when we went to pay.  Sadly I wish I could say it was the same host but it was 2 different hosts, just waiting a while to get to a table and then again to pay not my idea of fun. Was tempted to just walk out in the beginning and go to an ihop or dennys. Now don't get me wrong I don't mind waiting but 15 20 mins and seeing only a server?"}
{"text":"Oh Village Inn why do we love you? We love you because of pie, so many pies. So I walked in and I have never seen a Village Inn with so many people in it when it was not a Saturday or Sunday morning. Then I remembered it was free pie Wednesday. 

On free pie day with any entree purchase you get a free slice of any of the double crust pie, the special pie or coconut creme. 

I had Chicken fired steak with corn and stuffing. To be honest don't order this. The chicken fried steak reminds me of the kind you got at school from the lunch lady. The corn was cooked to death. The stuffing was fine. 

So you may ask why the 4 stars? Well I have had plenty of items that are good in the past and Pie. I had Peach Supreme that was great. 

So my server was very friendly and kept my tea refilled. She was working hard on a busy night. I would recommend her again. Nicole is her name. Also the manager came by to ask how everything was."}
{"text":"Village Inn is always consistent and very good!  The free pie is a wonderful treat.  Our server, Tracy, is the best!  She's very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"This newly remodeled location is absolutely delightful. I just relocated to phoenix and was pleased to have Village Inns. Definitely beats IHop or Denny's hands down."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was efficient and very friendly. My omelette was delicious. I highly recommend the village inn."}
{"text":"I wish they served fried chicken but I was told its southern thing. The wait staff is always nice here. I really come here for the pie which they push but don't have to. Anne the waitress is always polite and charming. Also this place won't bust your pocketbook."}
{"text":"Village in kicks ass all over Dennys. I won't eat at Dennys ever again if I can find a village in."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I ordered the breakfast platter that had a little bit of everything. Tasted okay, but I woke up that night with an awful pain in my stomach. I ran to the toilet and was met by my dinner from this place. I got food poisoning and could not eat breakfast food since. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Although this is a typical breakfast chain, the service is fantastic! From the hostess who seated us to the waitress that served us, their cheery disposition was much needed with this salty couple who just had terrible service and food at a place down the street that we refused to eat the food because the food was over done and cold at Lone Spur Cafe. The hostess noticed we looked a little sour and she asked us how we were doing and what was wrong. We told her of our experience and she and the waitress went above and beyond to make up for the other restaurants mistakes. Food came out hot and fast and everything was good. They even came out with a free piece of strawberry Hawaiian pie for us and told us to have a fantastic day. Now that is service!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Village Inn for years, and have never experienced such bad customer service from a manager.  Their system was down, and you can see the fustration in the manager's face. He was rude and even raised his voice. The way it was handled was very unprofessional. Waitress was great, but worst morning manager ever!!"}
{"text":"Honestly can say ive never had one bad meal here. Country fried steak skillet is my favorite.  Service is super amazing aswell its unreal. They treat you so good here. Village inn on 7th and bell, I love you."}
{"text":"Love this place! The waitresses are always so nice and the food is always good. Barely any wait time and the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I tried to think of positives, but honestly I won't be back. We had dinner -- perhaps this place is only good for breakfast. Our family of 5 tried it out.  The food was bad, the prices are high, and the service was poor.  To top it off, the waitress made a mistake on the bill. When I went to the register to pay and correct it,  they wound up making it more and had to change it back.  I was still being overcharged but the clerk said the computer wouldn't let them fix it. So i just paid more than I owed. Isn't that nuts? Two workers there complained that the computer system doesn't give them any options and locks everything down -- they were the only ones there (no management). I was polite and didn't complain, still tipped well, but walked away dumbfounded that they would knowingly have me pay for a billing error because the system doesn't allow any options."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a late lunch. We had to wait half an hour at 12:30 PM. We ordered our meal. I immediately had my doubts about our waitress, Denise. My suspicions proved to be true. It took a long time for our food! Denise wasn't very friendly or courteous towards us at all. She never checked back once to see how our meal was and if we needed any thing. We had to ask for refills on drinks, crackers, soups, etc. My friend finally told the manager we wanted pie and our waitress had never checked back with us. I went to the bathroom a few minutes later and told the manager the same thing again 5 minutes later. He them came rather coldly to our table to ask what kind of pies we wanted. My friend asked for coffee and pies to go. He was very abrupt and didn't thank us at all. This is the by far by worst Village Inn I've ever been to!!! I will never come here again and tell all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and stood for 3 minutes or more no hostess after another minute or so you can see hostess coming at the same time other customers walked up to pay for their meal she chooses to help them first without acknowledging me. I choose to leave"}
{"text":"Very disappointing burger. Overcooked and not biteable. You cannot bite into how big it is. Poor placement  grease everywhere. The bottom of the bun was as thin as a piece of paper. Just terrible impossible to eat. Waste of  $11"}
{"text":"The food is a bit better than Dennys and the pie selection is nice. They are always cool with my kiddo; he's delayed and sometimes can be a bit much to handle. But the inside is nice, seems newly decorated. I've been about five times and will surely go back. The chocolate silk pie is really really yummy."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better and cleaner village inns I have been to.  Every time I have gone for breakfast it has been great.  There really is no complaints...its a normal fill you up American breakfast!  Oh, and its cheap - always a plus!"}
{"text":"This location is very slow. I have been here since 10am it is now 10:32 and I have not received my food. We didn't get drinks till 10 minutes after we ordered. Haven't had service like this in a very long time."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's awful!  My boyfriend's father found a long hair in his breakfast skillet. Although the waitress offered to remake the meal, he didn't want anymore (for obvious reasons). When clearing our plates, the waitress told us that the cashier would remove his meal from the bill. However, when my boyfriend went to pay, the cashier called over our waitress who informed her to remove the charge. Apparently, the cashier couldn't do it, and so the manager was called over. He was very rude. He said, \"Since you wouldn't let us fix the problem, we'll go ahead and take it off your bill.\"  He further said, \"I don't know how that happened, because all of our cooking staff wear hairnets.\"

Anyway, I won't be returning to this VI ever again. (And based on how few other customers were there, I'm not alone.). And, I will be hesitant to go to any VI ever again. 

Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. I lost my appetite just seeing my boyfriend's father pull the hair from his food. This place ought to be shut down."}
{"text":"2/2 on going here when hungover... lol but its nice there.. no loud people because they have all yelled their lives away.... Food is pretty quick and good.. I got bananas in my pancakes and they actually make it in them and I did not know it until about half way thru.. good service tho."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to write about about poor customer service, but today I became so irritated that I feel compelled to.  I brought my family of seven to the Village Inn on Stapley and Baseline.  The wait time of 25 minutes was to be expected as it was a Sunday morning.  However, when we were called in, the hostess brings us to a small table with six chairs.  I let her know that wasn't going to seat seven of us and she suggested putting two tables together.  We took our seats and the waiter comes to ask us what we'd like to drink.  My husband and I ordered a coffee and the container he brought to us that held the creamer was completely dirty and covered in grits.  It clearly hadn't been washed.  At the moment, we didn't say anything.  

We continued to wait as all of us had figured out what we were going to order and by this time, an additional 25 minutes had passed before anyone even came to check on us.  Finally, our waiter comes to our table and we mention we didn't have silverware and he walks away.  He still hadn't taken our order! We noticed that several tables around us had their orders taken.  I don't understand how he continued to miss us since we were clearly in an area that he had to walk by several times.  Another waitress came by, Brittany, about 20 minutes later to take our order, which she did. Although she was very kind we asked to speak to the manager.  In the meantime, another 10 minutes goes by and no waiter or manager is anywhere to be seen.  Brittany comes back again and gets our silverware and asked if the manager had stopped by.  I let her know he hadn't and she leaves to go get him. By this time, over an hour has passed and we still hadn't received our food, our drinks hadn't been refilled, and people that were there after us had already received their food!  Finally, I see our waiter and I was able to get his attention. 

He comes over to ask if we need anything and I told him it's been over an hour and we still hadn't received our food and he looks at me and said, \"It's busy\".  I told him other people around us that got there after us and had already received his food.  He didn't even know what to say and I told him I wanted the manager.  Finally, the manager comes by and I explain that we'd been there an hour and a half, still hadn't been served, no refills, and our container was dirty.  He said he could adjust the bill and went to check on the order.  Another 15 minutes passes and by this time, I was so frustrated I told my husband and kids to grab their things and we walked out.  

I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but after an hour and a half, I couldn't deal with it anymore.  On top of that, their restrooms were dirty.  

The only thing that was decent was Brittany as she tried to step in and help out where she could.  For everyone else, it's clear that the food service industry is more than they can handle.  If you decide to go, hopefully you don't get the guy with the pony tail; he just doesn't know what he's doing.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Uninteresting. Not any different from Danny's or IHOP or similar. Tasted alright, was warm, relatively fast service. I do not know, what else would be there? I kind of was expecting something better then Danny's but was not really disappointed when it was not. It's alright, just do not expect anything special.

\"Its alright\"

{"text":"Always friendly service no matter who served us. Food had always been good, especially the bacon. Love the bacon."}
{"text":"Great staff and food!  The staff are so kind and often remember us.  Free Pie Wednesday is awesome!  Delicious food and pies!  Good varitey."}
{"text":"Standard Village Inn fare. The food will never impress unless you are impressed with consistency... but that is what you expect from a major chain. I've been eating VI since the first franchise outside Denver in Tampa opened. 
Two stars: I have to debate and convince myself to go to this location. It's never busy when I go.... but it seems as though I am always waiting.... waiting for hostess, waiting for server, waiting for cashier. 
I don't ever see any management managing so I'm assuming they are in the kitchen which is why I probably never wait for food. 
The servers always look like deer staring in the headlights.... for that I blame scheduling and dining room management which brings to mind.....SERVICE. Out of the last 4 visits I've walked out without being waited on twice. TWO STARS."}
{"text":"Good food and service,   food came out fast and a lot of food for the price.   We were seated right away.   And our drink order was taken.  I had the chicken fryed steak and eggs.  Came with hashbrowns and pancakes.  I could not finish it had to  some home."}
{"text":"Did not have the best experience there yesterday. We waited 15-20 minutes to get sat. It wasn't a big deal but people who came in right before we got sat were getting sat as we were standing next to our table, waiting for it to finished getting cleaned. Our service was a bit slow but not terrible. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out and when it did, some of it was overcooked. At the end when they asked how things were and my husband let them know about the food, the did take off one of the meals which was nice."}
{"text":"I was there this morning. Just left. I ordered a Ham and Cheese omelette with onions and asked it be stuffed because normally they mix everything in the egg when they beat it. Usually they are good sized omelettes. I asked for lots of cheese and ham. I thought it looked kind of thin, but tried a bite and instantly knew that it wasn't what I asked for. (please see photo). I showed the waitress and she said she would have it remade. I could hear her talking to the cook since I was sitting right by the kitchen entrance in a booth. I heard him complaining about having to remake it. I also heard her tell him the first time he wants lots of ham and cheese in the omelette. I'll pay extra to get what I prefer. I feel like he made the omelette in a sort of \"you'll get what I give you\" sort of way. I got up and left when I heard him complaining. I used to really like to go there for breakfast but I don't know now. Maybe that is the last time. Also, the hash browns were not even cooked, and not browned at all. This cook is either inexperienced or just doesn't care about what the customer wants. I thought good cooks took pride in their cooking? Guess not!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of one was because I've been to a different location (3rd and bell) and they were just fine. But I decided to try this place out and boy do I regret it. I ordered a build your own breakfast where you pick 4 different choices. I chose toast, English muffin, 2 eggs, and a strawberry crepe. Toast was burnt so that was disappointing. English muffin was the best part; not burnt and had a decent amount of butter on it. Egg yolks were extremely runny. And the crepe was thick and chewy. Customer service wasn't all that friendly either."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today just to get a $4 and some change chili to go Felicia took my order, keep in mind this was a to go order she seriously treated me like I was a dine in customer who ordered a high end steak, she went above and beyond making sure she got me sides and extra crackers (I'm pregnant and wanted chili) and just being so sweet, I think it's fair to say anyone who's worked as a server or in the service industry it's easy to ignore or not care about an order less than $5, I'm guilty of that but she made me feel so special and she's a great asset to you your restaurant, I came for a bowl of chili but next time I'll be coming for Felicia. Thank you again xoxo"}
{"text":"Gawd!!!! It's embarrassing to give a VI five stars but this one earned each star today!  

First, it was NOT packed and we got a table with no wait at 1100 on a Sunday morning.  Second, from the hostess to the manager to the cook who waved at me from the kitchen, EVERYONE was warm, friendly, polite, helpful, and dare I say, downright CHEERFUL.  Third, our server, Jennifer, was five star all the way... She was high class and high quality, WTF is she doing working at a VI?????  Oh yeah, she was making my freakin' day, that's what she's doing working at a VI!!!!  Thank you Jennifer!

So we really took note that while we thought we had the BEST WAITRESS EVER, that all the other waiters and waitresses were equally professional, cheerful, and efficient.  WOW!!!!  Again, at a VI??? 

I am perplexed, confused... VI was always a quick, semi-crappy meal with a tweaked out server and non-existent support personnel... But I must now confess that we will be back so see if we were delusional due to lack of sleep or if this is a whole new VI.

I haven't even talked about the food... Like the service, this was the best food we have ever had at a VI... double bacon skillet was phenomenal, fully loaded double cheeseburger was moist and flavorful... Pancakes, made the pancakes at Sear's in SF look silly, yeah, that yummy (at a dang VI!!!!!)!

We will be back, we will bring momma, looking forward to elation at the consistency or absolute disappointment... But today, five f-ing stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place! The staff is very patient and personable, and the menu has plenty of options for kids. Service is awesome, wait time is never too long, and the manager is usually checking in on the customers and helping out the servers. Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came with my parents to try the AYCE fish fry.  Jasmine was our waitress and she was awesome!  4 stars is because the fish and french fries were good but just warm when we got it.  There was no wait for the food.  I do believe they precooked the fish and fries in expectation of the Friday fish fry.  It was good but would have been great if it was fresh fried when we ordered it. The pies are Excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for an early breakfast with some friends. Waitress was pleasant and was so sweet replenishing our creamer as needed. Food was great and would reccomend the VIB. it has an endless selection of sides and main dishes to choose from. Cost was about $11 with tip."}
{"text":"Pros: large menu, reasonable prices, nice kids menu, nice waitstaff, and wonderfully tasting sandwiches

Cons: dirty booths, slow service"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, courteous servers, quick to take our order and the food was delivered fast. The place is clean, comfortable and the prices are good. The food was really good too! Diane is our favorite server and she remembers what we like to order even if we haven't been in for awhile."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast on a Wednesday. We were seated promptly, and then waited 10 minutes to even be acknowledged... Waitress said she would be right back 10 minutes later we finally got coffee. 35 minutes after arriving we finally got food... One plate was someone else's breakfast... When the second plate was brought... It was wrong. The waitress knew it was wrong and apologized... Do you want me to get another one? I replied no... I will eat it... Because we've been sitting here 45 minutes and I still haven't got my food. Told her I didn't think I should have to pay, and she agreed. Manager lady finally showed up put the bill on the table apologizes... And says I took your mail off the bill. No remorse... then we stood in line for 10 more minutes to pay the bill... Since you can't pay at the table. NEVER Going back... And management does not seem to care."}
{"text":"Prologue:
After having been somewhat disappointed with our decision to dine out for Thai cuisine on Christmas Eve, we decided to stick to something a bit more traditional for dessert.

The Plot:
We shared a piece of Chocolate Caramel Delight pie, a piece of Caramel Pecan Silk Supreme pie, and a cup of hot cocoa.

The Scene:
The portion sizes were good and just enough for the two of us.

My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed the Caramel Pecan Silk Supreme pie and I also agreed that it was the better of the two flavors we ordered. In fact, she enjoyed it so much that she purchased a gift card, which came with a $5 coupon, so she could order more pie to take home.

The hot cocoa was rich, not too sweet, and complemented the pie nicely.

The Rest of the Story:
This franchise is well known for doing a high volume pie business and they excel primarily in the area of variety. In order to offer their product at a reasonable price, their pies are apparently mass produced off site. Although the quality of the pie was good, I cannot confidently say that it is well above what can be found at other similar franchises, especially when it comes to the crust. Neither of the two pieces of pie we were served looked much like what was depicted in the menu, which is usual and quite understandable. Never the less, I was still expecting a larger portion from a restaurant that specializes in pie, especially on a major holiday.

Epilogue:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable.
My girlfriend was happy with the way we concluded our evening and that was good enough to make me happy and satisfied.

{"text":"Went there for dinner the other day. Absolutely terrible service, my friend and I waited about 15 minutes before the waitress even came to get out drink order. And that was the only time she even came by to our table as well. Food was alright, what you would expect from a brunch stop. The cashier was rude as well, and the lack of service alone will keep me from returning to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim Sunday at about noon. Yeah!! Breakfast served all day. Michelle was our server- great job and service with a smile. 
I ordered Reuben burger on rye and my husband had the tres huevos rancheros with scrambled eggs. Both orders had a ton of flavor. The Reuben burger combo (changed bread from a bun to rye per my request- worked great and added to the flavor) was a home run. The coleslaw side was also very good and added a nice cool and creamy component. 
We also split a piece of caramel chocolate pie- very nice follow up to our meal. 
Yes I understand this is a diner type restaurant chain (?) but for a decent go-to place for a good tasting meal, The Village wins out. We will certainly go back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and spend your money else where. Easy pass on this place. Servers were rude. Order was wrong. Food was marginal at best. They didn't even clean off our table when there was pie all over from the bottom of my food (It wasn't even my pie?!) just left it there. Definitely will not be back. Saving a few bucks on a free slice is not worth the experience. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wed. For free pie with meal. Needn't have bothered, pumpkin pie was gluey tasting. 

Waitress had an attitude which nobody likes... I ordered BLT with crispy bacon, what I got was crispy overdone fries! Who orders crispy fries?

Wish I had skipped this visit."}
{"text":"We have visited this location several times. Each time the food has been good and prepared exactly as ordered.

The wait staff could be a little more attentive and follow-up more often. Maybe some day individuals will realize when you are extremely attentive to your customers and check up often not only does the business benefit, your tips increase drastically. To me stellar customer service can mean the difference between me giving you a 10% tip to instead me giving you a 30% tip. I don't do the in between stuff. Either you are a great waiter/ress and get my best tip or you aren't and get a basic tip.

Village Inn has superb pies. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, is OMG crazy, insane, over the top, beyond stellar, out of this world, superb good. If I only could have 1 pie choice for the rest of my life, this bad boy nails it 10 out of 10 times. The strawberry rhubarb is pretty good. The banana cream is decent.

The Friday all you can eat cod is pretty good and nice size filet size, and great flavor, not greasy at all. The $12.99 price vs IHOP $8.99 price is night and day in quality, flavor. IHOP is completely saturated with grease to the point where when you bite into it the grease sprays out all over. Now it isn't anywhere near the best fish fry I have had, but for the price it is 100% fair and well worth it. The coleslaw however at both places is very dry and very bland."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the breakfast menu. It was excellent. Had the corned beef hash with two eggs hash brown potatoes and three pancakes. All tasted great. First time a waitress ask how I wanted my corned beef hash cooked. I usually have to ask it be  cooked well done. Excellent service and happy pleasant employees at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good is usually good but haven't been seated yet to try it. They have a room full of people standing to be seated, there are 12 tables open but they are NOT seating people stating they are waiting for the kitchen to catch up! That's just dumb it's better to at least seat people than to have them standing to wait!!! Poor management !!"}
{"text":"This location was by far the worst breakfast I've ever had. The waters came out with no ice or lemons. I should have taken that clue as to how it was going to go. Food took over 30 minutes to come out. Four out of the five meals were cold. When we asked for new ones they came back out after being heated. Re-sent them back again because we told them we wanted new and waitress had the audacity to bring out the same French toast again. My meal was not fully cooked the third time it came out. Do not visit this establishment."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time, and I was not impressed. The salad was damn near rotten, I asked for another one, and this one was semi rotten. The pot pie was over cooked and tasted funny. I ended up throwing away half of my meal. I do not plan on coming back. The service was ok, but average."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Did not receive refills or second servings for the all you can eat fish.  Left after waiting over 15 minutes for more fish.  Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Same boring menu as Denny's and IHOP with surprisingly worse food. Worse than Denny's? Yes! I think it's in the way they prepare their food because it always leaves me feeling sick like I ate an entire stick of re-fried butter. I haven't been impressed with anything on the menu including the lunch and dinner. If you want a good breakfast make it yourself instead of coming here. Even if your best breakfast skills are a bowl of cereal."}
{"text":"This time was a disaster !!! We do like Village Inn for most of their items, but \"Not a happy camper this time\".  I ordered chicken noodle soup (1 piece of chicken in the whole bowl) which by the way was $3.70.  I had to ask for crackers, butter, etc the butter never did come.  I also ordered side of potatoe pancakes (AWFUL) is putting it mildly, I bet the cook NEVER made these before !!! they were half way cooked and not sure really what they were supposed to be just hash browns, eggs and batter.  Served almost cold......HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE !!!!

Waiter said they were short staffed \"What\" 5:30-6:00 PM on a Monday evening???\" why were they short staffed.....Not a good sign at all !!!"}
{"text":"Went in at prime dinner time NOONE was there \"Red Flag\", New item \"Chicken Artichoke on a bed of rice (no) the rice is considered a side dish \"WOW\" $11.99 Really??? oh well, chicken way overdone, dish soaked in butter/lemon sauce 
 no lemon taste at all and butter wasn't really - real butter it was like that oiled butter \"for popcorn\" yuck !!! Well what took the cake was NO one cared...Well we care, and we definitely WON'T BE BACK !!!

SIDE NOTE:  The Denny's across the street \"New management, New decor and New chef GREAT FOOD NOW !! A MUST TO TRY"}
{"text":"Because my elderly father loves this place, we come. Course, he is blind and can't see what I have to see. The coffee pitcher hasn't been washed in God knows how long. The table has stains on it. The waitress's forced niceness is just so obvious. The maple syrup container is disgusting and the food itself is subpar at best. All I can say is old people keep this place going. Sigh"}
{"text":"This location I have visited twice and even though the service last time was excellent, the service this time was just okay. The server although he was friendly took a long time to get our drink and breakfast orders which was unusual because you figure that if the server sat you himself he would have taken the drink order faster! Anyway the food is average but well above average of other breakfast places like Denny's or IHOP. I am sure the service will be better next time but for right now this location still earns that rating."}
{"text":"Food and service are wonderful, must try on pie Wednesday's.  Ask for beanie she is the best server! Unfortunately due to my lactose intolerance i am unable to enjoy most of the items without suffering from constant diarrhea.  The chicken fried steak is"}
{"text":"We go to this location often but the last couple of times we found the manager incredibly rude (assume he's the manager, works the register, large hispanic man?).  The servers are wonderful and the food is usually really good.  We will be going to the 40th street location now as the manager there is very nice.  
There USED to be a really nice manager at the 310 E Bell location. Wonder what happened to him.  This new guy is not the person to be in such a front-line position."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant was greeted by the manager was told that there would be a 30 minute wait and we could visibly see there was nobody in front of us waiting the way she was talking was like she was trying to talk us out of eating here we waited for 30 minutes and then 45 minutes and finally got seated to a table ordered our drinks that took 20 minutes to get to our table and waited to order no waiter or waitress ever came manager was walking around doing nothing tried to get her attention numerous times and she would completely avoid us by this time we have been here over a hour and a half and barely have 2 drinks with no order to put in, place was not even crowded or busy. Manager had a bad attitude and finally came and said sorry I only have one waiter nothing I can do and walked away. We waited a additional 10 minutes still no body came. We couldn't believe this. This was my wife's and I first time here and now our last
We got up from the table and waited at the counter to pay for our drinks and leave 
Still nobody in sight. Manager looked at me and walked to the back. We decided we were not playing these childish games and left sorry to the owner to walk out on a cup of soda and orange juice we tried to pay for it and got completely ignore by your management. We couldn't even order food. This was absolutely the most crap service I have ever seen. What a shit show being run there avoid at all cost
Place is terrible will never return again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints. I was seated immediately and the waitress was very helpful. I wanted to order a omelette but I wanted to do some substituting. She advised to take a look at this new selection called \"My Incredible V.I.B\". You get 4 selections of 30 menu items for $7.95. I got a 2 egg cheese omelette, 2 scrambled eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage. It was cheap and filling. The soda refills were never asked for just brought. Really happy with the service. Food was 3 stars but service was a clear 5. 4 seems a little high but the service was that good."}
{"text":"I think nostalgia is really the reason we eat here from time to time. My grandma liked it, despite all the reasons not to. Tonight (and every time) the service is slow, drinks are left empty, the food is warmish (if you're lucky), everything tastes processed/packaged, and it is overpriced. Considering you can also get all day breakfast at IHOP and Black Bear Diner, there is no reason to eat here. Do the sensible thing and use Village Inn only for holiday pie orders."}
{"text":"Great place for many meals.  Breakfast is a real bargain and they do NOT skimp on food portions.  Pie Rush Wednesday are amazing, and their early bird dinners INCLUDE pie...seven days a week!  Staff is friendly and it's just a good bargain for the money.  Take your out of town company for a great and inexpensive breakfast!"}
{"text":"I do love Village Inn!!!


We go to village inn on a regular basis because it is one of the few breakfast places around. I was always a fan of Ihop because of the pancakes but Village Inn is much better. You don't have to order a side of anything because most of the meals already come with it, (side of hash browns with your omelet at Ihop does not exist unless you pay for it!). They also have great pie!! I love the chocolate truffle, it is a seasonal pie so I tend to buy a whole one and freeze it but when it is there it is a must have. The staff is friendly and good at what they do. The restaurant is always clean as well as the bathrooms. I feel village Inn's are underrated these days, and I may be old in spirit so that is where my joy of village in comes in, but in the end it is great. :)"}
{"text":"When Thanksgiving rolls around and we have been nominated to bring the pies, I come here. A quick phone call to pre-order the pies (to ensure they have enough on hand) and a stop on the way home home from work the day before guarantees that we will show up with (almost) the best food of the bunch."}
{"text":"The scene:
Its stylish, clean and new. They've been up and running under a year. 

The service:
Super nice and right on top of everything. If our waiter wasn't on it, another one was right there to take care of it. 

The food:
Definitely inexpensive (4 items at $7) You can get a good, filling meal for two people easily under $20. Mine came out a little cold, but it was tasty. It was also out fairly quickly. 

Overall:
We'll be back, they took good care of us and its a great late night stop (open til 12am)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Village Inn and being back in Glendale, it's nice to have one near me.  And by near me, I mean about two blocks down the road.  This location was the same one I had my graduation dinner after high school.. yeah I know.  big spender.

We decided to go for breakfast on Sunday morning.  Showed up and as expected there was a large crowd.  Mostly older people and a few young families.  This place is kinda cool cause you can see that the staff has worked there for many years.. kinda reminded me of the old Smitty's restaurants.  Remember those?

What i ordered for breakfast was an iced tea and an omelet with a side of cakes.  I decided on the California omelet.  I really didn't like it.  not because the eggs were bad or anything was not cooked or anything.  It had onions and I'm a huge onion hater. By onion, i mean the large slab slices.. not sauteed or anything.  Along that was cooked spinach.  Yeck.   

Doesn't change me eating there.  This place is still great, I just will get something else next time. :)"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and experience, the service is above average but not excellent. I've been to this location a few times and the food is always good, good quality coffee and you definitely get more bang for your buck here compared to other comparable restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this VI. I come here every weekend almost. It's always nice and quiet, no hectic rowdy chickens with their heads cut off like other locations. I usually order a vib and everything is always made quickly and tastes great. Friendly service and great food. This location is nice and quiet. :)"}
{"text":"So Ive been here before for pies that I love! But came for brunch. I have to say I was not impressed at all. We were seated immediately which was good, but we were seated right where the staff come in and out which honestly was not even an issue but my goodness they were busy and you could hear and see the staff in the back goofing off and cussing throwing things at each other which even still is whatever to me, but our waiter he came got our drink order and didn't come back for like 10-15 mins drops drinks off takes our order and bails then about 20mins later we get our food and it's was warm at best. It was just not a good experience and I probably would not eat here again but I'll still come for pies"}
{"text":"Just walked in for some pie and my waitress Veronica is awesome! I've been here a lot and I can say from experience that the service has just gotten better and better"}
{"text":"The food here is not bad and it can be a great value. But what we are really impressed with is the service. Kimberly is seriously the best waitress My wife and I have ever seen on planet earth. And I'm 54 years old and we eat at a lot of restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this location has only 3 stars with Jacob working there. My daughter and I just went in for National Pi day and Jacob was patient, polite, and super enthusiastic!! He looked like he could run this place as an army of one! We were both super impressed by his positive attitude and could hear him encouraging his fellow staff members. This was by far the best Village Inn experience ever. We are used to visiting the 3rd St. and Bell location but decided to switch it up. If you live by here or are planning a visit definitely ask to be seated in Jacob's section his positive vibes will surely rub off on you and absolutely make your morning/day/night. Next time we are needing a sweet tooth craving we will drive the extra distance to this location it was well worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit awkward to get into from Thunderbird Rd. There is only one entrance. I went on a Wednesday (free slice of pie day). The waitress is supposed to ask you which kind you'd like--my waitress didn't. Had to ask up at cashier. The second time I went, which was this past Wednesday, the waitress did ask and included the amount of the 2 slices of pie on the bill. The cashier charged me for them and had to call the manager over to correct the mistake. For someone that is not familiar with this procedure one could wind up paying $7.98 for the 2 slices of pie. The bathroom was disgusting--needs a good overhaul and cleaning. The food is way over priced and is not that tasty. French toast with bananas and strawberries should not be $10 and the 2-2-2 breakfast should not be $8-9. Coffee is lousy and is $2.49 even though the pot is left there. Never coming back again. Yuck."}
{"text":"Decent diner food with tasty pies.  It's kind of like a more upscale version of Denny's, but with more selection.  I like to come here on Pie Rush Wednesdays, where you can get a free slice of pie with dinner purchase.  They currently have a seasonal Hawaiian strawberry pie that is pretty tasty!  As for their breakfasts, generally I've been pretty satisfied with their skillet meals."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Between the 4 of us we had a corned beef hash and eggs, french toast, lemon artichoke chicken with pilaf, and the Inn VIB.
Service was excellent. From the hostess to the waiter to the pie lady. We went around lunch on a weekday.
The lemon artichoke chicken was actually really good. So was the hash. The pies looked amazing so we took a key lime cheesecake to go.

Only bad thing would be the soggy fruit."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good.  My first time was at 1 in the morning. Stopped in to do some homework.  Waitress was very attentive since I was the only one in there.   Coffee is pretty nice. One time I did find a little something in coffee cup but you'll find that once in a while anywhere. Some breakfast portions are small but nothing too bad."}
{"text":"It was okay I wouldn't rate it the best. Ihop is better. Reasonable price. The employees need to be more smiley. They kinda look like \" I hate my job kill me\" I mean we all hate our jobs lol sometimes but why show it. The has brown are mushy not good. I only ate the too that was crispy."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience. The manager said it was a 10 - 15 wait but she should've said it was an hour. We didn't have an hour to wait with our 8 month old. A couple that came in 20 min after got seated before us. When we finally got seated we waited almost 10 min and still no server came to get our drink order. I finally had enough so I went to speak with the manager and she said she was on her way to get our drink order. She got our drink order but she never came back with our drinks. Unbelievably horrible service from the manager. The server had been double seated so she needed the manager to help out but didn't. We ended up leaving and got pie to go and the manager gave us 30% off. Hopefully next time she knows not to tell customers it's a 10 minute wait when it more like a 45 min wait and hopefully next time when she takes a drink order she comes back with the customer's drinks."}
{"text":"Always great service! Never have to ask for a refill and when I'm home sick my honey gets me some soup to go."}
{"text":"The cheesecake with strawberry topping and the coconut cream pie are AMAZING. I ordered them to take to my parents house yesterday. I called ahead and explained that I couldn't come inside because I have a medically fragile child with me in the car along with my other babies. The general manager, Sarah, was extremely accommodating and kind! She came all the way outside, took my payment and then gave me my order. She was so sweet! I really appreciate her kindness and understanding!"}
{"text":"Staff is inattentive and unprofessional. If you come in with a child don't expect to be waited on immediately, or have your drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Three stars only because the service was bad and the coffee was lukewarm. I enjoyed the food and it was a good value."}
{"text":"Need to bring back the Ham Steak or we aren't coming back. We have eaten here for years. The half of order that you exchanged it with an up charge isn't half the size as the previous one. We will pay more. Let the consumer decide."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Village Inn! I was craving some diner food for breakfast, and the Classic Eggs Benedict with hash browns really hit the spot! Our server was attentive, and our food came out quickly. I look forward to going back for lunch or dinner, so I can try the pie."}
{"text":"Wonderful people. Got here around 7:30pm no coconut pie or banana cream pie. But this young lady offered to make one for us ... we were very happy with the pie .. will come back :)"}
{"text":"Got seated within 3 minutes on a Wednesday night pie night. That's pretty good especially with all the snowbirds in town. Waitress Joanne greeted my daughter and I with a smile and was very courteous. She checked on us often and was back to ask which free pie we would like with a smile again. I could see she was very busy with other tables but took her time to come back often. The manager stopped by and asked how our food tasted which was nice. 
I mostly order breakfast here.  My omelette with pancake and hash brown tasted very good and so did the VIB meal my daughter ordered. 
I definitely give  5 gold stars for the waitress Joanne tonight!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once a few years ago and I remember the food being pretty good. I really love their pie's though. Bought one last night (Chocolate Silk) and their pies are always good. They are made fresh daily and kept in a glass cooler so you can view them. Absolutely no complaints about the quality or taste. I was greeted very quickly by the manager to take my order. One thing I did find out was that they can sell out very quickly of certain pie's, so if there is one that you want, you can place an order online and have it that day if you order in the morning, or the next day for pick up."}
{"text":"I'm glad I'm not the only one that has observed sub-standard flair from this location, management is piss poor and doesn't get it, now they won't get my business. 

I ate there in December with family and the experience was that of a very \"OFF\" operation, nobody to sit you, the front was totally bare, 2 members of the wait staff walked around and served their customers while my party and several others just waited around, a manager that was no where to be found who should have been observing what was going on but was in the back room probably surfing the internet. 

Food was overcooked, 3 orders of Eggs Benedict may have well been hard boiled and the sauce had turned, the one order they got right or got it close to being right was the simplest, eggs scrambled with cheese, whomever came up with the idea that you cook it, drop it on a plate and sprinkle the cheese over it and hope that it melts needs to have their cooking spoons taken away but it was tolerable. 

Made a few comments to the manager at that time, she was apologetic, I gave them another chance, they blew it again, Sunday morning, busier restaurant, staff met us at the door, sat us and we waited, and waited and waited, watching the waiter from our section walking around the parking lot was a lot of fun while we waited. Finally a waitress came over and got our drink order, could have shown up with water then taken our drink order but it didn't go that way, a few minutes later and we're still waiting, finally some coffee, water, other drinks and she walks away, HEY WE'RE READY TO ORDER, I know she hears it, I'm boisterous at that point, no difference, we wait some more. 

Fast forward to the food, everything cooked wrong or entire orders are wrong or in one case it has to go back and before finally throwing in the towel and telling the waitress cancel the re-order, everyone is done but one person who didn't end up eating because for some reason it takes longer to cook a medium rare steak than the well done one they delivered or maybe the eggs were still being scrambled. 

I called the manager over, advised her of everything that transpired, pointed out her employee was back in the parking lot walking around, talking on the phone and smoking to which her response was oh he's on break, 3 times in the last 30 minutes... wow I wanna work here you don't have to do anything! 

Food = Crap
Service = Crap 

This is not indicative of the chain but this location = CRAP !!! 

Hope they manage to turn it around or there will be another closed food location in Litchfield Park!"}
{"text":"I like the wait staff here.  They seem to be pretty good at what they do.  The chef is pretty accommodating for my special orders as well."}
{"text":"I have been saying I want to eat here almost every other week for the last year when we drive by it. All I could imagine was a nice home cooked meal at a restaurant. Well I got that out of my system. My bf loved his meal. he ordered a breakfast entree and french toast he really liked it. I ordered grown up grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was ok, nothing special. My grilled cheese came out black. TBH I should have sent it back but I didnt. I tried to eat it but it was tasteless. All I could taste was the burnt toast. Like I said i should have sent it back but also not sure why a cook would think it was ok to serve that. Or the server."}
{"text":"I used to work here in high school and thought the food was amazing then - but boy my taste buds must have changed. Or the food really got that much worse.
I was getting my car worked on across the street and while I was waiting figured I would stop into my old stomping grounds for some breakfast.
I ordered off the V.I.B. - strawberry crepes, eggs, hashbrowns and sausage. A dish I always used to get. 
I never add extra salt or pepper to my food after getting it unless it ABSOLUTELY needs it. In this case I was very happy I didn't because the eggs tasted like they were FILLED with salt. They weren't even edible.
The sausage was cold when I got it.
The hashbrowns were SOAKED with butter. Yes, I know they are made with butter - but this amount was dripping off every undercooked bite I tried to eat.
The crepe - I was really looking forward to this. But last time I checked, you don't need a steak knife to be able to cut your crepe. It was so rubbery I could barely chew it. In addition to that - whatever they cooked the crepe on they clearly didn't bother cleaning. My strawberry crepe tasted like it had been cooked in the same pan as onions and peppers. No thanks.
I also dislike that the server puts your check on the table the second you get your food, but whatever, some places do that."}
{"text":"We went to this village inn because the pies looked so good but didn't expect much from it. But I have to say it was GREAT, clean and very friendly staff.it looks like the whole place was just remodeled  so the inside looks MUCH better than the outside. We loved the food, it was fresh and very delicious. And the pies were AWESOME best pie EVER!!!! We WILL go back soon :) I totally recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and was told to go to the bank to get my own change I would not recommend going there due to poor policy's was with large group would not recommend"}
{"text":"My last visit to this restaurant was on 12/4/15.  This is not a typically Village Inn.  It is located near the Walmart shopping plaza, connected to an AT&T store and Elecktic Pie (another personal favorite).  It can be difficult to see from the street, since it is not look like an average Village Inn.  With that being said, I enjoy coming here.  I have never waited long to be seated, and there are usually guest seating down eating their dinner.  The wait staff and managers are helpful, personable, and knowledge of the menu.  I usually get breakfast - french toast - but I decided to go a more health route and decided to try the Garden Veggie Omelette with a English Muffin instead of the pancakes, and a side of hash browns.  The meal was warm when served at the table, pippin' hot, fluffy eggs, and loaded with veggie goodness.  The English muffin was already buttered, but I feel it had to much on since the butter was dripping down onto the plate making the bottoms soggy.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly.  My son ordered from the children's menu: half a Belgium waffle with fruit.  Since it was Friday, the other adult at the table ordered Fish Fry which came with french fries and coleslaw.  We all decided to get a piece of pie, and I ordered the seasonal peppermint french silk which was delightful."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and not our last!  We were greeted promptly and seated right away.  The menu is large enough for everyone to choose a item.  The food was fresh and hot when it arrived.  The GM stopped by as well and talked with us, which made us feel welcomed.  We'll be back for lunch/dinner so we can try the pie!  Keep up the good work.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast, lunch place.  Haven't tried dinner here.  Great place for lunches, nice to purchases pies to go.  Large selection for breakfast.  Crowed on Wednesdays due to \"free slice of pie day\" with any order. Delicious pies!"}
{"text":"The food is good and if it's wrong they are very good at fixing it! I absolutely adore Kaylee! She always has a smile on her face and takes great pride in making sure your experience is a fabulous one!"}
{"text":"Wanted to find a place that was open Christmas Eve after some last minute shopping to grab some dinner. Was headed to the Chili's in this parking lot when we noticed Village Inn had plenty of cars around it. I'm glad we stopped by! They had a holiday turkey or ham special for under $10 with delicious thick sliced turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, biscuit, and cranberry sauce except they ran out before we got there so we went without. It also came with a slick of pumpkin pie at the end that was wonderful, not too sweet or spicy. The service was on point. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I tend to gravitate towards the old style, mom and pop, greasy spoons for breakfast and steer clear of the chain restaurants. This Village Inn is an exception. It's been here a while, some workers have been there for 15 years and know their customers. It's well kept, clean and friendly. Did I mention the food is actually good? This place has steady business for a reason. My only complaint is wifi only allowed me to upload 10% of my YouTube video. I think I'll survive."}
{"text":"Just what you'd expect, and maybe a little more. Decent food - even for people with food allergies. Very good service - fast and friendly. No matter when we go, it's always very busy, but we always walk right in too. 
There's a reason this chain diner is always packed...."}
{"text":"We come here quite often on saturday mornings. The food is good and the servers are always friendly and fast. My only real complaint is there is always 10 families/couples waiting for a table and there are 20 open tables..... its the weekend,  plan on having a few more servers working so customers don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Pie was amazing waitress was very sweet we had Bobbi jo and she was great!! On the other hand the assistance manager Trinda was very rude the way she talked to us and her employees..."}
{"text":"To be fair the service is awesome during the day! But come 5 6 or 7 at night this place is no good! At night the service is so bad!!! Once the manager goes home the rest of the staff is in la la land!!! It's so sad and we give it more then one try at night! Man waiter is rude. Old lady cashier is slow and rude!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints here. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Service was polite and quick. And of course the pie is a must have when you stop in."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is what makes this place the one we choose time and time again! Be sure to ask for James. He is an exceptional server, very friendly and personable, extremely attentive, and has great smile!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a handful of times, and its an okay place.  It's not a trendy resturant, nor is it the best food you will ever eat.  Its tasty enough to scarf down and walk away feeling full.

The service here was okay, and they have a decent menu with decent prices as well.   Not bad, just not the greatest."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** September 2, 2017
So I ended up giving this place another chance. And I've actually been back here about three times. I figured that the best time to eat at a restaurant is right after something like the incident below. And I was right. This place is filled with good employees and good management and they have loyal customers. As I figured, they addressed the issue right away. The place is clean and neat. And they are busy as ever. 

June 2017
So I actually eat at this Village Inn restaurant location quite often. Village Inn hasn't been my first choice to go for breakfast in the past but this one is close to me and I started to go there in the mornings before work. It took a while for me to get to know the staff and for them to know me. It was just a close/convenient place to eat for me that's it. You can tell the building is old and seriously needs to be updated. But yesterday was the clincher for me. I don't think I can go back. 
I went in with my nephew as he needed me to sign some paperwork for him and I thought we could do it over breakfast. After we sat down and ordered, a couple of ladies were seated next us and we figured they would order soon but instead they asked to see the manager. The younger lady's eyes kept looking at the wall. They were right next to us so we could hear what she was saying. She said to the manager \"We were going to eat here but then we saw that.\" She pointed to the wall. The wall next to their booth was a bit dirty you know like fingerprint smudges, so we looked at ours it was the same. Then I looked back at theirs and it saw the COCKROACH that she was pointing at! The manager apologized and the ladies left.
We had already ordered and our food was about to come out. We watched as the little guy kept moving about on the wall and on to the table! I felt uncomfortable but our food was about to come out. So when our food came out, I asked the server to move us because the thing was still there. 
I know you're thinking why didn't you just leave?!
Well we were there for breakfast and also to sign paperwork and we hadn't don't either yet and there wasn't enough time to go somewhere else as I had to be at work soon. And our food just came out and I'm not THAT big of a jerk. 
They comp'ed our meal obviously. We ate, signed the paperwork and left. 
The staff for the most part is very nice. But that building is old and desperately needs to be remodeled. And they definitely need to make sure that it gets sprayed better for bugs. 
The reason I'm writing this review is that hopefully it gets done soon. They have alot of regulars who've been going there way longer than I have and they deserve a better atmosphere to eat in."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is generally good as well.  Sometimes gets pretty busy and there can be a wait."}
{"text":"It was very nice to have a Friday night fish fry at Village Inn. It did take a few minutes for the refill to come the first time. But, we learned that a cook had walked out that moment. They recovered very nicely.

Honestly, I think Village Inn has the best french fries I've ever tasted! They have the skin on and are seasoned perfectly."}
{"text":"I would give less than one star if I could. Came in and various tables were available. Had a large party so expected to wait longer than normal . told the hostess we would accept two tables instead of one large one but she kept giving out all the tables. Waited about 30 minutes, finally got seated. Waited another 40 minutes from the time we sat down for the food to come and various missing items. Waited even longer for silverware! Waitress never checked on us again. Horrible experience! I live right up the street and I will never come back again!

After complaining to manager Donna,she was more than accommodating!amazing manager."}
{"text":"Very dirty, only had a handful of people working. Our server was really nice, the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around. You do not feel just like a customer here. Jen, Samantha, and Shelly are the best hands down. If you are looking for great food and service come to this Village Inn!!"}
{"text":"We buy pies from them every Thanksgiving if we are in town.  They often call us to see if we want pies before Thanksgiving - no that is proactive! The pies are great - especially the chocolate pie!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Food and service has always been good. Even bought a whole pie to take home as well."}
{"text":"We go here all the time because they have great breakfast food. We typically don't have issues but 1/4 of the time our servers have not been very attentive, especially towards the end of the meal. Half the time we want pie and no one comes back after they have placed the check on the table. A couple times we have had to eithe ask another waitress or go up to the register with our food and ask for a box because we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for her to come back. And it was free pie Wednesday!  We typically don't go that day, so we were expecting to be asked what kind of free pie we wanted. Instead, we lost the waitress and has to ask the front cashier, while my leftovers were in hand."}
{"text":"If you are seated in Connor's section, ask to be reseated. He will give your food away to other people, his order accuracy is awful. The restaurant was dirty, not an appealing place to visit. I would highly recommend that you not visit this restaurant and pick another Village Inn restaurant for your dining pleasure."}
{"text":"When I ate here yesterday it was my worst \"dining out\" experience of all time.  Then I went out to eat tonight, so we will say second worst dining out experience of all time.

We were greeted by a very lethargic and disinterested hostess.  She took us to a booth about 3 feet from the door.  I think it was because she was too tired to walk any further.  Her voice was barely audible, zero eye contact, and a thuggish-looking boyfriend? of hers (definitely not an employee) was hanging out behind the counter waiting for her to come back.  

Our waitress then came along and asked what we wanted to drink before our butts even hit the crappy booth seats.  We both looked at her blankly because we are not \"Diet Coke\" drinkers.  We liked a variety of beverages and wanted a moment to think.

She left and came back at least 10 minutes later.  Okay, I wanted to glance at the drinks before I ordered - not memorize the menu.

She was one of those waitresses that thinks you are college buddies.  She tried to take our order without writing it down.  She failed.  She asked a person passing by, \"Do you have a pen?\"  Then she laughed and said, \"Yeah, I can't remember this.\"  Then she repeated our order back to us - wrong.  

Our food came out in a pretty timely manner.  Too bad it was GROSS!

Husband's:  Grease-dripping, flavorless hamburger.  Cold fries that tasted like mashed potatoes with nothing on them.  

Mine:  Tomato basil soup so old that the oil had separated from the soup.  The grilled cheese I had asked for without bacon came out WITH bacon.  She caught that.  Said she would have them remake it because it only takes a minute.  It came back out MOMENTS later - cold and with little bits of bacon stuck to it.  How convincing!

As we were leaving the hostess came over in a timely enough manner, but then literally FELL ASLEEP while she was ringing us out.  Her eyes closed and she was swaying.  She opened them and APOLOGIZED, saying she was \"so tired.\"  Again, barely audible.

Food:  Awful.
Service:  Awful.
Professionalism:  Awful.
Cleanliness:  Awful.
Overal experience:  Awful.  

$30 for dinner for two.  Seriously?!"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service with a smile.  The food is somewhere, I'd say, better than IHOP.  Not super great, but definitely delicious.  They actually had three or four different brews, which was a surprise.  Other than that, not much different than the chain breakfast places, just a little better."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning and it wasn't anything to write home about. I had the ultimate which had pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns. My eggs were way overcooked,  serving of hash browns were the size of a 50 cent piece, bacon was really undercooked and really greasy and the pancakes were just OK. My husband had the chicken fried steak with extra gravy, hash browns, eggs and pancakes. He said the chicken fried steak was VERY good, but his eggs were overcooked and the serving of hash browns were the same as mine - 
dry and hard. How does that even happen?! We asked the waitress for new eggs and she brought new eggs with no questions asked. We dealt with the rest. I will say the coffee was really good!! They bring a pot to your table so you don't need to wait on refills. The total bill for 2 people for 2 breakfasts' and 2 coffee's was around $33.00 without tip. A little too expensive for subpar food if you ask me."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Gina, was great. She kept refilling my water which is RARE at diners. Normally your server gives you 2 refills and then they disappear. I ordered a California Benedict. The egg should've been slightly runny (it was fully cooked). The sauce was \"ok\". The pie was great and our overall experience was great. 
Thanks Village Inn. :)"}
{"text":"Poor Service

Just there on Wednesday night and the service was terrible.  Took long to get our drinks...longer to get our food.  Dinner was missing items and no waitress to check on us.  We had to raise our voices just to get a refill, napkins, and the missing items!  Food was good once we got it.  Won't be going to this Village Inn again!"}
{"text":"Food- I got a reuben that came with soggy bread, fries were decent. My girlfriend had the country fried steak skillet which tasted really strange- the steak tasted like breakfast sausage and was very crumbly. We normally love country fried steak but something was off. Our friend had the chicken avocado and Swiss sandwich which was decent.

Price- The aforementioned order with 3 free slices of pie (a Wednesday promotion) and a drink was about 35 dollars.

Service- We started with Brandon as our server, he was obviously new to serving but he was eager. Upon dropping off our food he gave us our check, which I believe is standard procedure at Village Inn, and told us Raquelle would help us for the rest of our visit. My girlfriend didn't like her skillet, but didn't want to complain. We convinced her to say something, and after waiting 10 minutes she caught the manager's (Gary) attention. She told him she didn't like her entree, and appearing extremely inconvenienced he said \"so you want something else or what?\" Raquelle then showed up and checked on us, seeming genuinely interested in my girlfriend's satisfaction with her new meal. Gary, however, made his rounds checking on tables and clearly avoided ours. As a manager he should be setting an example for his servers but his attitude was deplorable. Raquelle is the sole reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars rather than 1.

Ambience- The restaurant was clean, a bit noisy and reasonably spacious.

This was my first time at a Village Inn, and most certainly my last."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not a Village Inn Fan and haven't been here in a least a few years because of a bad experience awhile ago. We walked in  and were greeted within a few seconds, ran to the bathroom and one of the stalls was out of order and not working so I had to wait for the three people ahead of me. Got back to the table and our order was promptly taken got the strawberry crepes with crispy bacon hash browns and it came out exactly as I asked which was nice! Food was delicious! Our waiter was nice and brought us out Togo drinks for the road! The one  thing I would say was a lot of people were there standing around and all the tables around us were dirty and not being bussed! I know it was after their morning rush but as a guest looking at dirty tables wasn't very appealing !"}
{"text":"Impressed with the wait time of just about 10 minutes.   The place was packed with a ton of people waiting but the service is quick.  I tried the build your own breakfast with the egg white and part skim mozzarella omelet and I was very impressed.   The whole wheat toast was surprisingly good; thick bakery style slices.  I recommend butter on the side.  Jill and Bo were our servers.   Super nice and great teamwork!  Definitely recommend this VI!"}
{"text":"Service is great, however the meals are not always consistent. My mother is the fan!"}
{"text":"Great Experience. We were greated with a smile. Just went in for an iced coffee and ended up staying for a light bite to eat. Our waitress was so attentive, as with all her other guests. Food was good and did the trick!"}
{"text":"Are used to frequent the Village Inn in Gilbert, Arizona on a regular basis. I came to this Village Inn because it was the closest to my new location. The service was horrible. I work in the tipping industry, the waitress should be ashamed of herself. Unfortunately good manners or even customer service seems to be lacking in the millennial generation. So if you would like breakfast with an attitude this your place. If you would like to be treated courteously while you pay for your breakfast You might want to go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Village Inn location. Friendly server, but the hot food arrived room temperature and took a very long time, like it was just sitting in the kitchen.

Three Village Inn managers were having a meeting at a nearby table, we could hear EVERYTHING, like what needed to be replaced, all about their pie inventory, peak/slow times, Free Pie Wednesday pie inventory, etc. 

They should had taken a proactive approach to assist what seemed like the ONLY Food Server working on a Sunday evening around 6pm.

One manager walked by to ask us how everything was, we expressed our disappointment, she disappeared, then was at the register. She offered us a discount, and not so much of a sincere apology. Unacceptable. :(

I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Loving this location. They are very generous with the portions and both times that I have been here the waiters have been very nice and fast. There was a 30 minute wait on Saturday but I think that's typical of most diners on weekends. On thrusday morning it was almost empty. Plates are a bit more expensive than Denny's or IHOP but like I said, their portions are huge. Plus most breakfast plates come with pancakes. At Denny's , the chicken fried steak meal just comes as is but here it comes with a side of pancakes as well. They don't skimp out on fries and onion rings either which is one of my pet peeves and one of the reasons why I stopped going to Denny's"}
{"text":"Had family dinner at this Location.
Menu is getting a bit old since we eat here once or twice a month. A few more new items or newer items more frequently would be great.

Food is always good for what you would expect and the staff is always friendly and checks on us frequently during dinner."}
{"text":"Hells yeah. Haven't had this place since Iowa City.

Best mozzy stix ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place better stars but quite honestly I'm over being treated like garbage by the gm there.  All of the servers we have are awesome!!! Brian knows exactly what we like.  We used to eat here at least three times a week after the gym because we're trying to eat healthy.  While there aren't many healthy options, you can still eat healthy as long as you are ordering off of the VIB menu which the GM likes to police/enforce the rules on EVERY time we're there.  She will actually watch as our food is plated and reprimand the server if we are violating the VIB rules of different items.  I've emailed corporate regarding this matter a couple of times and they say we're following the rules (we order the same every time).  Here's what the funny part is...we don't have a problem being charged extra.  We simply want what we want.  No reason to treat us like garbage or give the servers a hard time.  Nobody is trying to get on over her.  
The restaurant itself isn't the most clean/tidy place.  Perhaps the attention should be put in other places.  Not in people who come in just want a healthy meal and are willing to pay for what we want!!!
We were regulars...we will find other places to eat healthy late night who actually appreciate our business."}
{"text":"Village inn has always been a favorite of mine and I'm so glad this one is close by ..service has always been very good and the staff is always friendly and warm ..food always hot when delivered so its always a go to when I'm feeling really hungry ..love it"}
{"text":"We had a hectic morning and Village Inn was down the street from our Appt.  so we decided on breakfast.  Had Eggs Benedict everything was okay but eggs were poached well my husband mentioned it too the Manager who had stopped by and he took the plate and had the dish redone.  Came back with GREAT POACHED EGGS!!  I don't like complaining but this was so NICE!  Today was also WEDNESDAY, you get a slice of pie for free, another GREAT DEAL...  Sasha (husband kept calling her Sarah) was such a GREAT waitress, it made the morning just better and will go back again and make a point of going on WEDNESDAY... again.  Oh by the way PIE is to die for, so fresh and tasty....  thank you Manager & Sasha for making our morning end so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Do you ever get a craving and you just need to satisfy that craving??  
One Saturday evening my daughter and I saw a commercial for pie on TV. She said \"mom, let's get some pie\".....who am I to ignore that request??  So off we went.  

We have been here a couple of times and it is clean and the service is friendly.  The food is nothing spectacular but it's good if you want a quick bite.  Now the pie....well, the pie is pretty good.  I have had chocolate cream, peanut butter and chocolate, and lemon cream cheese.  All have been good and fresh.  And it satisfied a craving.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us frequently. 

My friend and I came here to have a slice of pie later at night. Both slices were delicious and their coffee was good as well. This location didn't have very many patrons at my time of visit, so it was very quiet. 

Village Inn has been a family favorite for their pies, and this place didn't change that one bit!"}
{"text":"The food is good and this is probably the only place open on Christmas till midnight !"}
{"text":"Um...no. Staff was friendly and attentive. However, the eggs that tasted like scrambled margarine with a hint of asparagus flavoring were a bit of a turnoff; as were the tasteless bacon strips and the old grease smelling hash browns. As well, I was not aware that coffee could actually have no flavor at alI.  I was expecting something better in the neighborhood considering that the other breakfast places in the vicinity are all good in my book. Good thing they are there because I won't go back to the Village Inn. It was like eating in a sad version of a Dennys....."}
{"text":"AWFUL-HORRIBLE-TERRIBLE! NEVER going back there again. Me and my girlfriend ordered the Build Your Own breakfast deal, awful mistake. First of all if you order 2 of the same thing you get charged another Dollar which is rediculous, then when we get our food it's like a Kids Meal portion: COLD potatoes and there were like 8 little potatoes, COLD hash browns, the side of fruit has 2 pieces of melon and 4 grapes, and a HALF of a waffle, side of fries had about 10 fries on it. We were there about an hour and a half and ate our food in 2 minutes STILL hungry and already had spend $28, server was rude and didn't ask us how our food was or anything, it was like she sensed our dis-satisfaction and just felt we were a lost cause at that point. Then the grand finale, the general manager Cesar Real asked us how our meal was and I told him awful and explained all these issues and he pretty much said \"well those are the portions we give here so sorry about that\" no discount for shitty cold food or awful service not any type of anything to help out, and this is their manager. Twice the price and Half the portions of Denny's. I will never go back here again ever, horrible."}
{"text":"Had an issue with this Village Inn, and the general manager was quick to contact me. The attention to customer satisfactory and the urgency to resolve is refreshing. Thank you, Jennifer."}
{"text":"Driving around looking for a place to eat we  found this little gem service was great food was great and the pie they claim to be the best pie in America didn't disappoint we will certainly be back"}
{"text":"Cherry pie was on point!!!! I had it a la mode with vanilla ice cream. I am still dreaming about it now, I may have to go get another one."}
{"text":"I've been there twice both times were bad experiences the first time they had burnt my toast her food was cold and uncooked the second time they forgot half of our order the waiter said he would put it in and then he forgot so we ended up just taking it off our bill and they didn't even give us a discount. Poor service bad food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the pie. And it was good.

Family had the hankering for pie to celebrate the New Year. Ran up th road to Village Inn. The service staff was cool and I procured a Triple Berry and a Peppermint French Silk. Arrived home to much fanfare and squealing from my wife... and little girls. If only being a hero was really this easy.

Seriously, the pies were good and the crusts were perfect. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to say... I've always eyed this place with suspicion both aesthetically and gastronomically.

Anyone who says their pies are the best has not been to Marie Calendars... 

I came in with an open mind and left with a full belly so here's the run down:

Dinner salad with blue cheese dressing was a hands down winner. The dressing was amazing. I even used the saltines they brought me to eat the chunks of blue cheese on!

The Cuban pita sandwich was A-OK, as were the fries. Service was efficient and friendly.

My pie... meh... was not impressed at all... but that's OK. It got the job of putting way too many calories into my body from one meal sitting.

I had water to drink and thank goodness!

The decor was cute and modern, I was actually surprised at it. I was expecting something schlubby or dumpy. It was not.

Best part of the night was being rung up by a cashier/server who had a long, long, coke/crystal sniffing pinky nail.

Stay classy Glendale!"}
{"text":"Service was awful,waited before anyone noticed  is standing there. Also, flies inside on food. Will not go back"}
{"text":"It's Village Inn, so food quality is good for the price but nothing spectacular.  I have to say I really enjoy this location, super friendly, prompt service, and makes you feel like a local diner \"where everybody knows your name\".  Great value place for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"So many old people here. I call this place God's waiting room. One old man was eating with his shirt completely unbuttoned. It was gross. It took forever to get seated. Even longer to get our drinks.  Management yelling at employees in front of the customers to clean their tables. I'm surprised they don't pre chew the food the seniors who seem to be the only patrons."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, waiting over 40 min for breakfast and as I'm writing this review. Don't waist your time and money here thanks"}
{"text":"Complete waste of money. Disgusting. Hash browns first raw, then burnt. Will NEVER go again."}
{"text":"Great food great service!!!! And very good Management! Out of 5 of us every order was perfect!!! Wow"}
{"text":"the service is slow, waited ten minutes to be seated and it was not even busy then when we did get seated it was another  ten minutes before we were waited upon I am givîng it a three star because the food was great once we received it."}
{"text":"I have always loved other Village Inn locations, but the experience at my first and only visit to this location was poor from beginning to end.  I had unsatisfactory food and service from the hostesses and waiters.  We contacted the restaurant days in advance and they agreed to a reservation for 30 people at 10am on 4/28/18.  Our group arrived about 15 minutes early and waited patiently.  At 10 am there did not appear to be any openings and the hostesses said they would seat us as they became available but couldn't guarantee we'd be seated together because as they told us, \"we can't control how fast people eat.\"  No you can't, but you can control seating people in the reserved section 10 minutes prior to the reservation.  And you can use some tact in your multiple curt, terse responses to customers' questions.  Our group was ultimately split up and seated at different times.  

Our waiter, Jorge (???), was clearly having a bad day and was very blunt and short with us.  He forgot our drinks and when three of us asked for tobasco sauce, he gave us a bottle that everyone could see had only a few drops left.  He was not inviting or outwardly thankful for our patronage and instead acted quite bothered.  I wouldn't say he was offensive, but he certainly did not attempt to provide a positive experience.

The food was unimpressive.  I ordered 2 scrambled eggs, 2 strips of bacon, a cup of fruit and a cup of apples.  The bacon and egg portions were tiny amd mostly flavorless.  My son ordered the banana supreme french toast and said it didn't have much taste, either.

On day two in the area, most of us went to competitors.  The Denny's in Peoria had an amazing build your own grand slam and my son loved their banana blueberry pancake breakfast.  Hopefully the four or five employees our group had negative experiences with were just an anomaly.  

Hostess Lani was very courteous and cheery.  She was the bright and shining example of effective customer service as she smiled and spoke with us near the end of our meal."}
{"text":"I couldn't complain when wanting a late night appetizers with friends. They just upgraded/ remodeled their entire restaurant giving it a more modern day feel which is pleasant after a long day. The server was pleasant but during a slow night with few guests, food and attentiveness could of been better. You get what you pay for during sleepy hours. Lol"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast places to eat. Yes, we are aware you can go to \"artisanal\" breakfast joints like The Place or Butterfields, however, if you are looking for a no frills, straight to the point breakfast spot, come to Village Inn. You won't have to deal with 45 min - 1 hour lines just for food! 

Staff is great with Cindy and Brian being our top favorites when we visit. You may ask, Why then the 4 Stars? Well, on occasion, we get seated somewhere and forgotten about. Yeah, it has happened around 3-4 times this year so far so there is definitely room for them to improve their customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times already, usually either with friends or co-workers.  Every time I been here, the experience been good.  Never a bad moment then again never a fabulous one either.

They have always been quite neat, and the bathroom is always kept clean.  The restaurant always had appropriate lighting and the service has always been fast and prompt and the waitresses has always been friendly.  The food is good, not great, but not bad either... 

Overall a nice place with great service.  I do see myself coming back to this location, not alone though, that be quite awkward!"}
{"text":"Normally we have no issues here. This morning our server was kind of rude and the chicken pot pie my daughter ordered (which she has eaten here before) must have been frozen since the ice age because the chicken tasted vile. The manager said they make them fresh every couple days. This one missed the boat."}
{"text":"I work at a hospital down the street and when we are all having sugar cravings I occasionally go to Village Inn to get pies. I have to say I receive the best service when I go in and order 6 pies on 6 different tabs! So thank you for dealing with us! We love getting late night pies to get us through our night shift!"}
{"text":"My first time here my dinner was good...But the pies...Yummy there was so many to choose from it took me a while but I settled for the Lemon Surpeme pie...Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean store and good menu. Best part of coming here is of course the pie. Huge selection but if like bananas, you can to try the melt in your mouth banana cream pie. Of course you can take whole pies or slices to go. Prices are decent, too."}
{"text":"I had a piece of peach supreme pie last night, it was good. My friend had all you can eat fish and chips, she enjoyed it too. Next time I like to visit on Wed to just enjoy the free pie. =D"}
{"text":"It was Pi Day (3/14) so I decided to get pie (and apparently so did everyone else). Village Inn doesn't have online ordering so I called to place an order for pickup. I could tell they were busy because the girl on the phone had me repeat my order more than once and she put me on hold and never picked back up, so I called again to finish my order. She said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. When I arrived, I stood at the pickup counter waiting to be acknowledged. There was a long line growing at the checkout counter. When the girl finally acknowledged me, she said I would have to get in the back of the line. The manager came out and told me they were working on my order. Then they informed me they were out of banana cream pie (my favorite) and asked if I wanted a different pie. I was disappointed, but settled for a slice of cherry. Once I got up to pay, I waited a few more minutes for my order. The manager said he was sending me home with a whole cherry pie for my trouble. What an awesome gesture! The food I ordered (VIB w/ french toast, country potatoes, 2-egg cheese omelette, and bacon) was hot, fresh, and tasty. Good pie too. Very thankful for managers who care!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast for dinner one day last week. It was pretty quiet evening there. I got the VIB with a cheese omelette, bacon, french toast, and country potatoes. Everything was really good. Our server was nice and friendly, which is kind of a rarity. The manager even came by to see how everything was. Got to use our $5 off coupon. Very good meal."}
{"text":"Went to Village Inn for breakfast. We had a 20% off coupon but the waitress told us (in a rude tone) that it was expired (by one day) and the computer won't accept it. Lame. I get it, but she could have been nicer about it. I ordered the VIB with french toast (no butter), cheese omelette, country potatoes, and cinnamon apples. It was a lot of food and all very good. Got two slices of pie to go: Boston Cream Elite and Pumpkin w/ Whipped Cream. When we tried the Boston Cream, I thought it didn't have a lot of flavor. The cake part was okay, not very moist though, the vanilla cream didn't really taste like anything, and the chocolate frosting on top was very sweet & sugary. Altogether, not impressed with that one. The pumpkin was tasty... no complaints there."}
{"text":"Friendly service by all. Outstanding pies with free pie wednesdays. Prices are very reasonable and food is tasty. The servers  make a point to make you feel welcome especially Donna :-) 
Village Inn is a great place to have a quick bit to eat at a good price with friendly service. It doesnt get better than that :-)"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would. 
I ignored the cold French fries. I even ignored getting the wrong order. I could not ignore the hair in my pancakes. I especially loved that the manager acted like my elderly Mother was lying about the whole thing when we told him. This is just another example of great customer service these days."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but quick and easy food with lots of family friendly options"}
{"text":"This is the best village inn i have been to i all of my life and they serve good food the help is always good and helpful and the place is always clean"}
{"text":"The food is usually good. Its a great place for breakfast or sat morning brunch. The service is decent but not quite friendly. Very quiet compared to other diners early in the morning."}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn on what I should rate. I ordered two different entrees. The first one was there BLT on sourdough bread with chicken noodle soup. The chicken soup was absolutely amazing perfectly proportioned vegetables, noodles and flavor. The sandwitch was really good. They put a very generous amount of bacon.
 
Know for the 2nd order this is were things get a little bit tricky. I ordered there new Reuben cheeseburger. The sandwich comes with Thousand Island dressing , pastrami meat sauerkraut , tomatoes,  pickles and swiss cheese. 

I really really really hate swiss cheese. The thought/smell of it literally makes me sick. This is why I I pacifically asked for cheddar cheese on my cheeseburger. The gentleman who took my order over the phone even repeated it back to me correctly, twice.

 However once I brought my to-go home this was not the case. Guess what there was swiss on it. Pretty much ruined my whole cheeseburger.

 Apart from that I will give them the burger was perfectly season the pastrami meat with the sauerkraut and the Thousand Island dressing really paired well. But unfortunately I wasn't really able to enjoy it. 

Also when I got to the restaurant the soup and the drinks I ordered were already on the counter. I had to wait a little bit for the food which is no big deal I expected that. But you guys should really think about putting the soup out last because when I got home the soda was completely water down and the soup was kind of cold."}
{"text":"Danielle is majestic af. 10 out of 10. She keeps it on the Sunnyside of life! Bonus, I received extra whip cream on my crepe."}
{"text":"Not sure about the food, but that's because we didn't get to try it.. Host just ran two good customers off before even seating them.. Rude and completely uninterested in making us feel welcome.. Hope your shift is over soon, buddy..

Oh and it smelled funny in there, too. Not sure what that was about..."}
{"text":"Had a planned breakfast for my mother-in-law today and everything seems regular and ordered the Ultimate Skillet. And was almost done when I  hit a piece of bacon that for lack of a better term tasted like hand sanitizer. Or some chemical.  Wife confirmed 
Spoke to management which said the would remove from the bill.

Strange"}
{"text":"If you've seen one Inn, you've seen all Inns. Only, most I've seen are shutting down faster than the Democrats will be leaving Congress this year. Nevertheless, I'm happy this particular one on Northern Ave and the Loop 101, is still in business.

Very clean, well laid out - even for its smaller size and it had an extremely friendly staff to both me and my father - who happens to be so much a regular, he says he'll have his regular and they recite back to him precisely what it was just to be sure. Rarely do you see that, especially in a chain. They were also extremely friendly with me, and happy to meet his son.

That all said, let's get down to the food. Oh, boy, it was, well, Luby's quality. I had chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, corn, clam chowder soup and it came with a biscuit and soft butter. Let's start with the positive: the chicken fried steak and it's seasoned gravy was very good. As was the biscuit and butter - that was delicious warm/soft butter. The soup was only adequate with its enormously small chunks of meat inside. The mashed potatoes were actually wet and/or runny inside - it was edible, but not by much. And finally the corn. How can you mess that up? Well, enough for me to take one bite and push it over to my father who must be used to it by now. That was the worst.

But, if the corn's the worst, then is the whole place not worth visiting? By all means NO...the staff and ambiance sincerely makes up for any shortcomings. 

(Overall rating: 3.5/5 Stars. The following is rated by \"out of five\" stars.)

Ambiance: 4 - Very nice looking inside, well laid out.

Service: 5 - extremely friendly and personable.

Food Taste: 3 - see above.

Food Quality: 4 - well presented.

Cleanliness: 5 - Very clean, down to the restrooms.

Friendly Staff: 5 - See above.

Fast Busing: 5 - the waiter did all that, and extremely efficient, always with a smile and a chuckle.

Smoking Area: Outside to the immediate right. Not bad, includes a sitting area for smokers.

Would I Return?: If my father wanted to. I wouldn't go out of my way.

Would I Recommend?: Yes...sort of....

And to who?: If someone lived within 5 miles of it and if they were on a tight budget.

Additional Information: Without having to, the staff treated my father with the utmost respect and courtesy while showing genuine concern that his visit was enjoyable. If they did that for one person, chances are they will treat you the same way. Kudos to the hiring staff."}
{"text":"the worst service you will ever get.  my food took forever and I ordered a burger and fries.  and when it came it was wrong and then when corrected it looked like there were hardly any fries on the plate.  I do not even like their pies anymore.  Marie Calenders in California has much better pie."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have eaten in. Food was awful, Chicken fried steak cooked to a crisp, could hardly cut into it let alone eat it, scrambled eggs cooked so hard they were a joke, My wife had Eggs Benedict that were discustingly HARD and the bacon was like mushy rubber. Never again. This is one Franchise that needs to be CANCELLED!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a village in before and they will not be a place I will consider going to again, or at least not this location. The flooring is disgusting, our server was a little to much in our business. I went with a friend for a last get together before Christmas. The server was friendly but she does not need to continue to ask about the gift I gave a friend. Asking her to open it so she could see what she got. The server did not know us. The bathrooms need some serious cleaning. I think they also need serious cleaning around the entire building. At one point while I was eating there was weird looking gray stuff that was on the seat next to me. After a little while longer I noticed it on the table. At which point I stopped eating and this was crap falling from the ceiling. I don't know if any of it landed in my food, but that is YUCK YUCK YUCK. As we went to check out, they attempted to run my card on a back register 4 times, each time saying its the register what does not read cards well, and I was not being changed. True I was not charged, but don't offer to help me check out on a register that gives you issues in hopes to save time when in reality no time was saved, I still had to wait for the other register to become open, at which point I was then checked out. Same time as if you had not attempted to make it go faster. Sorry I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Have a great breakfast, California skillet. It was a great warm up on the cool and rainy day. Also the service was very good"}
{"text":"First time coming to VI as a newcomer to AZ, I like that they serve breakfast all day. I ordered the ultimate breakfast and upgraded their standard buttermilk pancakes to the new pumpkin pancakes topped with caramel pecan sauce. I thought it would be a big breakfast combo plate for the price but it was a bit smaller than I expected but the pumpkin pancakes were the best! The caramel sauce was enough that I didn't need syrup. One of the servers also came back with extra bacon saying she didn't like the ones she previously gave me. Totally unexpected and so much appreciated! The pumpkin pancakes alone will bring me back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast around 11:30/12ish and it was surprisingly busy. I was with other people and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table but it thankfully went by fast. The menu is huge and the prices are good, especially for this place. The inside was actually nice and the place was very easy to find and also there is tons of parking. We didn't have to wait too long for the food which was nice since we ordered all different things. I got an omelet and it was actually really good."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes.  Left feeling disappointed.  To compare... For the same price you can eat at IHOP or Dennys.  Both places offer better tasting/quality food.  I was also very disappointed that my cup of coffee was overwhelmingly watered down.  Same with my second and third cup.  And 3.99 for a slice of pie?  That's a little steep when the meal wasn't great to begin with.  I have had their pies before and if you are going to visit this place I guess that's what you should get.  Skip the regular food and drinks.  Water and pie anyone?

This place also gets a star for the interior.  It was mostly updated and it didn't feel as run down as other Village inns I had visited in the past."}
{"text":"I mean it's your typical American dining spot.  You're never going to be wowed and leave with an oh my god that was amazing feeling after eating here.  It certainly does fulfill its purpose though with decent breakfast, and mediocre lunch and dinner with some pretty good pie. The pies are pretty tasty, and I frequently eat breakfast here as there're not many other options.  Service is a hit or miss, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"The standout element of our Village Inn visit was our waiter, Raleigh. He was friendly, funny, helpful, and on top of our needs. Five stars for Raleigh.

Beyond that it was pretty typical Village Inn, with mediocre but cheap meals, very good pies, and a slow, slow kitchen. If you cherry pick from the menu you can get something verging on good at a very reasonable price. Eventually. (This is, after all, a restaurant chain which thinks a Frito chili cheese skillet is something people want for breakfast.)

Do note that there is zero, zip, nada in the line of cell service in this location. With Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint all represented, nobody in my group had any bars."}
{"text":"Have been here twice over the past two weeks for lunch with a friend. The first time we both had the grown-up grilled cheese, which has bacon, tomato & pickles (on the side) on toasted parmesan bread. So good! Then on Wednesday we returned with my hubby. I had the grilled cheese again, this time with their tomato basil soup. Perfect for the weather!! Hubs had a very yummy bacon bleu burger & our friend had the turkey club. Unfortunately, friend found something in her fries that caused her meal to be returned & removed from the bill, but the pie afters was good anyway...recommend the white chocolate cherry pie."}
{"text":"Just as I nestled my tired butt into our booth, two cute elderly ladies were getting up from their table right next to us. As one helped the other into her walker, well, how do I put this delicately? Hmmm....as one helped the other into her walker, the lady with the walker, she, umm. Ok. Well, she ripped one. Ok. She farted. Yes I said it. And everyone heard it. But, unfortunately for me, my face was a foot from her polyester crack. Welcome to the Village Inn. As we awaited our food I noticed one employee at the counter chewing her nails. Really going to town. Like trying to break the Guiness Book of World Records. It was distracting. And disgusting. 
That said. We had a wonderful server with a nativity scene apron. Wow. Hmmm....I believe Mary has mustard on her forehead.  I enjoyed the basic eggs over medium, hash browns (perfectly crisp on top) and my buttermilk cakes. So the food was actually tastey. The flatulence and nail biting I guess were just a bonus."}
{"text":"Decided I needed some pie to help me forget my not so great experience at Los Olivos.   I ordered the apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and Coffee.  Delish & flaky crust and they warmed it up for me, which is the way I love it.  Found out while I was there that: Every Wednesday is rush Wednesday and you get a free slice of pie with any purchase."}
{"text":"Kind staff, good food, delicious deserts, very clean. IHOP is now #2 for our breakfast outings.."}
{"text":"My breakfast nachos were AMAZING!  Mom didn't care for cafeteria style turkey dinner.  The free pie Wednesday was a nice treat!  The waitress was a sweetheart, she gave us a kids meal with double Mac and cheese so my daughter that was in the hospital would have what she wanted for dinner."}
{"text":"Always friendly and great service.  It is nice to get whatever you want on the menu anytime during the day or night.  The pies are really good."}
{"text":"Seems like service here is a bit slow, but it's somewhat busy so I suppose it can be expected. Food was just ok... Nothing to brag about, tap water being served is not cool, and least get it filtered... BUT THE PIES!!! Mm mm, now those ill be back for... Over all, it's been a ok experience, wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast in the future..."}
{"text":"This location is a personal favorite of my wife and I. The ambience is modern and aesthetically pleasing. The service is prompt and on point. The menu depth and pie selection keeps us returning again and again. 

I might suggest taking a look at their lunch and dinner menu as we have been pleasantly surprised to find there's much more yums to be had than just pancakes. 

And of course, ZOMG! PIES!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is as expected (decent). This review is more on the manager. We have been here several times and the manager is always spot on! Today as I walked in I noticed an elderly couple. The older woman was struggling to feed herself but was valiantly defying whatever ailment that was hindering her and insisted on doing it. The manger was great as were his employees to pay attention to them without making a big scene. Kudos to him and his great staff!"}
{"text":"I've been to another Village Inn one other time for dinner and did not like it at all. The food was very bland and nothing noteworthy. This time, we thought we'd try their breakfast and we were pleasantly surprised - the breakfast for very tasty!

We both got the High Road breakfast which included 2 scrambled egg whites, 2 sausage links, and an English muffin. It also included hash browns which were out of this world! Down of the best hash browns I've ever had.

The service was a little slow but that was expected being a Sunday morning. The waitress was very apologetic and had a great sense of humor about it. I can't wait to go back there for breakfast again."}
{"text":"I honestly thought that I had written a review for this place before, but I guess not.... hmmmm odd. Well... I usually go there on Wednesdays so I can get the free pie deal, but today I went because I had plenty of time for breakfast before math class. (and I needed some coffee) On Wednesdays I usally get Erin as waitress and she is pretty awesome. They have a 3 pancakes for $2 deal that I have done a couple times, done the V.I.B. a few times, and most recently I have been doing the corned beef hash and eggs combo which comes with 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, hash and hashbrowns. Everything is always good there, and everyone is always really nice and helpful. The prices are about average with what you would spend at any breakfast place. Order the right thing and you will have a great deal. Oh and their pie is amazing, not sure if I mentioned that. so far i have had the lemon blueberry, raspberry chocolate, and coconut cream."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place! I usually get the VIB deal when I go but I decided to switch it up the last time I came here and I got the chicken fried steak breakfast with hash browns, scrambled eggs, and pancakes. The portions were huge! Everything was very good. I actually took the pancakes home for breakfast the next day. Every Wednesday you get a free slice of pie with your meal. Plus they have early dinner specials that come with a slice as well. (No you don't get two) I got the coconut cream pie and was delicious. Service was great. I'll be back if I'm on that side of the valley again"}
{"text":"The manager apparently was understaffed when we arrived, and didn't do a great job of handling it, which is funny because we didn't have to wait that long to be seated, order, or get our food, he just gave kinda bad service when he didn't really have to. Other than that, exactly what you'd expect from a chain breakfast place. Friendly staff, just an overworked manager maybe."}
{"text":"1st I got seated and the server took a while to approach me as well as the people next to me....an older male that came in right before they did ordered like 5 min after me and got his food like 7 min before I did. I ordered the French toast combo and the egg portion was crappy my sausage was all wrinkly asked for hash browns and she forgot to put those in.....back to back problems. Never coming back....sad to say because I liked this place they just need a server who cares more is all."}
{"text":"The service was awful on a Monday evening about 7pm. We went to get a couple slices of pie, to go. The manager treated her employees terrible,  they forgot about us because of some other dilemma in the kitchen and then the pie was given to us upside down in the to go box.  I forgot to mention the slices were tiny."}
{"text":"My daughter, granddaughter and I had breakfast there this morning.  To our great surprise the check was $39.00...each entree was $8.50!  The food was just okay but acceptable.  Shock of shocks:  small OJ $2.59; iced tea $2.39; 2 cups of coffee @ $2.29 each.  We each received an empty cup with a carafe on the table.  I had 2 cups...my daughter had one.  Had I been a!one I would have received the cup and carafe for $2.29.  All we got for an additional $2.29 was an empty cup.  These prices are so inflated.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Love  this place ,  staff is great and and foods always good, go here every weekend"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, mainly because I don't typically like to pay $10 for a burger when I can go next door to Jack In The Box. However, if you want to take someone out for breakfast or lunch this is the place. I brought my mum and brother here today, and it was good to just sit and talk. 

The food isn't 5 star quality or anything, but it's not awful. The All World Burger (what I ordered) was pretty good, a little dry though. My mum ordered the Turkey and Avocado Melt and it was very good, just a little greasy. I also drank three cups of coffee - it was that good - & I don't usually drink coffee anywhere.

The ambience was my favorite part of this location because it felt very relaxing and there was no tension. The employees were very nice and greeted people, something I always look for in an establishment. 

I do recommend this location, but not if you're looking for a quick lunch stop. It's somewhere to eat and enjoy, you'll probably be here for a good hour to hour and a half. 

: )"}
{"text":"The water tastes like it would be toilet water. Once we were seated, we NEVER saw our waitress Rachel again. Our glasses remained empty. While we waited for our food, a man brought his little dog in under his arm and no one said anything (gross)!! We waited almost 30 minutes for our food. When our food finally came, it was warm. My youngest daughter ordered a sausage patty with her meal and received a smashed hamburger. 
All in all, we will NOT be back to this location!!!

UPDATED::: 7/25/15

After writing my initial review, I was contacted right away by Matt with customer relations. He was very concerned about our review and had the manager Linda at that location contact me right away. She told me to come in and receive a couple meals, drinks and pies on the house for our horrible experience before. She apologized several times and told me our business was very important and she wanted to make it right. After talking to her that day my sister, children and I went back to the location and we were very well taken care of. We had a different waitress this time who was simply amazing. The food was made perfectly hot and our glasses were never empty. After this experience and how well Village Inn took care of us after our initial experience,  I can say, we will definitely be back.  Thank you so much village Inn for going above and beyond and making it right. I really appreciate the fantastic customer service and prompt replies. So, I am changing your star from a one to a five."}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwich is the bomb!!!! Super fresh, the softness of the thick toast with eggs, Bacon n cheese just made it so perfect! Their pies are off the chain!!!  Will def go back if it's in twon again."}
{"text":"Extremely unfriendly & slow service.  We were seated fairly quickly but it rapidly deteriorated from there.  Once seated server Lisa seems to have a chip on her shoulder or maybe was extremely constipated, just not sure. Had to ask for straws as did other tables.  Order came and food is decent but not outstanding by any means.  Drinks sat empty with no offer to refill.  With the abundant of alternate breakfast places are nearby don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I come to this location numerous times a week, and I usually have phenomenal service. However today, I was very displeased. I spend about $80 a week on food for my grandfather, and I have never had any problems with this place until now.

 I called in my order, as per usual, however while I was on the phone the waitress had an attitude. I was waiting for her to tell me the total, and she just sighed and started talking to me with an attitude. Her excuse was \"I thought you hung up\". After she told me the total, she just hung up. It would have been nice to know how long it would take, so I wouldn't pick up cold food. 

Once I got to the restaurant I was greeted by Angelica, who had the same attitude as the girl on the phone who had helped me. If you have never ordered a to-go meal from Village Inn, they immediately show you your food so you are pleased with your meal, then you pay for it. She promptly got on the register for me to pay (which the total was about $3 more than the total I was given on the phone), then hesitantly asked \"if I would like to see it\". 

It's just infuriating to get terrible service at a place you're a regular at. I hope that this issue will be addressed and cease to exist in the future."}
{"text":"Great pies and skillets!

They service is quick and friendly too.

I highly recommend, especially the key lime pie."}
{"text":"The friendly staff here is what prompted the one star. My breakfast consisted of an on omelette with under cooked hash browns and burned toast. This was my first visit and it would take a lot for me to go back."}
{"text":"Visited this place several times and never disappoints. The customer base has an eclectic turn out with the shop not catering to one genre. The foyer had dirty ceilings so they might want to clean the areas around the vents even though it's only the entrance. Hanging dust isn't pleasant when waiting to be seated. The server was very nice and accommodating. Now the food, I recommend pie when you order your drink. The pies and cakes are good, however the less can be said about the pancakes. The flavor of the cakes are not very sweet even with syrup. Eggs and cheese (special request) were good and the omelette were good, however the fruit bowl should have the melon omitted only because you can't pick it with your fork( not ripe) and the turkey sausage was skimpy."}
{"text":"Used to go there all the time when we lived in own. Wife and decided to go get some wings see if they were as Good as remembered... well.. they were okay.. probably the best part of our dinner.. 2 cups of coke was $10.50
And than upon water found out they were supposed to charge for that as well... 
Won't be going back.. 
Servers were non existent.. and staff seemed disgruntled."}
{"text":"I frequent this location often. Have never had a bad experience with service! Wait staff has always been friendly, and managers are quick to greet and check on you. Food is usually good, pies are amazing!"}
{"text":"As far as the chain breakfast -y places go, Village Inn gets top marks. This is my go-to pie spot PLUS you get free pie on wednesday if you order anything....like a coffee....so pretty excellent. The BF and I went here tonight (for free pie) and got breakfast for dinner.... They have the same idea as Denny's build your own grand slam, but I like this one because there are way more options and pretty good options too like crepes, waffles, omelets....all kinds of fancy stuff (for a place like this anyway). The service has always been good for me at this location, especially from the (I think...) manager. Everyone is friendly. I'd definitely hit this place up for a fairly reasonably priced breakfast....not for a wonderful super creative breakfast....just a....I need a decent breakfast for a decent price type. Go local if you want something special."}
{"text":"Very short review, Village Inn let down today. It was Wednesday, which means it was free pie day. Usually when you're done with the meal, or when they bring out your food, they'd either ask you, \"are you getting a free slice of pie today?\" This is probably the first time it has happened. A free pie wasn't even mentioned. I didn't just order a drink to get a free slice of pie, I ordered a full breakfast item with a coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to eat that is close to home.  Servers are mostly very experienced and work hard at keeping customers happy.  Later at night they are sometimes understaffed but have patience and smile.  They have probably had a long day and the food is worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Service was good even though we were in prime time. Good food as well. I went with the standard eggs, bacon, pancakes combination and everything came out in a timely manner at a proper temp. The atmosphere was standard issue for Village Inn, which to say is casual. Even though it was a weekend we still did not have to wait for a table and our waitress was pleasent and well spoken."}
{"text":"The last time we went there we were so grossed out by the staff that we will never return.  A waitress sat at a table rolling silverware into napkins.  She touched EVERY piece of silverware at the top while also wiping her nose.  Then, a waitress in the kitchen was trying to pick something out of her teeth... had her mouth wide open while digging in there.  We asked for the manager and the waitress stood at our table like a big bully wanting to know why we wanted the manager.  It was a truly a GROSS experience.  We haven't been to any Village Inn since.... that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast. We were the only people in the place at 6:30 am. We were seated immediately of course and our waiter was right there to get our beverage. After a few minutes I decided to order the pork carnitas breakfast burrito. It was on the table in no time at all even though the restaurant began to fill up after I arrived. The burrito was very good. It was made with seasoned shredded pork, diced fried potatoes, green peppers, refried beans, fried onions, and scrambled eggs. All this wrapped in a giant flour tortilla. The burrito came with salsa and sour cream. It was very filling and I left the restaurant without having a piece of their famous pie."}
{"text":"I adore the staff.  

RudiAnn is a fabulous server.  I never have to ask for anything- she is always at the top of her game.

Meghan is great, too.  I always get prompt service. 

The food is good and the restaurant is family friendly."}
{"text":"The last two visits were very disappointing.   Chicken Fried Steak was so overcooked  it was inedible.   Tonight's Fish and Chips, the fish was overcooked on the outside and raw in the middle ' again inedible .

Service - waitress too busy to remember what we ordered.

The only good thing was the pie."}
{"text":"Your basic Denny's alternative.  Not fantastic, but lives up to it's own not-so-lofty standard, if that makes sense.  Not as risky as hitting a Waffle House at 3am, though just as hazardous to your health, if you choose unwisely from the rather extensive breakfast menu.  Predictibly decent - seems to never excel, nor disappoint."}
{"text":"After a few hit and miss attempts on our last couple of visits we are back yet again! Simply because of one man.... Michael! One of the best managers I have ever met! He has made sure that past mistakes are corrected! We walked in tonight and found the perfect server for us and has even come to check on us frequently! He is very attentive as to his customers and is more than willing to correct any mistakes the moment they are brought to his attention. He knows how to make customers feel welcome and valued. His ability to adapt and interact well with his customers is what keeps me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to get the turkey sandwich with a salad, it was good :) ambience was nice and it was in a great location!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this location, the fish and chips I order every time are delicious and constantly fresh from the kitchen, they don't taste old or anything! I'm usually seated right away and greeted like as if I'm an old friend. It's a really nice way to end my day after working or being in meetings all day. 

I also appreciate that the waitresses aren't afraid to have a sense of humor and just chat me up while I'm waiting for food or deciding what to order. It's just a truly, wonderfully cozy place."}
{"text":"So revisited after 2 years, and though I will stick by my last post of \"service\"...

VAST IMPROVEMENTS!!!!  It's really just said in one word, but I'm gonna do it with three words: RAY, RAY, RAY!!!  We had the pleasure of being served by him twice.  And each time was a delight.  I know the service industry, and I understand catering to people--it can be taxing, ridiculous, and just down right stupid.  This man just hit the ball out of the park each time.  The first visit was Valentines Day around 2, and they were packed.  The hostess was positive and upbeat, 20 mins to be seated (accurate).  She sat us and told us the specials, and did it with candor and delight.  Excellent.  A real person with a real face and showing real emotion, NOT a robot-rehearsed speech!  This place is packed and I know it must be hectic, we are now greeted by Ray.  First, the positive energy that he displayed was incredible, we immediately felt like we were at home with \"one of our favorite peeps\"!!  Placed our orders (2 Philly Steak Benedict--spectacular, I don't want to know the calories!!). He never missed a beat refilling drinks or getting condiments.  He was even kind to allow me to get a to-go cup to take my tea home in.  And watching him with his other tables just made me smile, he was just as GRACIOUS to all his customers!!  

So we go back 3 days later with the parents and sibling.  We get Ray AGAIN!!!  He was just as INVITING and JOYFUL as our first time.  And the best part, he never reused/resuscitated  \"jokes or mantras.\"  He was just REAL.  So refreshing to see a real person doing a job and enjoying being alive.  This man is incredible.  He really made our visit special.  Thank you sir!!  God Bless you and your family!!

Both times we were there a manager (I assume) was floating around asking how we were.  Bathrooms were especially clean.  To-go packaging was offers and executed!!  Parking was abundant.  And the place was SUPER CLEAN!!! Just two spectacular visits!! Thank you Village Inn, but really, thank you RAY!!!"}
{"text":"The place is always dirty the bathroom stinks and the food is awful. The service is so bad and who is running this place."}
{"text":"We have been thinking about breakfast and decide village inn.
Was on Sunday and busy morning,wait was 20 mins.
There was party of four. We order our breakfast and did not take that long.

Food was good,just relax morning to go out and not have to cook this meal.
Pancake was good. Drinks good. Waiter was good. Food taste good.

Three stars,I was looking at some tables that have not been clean up while people are waiting for tables. Get busy clean up busboy. Timed it and took ten mins to get tables done. That is managers job to bark.

I would come back again in near future."}
{"text":"Tired of suggestion you and your friends go to Denny's?  Wanting something that's almost a step up from Denny's but with similar menu items and willing to put up with your wild/drunk/insomniac friends?  If you're willing to pay just a dollar or more per plate, we can give you the impression that you've risen above the Denny's crowd.  Well, at least until you realize that it's essentially the same thing.  Sure, there's no \"moons over my hammy\" on the menu, and they have \"fresh\" baked pies and muffins.  But really - not so different at 3am.

During the day it's another story.  The Village Inn seems to rise far above the Denny's crowd.  You don't even mind telling a group of folks at work to meet you there.  It's not showing creativity, but it's just another burger/salad/sandwich place.  But when the waitress who normally works night shift is helping out during the lunch shift - and she asks you in front of your co-workers if you and your drunk/stupid/alternate-lifestyle-than-portrayed-at-work friends made it home that one night because you were trashed/high/making-out-so-hard-you-steamed-up-the-windows, you might have some explaining to do.  And you might want to find a new late night Village Inn."}
{"text":"If I could do negative stars I would . Worst service from the manager. I will be contacting corporate(:"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Would visit every Sunday with my husband and kids. The last two times I've been in once being today on 3/18/2018  I found a hair in my food, black bacon and horrible service. 
When I mentioned the hair that was cooked into my food the manger raised his voice and embarrassed me in front of everyone. And I still paid for my whole ticket and left a $10 tip. 
Won't be going back unless something changes. :("}
{"text":"This place always seems to be under staffed.  Almost every table was dirty,  not very many people in here today but I had to wait 10 minutes to be seated some no one was there.  Also another couple was polite enough to wait 10 minutes to pay for their breakfast.  We ended up leaving in order to not get any further bad service"}
{"text":"I'm never coming back to this location, yesterday was the second time I get a rude waitress.Every time that Me and my family ask her something she replied \"what?\" Like if We just have ask her something uncomfortable,  I order a skillet and I didn't want onions, bell pepper and I wanted swiz cheese instead, she was not happy with the modifications I made,  she left and came back and said \" I don't know if the kitchen can make so many modifications but I will try to get it right\". I ask her \"why is it so difficult to get it  right? 

The first time I went there about a month ago the waitress didn't explain to us that Wednesday was free pie we kept asking her for key lime pie and unaware it was free pie day, she kept saying \" there is no key lime it's not free I was so confused I just saw key lime pie in the entrance, And you are saying  there isn't any, she said I can't bring it to you b cause it's not free!! First of all she never explain to me about that promotion. I felt so confused I ask to speak to the manager she was so mad about it, when the manager came and explain to me why the waitress wouldn't give me what I order, he explain to me today is free pie and key lime is not in the promotion I said I wanted to pay for the pie I wasn't expecting to eat for free. 

I love I hop they are so kind and modify my dish without complaining all the time."}
{"text":"I always like going here with my grandparents.  They offer a variety of foods, mostly American.  I've tried their enchiladas, and they weren't that good, so I would stick with the American foods.  The staff is usually pretty attentive, and they definitely know how to talk to the mostly senior crowd.  People seem to like their pies, and the few I've tried were \"okay,\" a little on the sweet side.  I don't know what I was expecting.  I think I'll try the cheesecake next time I'm there."}
{"text":"After being here a couple of times, I have some things to add. 
It's very hard to place an order if you have a food allergy or follows a special diet. Almost everything on their menu contains gluten, substitutions are meh. And that's every time. It's not about a specific server.
The crowd is mainly 50+ and the place smelled like a 'sweaty armpit convention' every single time I walked in.
Expect lines."}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only are the hours convenient, but the staff is so nice, and their pies are yummy!! I usually eat here for breakfast. I get seated fast and my check comes with my food, so I can check out the second I'm ready to. Their pies are not pricey, either."}
{"text":"Good prices, fair food, garbage service. There was a point where all the servers were hanging out in the kitchen, and no one was on the floor to help for over 5 minutes. Best restaurant to dine and dash from."}
{"text":"we always come to this resturant & i liked allso my kids love it & they have good deal a free pie every wednesday"}
{"text":"Their VIB menu is quite good and affordable; moreover, there's a variety of options to choose from. During wednesday, they offer free slice of pie after 10 am which is quite nice...yay for freebies haha. Place is always clean as well."}
{"text":"Food edible.  The staff there always seems tired and unhealthy.  Even for the Village Inn chains which are already pretty junky, this one is on the lower end of the scale."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place doesn't have 5 stars!? This is my go-to place for breakfast! Even when it is really busy we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. Service is quick, staff is friendly, and food is great!!! Plus, food is well priced. Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin pie I've ever eaten. We stopped in for breakfast and it was  good. But their pies looked incredible and boy was it. I was impressed. Now I make excuses to eat here just to get some pie.."}
{"text":"The management at this restaurant are the worst I have ever seen! I will never go back to this restaurant. We were treated so poorly! My wife found hair in her food and her bacon came out black and the manager didn't do anything about it and we still had to pay full price! 
I would definitely stay away from this location!!"}
{"text":"Staff was awesome. Very cheery. Good was not good, except for the pie. The pie is always good here. Had a Denver omelet. No flavor and just weird texture."}
{"text":"Don't live in this area but stopped for breakfast, clean fast and friendly. Our waitress was nice and kept checking in on us, food was correct and fresh. If in the area I'd stop here again"}
{"text":"Got to listen to our server Cheyenne complain to co-workers about her long shift while cleaning nearby tables. The complaining continued in the kitchen where I could still hear her. Top it off, Cheyenne gets a phone calls, is very loud on the phone and walks outside and past waiting customers to be seated. 

Food good as usual. Just poor service."}
{"text":"Came here around 11pm on a Saturday night and was pleased to see they close at 1am on Friday's and Saturday's. I was seated by Kierra who was very sweet and kind. I don't know how this place is during their busy hours; and because I was dining-in kinda late, there was hardly anyone there. So I expect because of that, my service was extremely good. What I especially appreciate is; you know how at some places, just because there are hardly anyone there, the staff would think it's alright to disappear for long periods of time without checking on their guests? Well, it wasn't like that. Even though there was only me and another couple, we weren't left alone very long. We were still being checked upon to see if we needed anything else, ect. Thumbs way up to my waitress!! She made this place very enjoyable!!
PS: From the looks of my chicken strips, I thought it was burnt (I posted a picture). I tried it and it was still soft (not hard) and very good. If yours happens to be the same, just try it!!"}
{"text":"Happy New Year brunch, after the after sun rise hike near San Tan Gold Mine with a million dollar view.  Not all of us made hike, but breakfast for all.

Jessica was very good, took care of all our requests.  Turkey dinner is our favorite with two cranberry on the side.  Eggs and all the traditional with a over kill on bacon.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"For the privilege of sitting next to the kitchen I was treated to a mediocre meal that balanced lukewarm French toast with overcooked eggs. I would have mentioned it to my server, but I feared the sweat dripping from his brow would land in my plate had he stood still long enough to actually listen to me. The entire restaurant is in need of a good scrubbing (think walls and table sides/edges) so that patrons are not forced to share space with the remnants of past meals. Overall, thumbs down."}
{"text":"I live an exit away I can't believe I'm just now coming here after 4months. Food was delicious, nothing fancy or pretty just tastes great. Raymundo was our server and he was so nice! All the waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and close as they joked with one another and working quickly but very well together. Customer Service is more than half of the reason I keep coming back to places. You either got it or you don't and this place has it!"}
{"text":"been there plenty of times, loved it every time, better then another one that we were at near 59th and thunderbird, it was dirty and so low on staff that we waited to long there.
this place has been very great to go to and we give it wor best."}
{"text":"We eat at village inn quite often I normally have great service. But tonight was a different story. First took us about 5 minutes to be greeted, when server came took our drink and dinner order at the same time. I never got the salad I ordered. We sat a long time with no refills. There was a manager that just stood at the front I overheard him talking to another employee about other employees 
I am a manager at a restaurant and servers make mistakes so I am not even made about the salad or the drinks 
I am more upset that never once did a manager walk around and see how tables were doing, what can of manager just stands in one spot the whole time"}
{"text":"Since this interaction, Village Inn has corrected the issue with a satisfacty resokution."}
{"text":"Nice 'n clean! Great air conditioning! They have Eggs Benedict! ...but sadly...the poached eggs were a little overcooked!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is better than you'd expect.... wings are awesome... beer prices run high unless you're getting one of their specials..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, drive right by this place, turn east on baseline, and drive until you get to Black Bear Diner on the south side of the street. Bad food, bad service."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been more pleased! Service was great, thanks Kim, and food was delicious. Had a rough, long day with a loved one at Mayo clinic. Needed some food, it was late and we were tired. Kim was friendly, the place was clean, (even the menus were not sticky) and everyone found something to order. Pot roast gets an A, so does the bacon spinach omlete. Good pancakes, and my not was just what my late night tummy wanted. So glad we chose here over Denny's!"}
{"text":"I seriously considered giving this Village Inn 4 stars.  I know.  It is the Village Inn.  Let me explain...  I had just finished an hour long torture session at Mesa Community College's track/playing fields with a group of friends. (1) We were Hungry (hungry with a capital \"H\").   None of us live in Mesa.  No Yelp due diligence had been completed on the area.  Someone mentioned seeing an IHop at the corner of Dobson and Southern.  Done.  We get there. My heart sinks.  It is not an IHop.  It is a Village Inn.  \"Oh no,\" I thought secretly to myself, \"NOT the Village Inn.\" (2)  But the collective decision had been made.  The group charged in.  Five minutes later, we were seated in a large u-shaped booth.  There were crumbs on the seat and little hand prints all over the mirror behind us.  Children were here before us.  A busboy promptly cleaned up the mess.  By this point, my expectations could not have gotten any lower.  I scanned the menu in despair thinking, \"That sounds good, but can it be properly executed at a Village Inn?\"  Our server, Danny D. arrived.  He greeted us with much enthusiasm and a genuine smile.   He began taking orders, making his way around the table.  By the time he got to me, I was still at a loss.  I looked at him and stated, \"I have a problem with the menu.\"  \"Okay... what's the problem.\"  \"Nothing is quite what I want.\" I describe the breakfast that I do want, a veggie omelet with real eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and fruit on the side. (3)  \"No problem.  We can do that.\"  My mood brightened.  After about 10 minutes the food arrived.  It looked pretty good.   And then I took a bite.  The eggs were light and fluffy, good veggie to omelet ratio, just the right amount of cheese, and piping hot.  Somewhat stunned, I stated, \"Wow, this is actually really good.\"  My friends look similarly stunned.  My feelings were echoed.  \"Yeah, my food is really good too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"This is fantastic.\"   \"My taste buds are so happy right now.\" To top it all off,  Danny D. was a total rock star server, circling back to bring extra condiments, more napkins, and fresh coffee throughout the meal, and always with a palpable sense of brightness and cheer.  Maybe it was a fluke experience.  Maybe we were all so hungry that dog food would have tasted good? But then again, maybe not.  Maybe this Village Inn is just a diamond in the rough?  Only time will tell.  

(1) See my review regarding Iron Gloves Boxing located in Tempe, Arizona for more information.  

(2)  My experience with this particular chain has not been good.  I have bad memories of going to a Village Inn in Albuquerque with my grandparents and being forced to eat rubbery inedible scrambled eggs. Sometimes with hair.

(3)  The veggie omelet is a \"healthy\" menu item.  Ordered standard, it is made with egg substitute and served with whole grain pancakes."}
{"text":"I used to come here at least once a month...but boy...this morning will the last time I came here. Word cannot express how much my stomach hurts after having breakfast here this morning. I ordered a 4 items meal which includes eggs, fruits, 1/2 waffles and 2 sausages. The eggs and sausages were super greasy...but I ate it. I wouldn't be writing this right Now if my stomach isn't in a tremendous amount of pain. No way I'll come back here again."}
