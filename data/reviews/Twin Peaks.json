{"text":"You must have the Chili.  It is served Texas Stlye, no beans, with several types of meats.   Awesome!   The bowl serving could be larger, but only because it was that good!!"}
{"text":"Big Twin Peaks but very expensive beer- $9 for a Coors lite that would be no more than $6 at their other locations."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant  and bar on the strip that makes you feel like you are not in Las Vegas. Having 3 different floors great food and reasonable prices for drinks. Especially for being in Las Vegas. The staff is always really friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever if your not sitting bar top. We sit bar top and the gals up there are amazing, attentive, and act like they care. The girls on the floor are terrible patio especially. Anytime we get stuck on the patio we might as well serve ourselves. Had 3 different servers today and none of them came to us, we had to seek them out........ disappointed. I know you want the girls decent looking for reasons but please get some talent or at the very least girls who actually want to be there. If it's a chore to come to work it shows to all your clients. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to show someone from out of state how Vegas is with cute girls in short shorts and good bar food . Except the fact that the service wasn't the best , the girl was too distracted by all the other men and dancing around like a fool . The food was horrible with a small menu so not a lot of choices . It was my first time along with his and I was embarrassed , will not being going there again ."}
{"text":"Walked in and some high chick tried to get me to tip her for a table. 3 girls asked me for a tip within 30 seconds in the door and not one showed us a table. Ordered a shot ski and it was about half a shot and tasted watered down. I half jokingly told the waitress that it wasn't a shot and it was weak, she immediately sicked the manager on me, manager said she would send me a free shot. The shot ended up being on the bill later.  Next, the burger I got was about as thin as mcdonalds makes them. It was $15 btw. When it was time to get the bill, my  (not free) shot was on someone else's ticket. After the shot ski thing the waitress was a total bitch. We didn't correct the multiple mistakes on our tickets and went somewhere else for a beer."}
{"text":"My review is based mostly on customer service and atmosphere.  It was bikini week when we went there.  I forgot our waitress name but she was Asian, petite, super sweet and we had our kids were with us so we were quite demanding of her.  She was definitely on top of things and we left her. 22% tip becuz of that.  We loved all the TVs everywhere and will come back but will try a different food item.  The app platter was yummy but our burgers were so so."}
{"text":"Quality American pub fare with an exceptional atmosphere provided by the waitresses, with special notation to kirstyn, we have had her a few times and with each the service has been genuine,  fast, and accurate.  The staff is very upbeat and are sure to provide excellent morale for any occasion.  We've yet to have a negative experience here."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks has cold beers, eye candy and food! What more could you ask for! Oh and the beautiful and amazing waitress Bianca is the reason I keep coming back, she was very helpful and patient with me. This is my new spot hands down!"}
{"text":"Best place for an iced cold beer.  And I mean iced cold.  Served under freezing temperatures.  Its awesome.  The menus short but everything I've ordered has been good.  I like the ghost pepper wings and the billionaire bacon burger.  Too many tattoos in there though...unless you're into that of course.  Great place to watch sports as well."}
{"text":"My 2Â¢'s worth of opinion. Most all other reviews are straight on. Nice selection of TV's, ice cold draft beers. Service was good at bar not great but no ignoring on getting drinks. My only complaint is no attention to people at the bar by the bar tenders. I have been traveling from Fl to San Fran & have stopped in every major city & great bars on the way & have had conversations with many bar tenders. Here they seem to stick with their pack & talk with each other. Note girls, great time 30%, TIP, just another customer 10-15%. I'm never coming back, so why waste my money. Less you believe they were busy, 2 bar tenders 8 at bar less than 30 in restaurant with waitresses. I'm just saying!"}
{"text":"Every single bartender is a rookie. Not one of them knows the basic ingredients in any common drink! They didn't hire these chicks for their brains or abilities!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was not the best. They forgot the honey mustard even after we asked, they didn't refill our waters and they just never came back to check and see if we needed anything else after the food was delivered. But great food :)"}
{"text":"This use to be the place to go, it has turned into a complete mess as of lately. Came here yesterday and waited over 10 minutes and no one came to serve us. Decided to come back today and it took 7 min, we waited only because the Thursday Night football game was about to start. As we left we placed an order to go, got home and they gave us they wrong order. They said they would put the order right in and started driving back. Got to restaurant and order was still not in, had to wait for 6 wings. Last time we visit, going to miss the good food, but the service has really sucked as of lately!"}
{"text":"I've gave this place multiple chances because I'm optimistic that the service will get better and its on the way home from work...and they still haven't found bartenders that will greet you in a timely manner and not wait till hell freezes over to get you a cold beer...only thing this place is good for is wasting your time and money driving and dinning there...although they have decent bar food and cold beers you might die of thirst or hunger before you actually get to enjoy one of those.! Two words(Tilted Kilt)"}
{"text":"Pretty much what most have been saying on here. Food is below marginal. Great atmosphere and the beers are great. TVs all over. The food , well the food you don't want to eat. I felt some what queasy after my pulled pork sliders. The waitresses are very nice but not to bright and some wear WAY too much makeup. But I digress. The food is far below marginal and it came out a little cold, the bun my pulled pork sat in was dry and almost stale. I think it was past it's expiration date by a week."}
{"text":"DON'T BUY THE SOUVENIR MUG!    Contrary to what they tell you, other locations will not honor it for use/refill.   Long story short, I bought the frozen mug because the server said that other locations would fill it for the \"man beer\" price and you would get a few ounces more as it is a tad bit bigger than the standard glass mug. For the $20 bucks I thought that would be cool.   Look it to my local AZ location. Received a few comments from others at the bar and had a few folks interested in checking out the vegas location on their next trip. Bar tender filled it up when I explained what/where it was from. Having fun so far, glad I bought it.   After enjoying my beer and burger, asked for a refill. Was told that she couldn't because the manager said no.   Not her fault. I was upset that the manager didn't tell me himself (lame to make tipped staff give bad news; what if I was not a cool guy and took it out on her tip?) and that the vegas store either lied to me or their corporate does a horrible job of communicating what these mugs are to the non-vegas locations.   I emailed corporate so I'll update this if they respond. In the interim, as cool as the mug is (good quality, stays cold forever), don't buy it unless you don't care about using it locally (ie outside vegas).   Oh, the food was awesome as always and the server was attentive, important in Vegas. One star because of the mug fiasco."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome service! Ask for Chelsey, she's very attentive with a great personality!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in to see if a friend of mine was working that evening (she wasn't).  After a couple of $18 Lynchburg Lemonades (prices which were conveniently not displayed on the menu), I left feeling like Jodie Foster in \"The Accused.\"  The bartender Courtenay was friendly and extremely attentive; so, this review is certainly not based on service.  Rather, Courtenay's service is why Twin Peaks is getting 2 Stars rather than one.  The pricing was a definite reminder as to why, as I local, I've learned to avoid The Strip."}
{"text":"This place seems to be hit or miss on service and I agree with the others who gave low ratings.  The wife and I were visiting in March and first time we walked in 3 waitresses were just standing around talking and no one seemed interested in seating us their conversation must have been more interesting, we turned and walked out.  We came back on another day, second chance.  This time we were seated and our waitress was friendly and very helpful with the menu.  The other waitresses seemed to have an attitude.  The food was good but I later had an upset stomach from the chili.  With a whole lot of restaurants opening in Vegas I probably won't be back unless your Yelp ratings improve.  Get friendlier personnel and expand your menu."}
{"text":"Cute girls, service sucks bad and the have no personality. .. not a great experience. .. i will never come back.... go ASU!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time early in September and loved it. We had Melissa and she was GREAT! so sweet and attentive. We will definitely request her next time! Food was great!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and scantily clad and no surprise 8/10 people in the place were men.  The beer is served in frosted mugs   That is a red flag that this place is trying to appeal to the bud-light drinking-sports-bar-patron. The beer temperature is way too cold. The low temp might be fine for some kinds of beer, but an IPA should not be served ice-cold in a frosted mug that weights 5lbs.  Anyways, the menu is average bar food and pretty forgettable.  If you're looking for Hooters or Tilted Kilt type experience you should be fine with Twin Peaks as they are fairly similar establishments."}
{"text":"Thank you TP! Great service by Coleen and Princess! Food was great!!! Gotta love Twin Peaks! Will definitely be coming back in again!"}
{"text":"Meh...food was ok. Scenery was ok.  Service was fine.   The Philly cheese steak was pretty greasy.  I was here two years ago and it seemed a lot better than now as far as what the servers were (almost) wearing.  I might try it again...maybe this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to get an ice and I mean the coldest beer in Charlotte.  Awesome on a hot humid summer day.  Great service and the bar fair is quite excellent."}
{"text":"I'm sharing my personal experience because I appreciate reviews, good or bad.  We had a quick snack at this place. The service was fast and friendly, the girls are pretty and the food was good. We sat on the balcony and we enjoyed the view. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great location to watch sports and get a cold drink. Sitting at the bar gave me plenty of opportunity to watch sexy professional woman work. Selena the bartender quickly handled orders, and her trainee Kayla kept up with the demands. The bar back Michael was impressive as he kept everything tidy, while giving advice to the servers to present great food. Had a great time here!  Food was excellent and my beer was as cold as a Minnesota day. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I can't give a zero..eventhough it would be plenty.  Being in the customer service industry for over 30 years, it is what I believe would ALWAYS win repeat customers and great reviews. This place clearly has none. It is with the hopes of dressing their servers in merely \"hooker attire\"  to lure old men to be the basis of their repeat clientele. Good luck with that.  Upon arricing 40 min early for the Thursday first NFL game, the girlie greeting us with considerable empty tables scattered throufhout the restaurant, told us they were all reserved. Really?? They dont even reserve tables. The next thing I asked was if I could put my name on the \"list\" to be seated on next available. The girlie told me that she wouldn't know when if ever I could be seated before the game was over....REALLY?? If you don't want my money that badly...trust me, you will NEVER GET ONE PENNY! Hope the old men keep you sustained...I predict a fall in months to come."}
{"text":"Mr. Harris said that there were antlers on the walls, so we went here. He can be country when he wants to. Ordered beers from not so busy bartenders - I don't know if it was a good night or not, as it was Saturday - but they could've been friendlier. Although, to be fair, the patrons were rusty on their manners, so that probably was to blame. They had live music just getting started when we paid to leave, but I wasn't too interested in staying. He and I both had beers."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is my favorite sports bar and they have amazing food selection. My favorite bartender is Jordan and also my favorite manager is Dawn. With these two girls at your side you know you will always have a wonderful time here. They really care about their customers"}
{"text":"Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time the other night with my girl friend for a quick bite and some beers.  I didn't really expect too much from the food being that it is a sports bar after all, but thought it was pretty good   The reason for the 2 star review was that for some reason management seemed to have yanked all of the servers off of the floor for some kind of meeting in the kitchen which was noticed by everyone in our section of the restaurant.  We ordered more beers prior to all of this, which after 15 minutes and having finished all of our food, we opted for a water which also took an additional 10-15 more minutes.   It was by no means a busy night and the excuses and apologize from the waitress that we had only go so far.   We ended up finally getting the bill probably 30-45 minutes past when we had hoped to leave.  Disappointed, we will probably not return with so many other local microbreweries in the area that we have had far more pleasant experiences at."}
{"text":"The food was ok but not anything to write home about, bland and something I could have easily found somewhere at home to be ehh about. I can say I told other people not to waste their time and money here. The only reason this place got 2 stars was that it was clean and out waitress was great. She may be one of the only reasons the place stays in business. Unfortunately, I can not remember her name but if you do go there see if you can get the waitress with the Perfect Circle tattoo on her back."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice looking girls, love the theme. Cheese dip was cold and wings were ok. They changed the tv for us. Would not bring the kiddies though. We will go. Back."}
{"text":"As a glistening lesbian woman who loves beer and enjoys watching sports in pubs, I would rate this place a solid 3.  They have the real \"cold beer\" on tap and amazing tv's everywhere to watch games....even in the booths.  I know this is a chain and it's all about the \"twin peaks\", but these girls they have working, lack customer service skills.  I would enjoy if they hired real ladies that have more personality....and some dudes in booty shorts, too.  Equal rights. :-) As for the food, I can't say...but I would assume it's typical bar food."}
{"text":"Had fish tacos- very good and also the mixed vegetables as a side- excellent.  Thanks Erica for great service."}
{"text":"We figured it was a lovely afternoon to conduct some business on the patio at Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  Good service by our waitress, passable appetizers but it all came with a shock.  Our waitress, Janell (??) was very helpful but approached our table about an hour later and said they're instituting a cover charge and that she could \"...go ahead an add $15 to our check for a party of three.\"  Personally, I was shocked as our tab was already north of $80 (and climbing) and we hadn't even ordered our meal.   I ask to speak to the manager and about ten minutes later he arrives to say that it's \"corporate policy\" and that they always do that when there's an event.  Plus, there was \"now a sign that we can go look at that mentions a $5 cover\", which wasn't at the door at our arrival time.  So it was basically, \"We'll add $15 to your bill or you can leave\".  I talked about how this is  neighborhood bar, our bill was almost $100 already before we even ordered an entree and it wasn't clear that there was a \"special event\" taking place, our hostess mentioned nothing, there was no sign (at the time) and our waitress was just as surprised as we were about the requirement to add an additional $15 to our bill.  I was told that I was free to leave and read the sign that is now in front of the door.  The manager insisted that we pay an additional $15 or vacate.    We decided to wrap up business, leave the bar and went elsewhere for dinner.  The manager decides to end our evening without an opportunity to order an entree, closes our check and makes it clear that our business isn't welcome.  Twin Peaks has a great bar and a great patio during the afternoon, but the indifference of their manager completely turned me off from returning.  Visiting during the afternoon to conduct some business on the deck, never.  This was a piss-poor experience and sadly, the manager doesn't care."}
{"text":"A small group of us checked this out during happy hour on a wednesday after they opened Jan 17th.    They seem to have succeeded in their marketing claims of offering better food, colder beer, and hotter girls than their competitors Hooters, Titled Kilt, etc.  As a \"Caveman comfort food\" concept restaurant chain from Texas, there are few options for less fat and salt.  Options for lower calories and vegatarians is limited to salads and grilled vegetables, which was very fresh and grilled with oil. Overall we all thought the food tended to be either too spicy or too salty, but freshly cooked.  Inside was extremely loud with some nice booths but tables in the bar were incredibly close together as the scantily clad waitresses bounced and bumped their way between patrons, perhaps its a feature for this concept restaurant.  The outdoor patio area has a big fire pit along with the fireplaces from the previous Earl's restaurant.  Adding to the noise are big glass doors to improve the view from freeway on-ramp traffic."}
{"text":"This is my very first negative review on Yelp. I had a very unhappy experience.  I was with 11 other people on a Saturday night, we went in, and were told that there would be a wait which we were fine with. Almost immediately after that a hostess approached us and told us that a table large enough to accommodate us was ready, but we would have to pay a $5 cover charge each. That was fine, we all paid, and went inside to find out that there wasn't really a table, they just got us to pay, sent us to the bar, and got told to order drinks there. We felt duped, we paid for a table that wasn't even there, then sent to the bar to spend money while we waited. Good job getting us in the door under false pretenses. After a while they told us that a table was ready, then took us to a 4 seat table (high top), and said that the others near it would be opening up soon. One didn't open up the whole time we were there, the other opened up 20 minutes after part of our party was sat. The second table opened up all the way across the room from the first. This left us scattered, some of us standing, and none of us getting served at the same time. I asked the hostess why she'd even told us that we could be sat, and said that it lacked integrity, she agreed, and moved along with her business almost dismissively.   We were just out to have fun, and catch up. We couldn't do so, were scattered through the restaurant, and feeling disappointed. Our server, Shannon, was very nice, the food was good, and the atmosphere was amicable. It's just a shame that the hostesses were dishonest, and lacked any modicum of integrity.   I won't be going back. I won't be the person to tell all of my friends not to go, but I won't put it on the table of choices to visit in future. In losing us you lost many. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Let me first say that the young ladies who work here are very beautiful and for the most part, very friendly.   It isn't at all busy tonight and the two girls wandering around haven't been much help to us. They basically seated us and left. A man came from the back and asked if we had been helped and then the bartender left her customers to come take care of us. The two waitresses never came back but are currently up front dancing on each other and gossiping. We have yet to receive a check, let alone be waited on... we probably would have ordered more drinks or appetizers but not now.   Too bad. I had heard great things."}
{"text":"Hanging out with Amber and Selena they are the best bartenders on the strip. The food here is good too. My food always comes out on time and hot, bartenders like these two ladies are why I keep coming back. Chicken wings cold beer, maybe a water or two as well."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the excellent service and friendly staff keep bringing me back. I usually sit at a table and try to be in either Cassidy, Kayla or Candyss sections. They're the best server's they have at the place. If you get seated with them you wont be disappointed, I can promise you that.  If you don't want to sit at a table and just relax at the bar, you need to talk to Shelby and Adrian. They're the most awesome bartenders I've ever had. Both were very friendly and informative about the wide variety of alcoholic selection they had in stock. If you talk to those girls, you'll be laughing all night long. Also I never saw the bottom of my glass, they always made sure the beer was refilled in a timely manner. These ladies really make you want to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Food, Philly Cheesesteak, was a great sandwich with fresh hoagie! Staff was polite, quick, and professional."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Samantha was our server and she was great! Breast wishes!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like going to a strip club. Hmm, but I also want really BIG beers at a premium price. I also kind of have a thing for angry women. Well HUZZAH! lads, I've got a place for you: Twin Peaks!  Look, it's pretty standard for someone to say \"I go there for the 'view'\". And there ya have it. Douchey bro clientele, angry albeit attractive waitresses who don't want to actually work for their tips, and high prices. Also: BLARINGLY loud music to keep the conversation at a minimum and the drinking to a maximum.  Blech."}
{"text":"Someone described TP to me as being like Hooters but better. I'm convinced he was not referencing the food. Because it is just awful.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place showed up on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.   I never believed there was such a thing as a bad B.L.T. until now.  There is something not right about the sourdough bread this is served on. And the bacon isn't the best quality either. So order at your own risk. BTW...it is supposed to come with 5 strips of bacon. Mine came with 3.  The tomato soup however, is pretty good. But I wouldn't go out of my way for it.    My girlfriend had the smokehouse burger. She may as well have just ordered a bottle of cooking oil bc this thing was sloppy greasy and not very appealing. It is a rather large burger & it was crammed into a basket. Watching her try to manipulate it out was difficult & painful.   Atmosphere is \"ok.\"  We were seated at a high-top for 2 pushed up against a table for 6.  It was uncomfortable; felt like we were intruding on the group we were seated with.   There are tons of tv's around the bar & I noticed tv's at each booth. I actually think this is pretty cool...you can watch your game of choice without craning your neck to see what's on at the bar.   I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a sports bar or not. On the one hand, there are tv's a plenty tuned to various sport networks.  On the other, it is decorated as a log cabin with game heads galore, and moose printed fabrics on the chairs.  It's a large place but the way tables are arranged is odd: wide open like a warehouse on one side, cramped on another.   Everything on the menu is fried & there really isn't a theme. Bar food mixed with pot roast & meatloaf. I'm somewhat confused.   If you are wondering about bathrooms, you have 3 options: family, \"sit 2 p,\" and \"stand 2 p.\"    Overall, if you're looking for a spot to watch a game & grab a bevie this might be a great spot. If you're looking to actually grab a good meal...go elsewhere.   I am not sure what to say about the servers' \"costumes.\" Elly May Clampett meets Hooters is the best I can do.  3/8 update: Double check your receipt against your statement. What I signed for & what was charged are different amounts & not in my favor. DEFINITELY hate this place."}
{"text":"Two stars for the those twin peaks. Everything else sucks. Got some wings which were just okay. Food is nothing special and service sucked, especially for not being that busy."}
{"text":"Friendly service, decent food.  The fish tacos were very good, but the beer mug was so frozen the it actually froze the foam... I guess that's better then warm beer."}
{"text":"Pretty much a Bass Pro Shop collided with a Hooters, but with better food and they don't sell guns or rods.  Make sure you take note of the reviews about this place.  Most chick reviews hate it...hmm wonder why."}
{"text":"Sex on the peaks drink is definitely a shot ladies should try if they want a sweet taste.  taking 3 shots of it will not even hit you hard.  The food is so far decent. I noticed that if you go in larger groups your food tends to feel and taste colder compare if you go in a small group."}
{"text":"The servers are super nice, we had a server dressed as an army person and one with an angel costume on and both servers were really nice and helpful"}
{"text":"sat at bar with buddy... got a draft , emptied it, waited for bartender 10 minutes...finally gave up, moved to patio, waited 15 minutes....not even water , meanwhile , 7 different waitresses came and went to other tables, never even looked over.  In my opinion, the waitresses and bartenders appear to be air heads doing the bare minimum while waiting for 'Mr. Right' to come along to save them & pay their bills.....watch them cluster into little cliques to have useless conversations having nothing to do with what they're supposed to be doing.  Go work at a strip club....if u want $ just for being pretty, at least put in an honest days work instead of pretending to be a waitress."}
{"text":"We always have a great time at Twin Peaks....Fun fun fun !!! Great food and HOTT girls! !!!!"}
{"text":"The service is crap. asked for a split check at a table of 12 and brought the whole thing on one check, when we asked to have it split they said they couldn't and just assumed we wanted it on one check even after we asked for separate checks. They CANT split a check. They are that lazy"}
{"text":"Over-priced food that under-performs in taste and consistency.  that would be my one sentence description or review. Sure the girls are good looking, sure your beer is about $1-2 per beer priced for it, sure the girls are not making that extra $1 or 2 in their paycheck (I am sure they are still $3 per hour plus tips)  The beer is cold, but actually ANY BEER SNOB would tell you the idea temperature for beer is between 40 - 50 degrees F. NOT 29degrees.  the location is pretty good off of FLW and 101 so it is a meeting site we have used on multiple occasions - big parking lot helps.  but everything inside could be dramatically improved if they were not after the horny old men or the party guys in the neighborhood. it is a very popular place to watch fight night.  Food is over-priced an average at best. at least unlike Zipps (down the street) it is consistent. Zipps is not even consistent!"}
{"text":"Well after leaving Iron Thunder Saloon - Concord, I figured I'd visit Twin Peaks just across the highway......no way that my food service experience could get any worse......  Another BIG mistake!  I arrived and asked for a high top table....one was available but guess what...no waitress was assigned for that table.  Weird because all the other tables in that section were occupied and being served.  Then another one just happened to be open but wasn't cleared off yet.  Hostess asked me to sit at front until it was ready.....so after 15 minutes of waiting, I finally asked hostess if the table was ready.  And of course it was ready but they were too busy to put down the tablets and phone to get me seated.....finally I was seated.  Waitress swung by to say she'd be right there but after 10 minutes of isolation, manager saw me without drink or food and asked what I would like to drink.  Took my beer some time to get there and then more time for waitress to finally show up to get order.    Ordered, received my order, consumed it, got the bill and paid in cash and left a 3 cent tip.  I think the waitress said a total of 20 words to me during my visit.  I really enjoy all my visits to Twin Peaks but this will be my last time visiting the one at Concord Mills.  Absolutely terrible visit to a poorly run establishment.    Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pros: Food & overall environment. The pulled pork nachos were something new for me, but totally delicious. The environment was nice, sitting outside we were spaced far enough away from other tables without feeling neglected. Tv's in view of almost all of the tables, all sorts of sports to watch and keep entertained. Good booze, good food.  The cons: The service was pretty \"blah\". Our waitress didn't check on us while we were eating, another waitress refilled our drinks, I did order a pretzel as a starter but it came out after all of the dinner came out"}
{"text":"The \"scenary\" is pretty good...Jewels, Red head Ashley, and Lacey are the best! Food is decent...as a guy it's hard not to be a fan...I consider this a jump up from a Hooters scene...tvs everywhere so not a bad spot for the fellas to get together and watch sports..."}
{"text":"Worst Burger I have ever had. Bbq sauce bad, buns completely soggy, didn't have a good flavor, fries were bad. Not a place I would return."}
{"text":"I went with two other friends for happy hour. The beers were super cold and they have a nice variety of appetizers.  I especially love the fried pickles and the pulled pork sliders. The hostess and the waitress were very friendly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a gal,  I don't go here for boobs.  Have had many fun times here with my husband and friends.  Food was good and service.  Actually had my own birthday party here a few years ago on the top floor,  great view of strip!  Good, until this weekend.  Asked yesterday if we could reserve a table for football for today,  Sunday. Got told in demeaning tone, no.  Noted to gal at door that we did this for years.  No answer. Talked to 2nd gal, same condescending attitude and answer.   Went today about an hour b4 game and told \"we're full\" by door gals .  No help with putting name in, nothing,  just we're full and no suggestions to possibly get a table.   Sad.    Why so full of yourselves?    Hey,  Cosmopolitan has a great spots book /bar.  Next door is Nacho Daddy,  good food and friendly folks + tvs.  Try something else!"}
{"text":"Chill Spot. Erica behind the bar was cool peeps. She recommended a great meal. Great hospitality! Very personable with a very infectious smile! I will definitely stop through here when I am in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to drink, enjoy the view and watch sports on their numerous large flat screen TVs.  On this day I had to wait a little too long to be served.  The bartender apologized and informed me that several bartenders, servers, barbacks and kitchen staff had called in \"sick\" today (EDC Weekend).   I finally had a chance to sample the food yesterday. Tried the Pulled Pork Nachos.  Nice size portion, however, very skimpy on the meat and cheese.  Also their barbecue sauce was way too cold & SWEET.  Only the nachos on the top were luke warm as I worked my way down they got colder and colder.  The cheese was cold and not melted at all.  I told the bartender I wasn't very happy with the food, so the manager came over and offered to remake them or take them off the bill. I chose the latter.  2 Stars for food, 3 for Customer Service"}
{"text":"Love this bar! The owner is fabulous and the girls are super attentive! During a \"big fight\", the owner reserved us a booth to watch our college game. They even let me borrow a phone charger."}
{"text":"OK one word DUH .......... \" great views\"  guess the joke is on me !!! The ultimate joke bomb.  Yes the view is awesome , very distracting actually.  The girls are HOT and were all wearing tiny variations of Santa and elf costumes. They were all very sweet and friendly, explained the menu offered to let us sample beers.  ( this was my first time there )    I'm absolutely in LOVE with their beer Dirty Blonde, it's a great Hefe with just enough sweetness to it. They are serious about their beer being COLD ! 29 F to be exact,  I can't wait to come back in the middle of the summer.  That beer is going to be sooooooo good on a 115 degree day.    I had the green chile meatloaf with mac and cheese.  Also a quesadilla with chili . Both were really good, not your typical bar food.  The service was great throughout and we had a terrific time.  They have stolen me away from Tilted Kilt forever !!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, smiling and very persistent. I definitely recommend the billionaire bacon, but anything you choose will be delicious !"}
{"text":"Poor service. Boneless wings all breading and no flavor. \"Blazing\" wing sauce was nothing but Tabasco sauce. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is such an amazing restaurant, and i really enjoy the atmosphere! Great service and awesome food. The spicy chipotle chicken is my favorite and the girls let me tell ya..lol!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun dining experience. (P.S. ask to be seated with Shakira...you won't be disappointed.)"}
{"text":"Twin peaks is a new and awesome sports bar that's got a country log cabin vibe to it, the girls there are beautiful and the service is amazing, it also just may be the coldest beer I've ever had on tap,    I recommend the smoke house burger, and a man size corona on tap"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was good. The mozzarella cheese was good and the pot roast was very moist and flavorful. The server on the other hand was not what I expected. When asked what she recommended did not really have an opinion. She did not really interact with us. I orders one mozzarella and two showed up at different times. Observing other staff some had a wonderful smile but others had a look of anger. I might be back."}
{"text":"Food was decent and portions were large but the service stunk. I went with my husband and one of his friends. The girl was too busy chatting and up selling two old guys at the next table. It was too bad because my husband and his friend were there to drink."}
{"text":"Great place! Very open atmosphere and the staff was excellent! Probably the best chicken quesadillas I've had!"}
{"text":"My wife and I  walked in last evening, and  saw the B sanitation rating of 88% as we entered the door. Without hesitation turned around and left!  I worked in the food industry yeas ago and and can say anything less than than 93% is unacceptable. Until this number comes way  up, we are done this Twin Peaks at Concord."}
{"text":"My Twin Peaks experience was great. I'm visiting from Philly and sat at the bar last night. I had wonderful service from Lacey & Kirstyn, the bartenders. Love the cold beer but wished they had a 16-ounce pint size. Twin Peaks isn't in the northeast part of the country. Hope that changes soon. I'll be visiting Twin Peaks again when I'm back in town. Maybe, Lacey & Kirstyn will be at bar again. Could I be so lucky?"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off & say that management at this location is wonderful and has tried to rectify the situation.  Long story short, Twin Peaks definitely caters towards men, yes we all know that. That's the thing. But when a table of a couple walks in, gets seated and waits... And waits... And waits. There is no server in sight.  Then a table of 2 gentlemen get seated right next to us... Well... The server magically appears.  I just feel like if there is going to be a business regardless of the theme, practice appropriate customer service skills. I love the beer there but I can say i will never go back, because as a female, I enjoy being treated the same way as every other guest."}
{"text":"FIRST time to this location, Waitress suggested VEGAS size beer (32oz)  When the beer arrived it was definitely VEGAS size.  However it was a beer slushy not drinkable.  The manager did take care of the problem and offered travelers.  Food is great as usual at TP.  I will be back but ordering a MAN size beer.  No gimmick slushy beer container."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sliders. Great....  . And the hard cherry cider a hit with me. R girl Melissa was the best. Thank u."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is usually busy - why... young girls, jiggling   Service level is average at best  Food - not worth ordering here  The beer is ICE cold and it is fun to watch the ice melt inside and outside of your mug - but honestly it is overpriced you are paying for the views rather than the beer.  TV's are awesome, incredible and the one reason to go to Twin Peaks - sporting events but expect no service during the event  If you want this, be a man and go to a strip club instead you will have more fun."}
{"text":"Twin peaks is great.. Everyone there is great.. Manager's, servers, and bussers... Very friendly place.. Our server Indiana was very sweet and nice.. Come see her and the gang at twin peaks...."}
{"text":"I would call it the worst experience I had in my entire life. The food was alright but the service is just awful. We went there with a group of 5. After having some starters the waitress came back to get the main course orders. I was unfortunately at the bathroom when she took the orders. She never came back so I didn't have any food except for the starter. My friend got a burger that came partly frozen. He told the waitress and she brought it back heated up in the microwave. What should I say? Savages? Third world? Or just US & A?"}
{"text":"The food here is horrible. The first time a year ago I got food poisoning from their Pork Sliders. Ate again there on Sunday during the games and the Steak salad may have been the worst over vinigary salad I have ever had. The Buffalo Wings were cold precooked/reheated with warm sauce and cold meat/bones.    The service is so/so but whats sad is this company is suppose to be known for really really pretty servers and some girls with twin peaks ( o Y o )  it's a bunch of flat chested overly tattoed skanks."}
{"text":"Dave. Henderson.  I love the place but. I am never ordering a burger there again. The burger was a defrosted thin mcdonalds Big Mac style single patty. With less taste. Where's the beef. I ordered a venison chili burger but there was so little chili I had to call the waitress to show it to me. She lifted the bun with her hand touched the patty and said it was between the cheese and the patty. I still couldn't find it. She took it back and brought the same one back. And said that's the way they make it. The manager brought a dinky little bowl of chili but no spoon.  Service was not good. Too bad"}
{"text":"25 minutes to get a shot,22 minutes for my cocktail..70 minutes for a chicken sandwich and pot roast..... The wait was just silly for anything I asked for, it was busy but still plenty of open tables.  Fried pickles good but wayyy too salty, Chipotle chicken decent. Fries were obscenely salty and barely edible. Chix quesadilla good but small portion. Margarita was pricey."}
{"text":"So when you've had a rough night and have to skip breakfast, stop at Twin Peaks for an early lunch.  When we arrived I kind of expected bad food and waitresses with attitudes like hooters but we were unexpectedly impressed!  The food was great, as was the view of the strip from the 3rd floor balcony.  We went for lunch 2 days in a row!  Even though we said we weren't going to start drinking until later in the day, a couple of the lovely waitresses talked us into it."}
{"text":"I just go here for the confident girls that were fake tans, big boobs and little shorts really really well. Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint  I always get great service, they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer)   First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the nba finals game 7.  Get here early to avoid the wait during big sporting events. Our group had to wait an hour to get in which was fine because there's a margarita bar next door with TVs too.  We got a seat with its own tv which was cool.  The staff here are very eye appealing and have a great attitudes.  As for the food we ordered appetizers and didn't expect the portions to be so huge.  The taste however was just ok."}
{"text":"First visit was my last. Had pulled pork sliders. Buns were cold and greasy. Pork was dripping with oil. Pickles and cabbage didn't seem to go with the pork. I couldn't eat even one of the three served. My partner had a hamburger which was just average. French fries tasted of rancid cooking oil that was long over due for a change.  If this place stays open much longer, I'll be surprised."}
{"text":"Would've been ok but our waitress decided to ignore us. Talked to a manager twice, then found the waitress who said just give me a minute (after waiting about 25 minutes for the beer I ordered). She wasn't concerned until she found out we spoke with a manager and were not happy."}
{"text":"Average service, terrible terrible fat drenched food. Good for frustrated frat boys. Avoid."}
{"text":"thanks Taylor your were the best! had a super fun time when I came to this Twin Peaks"}
{"text":"Awesome food and spectacular service, especially Julissa and Christie!!! The food is fresh and a good variety. The place is clean and well maintained. Hostesses make you feel welcome. Enviroment is nice, especially man cave."}
{"text":"I stopped for dinner at Twin Peaks while I was driving back to California from Texas, and the Angry Balls drink, which is beer mixed with cinnamon whiskey, was extremely good. It was like an alcoholic apple pie. I had two waitresses serving me, Lilly who started my order, and Kimberly who finished it, both of whom were very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??"}
{"text":"First time ever there. Girls were really friendly and nice. I had yummy tomato soup and a steak Salad. The salad was fresh and tasty and the meat was cooked well. I think that there should have maybe been a bit more steak in the salad. The beer was ice cold and fantastic.. a great place to hang out. I would go again."}
{"text":"The waitresses were as advertised (i.e. some great scenery).  We had some wings and the BBQ pork nachos.  Both were tasty.  The beer was good and was served in frosty glasses."}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other day. Not a great experience but could've been better. Our food was not prepared as we'd liked and our waitress took it back and brought out another. It was better than the first but still not what we wanted. They did take it off our bill though, so that was nice. Other than that, our waitress was excellent and because of the service I'd go back, the food was good, not great."}
{"text":"Sliders are to die for, and the Queso rocks.  Enjoy the scenery as well!!!"}
{"text":"The last fee times we have come in here the place keeps getting worse.  The bathrooms are always a mess and service is terrible especially the girls seating you at the front."}
{"text":"Ok WAY OVER RATED!!!!! The food is overpriced sub par bar food, service was slow our waitress made us feel we were wasting her time.  Seems she had some friends at another table that needed more attention than us. Music was a bit loud to hold a conversation with our group.  Will not return. Customer service is key to me you can almost over come an over priced sub par meal with great customer service but if that sucks it's salt in the wound. ,We as customers are spending our hard earned money in these places MANAGEMENT/OWNERS please invest in customer service it is so important."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a cold beer watch some sports or look at  the attractive women that work there in skimpy outfits.  Food is OK not memorable, typical sports bar food, beer selection is average not a lot of variety if you like craft beer."}
{"text":"This is not really my type of place, but we had the best time at there Super Bowl party! Didn't eat the food, and we just Bombay on the rocks, but the atmosphere was fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Service has improved and the Chicken Poblano sandwich has become a favorite.  Food is always served hot and its consistently good!"}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere definitely two steps up from Hooters. The food was good and reasonably priced. Great indoor/outdoor bar with lots of nice TVs to watch a game.  I didn't have a drink but it looked like there were a number of beers on tap."}
{"text":"This place looks good from the outside till you go in to find stuck up bartenders. When Arron de sides to she wants to pay attention to guys that are patrons just like me. She can't seem to put 2 nickels together. I would perfer going else where for food that is not over priced either.  Not to mention they don't even ask what size drink you want. Just ignore me and stay focused on what ever. But then who do you complain to if they or no one else is there to fix the problem."}
{"text":"Food is great for your buck, and the women are beautiful. Tried the fish tacos and no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, average food. Not recommended at all, unless you just want to watch the game which was great!!"}
{"text":"Went to watch the Hockey game at 6:15pm. At 8pm we were forced to pay 5$ each to carry on watching as there was a Bikini contest going on. I pointed out to our bar server that we weren't there for the Bikinis, but for the Hockey....still had to pay the money!!!  We paid, as we wanted to carry on watching the game.   For nearly 80 minutes the Bikini contest went on, the mic feeding back so badly it started to hurt my ears.  An attraction like that should be kept to 60 minutes. Drunk people attention span isn't that long !!!    I work in sound and I offered a solution to both the bartender (not interested!!) and I even grabbed the manager. He told me that he had already mentioned it to the DJ. It would have been a simple solution of reducing the mic level, or the treble. Nothing was done and it carried on squealing back continuously.   Seriously, If your DJ can't deal with simple mic issues like that, he should give up and find another career.   Between the 2 of us we spent over 100$, we would have been happy to go back for the remainder of the playoffs, but will now go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead.   Food was Ok, drinks kept flowing. The place was busy, but if they want to keep it that way, sort out tech issues.   I'm writing this 2 hours after leaving and my ears are still hurting!!!"}
{"text":"The manage Danny ruined my experience. I will never come back here unless he doesn't work there. He seems so full of himself with no respect for customers. At the girls and food saved the experience for me and my friend who ended up coming in as a last minute decision. That manager left me with a disgusted feeling...."}
{"text":"Great food and great service  but mostly importantly great view! And by view I mean the decor! Love the details they put into the place and how everything is big! Even the beers are big amd ice cold. Definitely a great holters substitute.    Cold beer and tvs everywhere makes this place a great location for footba season"}
{"text":"Dana was awesome.. Love her! Came for a little day drinking and didn't try the food. Bloodys were on point, same shot came out all different colors.. Bar needs some work but enjoy the environment.."}
{"text":"My buddies and I come in for football. The manager wouldn't change one of the tvs to see our team . They dont know what they are doing .Food seems to have changed in quality . For the worse .The girls are all very nice but the 2 hottest ones  are not there anymore it seems . Got the wings ghost pepper they are bomb! Nachos didnt have enough meat . All and all its a good place for sports beers and girls best beer in town ."}
{"text":"I have to say this was the best sports bar I've ever been to & I've been all over the country. Everything you would want in a sports bar this place had it & more. The rock climbing was also a good time. Nothing like drinking beer, watching sports & rock climbing. All that being said it was the people that made the experience. The ladies were tremendous & the managers were great. It was so good that my boy & I went Thursday, Friday, Saturday. There are a select few of the staff I'd like to commend for there service: Jeff (Manager) & Daniel (Manager) helped make the visits an excellent time. I appreciate the professionalism. The ladies that took care of us all 3 nights were just simply great. They were all good people. Kayt scales a rock climbing wall like a damn spider. If you're their the next time I'm in Vegas I will get my revenge. Nikki G. I appreciate the great service. Quite possibly the best waitress I've ever had. Thanks for running to grab the fries (haha). Sorry the Rangers couldn't pull it out Summer. I feel your pain with my sports teams. These 3 ladies were just spectacular.  Pretty obvious I'll be going back the next time in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot, to hang,  catch a game and have ice cold beer. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The old menu was better!  Seems like everything has been sized down.  Salads are smaller!  Chicken fried steak is much better. Steaks and pot roast are good but small. Beer still cold! yeah!    Happy hour is not promoted and server did not know and wasn't sure she had to talk to manager.  No happy hour menu out on table to select from.  They have to tell you verbally WTF! Be warned...  Girls are pretty but NOT helpful.  Like the place better before the menu change!"}
{"text":"This turned out to be my favorite sports bar in Las Vegas.  It's clean, the food is good, the atmosphere is fun, and the girls provide great service on top of being beautiful.  I was there for game 7 of the NBA Finals (showed up way early to make sure I had a seat), and the two excellent bartenders still managed to be attentive, even with the place packed.  This will be a definite stop on all my return trips.  The liquor is a little pricey, but in Vegas, there's no way around that (unless you're gambling of course)."}
{"text":"What a disappointement! Food: Even if the fries were good, the meat was burned and crispy. Waitress: My expectations were high but in the end the waitress was bored, only friendly when she gave us the check. The managment should really take care of it!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, took interest to get the game(s) we needed to see -GS Warriors in Scottsdale and my Alumni UK Wildcats ....competing Spring Training, etc.  The food and selection was 100% upgrade from Hooters with fraction of the price.  The beers were good, cold and flowing with terrific service.  Special shout out to Halley, Mercedes and especially Robert (Rob)."}
{"text":"Rochelle and Jackie were great bartenders and amazing  service. Would come back any time."}
{"text":"Overall is usually a great experience.  Food is better then average and service is (most of the time) very good."}
{"text":"This is a great bar.  We enjoyed some great drinks and food.   Hannah was our server and she is awesome.  Our food was great and we will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely horrible. Went in to check it out and have some dinner. 45 minute wait not a big deal, decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. I was looked at and past over by 3 different bartenders (presumably because I am a female). Word of advise ladies- we will tip you well also as long as you give good service. Two gentlemen at the bar had to ask the bartender for the drinks I wanted because I was being ignored.   Buzzer for table goes off right as I got the drinks.  Get shown to the table (good thing I got two drinks at the bar), it took 10 to 15 minutes for the server to show up.  And talk about stupid.  I understand the concept of the restaurant but seriously train your staff better.   We were going to order a bunch of starters (what they call teasers). There menu is not that big.  Ordered soft pretzels,  they wes out.  Ordered pulled pork sliders,  server said I think we might be out,  can you go check so we can make a decision.  Yep, they were out. Asked the server,  what do you have?  She says everything else. Ok.  What kind of fish is used for the fish tacos,  oh we are out of fish, but if we had it tilapia.  (How do you run out of half the items in your menu? ) Do you have any wine?  Yes,  chardonnay and white zinfandel.  Do you have any red wine?  Yes, it's a cabernet, I think.   Food was so so.   Time to pay the bill, have her $32 in cash asked for the rest to be put on a debit card.  Only puts in$22 in cash and the rest on a credit card.  Called her over,  told her the mistake and she gets mad at us.  Sorry darlin' you were not worth the $10 you tried to pocket.    Again ladies,  just because we are not interested in your Twin Peaks doesn't mean that you have to ignore us and give us crappy,  no horrific service.  If you givegood serviceyou willbe tipped well.  Gengerally 20-30%.  We are all in the industry and if you worked for me you wouldn't have a job."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming in, but I sat at the bar with lauren and shey and had a great experience. great service, great food and drinks! Def will come back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in the service tonight!  The server was rude and ignored us completely. Thank god for the manager Jimmy he made it somewhat better the girls talked shit and laughed at us when we complained. So much better places to go on the strip! When we complained the server told us she did fine and we were wrong for being upset.  Service was pathetic don't waste your time."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to grab a bite and watch the game with family.  Happy hour is a great deal but honestly the prices are bad at anytime.  The big plus for me is the super cold beer.  I also love the philly cheesesteak done southwest style.  I like mine in a tortilla instead of on a hoagie.  My daughters love the burgers and you can't go wrong with one of the fried baskets.  I'm a fried pickle fan and this is one of the few places that has really good fried pickle chips in town and they aren't overly salty.  Of course it's not a trip to twin peaks if you don't have an order of billionaire bacon.    My only complaint is some of the wait staff are overly friendly to the point you can't eat your dinner.  I don't need to know your whole life story.....just saying!"}
{"text":"Another sports bar that plays top 40 music and won't turn the sound on for a game. So if you don't enjoy listening to sports then its a good spot."}
{"text":"If you go the Las Vegas Strip Twin Peaks make sure you get a Bloody Mary made personally by Kayli or Kelsi , two of great bartenders there . Make sure they do not use the corporate issued mix you will be disappointed in that."}
{"text":"Food is OK at best; definitely not the \"highlight\" of this restaurant and obviously overpriced.  Only went because a friend was getting a divorce and wanted to go out with his friends.  Now I see why; puts Hooters to shame with obvious body-selected waitresses.  I had to endure cat calls from male patrons and watch sleezy responses from the servers in hopes of increasing their chances of a high tip, while watching the national swimsuit competition on a 55\" TV as a Dad's 7-year-old oogled at the waitress's \"endowments\".  Call me old fashioned, but this sort of thing is way over the top, and to call this place a restaurant is like saying Captain D's is a \"great little seafood place\"."}
{"text":"Here with good friends. Awesome twin peaks server Kimberly. Lots of tv to view, besides the server's.  Food is fresh hot and quick."}
{"text":"The Hostess and waitresses suck and they're retarded, for this kind of place really goes without saying. Another hooters chicks with big tits and bad attitudes place!.. The 29 degree slushy beer idea is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in a sports bar. Don't do it"}
{"text":"Parfait comme le service et le dÃ©cor dommage que ces chemises rouges soient si chaudes"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.. wasn't impressed and the food was average. No plans on returning"}
{"text":"Came in Thursday night to watch the game and had the cheese bites and the hangover burger, they both were amazing!!!! It was pretty busy but our server Samantha still kept our beers full and cold and was constantly checking on us. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a casual drink and eats saturday night so we came in and we're greeted by two very rude hostesses got placed way in back and that's when things got better some very nice little waitress named Meg treated us like gold .....she saved there bacon in our mind ....we will be back just to see her again. Cold drinks and pretty good bar food"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good spot to have a couple drinks on your way home, this is it.  Drinks are cheap and service is top notch. Sit at the bar. Shey especially stands out.  Never wait for service and she can read your mind about what you want.  Besides the pretty smile she pays attention to detail and works hard while still adding the personal touch that makes you feel like Twin Peaks cares about you spending your hard earned dollars at their establishment.  While I thank most of the staff, thank you Shey."}
{"text":"Worst Twin Peaks I've ever been to and I've been to a handful of them out of state. Terrible service, took forever to get our drinks and our check. Luckily Michelle was there to save the day and make up for all the slack of the other girls. Won't come back to this location though."}
{"text":"Alpine version of Hooters. Food selection meager, beer selection scant, waitresses friendly which is more than one could say about the Hooters' chicks. Overall, interesting first time experience but not really worth going back....Sorry TP....try again..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went her tonight. We had the most amazing server: Melissa G. She was absolutely friendly. She had us taste our drinks to make sure they were fine. She kept coming back and asked us how the food was. I ordered the blackened fish tacos. It was great. There was a lot of fish in the tacos and the salsa was great.   I will be coming back in the future. I only want to be served by Melissa G! She wa awesome!"}
{"text":"NFL Sunday - $45.00 per person for morning games and another $45.00 per person in the afternoon games.......ARE YOU SERIOUS! I know I'm in Las Vegas but, damn. Funny thing is they have turned at least 25 customers and counting from coming in. The worst thing is there are only 15 customers at this time. Piss poor managment is all I can say. Hostess is rude and zero personality but, her butt is like an onion and it make me want to cry."}
{"text":"I love this place! Indiana and Liz are my favorite servers! In addition to the wildlife on the walls, the great service, the amazing atmosphere, no smoke, no gambling and ice cold beers keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"BILLIE  is the best!  Always fun to talk to.  Beer is never empty. Always sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Came here about 3 weeks ago had a blast service was great, here tonight our bartender Renee is more concerned with her cell phone then trying to get our food order right... Then after the kitchen is \"closed\" (15 minutes later) she tells me that they are out of the item I ordered... Not happy with this joint tonight probably won't be back & being that I'm in the Vegas industry I'll tell my friends & colleagues not to come because of the poor service... I can spend 90 bucks for a couple of drinks with my friends elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Coldest beer in town. Lots of TV's so you definitely can find the exact sporting event you want to watch!  Food is not bad at all either...pot roast was just like mother's!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food, beautiful ladies, more tv's than any sports bar that i have ever been to and the absolute coldest beer in town."}
{"text":"Had lunch today and ordered the Meatloaf.  Fantastic.  Beer is ice cold.  Cassie waited on our table.  1st class service.  She is witty and beautiful also.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"*Bad service. *Food is awful.  Wings are overgrown thunder hormone injected wings. Wing flavors are not good.  Mini tacos were worst than Taco Bell. Not only they were awful but we found a blonde hair in our food and manager apologize to offer something on the menu. But at this point we didn't want to eat anything at this restaurant even if its free. My bill came out to 60.00. I love wings but it was so awful I didn't even want to take it home."}
{"text":"This was a good visit here. We tried this location last year and it was good as well. This visit we sat at the bar and people watched. Our bartender was excellent Ana even caught an issue with our order as she was bringing it to us. She had it corrected and the food was excellent! We had the steak nachos. The beer was definitely cold, just like promised."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sat. night week after opening.  Place was jammed and packed.  Sat at the bar for about 20 minutes and was never even approached by a bartender.  Was going to have a few beers and order some food, but that never happened.  So I just left.  Maybe I will try again on a slow night."}
{"text":"Shoutout to T-22 for the amazing service and Brendan for the great atmosphere. Keep these cats around for a wÃ¼nderful time."}
{"text":"This is my second time at twin peaks. The first time was at the location in the strip. The food was very good. I got the fish tacos and they were full of flavor and texture. For bar food, it was delicious. I also got the dirty blond beer (man size) to wash it all down.   My roommate and I sat at the bar to eat and the bartender took our order. She then went directly to the computer to put in the order and instantly had to ask me again what my roommate ordered. When our food did come out they initially gave it to the wrong people at the bar. The couple said it wasn't their food and then the bartender didn't know where the food was supposed to go. I saw her looking confused holding our food so I told her it was ours.   This location just opened not long ago so I know they are still working out all the kinks so I'm not to hold it against them. I really hope that's the case and they didn't just hire airheads. Haha. I would come back to eat there or have a drink again.   For a low key time I would go to this location, for a more night out to watch a game with friends the strip location may be more fun!"}
{"text":"My buddies and I stopped by Twin Peaks after Super Bowl for dinner and drinks.  Never been here before and I must admit I was very impressed with everything.  Our waitress Ariel was fantastic.  She made numerous stops by our table to ensure we were happy with our food and made sure we always had drinks.  The manager Fabian, was great also. He stopped by to make sure we were happy and he chatted with us making us feel welcome.  The menu is limited but the food was great.  I had the trout and it was delicious. The beer was ice cold and came from their micro brewery.  I also had a bloody mary and it was so delicious my friends also had one.  The staff was friendly and very attentive.   If your looking for drinks or a good meal for a reasonable price you won't go wrong with Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Food ok.  Went for a Monday night football game.  They played music over the game the entire time.  Not quite what I would call a sports bar.  Had to request for sound on the game multiple times and no one seemed to care."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in Las Vegas, servers won't ask if you need anything or acknowledge your existence. I will never go back to this twin peaks in my life and will never recommend anyone else to unless you like horrible customer service. Server didn't come by for more than 45 minutes! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PLACE TO GO! Go to Henderson Twin Peaks they know how to give a lot better service than you will ever find here."}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly really great. We sat on the first floor and there are a bunch of tv's to watch from. We ordered 2 Vegas size beers, the beer was nice and cold, the coldest beer I've had! JC was our server and she couldn't have been sweeter and she's gorgeous. It was our first time here and I'm glad we went. We wanted to climb the rock wall but they said it was too busy which was fine because we drank a lot anyway."}
{"text":"We definitely enjoyed our time here for meal for serve. We both loved chipotle chicken and its within sauces. Its a nice place to both eat n chat, next u.s. visit i will come again to this restaurant and thanks to Emily and others for their interest."}
{"text":"Place is a bit loud. With servers in very tight and skimpy outfits, it's definitely not a good environment for kids.  Food's just average.  Nelly was nice and very helpful, though."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! If you are looking for an awesome place for football this is the place to be! They have giant flat screens EVERYWHERE including their booths! The girls here are not only gorgeous but friendly as well. The service was fantastic the girl actually sat down with my buddies and I and chatted it up with us. The other girls came by to and really made us feel welcome. The food is delicious, you can tell its made in house. The beer is super Frosty! Beer that cold and girls that hot... I'm in heaven! I come here at least 3 times a week now and will be here for college ball on Saturday and NFL football on Sundays! Keep up the great job Peaks! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to watch the niner game. Place was packed, but still got seated right away. There are TVs everywhere and the atmosphere is great. Our server was super nice and attentive. The food was also pretty good, as far as bar food goes. Recommend the buffalo wings spicy. They were bomb. Only complaint I have is it took forever to get our food! The kitchen had some issues handling all the orders so it was backed up pretty bad. Other than that we had a nice experience."}
{"text":"So yeah this place opened up close by to me recently so I thought I'd hit it up and see what it was like since on the outside it seemed like a cool place to drink a beer and watch the dbacks and be left alone. Before doing so I skimmed the reviews and saw one that said \"Now I know why it's called twin peaks\" I knew what they meant by that, but took it with a grain of salt not expecting it to be the full blown love child of basically Cabella's, Hooter's and maybe a strip club and I found the place to be creepy and uncomfortable the whole time. Didn't really care much for how the waitresses would be constantly trying all these different angles to butter me up and play me to part with my hard earned cash like some insecure geek \"aw shucks\" loser/sucker. I think this place is mostly for the white collar type to safely experience a trailer trash fantasy they have. It totally gave the vibe and feel of a strip club. No thanks."}
{"text":"When my friend and I were walking in, he noted that he didn't fully understand why there would be a restaurant named \"Twin Peaks\". By the time we were seated, it became immediately clear that the title had nothing to do with actual mountains or the great outdoors. The service was friendly and pleasant, though the server did ask me \"What does hoppy mean?\" when I asked her what the hoppiest beer on tap was. The food isn't great, and the beer taps are average. The BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos were something fiercely awful - Guy Fieri is probably kicking himself that he doesn't have it featured in his restaurants. To their credit, there are tons of televisions around to watch whatever sports are on (yippee).  Ultimately, the selling points for this place are the massive amounts of televisions and the scenery that only a heterosexual male with no greater sense of appetite can enjoy. The service seemed friendly enough, but the food was bleh."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Pretty girls.  Good food.  But don't assume great service or special order understanding."}
{"text":"A great place to have some beers and and share appetizers with friends. I recommend the buttermilk sliders and chicken ranch quesadillas."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review, the food is still decent to pretty good unfortunately the service still leaves a lot to be desired.   I usually go every couple weeks or months when I feel like a burger but want something better than jack in the box.  I usually come in during the weekends around 11-12 and the place is empty, I'm not big on crowds so I like it.  Never sit at the bar so I can't speak to that, the booths are nice and big.  The menu isn't very big and you can't find calorie counts anywhere, but if you're watching that you shouldn't be eating here anyway.  The two main things I get here are the twin cheeseburger and the chicken tender basket, both are pretty good.  The appetizer tacos are decent but some bites were pure cilantro, not something I want to repeat.  Wait times for food isn't bad, usually around 10 minutes.  Where this place consistently falls short is service, they hire all college age girls who think that just because they're not wearing much they can get by.  Obviously that's this place's theme but for example today I saw my waitress three times while I was there, last week was worse since my waitress was MIA and other girls had to check in on me.  I don't need someone hovering over me but at the same time if I'm tipping extra I would like to actually see the person I'm paying.  Last thing that bothers me is that if I'm paying with cash they don't bring the change, it's not a biggie but they should ask if I want it and not assume I don't.  I'll probably go back again in a couple months when I forget about this time, kinda like Arbys."}
{"text":"I put one star but I'd rather put none.  we were seated, waited 20 minutes and no service.  I asked the girl at the front to get have a server come by; she never came back after another 10 minutes.  I also noted that the black family was not serviced and neither were we - a minority family.  There was a pair of young guys 5 feet from us and they were being serviced by 3 different people - they even had time to chat with them for 5 minutes a piece complete with hugging and combing the boy's hair.  How do I know? I had nothing else to do than watch the servers aid other people other than us and the other family.  Your organization was pretty disgusting tonight.  Very amateurish and borderline racist."}
{"text":"Great great great bartenders and hostesses. Selena and Amber were absolutely the best in Vegas by far.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends..good foods,sweet waitress,lovely hostess and beautiful view place.I'll come back.thank you"}
{"text":"Im a local but Ive been to several outstate TPeaks properties and this one tops them all. Nothing more fun than watching the girls scamper up and down the wall and then cushioning the tourists as fall off.  Try the Pork sliders and some kick a** chili. Step outside for some great people watching and come back in for COLD beer. Tip!  Better pricing Mon- Thur.  Military discount."}
{"text":"Great TVs, very cold beers  and beautiful girls serving you. Perfect spot for sporting events. Not the best in healthy food options, but did have a few salads to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"4 Stars fun sports bar 2.5 Stars pot roast swimming in grease 1 Star coupon makes you buy a $3.25 drink to get $9 off It's just business :("}
{"text":"Stick to Hooter's, y'all. First off, let me say for some really strange reason, I love breastaurants. So I was pretty excited to try Twin Peaks. When it comes to food, the fried pickles were the best thing I had, but again Hooter's is better. For an entree, I got the  blackened fish tacos. These were pretty darn disgusting. The biggest letdown though, were the wings. What kind of sports bar has crappy wings?!?!?! Twin Peaks, that's who.  Furthermore, the lumberjack-y theme was cool, I guess. But the plastic wood and rock decor trashed up the place. Is it that expensive to invest in a real dang rock? I'm sure nobody else even noticed this. But it was off-putting. There were a lot of tvs, however, rather than sports, half of them were turned to this bizarre Twin Peaks promotional channel.  One more thing that probably didn't matter to most, but peeved me were the girls. Well not so much the girls, or their little outfits, but the gaudy jewelery and belts. Like we see you walking around half naked, why do you have to wear a giant pink rhinestone belt and gargantuan fake necklace too? All the girls had so many gaudy, non-matching accessories, it really just made them look trashy. Again, I'm sure nobody else would even notice. But it bothered me.  Another thing, our waitress was really weird about giving my boyfriend his military discount. Which maybe it's not standard procedure for them to give military discounts anyway. But it was still a strange situation that did not get Twin Peaks any brownie points.  You can find me eating a mile or two down the road at Hooters, and for the love of breastaurants, I hope you make the same decision."}
{"text":"Certain items on the menu are really good.  Not a fan of any of their beef products.  Today I was just there for the twin peaks sundae, apparently they recently changed it (from a Blondie browny to a chocolate browny).  I liked it better the other way.  However, Bianca is a superb waitress as usual."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. Apparently if your not a man or don't have one with you at the bar you don't get service. I have been sitting here for 5 minutes and wanted food. She never came back to check on me or ask again for an order even when I have a menu in front of me."}
{"text":"it's actually a nice place: smells good (piney), cold beer, good food, reasonable prices and of course hot women. All areas a notch (or few) above Hooters, which the owner, a former Hooters franchisee set out to do. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"What a difference a year makes last year this place was outstanding in one of my favorite places to go this year is one of the worst service is terrible which assist are very unfriendly and inattentive food was always average so the friendliness of the staff was what made this bar now they taking that away so now it is no use of going to this place anymore very poorly run was way better last year don't know if there was a management change or not"}
{"text":"Waitress brought us the wrong food so many times we just accepted it and took what she gave us and then we never saw her again to check up on us. Foods not bad and TV's are nice when you're trying to watch your favorite sport"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times.  The reason?  The beer is REALLY cold, which some days, just feels spectacular.  The tv's are HUGE, bright, and plentiful, and its lively - going at happy hour always seems to be mostly full.  The food is hit or miss for me - sometimes it seems crazy salty, and other times, just right.  Favorite is the hangover burger.  It just tastes so perfect.  I love the pork nacho's even though they give me 10-tums heartburn!  The fried cheese sticks are huge, and really really good.    Of course, what would the review be without talking about the ladies.  This place definitely seems to increase in quality when ASU is in session.   For some reason, it always feels like the \"hot\" waitresses are the ones that are NOT in your serving area.  The bartenders seem to be the hottest of the bunch (my opinion).  But enough about hot.  What do I dislike about the servers?  Well, they all seem to wear giant mayan head dress necklaces.  Not sure what this is about, but usually they have giant stones and huge arrays of shiny things on them.  It reminds me, of the flair that TGIF servers wear, just updated for Twin Peaks.   Are the servers rude?  I think they are not so much rude, just not clued in to what role they are supposed to be doing.  At some point, just like Hooters, they will walk to your table and sit down and chat with you.  But they chat about stuff you don't want to hear about (buzzkill items) like their wages, or how crappy life is, etc.  Seriously, I kid you not, the last time a buddy and I went there for a beer we ALMOST asked her to leave the table.  We just sat there staring at her and she staring at us.  At least learn to talk about the things that we came there for - beer, sports, women, etc.  I don't want to hear about how the management asks you to buy Uggs, but some girls buy them at Target but you really can tell a fake Ugg.  That kills me to ask a hot gal to leave, but probably the last three times, we have NOT wanted to talk to the servers because they just don't seem to enjoy their job.    The worst thing about this place, is wet tables.  The beers are so cold that they make a swamp of condensation all over the table.  The waitresses don't put down fresh dry coasters except the first beer, so eventually, you can't lean on the table without getting wet.  I dislike that, because I have to keep my phone somewhere else than the table, etc etc."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this place out with another couple. It was Saturday night and the place had just recently opened..it was packed!! We only had to wait about 15 min until we were texted that a table was ready.   The staff are all girls that are scantily clad...something similar to the gals on Dukes of Hazard...cleavage proudly displayed, midriffs showing. Not offensive but perhaps not the place you might want to take your kids if you have concerns about such attire. Our waitress was friendly and gave us great suggestions for drinks and food.   Their food is a tad on the spicy side. I would have been caught off guard  that my Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad was going to have the zip that it did had our waitress not pointed that out. Spicy is ok with me..it was delicious! The others ordered burgers, chicken sandwiches and steak...all commented that their food was spicier than expected.   Overall the food was good, the service was great, and they have lots of screens to view sports and other things but I'm giving it only 3 stars because of the spicy food (I like it but some of my friends don't so I won't suggest we go out with them here) and the music is LOUD which makes conversation difficult."}
{"text":"Had a Great time good eats ICE Cold Beer& the Best Staff. Our server. Marissa was Awesome me & my Wifey will definitely come Back."}
{"text":"The place is what it is.  Young girls with half their boobs hanging out, and short shorts.  That's what brings them in the door.  Having said that, the girls are very friendly and service is the fastest of any restaurant I have been to for a long time.  Not only was our waitress, Lindsay, very nice too us, so were all the other girls when we came in and leaving.  Was here with my wife, so wasn't a matter of them flirting for a bigger tip.  Food was tasty, not over the top and more of the pub style of menu.  For the price of the food, good value.  Beats Hooters hands down.  Good place for a change."}
{"text":"Yelp is wrong - this place is open on Sundays! What kind of sports bar isn't open on Sunday? Probably should change this."}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place sucks the big one. My girlfriend and I came here at 1108 PM Saturday 15th 2017. We ordered a cob salad and a buffalo chicken salad. Didn't get our salad until 1240. What in the hell is that about? Waitress apologized repeatedly but didn't make us feal any better. It seems as though the effort for good service is in the visual but no effort in making sure there is any brains. I can guarantee we will not return."}
{"text":"The beer is really cold. The service is OK and easy on the eyes. I usually order from the appetizer menu.  Good spot for watching sports."}
{"text":"Always impressed with the food and service.  Amber and Holly bartending. Great interaction with customers and the bar was clean.  I'll be back soon for lunch."}
{"text":"1. Worst food ever 2. Worst service ever  3. Manager is a complete asshole to his staff and to me the customer.  4. Learn some customer service - bunch of Testosterone sexist pigs -   and I'm a guy writing this FYI"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and the cold beer and beautiful talent, but actually getting the cold beer in a timely manor is has been horrible the last 2 times here."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports. Tons of TV's. Good looking girls. Service is not exceptional or above average. Food is not that great and the menu is quit small. Better restaurants and place in Scottsdale to see good looking people and sports."}
{"text":"Good food (nachos, sandwiches, appetizers ). Drinks are made decently good most times.. Good cheap shots. I like how they have a HH that starts an hour early (2:00) then the rest of the bars around (3:00). And everyone is always very nice."}
{"text":"Sadly I left without being waited on. I was waiting at the bar to place an order.  Sat 5 minutes with no greeting or acknowledgement. Two guys sat down and got waited on before me. I left and went to Hooters never to return."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and the food is always good. The ribeye is way above what you would expect from a place like this. The beer is always cold and delicious. However, my experience is always improved with Sara as my server! She is nice, funny, outgoing and fun to talk to. She actually takes time to interact with me and my table and make our experience as enjoyable as possible. If you come here, ask for Sara (from Hawaii) and get the ribeye, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Awesome place to be. We come from Cali and this is way better than a similar restaurant we have. Cant wait till they migrate west! Food was really good and the beer will kick u with a good buzz. No matter what the reviews say, families are welcome. Beautiful ladies and sports!  THE BAD:  Even though I get why, the service took pretty long. Good if you chill and drink but not if you want to eat and take off.   All N All, I would recommend this spot!  Erica was our host and she was awesome.  She took special care of our 93yr young grandma. Very beautiful girl. THANK YOU ERICA!!!"}
{"text":"They send out an email for their swimsuit pageant which is to be help on May 22, 2015.  I make the 4 hour drive to find they delayed the pageant until the following week.  They couldn't send out an email regarding the delay.  Assholes."}
{"text":"They charged me for each drink refill. No wonder why they were so eager to refill my coke tonight!! I normally have to track them down for a refill. It was sneaky of them to remove the drink selection off the menu. Looks like I'm done going there!!"}
{"text":"The food I surprisingly good.  The service is okay, I assume most customers are concerned about the 'scenery' more than food served hot and drinks replenished in a timely fashion.  I will go for the food and cold drinks but elsewhere for service."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful girls and ice cold beer! 29 degrees!! Wow! It sets a nice setting of a mountain lodge surrounded by tons of huge flat screens. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service been coming here for a few years now. They have plenty of tvs so you can see clearly from any point of view inside. The drinks are just as good as the food. The price is just right! Ask for chelsey!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great server! Terrible manager (Lynn)!!! I brought several people to watch the biggest soccer game of the year & her excuse for not putting the sound on was \"it's too much trouble for me!\" Unbelievable!!! I was floored that a so called \"leader\" in that position would actually say that to a customer that brought 8 people into her place. Appalling!!! Now she's standing around texting on her phone. Such a bad taste in my mouth & yet my server was awesome!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today and sat at the bar. The chicken ranch sandwich with fries were pretty good. The bartender could use some pointers on being a server. I only know her as Beams because that was on my ticket. She gave minimal attention to me and everyone else. She seemed more interested in taking selfies with her middle finger or staring off in the distance. I would think you would want to interact with the few people sitting at your bar to maximize your tip on a Wednesday lunch shift. I was in the restaurant industry for 20 years so I know mediocre when I see it."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Average+ appetizers and sandwiches. Pretty decent steak salad that is a staple for me. Great people watching in their open-air patio overlooking the strip on the 3rd floor. They do an amazing job keeping that cool in the summer and warm in the winter.   And if you're coming for the scantily-clad waitstaff, there's something for everyone (unless you like men, sorry). Variety of sizes, shapes, races, hairstyles, piercings, tats, etc. They are generally friendly, though service can be hit-or-miss.  Haven't figured out the climbing wall, but apparently racing a waitress up the wall is a thing.   Would love to give 4* since it's such a comfortable environment. This is a pretty harsh 3, but it's not quite a 4."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place!! My boyfriend and I just moved nearby and have been here twice already. Both our waitresses at those visits were super friendly and personable (I guess it's their job...but still!). The beer there is COLD and they have pretty good cajun fries too."}
{"text":"Definitely a downturn in food quality and service, which surprised me considering they have a big new great competitor down the street (Bad Daddy's).  Ordered burger for lunch today and the burger was cold, with the cheese melted on top of all the toppings - not on the burger itself. I asked the waitress if I could have the cheese melted on the burger (to try to enhance the flavor of the dry, cool burger). She literally brought me a slice of ice cold cheese. The asparagus was the skinniest you've ever seen and burnt to a crisp. I tried putting butter on it but that didn't make it edible. The waitress could tell I didn't eat anything but a couple bites, yet never asked me if anything was wrong.  She knew.  I was a regular lunch customer and I've referred several people to them the last couple years - no more. There's a reason there is no wait."}
{"text":"Visited tonight asked for a booth that was open was told no only high tops available. We said ok and sat down ten minutes later no waitress, we walked out.  I used to frequent this place very often and get the cold beers, fried pickles, and trophy trout. I'm not sure after that poor of service I will be back. They were not very busy and I saw plenty of wait staff.  ____________________________________________  I just wanted to add that I'm disappointed the Concord NC mgmt has not replied to my post as I was a frequent customer of this specific Twin Peaks"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately, great TVs, ice cold beer, pretty good food though a limited selection.   What we can't get over is the service! Server couldn't have cared less about the fact that she has tables to serve. Standing around chatting with other employees while we're waiting on multiple items (group of 9). This happened several times and twice we had to go find her to remind her that we needed items... which still took quite some time for her to get around to.   The good looking aspect wears off quick when service sucks."}
{"text":"Cute servers, great service, nice bar with lots of TVs... so what's the problem here? The food was gross... I mean terrible... I was here with a few friends and we ordered some wings and the fried cheese sticks at the server's suggestion. Both products looked like they were never strained coming out of the grease. You should have seen the oil dripping off those wings... just GD disgusting and soggy. We could not order any more food after that and I will not be back. I'm 43 now and just not that impressed by half naked 20 year-olds anymore.   Four Peaks is across the parking lot with great food. See you there.  UPDATE 7.17.12 Their marketing person from HQ emailed me out of the blue and asked if I would give them a second chance, since she felt I visited during their opening nights. She believed that if I tried again, I would have a better experience. I was VERY impressed that they would take the time to inspect what they expect, but she also offered me a little discount... so I go in again for happy hour...  This time I also took the wifey. As I said above, I am not that impressed by boobs and taking my lady would be a further good test of quality and service. We had the same thing I ordered before (wings and cheese sticks) and they were much much better. Actually the cheese sticks were awesome, big and meaty (if cheese can be meaty, that is). The service was excellent and I would put it way above their competition (you know who).    So, count me in... we're gonna try again when football starts so we can see how this plays out when it's an actual sports bar.  I'm changing from two to four stars. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've read several disappointing reviews of this place on Yelp, however, I was lured here by friends to participate in an NFL Fantasy Draft and it wasn't at all as bad as I had been led to believe. Caveat: It was a Monday. The beer was a tad on the icy side and had been over poured so that it was running down the side of the mug and had to be cleaned off the table as it was melting. Other than that, there were plenty of servers who attended our every need and were very pleasant overall. The staff was great in my opinion. They were very welcoming to groups conducting fantasy drafts as there were at least 2 other tables of guys doing the same thing as we were. Overall, not to shabby."}
{"text":"I'll preface this with an acknowledgment that this review will be useful to only a  few people.  First the good points:  - Servers are friendly and attractive (let's be honest- that's why we're here) - Beer was served so cold there was a small iceberg floating on top - Pretzel and cheese appetizer was very tasty  Now for the rest...  - No vegetarian friendly entrees - So many TV screens we felt like we were in an SNL parody sketch depicting a sports bar - Stuffed dead animals everywhere.  Again- not a vegetarian friendly establishment. - Salsa served with the chips was warm- not room temperature but actually heated up, while the mustard served with the pretzel was cold.  Not really worth complaining about, but the warm salsa was weird.  Overall, this place just did not suit us.  The dÃ©cor wanted to be hunting lodge rustic but the ridiculous number of TV's did not match that vibe.  I think we'll stick with Tilted Kilt- they have equally attractive servers, but also offer veggie pizza, veggie wrap, and a black bean patty to substitute in the hamburgers.  Oh- and no dead coyotes watching me drink my beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch and everything was great. Very friendly from the hostess station all the way to the table. Haley did an excellent job and made sure we were always taken care of. Beer is cold and food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The beer is cold, lots of TV's and the service was fantastic. Tiffany and Jesselyn were awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great new chain which i first found in Texas.  The working girls are young and mostly hot.  The food is good for a sports bar with hot chicks.  In Texas i found the food to be exceptionally good - every single thing the menu.  Here i found the food a couple notches below that but still very decent.  They do a great job to create a party atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered the pulled pork nachos and 18 hot wings, along with a slury of drinks. Our two waitresses, yea I said two, catered to our every need, even posing for a picture to show our friend brad that we are way cooler than him. Overall great experience, the ambiance and the decor were impeccable."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service is hit or miss. If your waitress has another table she wants to flirt at, you're likely not to get good service."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service sucks. I'm writing this review because I'm looking across the bar at a man holding up his glass as the bartender walks by (not the 1st time) without getting another beer. My waitress is quick to replace my tab in the shot glass before me, but it still takes almost 5 minutes to get my beer."}
{"text":"Great place to go for sports and ridiculously COLD beer!!! 29 degrees, ice in the beer, cant get any better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out. Had the hangover burger (the one with the egg on it) and an IPA. Place has a hunting lodge feel about it but very well lit .  Good Location, Ice cold mugs and beer, great TVs at the bar, quick service and clean. I have had better bar burgers but the seasoned fries where really good.  Bartenders seemed like they didn't want to be there, maybe just because it was slow. Overall fair service, cold beer, very nice amount of TVs at bar, and most of all very clean."}
{"text":"Great place for ice cold (freezing in all actuality) beer. The staff are all such sweethearts. Champ & kat are hysterical and always super welcoming. Definitely one of my favorite after work spots to enjoy a pint (or  three) to wind down after the day."}
{"text":"It was my first time at TP. I was on my lunch break! I loved it. When my female coworker and I walked in we couldn't help but realize we were the only female customers at the time. It was new to me so I was taken back but not bothered at all. I don't remember our server but she was GREAT! Attentive. She was sure to let us know what TP was about. Though it felt flirty- it felt sincerely welcoming. We shared fried pickles-AMAZING! My coworker ordered chicken fingers with French fries and I ordered the fish tacos. Everything was so so good and our server topped it all off with to go cups :) isn't she sweet. Overall great experience. Quick enough for lunch time which is my favorite! Thank you TP!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, this place has great food, great beer, and beautiful women!! They def showed me and my boys a good time while they were in town! Can't wait to come back during football season!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time based on the menu I saw online. The food was great no complaints really from me or my husband. The cheap shot I ordered was not so great not good taste & barely any liquor...it lives up to it's name so I guess you get what you pay for. The only real issue I had was our seats we were close to the windows and due to the set up of the place the constant back & fourth of the staff was a bit annoying while I was trying to enjoy my dinner. My advice don't sit near the windows near the doors."}
{"text":"my friend and I come here all the time and it's because of the customer service and the great food we like the management really cares about us feel welcome every time I understand there's a lot of stress for some serversthe food is great and the food is deliciouseven though the girls get stressed at work they don't show it and they always greet customers respectfully and with a happy cheerful attitude.the girls are so fun! Most are working themselves thru college,work out at the gym all with a heathy attitude!"}
{"text":"Great place for watching sporting events with all the TV's and they just added a few more. I've learned the menu selection is huge with all the variations you can choose like having chicken on the Nachos instead of pork etc.. For beer my personal favorite is the Dirty Blonde but they have a large selection along with a full bar. The staff works as a team to assist the customers so the service is fantastic but the one that keeps my glass full is Jess what a cutie! With football season coming this will be my go to place, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I real recommend this spot in the heart of the strip in Las Vegas. It is a chain restaurant with great atmosphere and service. If you are looking for a menu with limited but great options this is a great start here. When you go out especially in this town more time than not you are lost in the shuffle with average service at best and an overwhelming menu. They do it right here with meals made from scratch, great service from the management on down to the staff. This is a great place with multiple levels and areas to watch your sports team with the sound on and get treated like a champ. Mona is one of the managers and she is top notch across the board and the whole staff makes you feel like you are truly at home in the big pond known as Las Vegas. I cannot say enough about the variety of drinks, many different seating areas inside and outside, and the quality of the food. A great addition to the strip check it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. Codi the bartender was at the top of her game. Food was excellent and the beers were served at 29Â°- just like management demands. This place has a friendly staff. Yulissa was always ready with a smile and Ashley knows how to work the tap. She has the smile of an angel. Don't let the size of Ash fool you, she's a real tiger. Jo from Arlington will make you feel at home. Bailee... Super cool."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, and I am not very impressed with the service. I'm definitely over the skinny girls dressed like floozies; it seems to be like that in every bar now; if you are sexy naked, you are sexy dressed.   The first time we came here was a Sunday morning waiting for a biker run. The service was good, the burger was good. They were slow, so I didn't have much to complain about.   The other night we went here for wings and beer. I had to ask to have the bar cleaned. It was about 9:30 pm and they had a crowd, but they weren't overly busy. We had to ask for menus. I ordered a beer and it seemed really large, but I went with it. We ordered wings and a sandwich. They were ok, nothing I couldn't live without again. The wings did have more meat on them then some of the other places I have been. Next, I had to ask for another beer, and I had to ask if there was a smaller size. The small is really small. Dave never even got another drink because she never asked, and he did want one.  The one positive note I will say - I couldn't decide what to drink, so she gave me a sample of a couple of beers and then suggested something based on the feedback I had on the beer samples. One extra star for that suggestion, and attention.   We probably would have had a better experience if our server was more attentive and we would have spent more money on booze - but we just ate and left.   Not sure if we will go back again or not."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. It was better the first  time. Service was good. Food was a little bland. The chicken fried chicken's gray didnt taste the same. My son loved the sirloin, tho. Also, the beer was great! I will be back with friends, for drinks."}
{"text":"Service is consistently underwhelming.   The attractive AND competent servers probably work on the strip.  Food is usually good for bar fare.  Probably won't be back since there are so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few beers. They serve them at 29 degrees, near freezing. However, lately the service has suffered. Not sure what's going on but it used to be much better... Nonetheless, still great beer and the food is OK."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times as of late. Not cause I'm a full blown creep but because it is the only real sports bar that doesn't have smoking! Gotta love that. So as for servers Liz and Ashley C are the best two hands down. They actually know what they are doing! Most of the time the bar is the place to be though. Cindy hands down is the best followed closely by Amanda and Kat. They run a tight ship and get you the drinks prompt and with a good attitude. Ps play Amanda in connect 4 for an easy win... It will make you feel great!   Food is above alright... I've tired it all. Chicken tacos and the steak are the best way to go. Chili is above average too. Great place to watch the nfl! Or any game!"}
{"text":"Gimcky Hooters style place, but the staff is all very friendly. Love the prices on the beer - 22 ounce mug is very reasonable and always served at 29 degrees. I like the option of being able to try local NC brews. Had a pretty decent salad here, believe it or not. It was topped with buffalo tenders, which were decently sized and juicy. Not setting the world on fire, but an overall decent place."}
{"text":"Go anywhere else. Waited 15 mins before a waitress came to get our order and another 40 mins before we got our wings. I ordered 6 wings and got 4 medium size wings and 2 crumbs! We had to wait another 10 mins to get silverware, napkins, and place another drink order. We got horrible service because the waitresses were too busy flirting with their male customers. Food wasn't even good."}
{"text":"$12 for a half-sized weak margarita?!! Went after work to enjoy happy hour with co-workers and was VERY disppointed. When I asked the server about the pricing, (beause the menu had no prices and the happy hour section was a little confusing) she could of cared less. She wasn't very friendly or had any kind of personality."}
{"text":"My first experience at twin peaks tonight was remarkable. What made it so was Claire. Travelled throughout the Americas. Would come back here just because of Claire.    She's amazing!  The food was also good. Loved the service."}
{"text":"I've tried twin peaks multiple times now. I am not highly impressed with their food quality, can get better food at a PT's Pub than here.  I like that the beer is cold, their house brews are decent.  Only reason to go back is to get an extremely cold beer."}
{"text":"We (Mrs) went to lunch on a wk day.  It's a beautiful restaurant, hunter cabin style decor.  The food was ok, the liquor and beer menu great. My favorite beer is Four Peaks Tilted Kilt. The sports bar setting is great, tv screens everywhere with a variety. The atmosphere is nice, twenty-something waitresses are beautiful, our waitress Becca had a great attitude. The restaurant manager came by the table, very nice guy.  We enjoyed the service and time at Twin Peaks.  We'll return again."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, lots of TVs, plenty to watch!  Mercedes recommended the Turkey avocado smash and it was an excellent recommendation! The bread was lightly toasted, fresh avocado & arugula, generous serving of Turkey, and sweet potato fries! Mmmmmm!  All served by the stunningly beautiful Mercedes! I'm in love!"}
{"text":"We have tried so many other places, just because we feel kind of guilty watching football in the same place for 2 straight days, but Twin Peaks always wins.    Great TVs, friendly staff (Amber is fantastic, friendly and was our waitress for 2 straight days) and they know sports- they put on your game and have good audio.    Food is fine, but that's not why you're here.  Best choice after checking several other options."}
{"text":"Fun place. Boobies abound but as for the food? -blech. Don't go here if you're hungry, go here for the ummm, atmosphere and a beer. The servers sit with you and small talk you and it's creepy because you're just staring at not-their-eyes. I guess next time I should bring singles or just drink more."}
{"text":"Aren't we lucky to have one of these restaurants near us.. NOT!!!  As everyone else wrote, this is like a woodsy, hunting cabin style of Hooters., T & A with half assed beer. My wife I and ordered the BLT with the Tomato soup and French fries. The BLT was completely tasteless and salty, as well as everything else (except the beer)...  To sum up; BJ is right next door and blows them away.. We will NOT be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after a day at the Waste Management golf tournament with the wife. She is not a fan of these places typically but seemed to enjoy the vibe here. Definitely not the usual Hooters crowd. Could be a North Scottsdale thing. The food was very good, pulled pork sliders and wings. Nice selection of on tap beers including some great local ones and the service was great. Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings should be very concerned about this chain."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of friends with me and my twin brother being the youngest in our early 40s.  They would not serve me alcohol as I did not have my ID even though my twin brother showed them his ID and they served him.  Another friend at our table of 6 just had his 60th birthday the day earlier and they wouldn't serve him as he also didn't have his ID.  This was completely ridiculous so we left after the 4 who were served finished their beer.  Upon walking out the entrance all of us were served a beer by a lady selling beer out of an ice keg to foot traffic.  I've never been to a place that has shown such poor judgement with respect to IDs in my life and I will never go back to this place (even though the servers were very good looking)!"}
{"text":"This place had a fun vibe, much more upscale version of a hooters atmosphere. The menu is not too big, so easy to choose. Food was good, beer choices were great and decently priced. Good place for a group of bachelors! Wouldn't recommend ordering mixed drinks as they are highly over priced. We ordered margaritas and they ended up being $20 a drink."}
{"text":"My wife took me there for my birthday.  Service was horrible!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us and a total of 40 minutes before we received our salad and soup.  The manager was just as poor as the waiter.  They both gave us different stories for the delays.  Will NEVER eat there again.  Food was average."}
{"text":"Not the best experience we had here. One of the hostess did do a great job she was attentive and knew what she was doing. However, we just got done watching a UFC fight. Our server was Tiffany, ordered our food and we never got it. We also asked to split one of the bills and that wasn't also done. She seemed overwhelmed and busy so we weren't going to complain because we can see it was busy. Until she came back with the bill asking who had this debit card.. no one had that debit card and she got the other customer's table mixed up and one of our friends jokingly said \"might as well not charge anything\" and her feedback was \"Haha, don't push it\" with an annoyed pissed off tone. When confronted she said she was joking and never once apologized. Not cool at all, we didn't complain for our food not coming out at all and not splitting the bill. So don't give an attitude when you were wrong to begin with. Go there for the great drinks but if you get Tiffany, ask for a different server! Second yelp complaint and review given!"}
{"text":"I usually get the double cheeseburger and fries because it is awesome!  The mozzarella sticks are the best I've ever had.  The cheese dip is also good, but make sure you spend the extra $1 to add taco meat.  The girls are fun to stare at and there are TV's everywhere."}
{"text":"Love all the TVs and the food is good but takes way too long to get a drink! I would order a drink when my drink was half way and still wouldn't have it when I finished."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently stopped in to Twin Peaks - Henderson for lunch.  What a pleasant experience.  Our server was Lisa, and we enjoyed our interaction with her.  She made sure to check in with us to be sure we had everything we needed.  Service was quick and the food choices were outstanding.  A nice variety.  We also were impressed that a manager, Drew, took the time to stop by our table to be sure that all was well. This is something that I haven't experienced at a lot of other restaurants.  I've worked in the retail/service industry for years, and I really appreciate it when I receive excellent service! I noticed that Drew also made it a point to talk customers at other tables.  This definitely was a nice touch to our lunch time, and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, and Ashley M was really attentive to everyone at our table! Great service!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and its never been for the service, but I like the ice cold beer. This time I came in I sat at the bar and I was completely ignored. When finally greeted,  it was rudely and with perceived reluctance.  I am a bartender and I have never been treated with such disregard as this particular event. Ill never go back. I never went for the service, but they really need to step it up."}
{"text":"Service was spectacular, Amy played along with our admittedly drunken stupidity. I would wear a beard of bees for this place. Plus they played Tootsie Roll while we were there. Boom."}
{"text":"I had a good time at Twin peaks. Some of the highlights were the amount of TVs,  great for sporting events. The venue itself is huge, three stories with a rock wall to climb as well. You get to climb against one of the girls working, I got my ass kicked and my pride hurt a little, but atleast I got a t-shirt out of it. Lastly there our plenty of pretty girls working in their lumber jack outfits.           I got a hang over burger, which was delicious, I didn't care for the fries to much. The food and drinks are responsibly priced for being smack dab in the middle of the strip.         Lastly our bartender Lena, was the best part of our visit. She was super happy and nice to us. She made us feel right at home. Cracked some jokes and enjoyed some drinks. Twin Peaks is worth a visit, especially if you're looking to watch any sporting event."}
{"text":"The views are scenic but don't expect good service here if they're slow and there's someone there they know. We got there at around 3:30 and our first server was very friendly and attentive. When they changed shifts at 4, the story changed too. The table behind us had either regulars or just guys they liked I'm not sure. 4-5 girls at a time would come over and talk to them including our server. We went nearly 15 minutes without drinks even though the empty glasses were at the end of the table and she walked by a couple of times. Turned out those times were to put in their drink order and then return with them. We were going to leave but a manager came by and noticed our glasses so we stayed for one more round. Didn't help."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. If I could give it no stars I would. We went there to watch the boxing match and some dinner. They took our table down and then let us in for $5 dollars to watch the game. They kept letting people in at what I am sure exceeded the maximum capacity. Our table was never called and if they had let us know that we would never get a table I would of never paid the $5 dollars to watch the game. We  would of just went somewhere else. To make up for this they gave us a coupon for an appetizer in which we would have to go back and pay for entree. Such a great deal!! Never got to eat dinner let alone even get a drink. Will not be going back so not sure what I am supposed to do with this coupon."}
{"text":"came to vegas for a vacation and heard that the steak and egg tacos were to die for here so decided to give it a try, i was greeted by the host evelyn, no offense but shouldnt you have someone friendly hosting?? she had a face like she didnt want to be there, and as soon as my friends and i walked in she gave us a dirty look, like really?? i wanted to walk out based on that alone!! but i really wanted to try the tacos, we were greeted right away as we sat down by ashley, she was really sweet, we ordered our tacos and some beers, the tacos were AMAZING!! ashley was right on top of our drinks, she was attentive, friendly and personable, we were there to watch the game and i loved the fact that she was getting into the game with us, made the experience more great! shes the only reason why i didnt give this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great concept ..... good food (it may not be the food you ordered but it will be good). We eat here often as it is within walking distance of our house. The last three times we have eaten here the orders have been a comedy of errors. Example : the last visit:  one order was for fish tacos, we got steak tacos, also ordered the sourdough BLT dry with no mayo and ask for mustard or requested it on the side, either way....never got it.... one other issue: ordered the combo appetizer platter... we received it after we were 2/3 of the way finished with our entree. They are always very apologetic (they seem to have too much practice in this area) and seem to try hard but this is the third time in a row they have messed the order up ....... seems to be a pattern. I'm sure they will correct it but it becomes a bit of an irritation ."}
{"text":"This place is great service is good and very friendly smiles from Jacquie and Malyssa are great and always dancing and having a good time!!!"}
{"text":"The place is nice, the girls are awesome also!! But the music is terrible, new playlist asap please !!"}
{"text":"Twin Peaks in Concord is the best place to for ice cold beer and great sports. Had a blast and everyone is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice scenery. Believe it or not the wife wanted to eat here. Foods pretty good too! I enjoyed the triple appetizer and a chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant and was immediately welcomed with a warn smile from the bartender named Amber. This establishment has excellent food and customer service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Twin burger wasn't anything special.  The queso was good, but the chips were stale.  The Philly cheesesteak was chewy.  The kids chicken strips were good.  We had never been.   Hooters has nothing on the outfits these girls wear.  They made it worth the visit, but we won't be back unless it's lingerie week which is during Valentines."}
{"text":"My friends had been wanting to go try this place so we finally did! The staff was superfriendly, the menu selection was small and pretty basic. We ordered a few different items, everything was just ok....nothing that really jumps out. The atmosphere was comfy cozy and just as the ads suggest the staff shows off certain assets. It was a little pricey   but still fun. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"My companions and I have been coming to this location for about the last 6 months ever since we found out about the amazing happy hour specials ! And no matter who is serving us, Linz/New York, still always finds her way to our table to say hi and catch up with us ! She keeps this place running smoothly and I always look forward to see her when we come in, she brings a special charisma to this wonderful restaurant ! My friends and I will definitely be continuing to dine here and always hope that Linz finds her way to our table !"}
{"text":"Perfectly located for people-watching the disaster that is the Vegas Strip.  Grab a beer and watch the spectacle that unfolds below you from the 2nd floor balcony.  The appetizers are HUGE.  Way bigger than they need to be (we ordered the fried pickles).  One can easily be shared by 4 people and everyone will have plenty.  The wings are good.  The service is good.  The views are... fantastic... everywhere."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero, I would!    Waked in and was face to face with two girls at the Hostess stand having a personal conversation that was clearly more important than two hungry customers with cash to spend on food and lots of beer.  Finally got sat...one, two, three times the waitress passed by without so much as an acknowledgement.  So we pulled aside one of the many girls not doing anything and asked if she could help.  She couldn't.  But, she got us a different girl who also said she couldn't help, but, would \"find our waitress.\"  17 minutes passed without even a drink order taken.  We even stared right at the manager with desperate, hungry, thirsty faces to no avail.  18 minutes in we left and went to Pin Kow where we are always welcome!  I wonder if our waitress even ever came?  LOL."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to twin peaks to watch paperview ufc fights. We got there real early so we could have a booth; there's a tv at the booth. We ended up paying $60 for the table so that we didn't have to share the booth or move to another section. Our server August (or something close to that) was awesome. Polite, attentive and never to overbearing (we were there for over five hrs). She also made a couple beer selections that were good. My favorite was the knotty brunette draft. Yummier than new castle! I liked this place more than Hooters cause the food is actually tasty and doesn't upset my stomach like Hooters does. The bacon appetizer and fish tacos and red hot wings were all yummy. The only thing I find weird is kids in there. Not a atmosphere for kids in my opinion. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good and beer is reasonably priced. Facility is awesome and set up great with lots of tvs..BUT Service was terrible we saw our server maybe a total of three times the entire night....while it was slow! Not sure if she was new or what but definitely not pleased. And no it has nothing to do with me being a girl, I have enjoyed many of these sports bars and even worked at a kilt in California. Maybe in California we're just use to better service. Huge let down considering the AWESOME potential this place has!At the same time I am thankful we had somewhere to watch our USC game this weekend while we're in town for the saints game.     Adding on to this review 16 days later to notice the owner tried contacting me on here to better his restaurant and I think that is awesome! We didn't keep our receipt to better help with who the waitress is but very pleased that the head of the business takes pride in fixing any issues! Thank you Andy!"}
{"text":"Great place the lady bartenders are awesome! Jackie took great care of us, def. a must go for lunch or dinner! Great happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Atmosfere  4 star I like the ambiance is a nice sports bar, so for games is perfect it has tvs on every booth also which I think is pretty cool.  Food 1 star: Food was literally disgusting, sorry to say that I never like the term but someone in the back has to review the recipes. Got a fried chicken steak that was the size of 2 plates. Was extremely thin and over fried, I woke up this morning with a stomach ache for having eaten 3 bites, tasted burned and not meat flavor. The mashed potatoes were on the button of it and I couldn't get to it because was cover from that giant thing. My gf got chicken tender and she said said thing weren't good. They were pale and soggy from oil so she ate only the fries.  Service 3 star: The girls at the bar were nice but a little inattentive. I didn't order extra beer just because no one asked me if I wanted more after I finished. I tried to get their attention, got pissed after waving several times so in the end when they finally came over I just asked for the bill, I didn't wanna take the chance to spend another 15 min just for the check. The girls seemed busy but the bar twas half empty. If I come back will be no food and not very often"}
{"text":"I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  Well after my visit to Twin Peaks on Eastern I can easily say I'm still searching! Let me first say that this review is a little late because I just haven't found the time to sit down and really let this place have a full JT review. I would say we visited this,\" Health Department Disaster Waiting to Happen\" place in early March 2014. If I remember right it was a Sunday.   We arrived at what looked like a packed parking lot but for whatever reason none of the cars belonged to the people in Twin Peaks itself. In fact the place was kind of empty, save for the 6 or 7 tables filled with Sun Cities finest.   At the door we were greeted by a great looking girl who had a nice smile. She quickly asked us where we would prefer to sit and guided us to the outdoor area. Being that it was March we were taking a gamble that the weather would be acceptable to sit in. But after seeing a few other groups outside we figured we would be OK.   The Service After sitting down we began to take the place in as it was our first time at the nationwide chain. The bar was centrally located and looked like it was getting ready for the lunch rush. The girls were making their rounds to the folks at the tables in teams. And in general the place looked clean and nice. We sat around for a good 7 to 8 minutes before one of the teams of girls asked if we had been helped. We said no and she asked if she could get our drink order. I ordered a Miler Lite in the \"Man size\". Another 8 to 9 minutes later we watched as multiple girls walked by my beer on the end of the bar without grabbing it and bringing it over. A full 20 minutes later our waitress Candice made her way to us. She was visibly out of sorts over something and told us it was \"kitchen drama\" . I asked if she could find out where my beer was and then we would order. She made a face like the beer order was news to her and she quickly went looking for it. Once she came back we ordered. I ordered the chicken fingers and my girlfriend ordered the chicken sandwich.  Now that our order was in we returned to looking at the chaos that was happening in the restaurant. We observed the girls talking in groups for minutes while customers raised their hands to get their attention. It was comical to observe how the girls would walk by a table and completely ignore the people who were trying to get their attention. We noticed that the table next to us finally receiving their food only to have just about half the order taken back. We later learned that all the food was either cooked wrong or completely not what they ordered. We laughed together as we made fun of this awful place. I could have sworn that we were on a hidden camera show where the experiment was to see how we would react to super slow / terrible service. The manager, if you could call him that, was completely glamored by the cute girls. He was walking around in a daze. It was clear the girls run this place from start to finish. However, it was all fun and games until our food arrived and things got real.  The Food A good hour into our experience the food arrived. I looked over to the table that was still waiting for its order and said, \"I hope this was worth the wait\" they laughed and we started eating.  My chicken fingers looked horrible. They were white and looked to be uncooked. I dipped the first one in the sauce and took a bite. Just then my girlfriend asked me,\"What's this?\" as she pointed to the thumb of a rubber glove! I spit out what food was in my month and said, \"Don't eat that!\" At this time our neighbors, at the table where the food was all wrong, started to flag over the incompetent manager. We motioned over to them that after they were done we wanted to talk with him. They decided that our problem was more important so they let us have him first. He and our out of touch waitress came over to our table. Both of them just looked in disbelief that such a thing could happen. I quickly figured out that these 2 low intelligent people would never be able to correct what had just happened and that it would be a complete waste of my time to complain to someone who was obviously powerless. Therefore, I looked the dimwit in the face and said we were done, and that we were leaving and never coming back. He just stood there and drooled on himself. Candice had a similar look on her face and confessed that she couldn't work there anymore as she gave my girlfriend an awkward hug.   The Bill Well needless the say... this one was on the house!  After sharing our experience with just about everyone with ears we knew, it became clear that this chain was known for bad food, and bad service. Our friends in Phoenix and Orlando said this place was awful!!  I can only hope this review stops enough people from going here and they are forced to close.!!"}
{"text":"Ice cold Beer can't go wrong with that. Would definitely come back again and again. As far as service goes not half bad. But doesn't remind me of the twin peaks look. Over fun time had the philly very tasty, but do come for the beer it's worth it."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  They have a Philly cheese steak sandwich with jalapenos and queso that is really good."}
{"text":"This is a place you come for the view and stay for the beer. The food is terrible. That said, my husband works nearby and has lunch often with coworkers. While the restaurant does have awesome strip views to people watch, that's not what I meant by view. I meant the smoking hot ladies. That's why the fellas keep comin' back even though the food is terrible.  I finally experienced it for myself before catching a concert at Cosmo. We came in for beers and shared the mozzarella sticks and nachos. The guys have tried most everything and declare these most edible. The nachos are huge. They're decent, but I didn't care for the sweet bbq sauce and the quality overall was pretty cheap. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good. I'd get them again. Lightly breaded thick gooey cheese and a decent marinara sauce for dipping. The real winner here is the beer. We all had the manly sized dirty blondes. It's served at 29-degrees and you'll get ice crystals your first few sips. Not all beer is good so cold, but this hits the spot.  The ladies weren't as friendly to me as to the guys I was with, but they know who their target audience is. They are well trained to part men with their money. I could do without the sales pitch for golf gear, tshirts and whatnot. Just bring my beer and make it quick. Unfortunately, the bartenders were painfully slow on my visit. Hopefully, that's not the norm."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Not only is it a great atmosphere but the food is really good. Put it this way there is always some thing good to look at. WOW"}
{"text":"Been there three times now to grab a quick lunch by myself. Each time I have been sat in the same crappy booth adjacent to the food prep area outside the kitchen. Must be there idea of customer service, seat them at the worst seat in the house they'll keep coming back. Being close to the kitchen is NOISY and annoying. Food is OK. Cheap on the fries. I think I got 8 of them with my burger. Best part about the restaurant is standing outside the bathrooms and people watching. Amusing to watch them discern between the door labels of Stand 2 Pee and Sit 2 Pee and the anguish over which door they should go through!!! Tells you something right there!!!! If you have been around the area awhile, you'll know what I mean when I say, I miss Earls!!!  PS - another interesting feature is the booth-side TV. Good for privatized viewing of sports events."}
{"text":"Recently I came into Twin Peaks on Eastern and I had a server by the name of Taylor and she was amazing her Customer service was the best I've had in a while I will be referring her to everyone at my company thanks once again Taylor"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the area. Top-notch service backed by the best food for the price. It's the only food I've had at restaurants that doesn't leave me feeling sick. They've made me a loyal customer. A+!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! Tiffany was the best waitress we've ever had in Vegas. Very attentive, and energetic. We watched football playoffs all day yesterday at Twin Peaks, and had a great time. Wall to wall HD TVS, Ice cold beers, and GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"really chill ... Definitely a guys place but still it would be fun to come and watch football or something here because the ICE COLD BEERS ARE GREAT .."}
{"text":"It was my first time at twin peaks. The place is pretty nice and the food was good. The service sucks though. I had to deal with a server that cared more about giving me a fake smile and trying to be flirty to myself and my two buddies that were with me instead of knowing the menu or what beers they have. I ask for a Guinness so the server ask if I want it big boy size. I didn't know what that was but a lot of beer sounded good me so I said yes. She comes back to tell me they only have it in the bottle. So I say that's fine. And what do I get, a can of Guinness. At this point I'm already disappointed. Then we ordered our food. I got the chicken tenders. Which I recommend by the way. But I asked for ranch and never got it. And I never was able to ask for some because the servers seem to only stay at tables that seem to flirt back in hope of getting a good tip. So I never got my ranch but was charged for it. The only thing that made my experience good at twin peaks was my buddies and beer that made me forget about the place."}
{"text":"New outfits fail on the staff. Food continues downhill. Trying for a family atmosphere and I'm not interested. I'd go to Chuck E. Cheese if I wanted that. Peaks was a sports bar and a fun spot.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to this bar/restaurant. I arrived around 10:40PM  I liked the decor  inside and the view of the hot staff.  I was alone today due to my buddies bailing out on me at the last minute due to a family emergency.    I ordered a 22 ounce beer at the bar and looked over the menu.  So i finished looking over the menu and waited for the hot bartender to return to take my order. I waited for 15 minutes and i watched the bartender take a food order from a group sitting next to me. ???? I was very confused as to why the bartender was ignoring me.  I am not bad looking so i was confused. lol  The place was not busy, it was filled up 30%. not too busy for a friday night. If it was really busy I would then understand why the bartender was ignoring me. In a busy bar you have to yell and shout at the bartender to get their attention.     I then walked away from the bar to one of the tables, i expected i would get better service there. Nope, i was again ignored. lol     I then walked up to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to a female manager and explained to her about this situation. She apologized for the inconvenience and she gave me a discount for my meal.      I ordered the smokehouse burger with fries.    The burger arrived quickly.  The burger was just okay. It was not great.  It was greasy and under seasoned.    I would probably return to this place but not anytime soon. This place has great potential. Great decor, hot staff.  But food is sub par and the staff seems inexperienced.    I was going to give this place 4 stars for how hot the staff looked but alas, i could not with all honesty."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place out.  Not bad food but wasn't the best. Its like a young hooters. The \"Girls\" seem to try to hard to be cute. Service is decent and pricing is a little high. Cant expect anything different on the strip though. I would come back drunk just for the view and a burger."}
{"text":"Cool Joint, Nice Concept, a TV at every booth is a very cool touch, the \"view\" is as advertised, service is great and the food is not bad...not great either, but all in all a cool joint"}
{"text":"I have been going to Twin Peaks in Las Vegas on the strip for about two years now.  I figure it's time I give them some props.  My buddy and I went there for the first time one afternoon and never wanted to leave the place.  We met this incredible waitress named Sara from Las Vegas and it has been a must \"go to\" location every time I go to vegas which is about once a month. (I know, Vegas is too close to Cali for my own good)  Of course, Sara has become my favorite all time waitress. She always treats us as if we are her only table.  Very personable, very attentive and quick to refill our beers...  She even taught me how to climb the 3 story wall and feel like a stud. Of course until the last time I went and she challenged me to a race up the wall. That girl is strong and swift too!  I can't count how many times I have returned to see Sara,  only to find the whole restaurant is spectacular... The best place to watch sporting events from NFL and College sports to the UFC.  Go early, get a seat, and enjoy some of the best beers in town... The Dirty Blond is my favorite beer (No, Sara is a red head!) and the queso is awesome... and In fact, my recommendation for best hangover food on the Strip is Mom's Pot Roast.... mmmm mmmm good!"}
{"text":"The house Dirty Blonde Hef was an awesome beer, and the food was pretty good. Service was good as well. I liked most the over all feel of the place. A man cave type feel. High top tables and tv's everywhere. Id go back ever for a beer or 6. The girls were nice, and pretty, but pretty dont cut it when it comes to service. They all seems on top of things."}
{"text":"Ask yourself what you're coming here for. If it's eye candy, you're in the right place. If it's good service, go somewhere - anywhere - else.  I sat at the bar, which was not even half-full on a Friday afternoon around 5pm. With 2 bartenders (sometimes a third helping out) it took me over 25 minutes to get a refill on my beer. Were they busy fulfilling work orders for the waitstaff? No - they were too busy chatting with each other and checking their phones. When one of the bartenders walked past me, I gave a smile, raised my eyebrows and tapped the top of my empty beer mug. I basically got a glare in return that said \"What? You expect me to WORK?\" I honestly got the feeling they were going out of their way to avoid serving me.  I guess I can see where they get this from - their managers (one male and one female) decided to have huddles or conversations with them right there behind the bar in front of customers. I don't know if I've ever seen anything that unprofessional. And the managers didn't even acknowledge the customers either (what few they were) or apologize for taking away the already-slow service.  I've worked on that side of the bar, and the golden rule is whenever you see an empty mug, you always - ALWAYS - ask if they need another. Eye candy aside, I won't be going back. This entire team from management down needs to be trained much better. The customer comes first, not your team pep talks and certainly not your phone."}
{"text":"Management should be ashamed  HORRIBLY understaffed for the USA World Cup.  Empty beer mugs and 15 minutes before we could get another."}
{"text":"The chicken biscuits and cheese bites are the friggin best. My bf and I come in all the time for the perfectly cold cheap beer and scrumptious food! Billionaire bacon for life..  Amber is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Twin Peaks Vegas, how I wanted to like you more.  The beer selection is slightly better than I had feared.  You close down the area of your restaurant with a view of the strip unless it is Friday or Saturday, you charge $10 for a beer.  It was from San Francisco Bay Area....not even local.  No such thing as happy hour here.  Your recommended mozzarella a sticks were limp and flat, both in taste and appearance.   I was about ready to leave and then a strange thing happened.....you changed shifts.  I got here just around 5.  Once the dinner crowd workers and customers started coming in, I disliked you less.  You started climbing walls, and shaming grown men.....but so did 15 year old boys.  I decided to put your faults behind us all, an give you another go.  At the suggestion of another customer, not you staff, I tried the trout.  Oh my goodness, that was pretty darn good.  Having caught a trout myself last week and cooking it, yours was better.  The beer temp fluctuated between 27. Something and 32 degrees.  I'm happy to see your beer temps did not fall too low, for too long, to separate the ingredients.   As the night went on, I almost enjoyed myself....until I discovered my siphoned wallet, but that is Vegas, not you.   Between here and the Phoenix location I've been to, I give you three peaks.  I almost gave you twin peaks, but you pulled pulled out some surprises like Total Recall to make it three peaks."}
{"text":"Stayed next door at the hotel before catching a morning flight.  Having been to Hooters and a TKs before, I was hoping for something a little better.  It did not disappoint.  I can only speak to the bar area, as it was just me.  They have 14 to 20 beers on tap.  Two were from the local Four Peaks brewery, and several others looked promising.  At $5.25 for a 22 oz microbrew during happy hour that is a pretty good deal.  Had the chicken finger \"teaser\" which was pleasantly surprising.  Here are my suggestions for improvement:  Turn down the music just a tad.  I could hardly hear the people two feet away from me I was conversing with at the bar and the bartenders really had to strain to hear my order.  Turn up the beer temperature.  Don't get me wrong, 29 degree beer is good, however depending on the alcohol content, beer ingredients start to separate at about 28 degrees.  At one point one of the screens said the beer temp was 27.6 or 26.7.  Probably someone who doesn't know bout beer said colder is better...not always true.  Be friendlier.  Your mileage may vary, but the bartenders didn't seem nearly as friendly as the Hooters waitresses I'm used to.  I'm used to annoyingly friendly.  Something in between would be better.  No appetizer special for Happy Hour?  What?  Expand to Seattle.  It would be great marketing since the old Twin Peaks TV show took place in the Seattle area."}
{"text":"I was undecided on how to write this review for one big reason: I have been there maybe 9 or 10 times now and gotten beyond exceptional service half the time and pretty low-end service the other half.  That being said...  The Pros: The hosts, managers, and girls at the bar have always been very friendly.  They take a minute to find out your name, ask how you are doing, and make some recommendations if you need it.  The happy hour specials are superb and our various groups have enjoyed the steak salads and pot roast.  The TVs are everywhere, in good condition, and have a good mix of games on.  Friendly bartenders, large beers, good happy hour.  Check, check, check.  The Cons: So after two amazing experiences in groups of 2 and 3 we went on a Sunday afternoon for the patio and recommended the joint to some friends.  I felt bad recommending the place with the service we got.  Our waitress was at the host stand with her head down and apparently spacing out.  Between our first drink order and ordering food/shots, it took something like 19 minutes in a pretty empty restaurant.  Total time between finishing our first round and actually getting our second round/drinks/shots came out to something like 35 or 40 minutes.  We kindly just paid our bill, tipped, left, and got some drinks down the street.   So since then...it goes back and forth between amazing service and mediocre/bad service.  About half the girls are amazing and the other half seem like the would rather be putting bamboo shafts into their nails than working.  It mostly seems like the bar is where we consistently get good service.  Myself and my fiance will be back when we want a quick drink and salad during happy hour, but I probably couldn't justify coming here for full-priced drinks or suggesting the place to friends/coworkers with such hit-or-miss service."}
{"text":"Had a great time day drinking at the bar on 3rd level. Good view of the strip. Good place to watch a game and get loaded. Bartenders hot and friendly....especially Tina"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Twin Peaks Las Vegas.  Each time I have had excellent service and my lates experiance, i was overly impressed.  Our server Betty deserves a very special thanks.  She was great (freindly and welcoming) She is one of the best.  Thanks."}
{"text":"After pulling in the parking lot and witnessing a cop circling the place and another one parked in the far parking lot by Discount , I learned that Twin Peaks has delicious sweet ice tea. I thought it was called \"entrapment\" when they did that?   I agree with the other reviewers. I'm not going to hate on the ladies. Those are some killer bodies and you can't fake that. But they all seem miserable. Food made me ill. The crowd is the same crowd you see every weekend in every bar within a 8 mile radius. That being said, I'm sure I'll return...eventually.   Congratulations, heaping, Twin Peaks, you're exactly what I expected. It's nice of you to start a business dedicated to helping those with no personality pay for their brand new boob jobs."}
{"text":"The view was nice.  Service was awsome.  Not a place to go back for a burger.  For $14 it was small and dry."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a \"complimentary\" birthday lunch per their email of sending the offer to me and after sitting down for over 10 minutes at a location about 6 feet from the bar and numerous waitresses (or so I thought they were pretending to be) walking by one finally stopped to see if I had been waited on yet.  I think with no drink or food or menu in front of me it would have been somewhat of a clue as no.   She said she would get a server for me and after another 15 minutes another pretend waitress asked if I had been waited on yet.  She did bring me a glass of water and a menu but evidently that's where the \"servier\" duties end because no one came back to take my \"complimentary\" birthday lunch order.   This place has to rate as one of the worst service bar/restaurants I have ever been in and will never return too. The manager's need to teach the \"waitresses\" how to do their job instead of allowing them to just stand around trying to look good and impress patrons.   Don't bother going there!"}
{"text":"I've been going there for a few years now, but after tonight, I vow to never go there again, or tell anyone that I know to never go there... tonight I had 8 friends of mine (including starting pitcher for the Dbacks, Rubby De La Rosa) meet me there to hang out with my wife and I, but after buying everyone DRINKS and FOOD, I got cut off---even though I was only drinking beers. I was far from drunk and had a designated driver, which I identified (my wife), but oh well... It is what it is...."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is horrible.   Ordered an app and drinks.   Five minutes later, ordered main entrees.   Five minutes later, get app and main entrees all at once.   Carly was nonexistent.   She was too busy sitting at a table with what appeared to be her boyfriend the whole time.   No joke, the entire 45 minutes, no service.   Oh well.  At least the food was hot."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with some family members on 2/7/15.  We were looking for something close by that was kid friendly after a funeral service.  We were greeted kindly and the waitress took our order.  However, the service was very bad.  The drinks came out in stages.  Have no clue why.  I ordered a Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives which I was told was possible. When I received it there was no stuffed olives.  Instead my Martini had a straw in it.  WHO PUTS A STRAW IN A MARTINI?  We had ordered another round of drinks, but the waitress forgot.  We had to remind her.  We decided to order some food.  I asked for side plates which she said she would bring.  She forgot again.  I had to go up to the manager and get the side plates myself.  It seems that these waitresses have no experience in customer service.  The only thing that we did enjoy was the food which was ok.  We don't plan on going back nor do we recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite new bar but only because of (1) the indoor rock climbing wall that is $10 for 3 climbs up (2) the upstairs bar and outdoor area with its awesome view of the strip and (3) the way the place is decorated like a woodsy man-cave. Very fun spot to belly up to the bar, people watch and then try your hand at the wall. Food is OK- lots of fried bar food as to be expected but a surprisingly good cobb salad. Love that the large beer size is called \"the man size\"- probably dissuades dudes from ordering anything but! Luckily, they had smaller female sizes for me. Clientele is about 90% male tourists (probably because of the location on the strip next to the Goratorium and because all the staff I saw was female, gorgeous, about 21 and scantily clad. Fun spot- I'll be back to tackle the hardest climb (there's 3 ways up and one 1 of them is significantly harder than the 1st two)."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a wonderfull pulled pork Nacho with a fantastic elevated view of the strip. Service was just pleasant but I felt a little slow, but not so slow that I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and they are not fair.  The chicken tenders are the best in town,  especially with the spicy thai chili.  Most of the girls are friendly and make you feel welcome.  A friendly smile and a cold beer is just what the doctor ordered."}
{"text":"Try Knotty Brunette- ice cold brown ale beer!  The staff was very friendly, always smiling:)"}
{"text":"The Knotty Brunette is AMAZING! Come for the view the beer or the food, either way you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was the worst!!  Drinks were a mess, service was horrible, drink and food orders was both wrong. Girls are cute but super stupid! For real! The best part was I believe I got food poisoning fro the undercooked meat in the sliders."}
{"text":"The food and service at this bar is usually top notch but the last two nights are gone in and sat at the bar for more than 5 minutes and no one even offered me a drink. It's a shame that they spend more time talking to them so that the customers."}
{"text":"I came into Twin Peaks for my first time ever and had a great time with a beautiful lady named! Alexis White! I had a horrible damn at work today being a paramedic and today she just made my whole day turn around. I highly recommend the restaurant and this waitress! She offered us the best choices on food. Kept our beer ice cold and checked on us at the best times! Good hire! Thanks Twin peaks! Btw the billionaires burgers with double party was the best choice ever & the twin peaks dirty blonde & twin peaks knotty brunette beer mixed was so fucking good blended! I'll stop going to Buffalo Wild Wings and I'll be here more often! :)"}
{"text":"What a shame..this place is just going down hill. The service has been horrible now the last two times we have been in. Tonight we had to constantly look for the waitress to order another drink or food.  And then again had to search for her to get our bill. Then! A miracle! She was all of a sudden attentive when it came time for the tip. Well too bad, so sad. Had to look for you for two hours and now you start doing your job? This place needs to start training its staff and soon. Not sure when we'll be back. Buffalo Wild Wings is looking pretty good."}
{"text":"Let's just say, I'm the mother of three sons. Who like girls. Between the three of them and my husband; my Mom and I were talked into lunch at Twin Peaks, because we love those four guys. I agree, Brianda is your girl. She is on it, and I would recommend her as your server, if you can get into her section. Because we were driving and had stuff to do, we didn't try the beer. But, we were impressed with their cooler with the temp gauge on top. They clearly take that pretty seriously. The dÃ©cor is cute for the theme. If I was meeting a few friends for a beer after work, this could be a good place, depending on who was joining me. My sons and husband appreciated the waitress uniforms and subsequent scenic views, too. The food, we all agreed, was 'meh'. It's bar food, and it's ok-ish. If I was drinking some beers, it would have been exactly the kind of thing I wanted. Since this is really a bar with food, I would recommend it for that purpose. Beers and bar food with the gang--it's a good choice for that. Also, had lots of plasmas and various sporting channels going in the bar, so if you wanted to see a particular game or something, this would be a good spot for that, I think. I do like good beers, and will go back to try their two house brews with friends, for sure."}
{"text":"Call before going. Paid cab fare, walked up to have someone tell us they were closed...2hrs early Yelp listed 2 am closure but arrived at 12!! Don't think I'll go back since we just got the \"oh well, sorry\" response. Guessing not everything in Vegas is accommodating for late night food fare...Not sure if mgmnt is aware of early closure."}
{"text":"I love Twin Peaks on Eastern.  The beer is always ICE COLD and the girls are super cool and take good care of you.  I would never go to any other bar on Easter in Henderson.  The food is really good too and the prices are very fair.  All of the girls are super cute but my favorite is Samantha"}
{"text":"Came in with my wife and was seated right away. Our server Hallie was prompt and took our drink order. Food was great and quick. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and I had plenty going on with all the TVs. My favorite part was the ice cold beer. 29 degrees!!! Come check this place out! Thanks again Hallie!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Obviously people don't come here for the food. Fried pickles were way to oily and became soggy, \"hangover\" burger didn't have much taste and the fries were bad. Service wasn't good either, girls spent way to much time talking instead of getting the food out. We received our app then 3-4 min. later got our food. Wasn't happy and don't plane on going back"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great service and atomosphere . Probably the best Philly cheese steak I have ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos are awesome! After walking around for cars and coffee every Saturdays you build up a little bit of hunger and their tacos are amazing- the chicken is flavorful and pico de gallo is fresh. Service is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Hey corporate.....8 bucks for 4 shrimp is a little ridiculous. Cold beer but not worth the drive just for that."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here, I thought I would write a review after eating here to be fair. I was greeted by a handful of gorgeous gals that caused my mind to just blank. Why am I here again? Where do I wanna sit? UUUUUUuuuuuuhhhmmmmm Oh yeah, lunch. At the bar.  Had the fish n chips for lunch. The chips were kinda hard as if they were stale, but I wouldn't think they were since I was once of the first ones in there for the day. They were kind of a chore to chew. On the fries were four little bite size pieces of battered fish. How cute. Generous ketchup and tartar sauce on the side. I was hungry again an hour after returning to work. Service was nice, and my meal came out SUPER FAST. Maybe I order something else next time. I hope ALL the food isn't so mediocre just because we're staring at hot asses the whole time, but I'll give it another chance sometime. Fish n chips is NOT their fortÃ©."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is an extraordinary place to go eat! I think the burgers are made perfectly and the customer service is extremely professional. They are a great place to go!!"}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't return with so many options available.  Our service was 'ok', she was friendly but messed up our appetizer order and would disappear for long periods of time.  We both ordered the fish tacos and neither of us bothered to finish them.  I'm not sure what the issue was but the fish wasn't good.  Perhaps it was old or freezer burned or both.  The fried pickles were good maybe a little too salty but I would try them again.  The outdoor seating offers a great view as well."}
{"text":"Came here for the Broncos game. The food was pretty good. I also had the dirty blonde beer (I added a few slices of oranges) and I really like it! And I'm not a beer person. This is def a guy bar the gals are barley dressed but aren't bad looking.   There are TVs all over including the restrooms ( so my husband says). But it was an overall good time!"}
{"text":"Ashleigh was awesome best service ever!!!! Loaded tats were on point and beers super cold.  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good food, great service and tons of tv's."}
{"text":"Mom and Mike's favorite place.  Best hospitality in Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"Short & to the point, great food & super nice staff. I'd come back again! If you get a 32oz beer, they serve it to you in a pretty cool souvenir cup!!"}
{"text":"The food was on par with Chili's or Applebees or any other crappy chain fare.  For being a sports bar, the beer selection was really weak and the selling point of ice cold beers just means that they try to keep the cheap beer so cold that you can't taste it.    I was also a little shocked that cut off jean shorts and skimpy flannel tops was considered a marketing tactic. Kinda like lumberjack Hooters.  Sex sells, but flannel and sexy is a combo best left for the frozen North.  This is Vegas for god's sake!"}
{"text":"Drea is the bomb! I came to this location because it was close to work and the food is pretty good. There are a lot of horrible waitresses here, except for Drea. She is professional, smart, funny, sweet and does her job. She isn't there just to look pretty. I'll be honest, I hate going there when she isn't working because I know the service isn't going to be as good. If you're in the area, come here for the wings, but be sure to ask for Drea!"}
{"text":"The wings suck don't bother ordering them...I have a felling the whole menu is rough. The beer comes on icy cold mugs which is awesome. If they would improve the quality of the food it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had THE WORST experience ever at this restaurant. To start our waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there in the first place and while we were very nice she continued to have rude and dismissive attitude as if she didn't want to be bothered. My boyfriend ordered a burger with grilled onions and fries and I ordered a salad. My salad was mediocre can't really mess it up. When our food arrived my boyfriend look at his burger and there was two slivers on grilled onion, barely any. So we thought its ok no big deal we will just ask for more. We told our waitress about the situation and I think she took it personally. Brought back a cup of grilled onions with the worst attitude. It was unbelievable. Apparently she was so offended she told her manger to come and talk to us. He said \"Was there a problem with your food?\" And by this time we were annoyed and told him \"Yeah we ordered grilled onions on his burger and there was barely any on there, we just wanted grilled onions.\" And I could not believe it but the MANGER SAID \"Well you know, it's a restaurant, it's cheap. Maybe next time you should just say you want extra onions.\" THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. The manger is an idiot and should be fired. We have never gone back and we never will."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had a burger & fries. Girls were very attractive and friendly. Wasn't anything too special though for lunch"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been! Red head Courtney is no longer here so save yourself a trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hangouts in Henderson. Ice cold beer, decent food. Great sports bar with lots of tv's all around. And excellent servers like Ashley (the petite, beautiful blonde ) make the place much more enjoyable. Funny, attentive and very effective. The service and friendliness make it a weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"I take my clients to Twin Peaks twice a week and I found the customer service is awesome!! the food is just a awesome. i like the steak sliders and the chicken fried steak is huge and quite tasty. Love the girls!! I dont think you would be disappointed. I wasnt."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Very nice atmosphere. I went on Monday and the waitress, Sam, was the best! All her recommendations were on point. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not quite the ultimate place to view UFC.      The number of places streaming UFC on/near the strip is limited.  This was the second place we've tried.  The first under-card began at 3:30 and we parlayed that wager with other matches.  We arrived at 3:15 excited to follow our bet.  We were told by the hostess that the the UFC section of the restaurant would open at 5PM and we could enter for a cost of $15.  We spent the next 1.5 hours wondering how our wager was unfolding.  By 5PM a line for the UFC section was forming.  Everyone in line spent the next 25 minutes watching two employees struggle to detach perforated wristbands from a large sheet -- stockpiling more than the occupancy load I'm sure.  Patrons were getting restless wondering aloud \"Couldn't someone have done this preparation the night before?'  I agree.  The student council at high school dances were more practical than this management.  1 star for operations  Once we were seated in the UFC section things went better.  The atmosphere was simply great, service was friendly and our beer was always refilled promptly.  5 star service.    My thoughts on food are like many other yelpers.  Each person at the table pushed their plates away stating food wasn't tasty enough to justify consuming the calories.  1 star food.    Following the event we walked out to the balcony.  I'd pay more than $15 just to enjoy the balcony alone.  Very roomy and comfortable with a wonderful view of strip.  5 star atmosphere.    I'll pass on this place and  return to Sapphire Gentleman's Club for the next UFC event.  Sapphire is also close to strip hotels, organized, admits people on-time, has its own UFC section, seating and food is readily available, servers are friendly and when the event is over patrons walk into a lounge with another great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty girls - check Good food - check Welcoming atmosphere - check, especially from Billie and Marissa!"}
{"text":"Girls were friendly when we arrived but absolutely no positive vibe or smiles as they waitresses other than being polite.  We ordered all appetizers, the burger sliders were above average, however the pork sliders were pretty bad like average BBQ snack fare with little flavor."}
{"text":"We had a recommendation from a friend to go there when in Las Vegas. We love beer and the list was impressive (and we are from \"beervana\" in the Northwest).  However, the negatives outweighed the positives:  1. Volume on the speaker above our table for the football game was at airplane-takeoff decibel levels and didn't appear to be adjustable.  2. When our 2 beers arrived, the server gal had 3 beers in her hands and was confused about which might be our two, as all pretty much looked alike. So, we will never know what it was we were actually drinking.  3. Our waitress was prompt in taking our order and we were very specific that my husband wanted NO ONIONS on his burger. She understood and repeated it and appeared to comprehend it just fine. However, when the burgers arrived, his had the carmelized onions on it (which blend in with the melted cheese, so you can't just pick them off without removing all of the cheese). Luckily, I stopped him from taking a bite as he is allergic to onions. The waitress should have checked to see that she was picking up the correct order (same as with the beer, but that was a different gal), or that the kitchen had actually made a burger without the carmelized onions. He sent it back and decided he would eat elsewhere rather than chance what would come out of the kitchen.  My burger was delicious - but I'm not allergic to onions.  They were gracious about not charging for the burger mistake, and all of the servers were upbeat and cheery, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to twin peaks tonight and had amazing service from Amber. Not only is she smoking hot but she is a great waitress. The manager Dawn was really nice. This is my favorite place to eat in concord!"}
{"text":"We all know what the decor is about.  The food is good, not great.  The large Pork Nachos is definitely large.  Pork was good, but they put diced pickles on there.  Not a pickle fan and the menu doesn't list the toppings.  The waitress just said pork, beans and cheese.  They were still good, just picked off tiny pickle pieces.   The burgers are OK, 4 peaks does a much better job.  The beer selection is not listed on the menu and the waitress couldn't find her cheat sheet.  She had to keep going back to the bar to find out what they had on tap.    The best item was the apple turnover dessert."}
{"text":"The manager decided he was tired so they closed early during the busiest week of the year with the golf tournament going on. Scared money don't make money."}
{"text":"We came here multiple times on my bachelor party last weekend. It's perfect for a couple of beers with the guys while the game is on.  There are also GREAT views of the strip from the top floor.   You're sure to get a seat and the service was great, all the waitresses were very friendly and helpful. There is also a climbing wall, a quirky feature i though was a pretty cool idea.   If you get a beer, make sure you go for 'Vegas Size'. You won't regret it."}

{"text":"This is bar far one of my favorite places to go in Henderson. The beer is 27* (which has ruined draft beer at other places for me) the customer service shown by Modesto and Alyssa is amazing Tory has also been fantastic! Watching her multitask is like art! Great team behind the bar led by phenomenal manager Anjel.  My friend and I have frequented here while opening a restaurant down the street. It was nice always being greeted by warm smiles and people that knew us by name and knew our order. Again can not say enough how fantastic the service is here and the cold beer is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Cool environment, had amazing service from Brianna! Outside patio is very cool with misters and a fire pit and plenty of TV's outside. There's little tvs at every booth as well inside. Food is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Found this place and had a couple burgers. They were very tasty, fries were nice and crispy and the girls were great. The patio seating overlooking the strip was actually closed except for the bar but they were cool and let us take our food over to a table and eat."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks on Eastern is a great place to get some last minute grub. They have a good selection of wing types and wing sauces that taste great, but they taste like any other wings from other bars. The pulled pork nachos are the real winner. The pulled pork was tender and they used real cheese and not that fake, nacho cheese stuff. The only critic I would have is that there should be more cheese on it, as it didn't taste \"cheesy\" enough. If you're going to order this, I'd recommend asking for extra cheese!"}
{"text":"Beautiful weather and a fantastic outside patio !!! Mix in great whiskey,beers delicious food and great service and for a solid experience! Give it a try I will be back to add an extra star looking forward to the uniform changes, which happen frequently!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food and the service is non existent!  Do not go here it is a total waste of your money"}
{"text":"So first time to Twin Peaks. We walked in and got sat right away. And that's all we did. We sat there for 15 mins. Not a single server stopped by the table. We had At least 6 or 7 girls walk past the table and not say anything. So after 15 minutes, we got up and left. I told the hostess as I was leaving no one came by the table and she just had this look on her face like I don't know what to do. As a waitress in the industry, this was unacceptable. Also the theme of neon bikini party was more like let's wear our bras tonight. They were not bikinis. They were bras."}
{"text":"Vegas hotel restaurant , food was good ,  The waitresses are in a uniform that could be best described as LimberJack meets Hooters  Lots of flat screen TVs and music    I had halibut tacos and a green Chile soup  It was all good , the waitresses served us well and often check if we needed anything   It's a very casual stop as you wander up and down the strip , up and down the escalators. And walk ways ,  No world class chefs and no formal dining here but sometimes that's preferred ( often actually )"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!  I have come here with some friends on three separate occasions and every time was disappointing. The staff is rude and absent minded. Takes them a long time to get your order in or even just bring water! The food is mediocre and not worth what they charge for it. The only thing I did like here were the alcoholic specialty drinks which took way too long to make. And to top it all off, every time I did eat here, I always had terrible stomach upset for the rest of the night. Never coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for a meal and a couple drinks and left raging. We walk in and were sat quickly, but once we sat down we were completely IGNORED, NOT helped once, and not even acknowledged. Multiple waitresses walked past us, seeing our menus sitting out, no drinks, no hello. After waiting from 5:30 to 5:45, we decided it was time to call it quits and walk out. Upon approaching the hostess stand, the hostess and another waitresses were standing there talking. Clearly mistakes were made in the seating, but no one made any effort to rectify the situation. Mind you, the place was not busy whatsoever either. Very annoyed. Very frustrated."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy coming here...and i'm sure the guys don't mind one bit. Food is good, beer is good, girls are good. And the multitude of TVs is good! We enjoy coming here for happy hour or whenever there is a game on, however at times it can be extremely loud for any socializing among friends.   Don't come here if you think cleavage is offensive."}
{"text":"Great bartender named Sydney makes the hell out of the drinks accurate and fast coming back here soon with friends"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The beer is cold.  That being said, the breastaurant vibe in here is way over the top.  I like breasts, and restaurants, but sometimes you want a little separation, (see what I did there.). But seriously, beyond tight outfits, and typical \"will flirt for tips\" attitudes, they go so far as to put profiles of the servers on the screens to help the stalkers locate these girls after their shift.  This place makes me feel slimy, and I end up feeling bad for the servers.  They might love it, but it's a sad commentary on where we are as a society."}
{"text":"Do you think two months of advance planning would at least get you in the door here?  Think again!  I booked our dinner here for a bachelor party of 14 people two months in advance and coordinated with their sales and marketing manager, Kristy Mendenhall.  She provided a contract which I signed to finalize our reservation and I stayed in contact with her up until the event to make sure we were good...  One month out, they made a minor change and kicked us from our reserved \"man cave\" onto main-floor seating.  The night of the even we showed up 15 minutes prior to our scheduled arrival time. We didn't even make it in the front door because of their unprofessional and dismissive security guard who refused to listen to me. Eventually, the general manager opened the front door and I told him about our reservations. The manager said he would have to check but never came back. We went elsewhere to eat that night.  In summary: We signed a contract two months in advance! 14 people drove from out of state for this event and never even got in the door!  I even gave them the opportunity to make up for the mistake before taking it further and writing any review.  Kristy Mendenhall apologized and said she would send gift certificates to make up for the mistake. She told me this three months ago, and still NO gift certificates have arrived. Stay away if you are planning an event here!  The good news, is after we were turned down at the door, we walked down the escalator to PBR Rock Bar & Grill, where they were happy to accommodate us and provided excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I have been here on numerous occasions.  The service is amazing!  The bartenders and waitress go out of their way to ensure you have an exceptional dinning experience.  Managers consistently check on you, and ensure their staff is doing an excellent job.  The food is fresh.  I have sampled their menu and it is consistently excellent.  They have cooks who can accommodate special requests.    They have an extensive beer menu.    Game day is amazing!  TV's galore.  They even show special events such as boxing and UFC.  I highly recommend this place for their great service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal meal with great service! We had a great time and enjoyed our time in Twin Peaks this evening..."}
{"text":"My friend loves coming here for UFC fights. That's the ONLY reason I come to this place. The service and food are both sub par at best. The night that we came our server seemed to be on point at first. This is before the fights began. So the 6 of us ordered drinks. Another girl brought 2 drinks. She said 'who here ordered beer?'. Two of my friends raised their hands. To which the girl said 'who got what?' To which my friends asked 'which is which?' And then the girl said 'I don't know.' WTF? Really? Didn't you read the ticket? Eventually we got it figured out, but it happened again.  When the food comes, one of the meals was a burger that was just lettuce, meat and sauce, no bun. It came out w/ a bun. When our server finally came to check on us we told her the situation. She had it removed and put in the new order. During that time we ordered another round of drinks. I'm not sure at what point, but the runners, for our table anyways, seemed to just give up on trying to hand out our drinks and was at the back of the table where no one was sitting and called out drinks to have us pass them to one another. WTF?  One of my friends had requested blue cheese for her wings. Still no turkey burger. Legit took 30 minutes to get a turkey burger brought out. Blue cheese never was brought to the table. Our waitress would go MIA so we had to rely on others to bring items or check on things.  When the checks came, my friend that had the turkey burger issue had 2 turkey burgers on the check. Our waitress must have known her service was pour because she too gave up as when we got our checks she just handed them out to one person for us to distribute.  At this the fight was good."}
{"text":"Ella's is the bomb, she is on top of it! Received amazing service. Beautiful smile and personality. This Twin Peaks is the Best!!!   The manager Angel  is So Beautiful and Friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great place for consistent yummy food and service in a tidy environment.  Destination doesn't get better than this to meet friends, enjoy sports, great music, food and service.... WWCD!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place. I'm not sure if I've had it too much or what but they're starting to slack. I order the chicken and shrimp basket with fries almost every time. Today the fries were old. Like they we're re-dipped in the grease to reheat. Nothing was fresh. I may have to divorce Twin Peaks if they don't get it together!"}
{"text":"Came in with the boys and Brashtynn was fantastic! Quick and nice service, great beer!!!"}
{"text":"The good steak fries are gone I am disappointed and now they just throw the skinny fries on there and they use to have a nice presentation."}
{"text":"Service sucked... we sat for 10 minutes watching our waitress talking with a group of other waitresses at the hostess stands. It also took 15 minutes for us to receive our bill, and get the receipt back. There was no syrup in the coke we had to tell her, she didn't even see the light tan color of the coke. The food was good, not stellar, the 'plate' they used was a piece of wood. It was a good touch for the venue but hard to eat a hamburger or other large items without food all over the table and falling off the 'plate'."}
{"text":"This place is simply ehhh  Pros: really cold beer & really good venison dip. Cons: long waits for someone to get your order, takes over 30 mins to actually get your food after ordering, waitress are on their phone 24/7 and completely forget you exist so you'll never get a refill, and food is very mediocre."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for cold fries and an over cooked burger. Everyone else in our party of 14 finished eating and still did not have my food after sending it back. Asked for it to go and they said they would comp my meal. The n the waitress asked if I just wanted them to take the food off the bill so we could leave. I said no. Cook my food correctly, put it in a to go box, then take it off the bill. We sat down before 8. It's now almost 10pm and I still don't have any food."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here now a days so take it for what it's worth but I love the vibe. The place is upbeat and awesome and Shak kills it every time as well as whoever she's working with. Today she was with Lisa and she too was great! ZERO smoke is the number one reason for the loyalty!!! Well that and healthy lunch. Imposter veggie burger!"}
{"text":"Great place for a little something different.. The chicken fried chicken is very good yum yum.  That's my reason for the four stars . I be also the wings & they were average as well the burger too."}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday evening to watch the NBA Finals Game 5 and we were seated right away on the 3rd floor. Although it was busy, we still received the best service ever. Also, the food were delicious! Thank you Megan for such great service!!"}
{"text":"I'd thought this place was a great place to watch an event, but no unfortunately the TV's were not working for half the game and our waitress who was in hot lingerie didn't come back for a little over 30 min. We could have ordered more but just decide to not come back."}
{"text":"We love this place! We just discovered it last week and went back again in the same week. The food is Amazing. The best Meatloaf you will ever have. The best fried pickles we have had, they are spicy and for under 6 bucks its a huge appetizer.They have drinks like a lemon drop shot  for 2.99 all day everyday, and many more on the list of shots. But the waitress told us you can turn them into full blown drinks for the same price! Awesome! For desert we ordered their Apple Turnovers with caramel sauce and vanilla ice-cream, wow. They were so fresh and perfect in texture. I had blackened fish tacos and they didn't skimp on the size of the fillets in each of the two huge soft tacos they put them in. Best of all they have so many flat screens, even in the booths and you can change the channel in your individual booths to whatever channel you wish. This is our new favorite place in town. We live in Glendale and we will be traveling there regularly now. I am sure the view of the adorable girls is a nice added plus for the guys. Great atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"a couple of friends and i went last weekend for lunch, service was fine the waitress was friendly, food was also good, however when we left and were in the parking lot about to leave my friend noticed his cell phone was missing. he immediatly went back in and the hostess called the manager to speak with my friend. he pointed out where we were seated and she told him she would look in and around our booth. he waited at the hostess station for several minutes, she finally came back but didnt look yet. he was getting irritated at this point because the dinning room was not busy but he waited for several more minutes. she came back a third time and told him she would check around the booth as she still hadn't done it yet, now 15+ minutes of waiting have gone by. as a manager she should act more like a manager and do her job. my friend left the resturaunt and has vowed never to frequent this establishment again because of the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Daf was perfect. She is so professional and she took care of our group really well. We will be going back for corporate events to see her again!!!"}
{"text":"I must say I had low expectations for this place from all the previous reviews. We went on Sunday to watch football and got there before 10am. Ordered a bloody Mary and that was good! Had chips and queso which was ok nothing special. Later ordered a the ranch chicken sandwich that was probably a 3/5 stars. Apparently the host station is in charge of the music so when there is a commercial on they turn on the music. Well let me just say that is a bad set up and you need to pay attention to the game or it's a total fail. The beers were extremely cold with a range of 26-30 degrees that made the beer (imo) taste so much better. Now Savanna from Hawaii was our server and for me she gets 5/5 stars. She was very attentive and super friendly. Savanna was the Best! Good place to watch football, clean and it's not smokey. The place got super crowded so go early if you want a table."}
{"text":"Good cold beer. Food was great. But Bambi... sweetie you need to find another line of work, because you ain't gonna make it as a waitress. If I had not been with a co worker, I would have called for a Manager to find me a different waitress because you failed miserably. I understand everyone has to learn, but damn girl... you didn't even try."}
{"text":"Cool location. Fried pickles were good. $35 minimum on a Sunday when I went....wasn't an issue for me as I was drinking as well. The talent seemed to be a lot better at a FL location I attended."}
{"text":"This place has some great barbecue nachos. Nice view of the strip and quiet around lunch. Have not had anything else there. The beers are a good size though.. Lol"}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend and his buddies have been going here for years (well...because) but I recently went for the first time. The waitress are always so sweet and the service is top notch. The food is also SO good. Our server last night, Alexis, was so sweet and went well beyond her duties. The wings are outstanding and the drinks are good!"}
{"text":"Great service, limit selection of flavored vodka ... only Citron & Peppar.  So I had a Corona.  The friendly guy next to me said the Bud Light on tap was as cold as Ice as the temperature gauge in the front read 27 degrees so when he got his beer it literally had ice in it!    My parents would really love to come here!  He also recommended the New Fowl Play, which is a Turkey Burger.  Looks so great that I can't wait to go back & order it!  I had just eaten, but he got it & I could not tell it was a Turkey Burger cause it looked juicy & amazing like a regular beef burger.  I will be back very soon to try this & the Hunters Meat & Cheese Board!  The New items look fantastic & if you don't have a place to watch the Mayweather fight... here it's $30!"}
{"text":"OK...  So, my friends and I used to go to Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  It was fun, but it took 30 minutes to get there, so we didn't go very often.  The food was decent and the wait staff was friendly and able to get our orders correct.  It was also packed every day for lunch, which is generally a good sign.  So, imagine our reaction when a new TP opened up on Camelback!  Awesome!  My friends went there while I was out of town and said the food and service were awful.  Maybe they ordered wrong...  Maybe they had a bad server.  Who knows.  So, we went there last week, so I could do a \"quality check\".  There were 6 of us.  Everyone got their food at different times.  I ordered fish tacos, which was my go to choice at the Scottsdale location.  The first one was OK, the second one was bad.  I stopped eating after one bite.  At least at this time the server was nice and apologized for all the problems in the kitchen.  And today...  (You can see that I really gave this place a chance)  We had more people from out of town that wanted to go for a long lunch.  So, despite my friends original bad experience, and another one the week before, we decided to dare the peaks again.  Mistake.  One guy recommended wings as he had them at another TP and said they were \"decent\".  At this point, \"decent\" was all I was hoping for.  So, I ordered the wings.  Another person ordered grilled chicken strips.  Same usual fire drill.  Long wait for the food, and then everyone receives their meals at different times.  The waitress told my friend with the chicken strips, \"Don't worry, your chicken tacos will be out soon.\"  Um, that's not what I ordered...  I don't want to imagine what happened when she ran away from the table.    Well, the wings were awful.  I challenged myself to eat 3 of them (the most cooked looking ones I could see) and stole some fries from others.    When the grilled chicken strips finally arrived, they looked disgusting.  Like someone had microwaved some chicken strips and then tried to put some grill marks on them.  I told my friend not to eat them.  And then.  Oh, there's an and then?  Why yes there is.  The checks.  There were 8 of us.  One guy was paying for 3 people and everyone else was paying separately.  We do this almost daily without issue.  The waitress came back to the table about 4 times before everything was finally corrected and signed.    The one thing I will say, is that it doesn't seem to be the fault of the wait staff.  This place clearly suffers from BAD MANAGEMENT.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Serivce was amazing!!! Beer was 29 degrees and the food was great! Big thanks to Brashtynn for being our server!"}
{"text":"Nelly was fantastic waitress, food was great, beer was cold! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been to TP back in Texas, and the various locations have different styles. Style here...professional, friendly, and welcoming.  The food is good, but you don't come here for GREAT food.  You come to have a great time, sports, beer, and pretty girls.  Josie helped us last night, and although, she got added some tables last minute, service never decreased.  Hard working girls plus good food plus cold beer, equals a great place to hang your hat."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is a great place to unwind after a long day at work!!!! I don't know where to start. Our hostess (Quay) was great! If you stop by make sure you ask for Sierra, Kristen or Shania they are the best! They're all great for good jokes and conversations. Even though Ariana wasn't our waitress she still stopped by our table and had a great conversation with us. Definitely recommend coming here when you can."}
{"text":"Pretend for a second that you're interested in good food, and not in the waitresses. Now, imagine some of the worst dishes you've ever had. Got it? Welcome to this dump."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Well thought out, great food, terrific service!  Had a blast!  The rock climbing wall was very cool!"}
{"text":"Worse experience ever! Brian \"the boss\" there is a jerk and does not know what the meaning of customer service is! This is his exact word. \"I don't care what my employee said to you before but I'm the boss here and etc. \" I made a reservation and \"the boss\" is the way to solve problems??  We are  their regular customer (3-4times) a week and twin peak just lost us as a customer.I even got our conversation recorded and will take this problem serious. \"The boss\" going to get fired. I will contact his \"boss\" and see who's boss!  I'll make sure your boss see how you run that store.   Former twin peak employee."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, fantastic fish tacos! The wings are great as well....tons of TVs for watching whatever sport....good place to chill"}
{"text":"bad service. okay food. but bad service. waited forever for everything. 30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant and waitresses that just dont give a crap about women who come to eat. waited a while to get a bill too. Unless you have a penis you wont get good service here."}
{"text":"I wanted like this place but it took more than hour to pay for my bill. Kimi our server was horrible. She never refilled my water and took forever in getting us food and paying for our bill. I will never come back to this place and I recommend you save time and money and don't go there."}
{"text":"First time in and I was a little disappointed. I ordered the 10 oz sirloin steak which came with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Well, they brought me a 13 oz ribeye steak with asparagus. When I informed the waitress that this wasn't what I ordered she apologized and took it back. I give her that, she was very polite. The manager, Omar, came back and said he would charge me for the price of the ribeye steak instead of the sirloin. So me, being the kind hearted person that I am, said okay because I felt bad if they had to waste a perfectly good steak, but I also asked for some mashed potatoes because I don't care for asparagus. Long story short, I wish I would've just sent back the steak because he ended up charging me for the sirloin anyways. Overall the steak was okay, it had a lot of fat though. Just make sure you have the waitress repeat your order back to you to make sure you are getting what you order. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"If your going for the food not a great spot the atmosphere is good and lots of beers on tap but dont get hyped by the food in my opinion they could do better but then again who am i."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Our waitress was super nice and the beer is amazing! All the food was up to our standards and they continued to check on us!"}
{"text":"Really I feel as though there's nothing really wrong with this place - it's just ok in every way. The waitresses that work there are all t&a, although most of them are nice. Last time I went, someone in my party asked for a sculpin and the server thought he said Heineken so he repeated himself and the server repeated Heineken .... And do that's what he got. A Heineken.  Steak salad is yummy and wine is standard."}
{"text":"Good food! Lousy service. Guess the girls think they look too good to do there job! I recieved no silverware, napkins when asked. Told her we were done and it still took her another 15 mins to come back and ask if we were done yet. Cute redhead but waitress shes not! May wanna try the other version of Twin Peaks.  Wont be back!"}
{"text":"if anyone ever wondered where old fat white guys and their 90 lb Brazilian butt lifted wives go to drink, this is it! walked in, looked around, left"}
{"text":"Ok...so I really wanted to compare Twin Peaks to Hooters in San Marcos CA.  I heard it was similar...yet different. I ordered the wings...extra crispy cuz I hate \"soggy chicken skin\". Of course, it came...soggy chicken skin\".  So I didn't feel bad about sending it back....seems simple enough to cook the chicken as asked.  So it takes an additional 30 plus minutes to get my corrected order...thank god that is was done right the 2nd time around.   Honestly...not a great experience at this location. It if wasn't for the amazing service with a smile from Audrey...I'd be giving this joint a disappointing...2. Audrey, thank you for making my experience...enjoyable in spite of the kitchen.   Best thing about this location....Audrey, hands down."}
{"text":"I was drawn to Twin Peaks by the lovely waitresses and my best friend agreed to go for my birthday. It ended up being one of the best dining experiences that I had on the Vegas strip. We had unsuccessfully looked for breakfast and once I saw the girls at Twin Peaks, I told my bestie \"this is the place I told you about yesterday!\" She was a real trooper and agreed to go there. One of the waitresses, I wish I caught her name told me to try the Hangover Burger - she read my mind as I had spent the night prior drinking (hey it's Vegas) and needed to recover for another night of fun.   Our waitress, Natasha I believe - sorry I was a bit distracted :-) - was super awesome. She kept coming back to chat with us and we had some pretty amazing conversation, not to mention that she also pointed out some cool nightlife spots along the Strip. She was very attentive, brought our food out fast and made sure we were well taken care of. She was even nice enough to pose for a pic with me...a great birthday gift. :-) So if you're in town and go to Twin Peaks I highly recommend asking for Natasha, she's quite awesome...and beautiful. :-)  We were stuffed from the awesome meal but my only regret was not coming back to try the Blondie Brownie...it looked so good! Anyway Twin Peaks offered great food and great service making it for a very memorable birthday for me. I highly recommend dropping by and I will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband was so excited to try this place out and the menu was filled with a variety of options for any pallet. The staff was very nice and the service was good as well. The food was okay. My husband ordered the tomato bisque soup which he enjoyed. We ordered the shrimp and chicken tenders basket which was also very good. You have the option of getting your shrimp and chicken tenders blackened or fried. We got our shrimp blackened and our tenders fried. Both were very good. We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese which was just ok. It was kind of cold and the cheese sauce was all the way at the bottom leaving many of the top noodles without cheese. It was loaded with bacon on top so we didn't complain. For what the food and beverages cost, this restaurant was just ok. We paid $61 for lunch. Beers are $10.99 each and I got a small bud light for $5.49. I guess center strip Vegas is expensive but it just seemed high for what we got. Premium location on the Las Vegas strip yields premium prices.   Fun place to check out, climb the rock wall, watch the games, and chat with friends. Not a place to hang out all day long and drink...unless you want to go broke."}
{"text":"It is an interesting sports bar concept.  Women with tight uniforms with decent food and sports everywhere.  There is too much competition in Scottsdale.  It should last.  I will continue to visit here on business trips."}
{"text":"The beer and TV's are a huge plus. Beer is ice cold with a nice selection. Tons of TV's so no matter where you sit you will get a great view of any game in question. Food is very average and a little over-priced. I have had the burger, quesadilla and chicken sandwich in different visits. Service has always been solid. If you go in with the proper expectations you won't be disappointed... beer and TV's for any sporting event!"}
{"text":"The imposter burger was delicious and our service was good. The inside looks dingy (old decor/old cabin feel) and waitresses are in bikinis which is kind of gross from a safety/ food handlers position."}
{"text":"For those who don't travel the country often for work/play, Twin Peaks is a decent size chain, not a special Las Vegas sports bar. Meanwhile, this location stands taller than it's peers when it comes to looks. The ladies here are far prettier than many of their sister locations, and we've been to more than half of them after sporting events when most regular restaurants are closed. (And, remember, this one has a climbing wall, which none of the other have. You can challenge your server and race them to the top. In fact, they'll even bet you they can beat you and likely take your money.) I had a few clients want to come here to watch a few games and we witnessed one girl beat about 10 guys (and make about an extra $100!).   You came here for the food, right? Not to hear about the scenery. Wrong. This is a glorified Hooters, with better looking girls, better food, better outfits and better service and in most cases better TVs. It's actually a good place to come watch sporting events. You know you didn't come here for the food.   On the other hand, the food isn't bad. It's much better than you'd expect at competitors. In fact, they prep it each morning and it shows in the taste. If you have to eat at a sports bar, this is one of the better ones to chow down at. There's ample beer and liquor. The difference is the wing selection, which rests below what you're used to. Still, there's plenty of other items on the menu to keep you happy."}
{"text":"This isn't the kind of place you want to bring the family for dinner, but it a perfect destination for those looking to join a sausage fest and watch sporting events. There's a solid selection of nice, flat screens to watch and the best part is the food is a full grade (if not more) better than Buffalo Wild Wings and maybe to steps better than Hooters.   The food isn't great, but for sports bar food, it gets the job done. We tore into the chicken fried chicken which exceeded our expectations, being less greasy than we expected and with white gravy that packed taste. The chicken was tender, too. As for my green chili meatloaf, it was pretty good. Come expecting to watch sports, drink beer and munch on average food, and you'll leave thrilled and probably with a crush on some young, college girl."}
{"text":"Just went In for a quick bite got just a bowl of chicken chili and the Mac n cheese. Well both were lacking in flavor. Waitress was nice enough atmosphere was causal but the food was less then appealing. I mixed the two together which gave it a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Everyone knows what Twin Peaks is about: being better than Hooters. This one achieves the goal. Lots of cold beer, big TVs, decent food, and friendly, pretty girls at work. The service can be uneven on the floor when the place gets crowded but the bartenders are top-notch."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the food. Our waitress switched and refused to serve us and made a comment to our new waitress about us. Not really sure if that's how you treat paying customers or not? Although our new waitress was overly nice, the service was horrible!!!! Drinks sat on the table long after they'd been finished as well as food. The ONLY time she was quick was to get our check. $75 meal to be treated like crap with horrible service? NO THANKS! Will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"Awesome scenery. Went right before the lunch crowd and thought I walked into a dream GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS! Waitress was nice and Hangover burger was great. The French fries where the only thing that should be changed."}
{"text":"Tator tots were delicious, the cold beer was a first for me and I loved it! Also, our server was great and very easy on the eyes!!"}
{"text":"Pros: small plasma TV ' s in every booth, great drinks. Cons: food is not good, service was not great from the host to the server (our server was not as personable as I hoped and she sort of checked in on us..it was like a walk by ask \"how is everything\" and she didn't stay long enough to get an answer). Now I was caught off guard upon walk-in at the ladies work attire..it's quite raunchy and that look doesn't work for everyone (ladies: if you mind your guy looking at other females half naked this is not the place to be). I wasn't at all impressed with the food. I suppose if you get drunk enough the quality and taste of food doesn't matter. I would only return for the drinks tho."}
{"text":"Nice setting and what a VIEW! Good service. A+++"}
{"text":"Had some of the best service I've ever had while attending a Twin Peaks. My server Bianca went above and beyond to make sure I feel comfortable and welcomed. I am not one for eating at those type of establishment but if I ever feel the craving for greasy food I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Me & the husband love coming here to watch football! We order the bacon jam sliders, wings & fried pickles, which are never a disappointment. The service is amazing and the beer is always icy and good (I 100% recommend the dirty blonde)! There isn't a bad seat in the house with all tables having a great view of any game, the booths even have private tv's which is awesome. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger! Champoux was an all star waitress! Came here for a birthday lunch and it was perfect. You can rock climb inside - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"First of all, Imma state the obvious, the girls here are gorgeous. Lol. Food and service is just as good! Tried their bbq wings and \"hangover\" burger and both were deliciously satisfying!"}
{"text":"I bought the sampler plate and brought it to work, I work right next door, and was hoping to share something great with my co-workers. This place just opened, but the sampler was not good at all. The buffalo tenders were VERY soggy and limp, the mozzarella bites and fried pickles were soft and not crisp at all. Pretty gross and it was an easy plate to get at least one thing right... :( very disappointed. Hope that they start to do better!"}
{"text":"We were here for the NCAA Men's National Championship Basketball Game, and the entire experience was nothing short of AMAZING. They reserved us seats at the upstairs middle bar facing the strip just because we called ahead. Our two bartenders were both gorgeous and incredibly attentive. Two different managers stopped by to see how we were doing. The food was tits (pun intended) the beers were ice cold, and the value vs. what you get everywhere else in Vegas is unparalleled. Kudos. It's so very clear the leadership at this place has a major focus on hospitality, and it shined through during our entire experience. Truly a breath of fresh air on the strip. I cannot recommend this place enough. Run - don't walk!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Tuesday night. We had a fairly big party (roughly about 8 of us) and the service was good. Our server, Michelle, was super sweet and friendly.   We ordered a lot of different appetizers such as the pulled pork sliders, the sampler plate, chicken nachos and wings. All of which were decent, but nothing special or mind blowing. Out of all of them, I'd say the pulled pork sliders win.   The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's obviously nice for men who want to see women who in shorts and some cleavage. I loved that there were so many TVs on with different sports games on so I wasn't missing out on anything.  Overall, I'd only rate the place a 3 because the food is just mediocre, doesn't have much selection but the service we received that day made up for it."}
{"text":"They costumer service was very good and very polite the food was outstanding and the scenic view is absolutely beautiful the beer was awesome and I would recommend it to more people"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in one evening, and were pretty impressed with the cold beer.  I mean, beer is always supposed to be cold, I know, but here it is really, really cold.  There's even a sign on the wall showing the exact temperature in the cooler.  It fluctuated between about 28 and 30 degrees, but really - why would you order beer above 29 degrees given the choice?    We didn't try the food - I'm not convinced it was likely to be super fresh and tasty.  The service was efficient more than polite.  At least the beers kept coming."}
{"text":"I ain't gonna lie, I'm a fan on the brostraunts that are cropping up around America. And especially in Vegas, it seems appropriate to visit one of these establishments. Yes, I came with the wife, but she happily agreed. I think it was her tummy talking because she was about to eat a shoe off the Las Vegas strip she was so hungry.  We kinda stumbled on this place. For a late Friday night, it was surprisingly empty. Good for us, I guess. We get seated by the hostess, and keep in mind, it's my first time at a TP.  The girls here wear some insanely short shorts. Like, they had to cut the legs of shorts that were already labeled as Jeezus jean shorts. I mean, these were cut higher than bikinis. I ain't complaining. Nice views, and even the wife's jaw was dropping. Yeah, I got a cool wife.  We ordered a cheeseburger, a dozen classic breaded wings, fries, and a house brew.  The beer was actually pretty good, but I got the big 22 oz, and couldn'd finish it because I just had too much food in me. The burger was actually good. I mean don't expect a great burger, but for late night after club food, this burger hits the spot. But the surprise were the wings. The wings were excellent. Perfect ratio of breading to actual meat. Not so spicy, but spicy enough. Very good. Fries were fries.  Girls were running around. It seems they were understaffed, but the bar girls served as our waitress as well. She defied all odd and had the shortest shorts ever. I can't even explain it. Well, I can, but that's for a different forum.  Give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Very good service & very fast seating!!! Mel was a exceptional waitress!!! On point on everything!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes, at least 5 waitresses walked by and made eye contact, but never stopped to take our order. So we left and went to to the tilted kilt where we always get outstanding service."}
{"text":"Typically one of the best places to watch any sporting event in Scottsdale and offer a great happy hour. Good food, friendly staff and all around fun atmosphere. The only bad experience in years happened recently with one of the new managers, Alondra. Several times she tried to remove beers still being drank and often lingered at our table and others. Still a great place to join friends! Just one bad experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and dont come here! You're better off eating dog food! This place should close down."}
{"text":"Awesome place to catch any sporting event!  Kayla and Cindy provide amazing service!!!   The ladies take care of you, while you enjoy the sport of your choice.  I highly recommend this location for your next outing."}
{"text":"The customer service here is great!! My husband loves coming here because of all the television screens he can watch his sports while we eat. The thing this last visit that stuck out for me was my daughter ordered a burger and her bottom bun was really soggy,when the waitress came back to ask how the food was she could tell something was wrong with my daughters look, she asked her what was wrong with her food we had to make her tell the waitress that her bun was soggy. The waitress very nicely asked her if she wanted a new burger or a new bun it was up to her it was no problem at all. My daughter is very shy so for her patience was nice. The food is just ok to me i had the philly and it was really greasy so i only ate half, my husband and daughters boyfriend got the chicken tenders and shrimp baskets, their food was fine. The food is not bad but nothing sticks out that i would recommend to someone to go undless they want a place to watch a game or see almost naked women."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. As a women... I thought... Oh great. Another titty restaurant. I couldn't have been more wrong. There are plenty of titties but the service is outstanding. My beer is always cold and full. The food is great. And you can't beat football season at Twin Peaks. I think I counted 90+ TVs. And they pre-schedule them! Come cheer on your favorite team without fear of the channel being changed! Oh and order the red hot wings. You're welcome."}
{"text":"**Positives** Tons of large, clear TV's Great view of the strip from above. Overly friendly staff in bikinis. Cold beers- it was literally on the verge of freezing when they brought it. Decent tasting food.  **Negatives** Small menu with lack of choices  I'd love to give it a four because I really enjoyed the service and was surprised the trout I ordered was tasty (i don't expect much from chains like this). it lost a couple of stars because It's definitely more of a bar then a restaurant. Drinking makes me hungry, and there is very little, if anything, I saw on the menu that caught my attention."}
{"text":"Not an angry person. Been here for a while hoping that the service would get better. Food service is great. But waiting 20 minutes for a beer on football Sunday and watching your drink melt at the bar doesn't really work for me. Cute girls, great food, bad service . Wish I could say I will come back. Maybe next year."}
{"text":"Good food. Good energy. Ask for Amanda R if you go, she will take good care of you! The southern fried chicken sandwich was on point! Drink specials weren't bad either. I stopped by randomly while getting my car worked on. Not a bad way to spend your time while waiting on Van Chevrolet."}
{"text":"Came here on Superbowl Sunday and it was crackin!  The servers were great and the wall they have here is insane!   Was here for about 2 hours or so watching the post superbowl interviews and reactions while getting diving into so really good chicken strips/tenders with fries. I wish I had asked for barbecue sauce instead of ranch. The food was great.   While the drinks were a bit expensive you have to keep in mind that it is VEGAS! Everything is cheaper on the STRIP so you have to be mindful of that. Outside of that, the drinks were great.   There are ample TVs all over this place. Every sports station is constantly going on multiple TVs simultaneously.....IT IS AWESOME!   One of the best things about this place was that it wasn't too packed which was perfect.   #superbowlafterparty"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to watch games!  Katelin and Haley are the best!  They are the reason we come here!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a quick bite and some drinks. We were greeted and immediately sat in a booth. It was a bit loud as I could not hear what our hostess said but I just nodded, smiled and said thanks. Our server was nice but again I could hardly hear her so I just nodded, smiled, ordered a beer and my wife got a cocktail. My beer was ice cold and the cocktail was perfect. Lots of tvs and sports on made it feel like something was going on even though it's was still 100 degrees outside at 8pm. The food was good even though there was some really hot sauce that came on our pork nachos. Next time no hot sauce for sure. It's definitely way better than the last hooters I visited and the views are indeed very scenic!"}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR BILL!!!  They sneaked a couple items on our bill and when we disputed it, whoever the manager is around 8pm 3/21/13 stepped in and instead of apologizing, swore on his children that he saw the items on our table.  Now, on a packed restaurant, he's either really smart to remember each item on peoples' tables or he's a very dumb manager.  The latter is more likely, although everybody knows the business concept is sleazy, that's no way to run a business.  Frequent customers lost."}
{"text":"Great; to think, another Hooters or Tilted Kilt type restaurant. Well... kinda sorta, but this one is better! They have some pretty girls here wearing lumber jack style uniforms, but what sets them above the others is the food and beer.   The service here is awesome, the girls are sassy, but fair. Management is cool enough to hang out and strike up a conversation. So... that means a lot to me.   Although I just had the fried pickles and jalepenos here, I must say that all the food around me looked and smelled really good. Well, back to my basket of fried goodness. They are crunchy good with good flavors, and still crunchy even after sitting for 20 minutes. That just means the batter they used to fry these puppies up are good and consistent.  Let's get into the beer... They have a good selection of beers on tap. Not the best selection, but a good selection. So... there is a digital thermometer at the bar indicating the beer is served below 30 degrees, even though it was still over 100 degrees at 9 pm at night. BTW, it was 118 around 3 pm. The mugs are kept at a chilling 27 degrees and when the chilled beer sits in your frosty mug for about 3 minutes it forms a layer of beer slush on top of your beer, and in this freaking heat it was THE best thing to hit my lips.  So little to say... I will be BACK!  Oh side note... they have misters in the side patio deck with games out there. So go ahead, have a frosty beer and play some games while your at it."}
{"text":"I have been here no less than 6 times and each visit has been a good experience.   We came here last night to watch a football game. We had a great view of at least 5-6 televisions from any seat. There was even a TV in the men's restroom. We all commented about how many televisions were in this place.   There are low tables, bar seating and some high seats at tables. They even have a roaring fire going with sofas. It was busy but there was some seating still available all night.   We had a group of four, we had beer and it was cold. They display the temperature of the beer in the dining room.  So cold it had ice burgs in the glass. The waitress was very attentive and kept our glasses full all night. She was busy and didn't take the time for the normal table side chat, you'll get that if they aren't too busy (lunch).   We started with the wings and chose the medium sauce for them. They were really good. The waitress cleared the table almost immediately.   The guys in our party ate: * Flat Iron steak (cooked to perfection and really lean and tender too).  * Chicken fried steak (huge portion) he commented that it had some really hot peppers in the sauce. He did eat it all.  * Venison chili (good) * Meat loaf (sliced and grilled) it looked like a steak. (good)  I agree with some comments about it being like hooters... but the food is much better and there was a lot better choice too. They have burgers and fries if that's what you want. The only menu item I missed was some kind of pizza. Most bars in the area offer burgers, wings and pizza as the standard bar food.   Bottom line the food is awesome and the wait staff was point on for game night, not to mention some nice looking young ladies.  Give this place a try... it's not really a date place (although there were some ladies there). I don't think I would take kids there either, just my opinion."}
{"text":"One bartender was the best on the 3rd floor. I think her name was Tina. The other might be the worst person I've ever interacted with. Obviously should hVe fought her name but made me so uncomfortable. Not even trying to put her down but she was talking mad trash about every customer that was in front of her and me where I could here. FYI said no more than three words to here. Those words, \"would you mind grabbing my charging phone.\" She was upset that I closed out with the nice bartender helping me before she left. If a manager from there is reading this it's the 16th of January 2018 at 4:50 and that person is the worst."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place to watch sports! Had a lot of fun for the golden knights game with the girls dressed up in black n gold. The short manager was really nice coming to give us some chips and queso cards. Hannah was just outstanding and a very sweet girl and got us into the knotty brunette it was very nice!"}
{"text":"Always a cold beer and family friendly atmosphere . Best fried pickles and good wings ! Wish the service was a little better especially for people that go there to not Just Flirt and hit on the Girls !   We always take care of our waitress and just think all the girls should be able take care of the patrons , especially as often as we go !"}
{"text":"Best sports bar that I've found in this area. I have a baby, so I can't hangout in 90% of the bars around here since they're all full of smokers.  This leaves my family with a limited amount of places where we can go to enjoy a few beers and watch a few games.    For Happy Hour this place is awesome!  Cheap MAN SIZE (22 oz) beers for $3-5, I can't find many places cheaper than that.  Plus many appetizers for half off, what a bonus!  Their atmosphere is great.  It is like being at a lodge in the mountains.  In addition, the animals gives my son something to look at.  Also, just walking into the place and seeing 10 big TVs before you even get into the building is awesome!  My wife also loves this place.  One great thing about it is that it's family friendly.  They even have a family restroom that I can use to change my son's diaper in peace.   So many other restaurants don't even have changing stations in the guys restrooms.  The service has always been great.  The waitresses are always extremely friendly and helpful. No complaints there.  The only thing I can think of that would improve the place would be the food.  I would like to see a few more options on the menu.  That's just me though, as I get bored and like to try many different things.  Almost forgot,  the fries are damn good!!  Make sure to try them.  The fried pickles are awesome as well.  I've already converted a few people to the place that previously favored Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I may have thought this was a friggen bar based on the show Twin Peaks.  I was horribly wrong.  But that's where the bad ends. Our server was pleasant and gracious and the atmosphere was really nice (we also went at about noon). I had the Spicy Chipotle chicken and it was awesome. There was a subtle kick to it and it left me satisfied.   It's bar food but honestly, this food is way better than Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters. The decor is also cooler too."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this review has nothing to do with my server.  I work in sales and I manage a huge sales operation. One thing this makes more more mad than anything is when simple directions can't be followed. I ordered a steak salad. The charge 13$ for it. I don't care about how much it cost as long as it comes how I ordered it. I'm not sure why it is so difficult for the kitchen staff to follow directions. They put everything I requested to be taken off of the entree, on the salad and they put heaping amounts of it on there. In addition to that it took 25 mins to make....are you kidding me? 25 mins for a salad? Yeah it has steak on it but that can't take more than 5 minutes considering it was 6 minuscule pieces. This place is trash. Might as well spend half the money and go to Taco Bell. At least the wait would be shorter, and the 8$ an hour cooks they have there can at least follow directions."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great staff, great environment! What more could you ask for!? Always look forward to seeing Courtney G amongst many others!"}
{"text":"The beer is good and everyone says the food is mediocre?? The chicken tenders are damn good! Dijon mustard is great! If you want to go for night after work its perfect!"}
{"text":"I wish it was more obvious by the name what type of restaurant this is. Example Hooters. My husband and I accidentally came here thinking it was Four Peaks brewery. Still thinking it was Four Peaks we ordered based on the great food reviews of Four Peaks. It wasn't until after, we finally realized our mistake. I really think this type of place should be more obvious in the name so that people like us and others that do not wish to eat in this sort of place do not have to go through the trouble."}
{"text":"I have been here once with my family and a couple times with friends and enjoyed myself each time.  The beers are cold you can order the \"MAN\" size or \"girl\" size (nice marketing ploy)  The food was better than I had anticipated with large portions and full of flavor.  The only minor complaint I had was a Taco Plate that we sent back twice then gave up because it came out with cold meat so the cheese didn't melt.  The waitress appeared to get irritated with us even though we told her the rest of the food was great.  Oh well a minor incident compared to the remaining experience.  I really like the TV's in the booths and the bathroom so you don't miss a play.  The waitresses have always been alot of fun, they are knowledgeable about the menu simply stunning and willing to take a photo if you wish.  I find no issues with their outfits these woman are beautiful and certainly clothed with more than you would see at the pool.  This is a fun place for lunch just get there at 11am or anticipate a wait.  My colleagues and  I prefer to sit at the bar. (Views)  I look forward to a couple Sat - Sun football games this year as this place has more to offer than most.  Very clean and fun atmosphere.  Nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service, while not terrible, wasn't great. I went with 3 stars over 2 because while it didn't blow me away, it doesn't deserve to be slammed or completely written off. We may have just been feeling the impact of a new wait staff or an inexperienced waitress, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.   I don't think I would go out of my way to go again but it doesn't make the worst of Charlotte list either."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 30 minutes for fish tacos and a grilled chicken sandwich. Place wasn't that busy. Waitress said kitchen was backed up I think she forgot our order. Either way 30 minutes is too long and the food still had not arrived. Oh and football fans beware. This is a UFC bar. They will turn off your game in favor of UFC."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel welcome! All the ladies who work here are sweet and knowledgeable, the recommendations they provided my husband and I really came in handy while we dinned at their Las Vegas location. I was so impressed that I told the manager what a great job his people did and what a great meal we had.  5 smiles"}
{"text":"The only reason I came here was because this was the closest place that was having the boxing  fight from my room at the aria. I ordered some loaded tots and they weren't loaded at all. They were just regular tater tots and they were disgusting. The wings I ordered were also pretty terrible. It did have a nice view from upstairs but that was pretty much it."}
{"text":"This place could easily be my 2nd home!  Great, cold (29 degree) beer, friendly staff and a man cave with huge tv's. oh yea... The food is good too. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here after CES, they had a 20% off for event attendants! I came in and sat at the bar, the first thing I noticed was the giant wall of TVs, and they had everything from UFC to Hockey to Football, and of course, Basketball.   I got the 13 oz ribeye and a man size glass of the dirty blonde. My server was Ashley and she was really nice and prompt with her service! Kept an eye on my water cup level and always offered to help.  My initial reaction to the dirty blonde beer, a Twin Peaks draft, was that it was extremely delicious! Low IBU and very citrus-y. The steak was really well done, it was a little on the salty side but that works well with the beer. It came with fries and asparagus, I should have asked for mashed potatoes instead I was not feeling fries; but the asparagus had a great texture and flavor.  Oh yeah, the waitresses here have a dress code of low cut red top and short jean shorts, so there's that. Twin Peaks is one of those \"breastaurants.\"  I would rate it 4 stars for the food, (beer and asparagus were 5/5 and steak was 4/5, fries were a 2.) and 5/5 for service."}
{"text":"Friendly, upbeat and attentive service from Ambere and super ice cold beers will have us put Twin Peaks in our happy hour rotation."}
{"text":"Great large dining spaces with a full service bar! Typical bar food with a couple of twists...(it's bar food..remember this) But let's face it the Servers are what you are here for and they are worth a full star!!! Malyssa is worth 2of the 4 stars!!! Make sure to ask for her!!!"}
{"text":"The interior of this place is very nice. It was extremely busy but there was still seating. The patio was well laid out and had quite a bit of room. The service was ok although the waitresses seemed to get easily distracted by the tables of men hitting on them. At least the waitresses are dressed nicely and look pretty good as opposed to the typical hooters waitresses which are usually a bit beat and strippery. The burger I had was tasty and I enjoyed the spicy-ish fries. I would go back sometime."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great with plenty of TV's showing any sporting event u want to see. The food is great. The service is amazing. When u come ask for Nalina. My glass was always filled. She is friendly, professional and very attentive. I will definitely come back and visit."}
{"text":"Sat there and watched the game last night it was absolutely fabulous even know they were extremely busy they treated us veterans like gold we were able to have a free meal and it was absolutely wonderful thank you very much Twin Peaks"}
{"text":"Great food, salad, soup, wings. Friendly staff and management. Marleana was our waitress and she was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheesesteak around, pretty good fish and chips too. Servers are always polite."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the salads - chicken and the steak and they were excellent.  I am very picky so I would not say they were excellent if I did not really mean it.  Service was off the charts attentive and the flat screen tvs with sports are probably the best i have seen in a sports pub.  Lot's of them and easy to see from the majority of seats.  We would go again and try other menu items if they were in our home state."}
{"text":"It seems as though I'm writing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews lately but hey, if they earn it, they deserve it!   Twin Peaks is Hooters with flannel. BUT, as a female I actually loved it. I had a business lunch here with a super big table full of guys and the waitress was awesome! They were so efficient, it was great. I got the turkey avocado smash (just a turkey sandwich with avocado) and it was simple and hit the spot. It came with these super yummy sweet potato fries.   If you go in expecting a 5 star restaurant you'll be disappointed, but this is my new favorite sports bar for sure! So many TVs!"}
{"text":"took forever for a waitress to acknowledge us. By the time we finally got our food it was lukewarm too cold. We came to the conclusion that the only way you can get good service in this place you need a penis."}
{"text":"The food was good. Had a great hamburger and a pretzel. Our waitress was hot and provided great service. Good place to catch the game.,"}
{"text":"2 stars for their Fried Pickles, very tasty!  Was only here supporting our friend for the Bikini Contest..  I really don't care for this place-- not because there are half naked girls walking around pretending to be your \"server\" .. But because they're soooo stupid & clueless.. They're friendly .. But our waitress didn't even know the menu, at all! And big minus for just throwing my overflowing drink on the table, having it spill all of the place! Ugh.. -_____-  No trips in the near future for me.."}
{"text":"Sitting at twin peaks enjoying my beer and they decide to put the sound on for the May whether and mcgregor press conference, and as I watch family's leave because of the language  OMG.  AS management continues to listen to the language they keep it on.     Unbelievable.  !!!"}
{"text":"Time for a really quick and concise review of this place.  This review will be about the food and not the scenery.     I met a coworker here for lunch.  We ordered some wings and cheese cubes.  The wings were spicy tai if my memory serves me correctly.  They were really tasty too.  I will try them again for sure.  The little cheese cubes that are fried were yummy also.    I ordered the chicken tender basket with French fries. The chicken tenders were okay.  I personally do not think the oil was hot enough.  They were still good.  The French fries were good though.  I have eaten at this place twice and it has been good.  I have no problem with coming back."}
{"text":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Most of the girls are not all that pretty ... and the food is overpriced (of course) and it is not that much better than the food at Hooters.   Ok, management, wake up and smell the coffee.   In the food&beverage industry, restaurants such as this are called \"breast-aurants.\" That's because the customers are NOT there for the overpriced, bland & mediocre food. They are there to look at, and chat up, attractive & personable waitresses in revealing attire. Management, that is the business you are in. Based on my observations, management has entirely forgotten that most central concept ... within this restaurant concept.  And management shouldn't revel over that large wolf-pack of men who come in just to suck down a couple of brewskis while consuming all the large screen TVs and bar stools during a major sporting event; they won't be around any other time, leaving the space vacant during most business hours and so they aren't going to make your monthly target numbers. To hit the numbers, you will require wait staff that will draw-in repeats & regulars who will log significant F&B spend on a routine, if not daily, basis in order to socialize with them. Again management, that IS the business you you have chosen to be in.   My two visits ended my season here, 0-2. My visits were on weekdays about 5pm. And yes this huge space was mostly vacant at that time. A time when regulars, if this place had any of any merit, would stop by after work to socialize with their favorite waitress. The food was of a somewhat higher quality than a typical Hooters - but that sure ain't sayin' much. My tab+tip each time was around $20, salad+burger+drink. F&B-wise, for a twenty, anyone could get much better food at a ton of other venues.   So we are back to the wait staff, required to take up the slack. A few of the waitresses were attractive, most were not. Worse, almost all of them had caught a serious case of \"diva flu,\" bothered by the mere thought of chatting up customers. Instead much more focused on strolling around as if on a pageant runway - and picking up tips off tables that were actually mostly attended by the food runners.  The capacity of this venue is gigantic and if management wants to fill it anywhere near the level required to pay the rent and keep the lights turned on, it is going to have to get serious about recruiting - and retaining - much more attractive and personable wait staff. And holding high expectations of them in terms of \"guest entertainment.\" Said another way, they will have to have some degree of personality beyond that of 'prima donna,' constantly mentally reveling in the notion they are so d@mn gorgeous that they are entitled to work here ... and entitled to easy money for no effort.  I suspect management here is on cruise-control, thinking they've purchased some-kinda turnkey operation/concept, doing little more than hiring the best of whomever happens to wander in to fill out an application and waiting for the venue to run itself based on its menu. That just won't cut it. Based on my knowledge from successful managers in this line of work (Hooters, Tilted Kilt), management should be ACTIVELY recruiting applicants to staff these positions. One manager I knew, whenever & where ever he encountered a personable, attractive young women at any kind of more tedious or lower paid work, he immediately shifted right into his \"recruiting-mode.\"  Again, this space is huge, and so it's a huge challenge for management to make sure it stays full. And the way to meet that challenge is for management to step up to the plate, do its job ... and get busy finding the type of waitress upon which this particular restaurant concept is so crucially reliant."}
{"text":"Food is good. Beer is cold! Service is way too slow, which is why the 3 star rating. Had cheese burgers and wings. No complaints there."}
{"text":"BBQ wings and fries Thumbs up.  All the waitresses are pretty and the service was very good even on busy Super Bowl.  Mgmt was very friendly and accomodating"}
{"text":"Good food for good price. Atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. We were In a party of 5 and each of us ordered something different and all of it was delicious. (Sandwich, fish tacos, chicken sandwich, chicken tenders). The beers are ice cold and great on a hot day! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday today and Dreama was our server! She was so fun and we loved her. I ate the chicken fried steak and had their house dirty blonde- both were phenomenal! This is my new favorite restaurant. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I'm never disappointed the staff is always outgoing and easy on the eyes lol food was great as well"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Twin Peaks fan already, due to having one at home in Omaha. So it was refreshing to see how great Twin Peaks is at another city. Food was just as good and beer was just as cold. Zero complaints whatsoever, highly recommend stopping here and requesting the balcony overlooking the strip. Also, request Selena's section, very attentive and friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Service was great - all wait staff was VERY attentive as we sat at the bar.  Food was fairly good.  We ordered the chicken tenders and the waitress asked if we wanted any other dipping sauces.  We said yes and order blue cheese.  Well the bill came and they charged us $.69 for the additional sauce - REALLY??? Our bill with food and drinks came up to over $60 and they are going to charge for extra dipping sauce?  That was our only gripe."}
{"text":"Over priced tiny wings, watered down $8 cocktails, understaffed, topped off with dirty bathrooms....."}
{"text":"Note: slightly better than Hooters, but is that really something to be proud of?  Okay. So today was my buddies half birthday. He wanted to go here and he kept saying It was \"Better than Hooters\" and \"see there are a lot of women here too.\" But really this is barely a step up from an in and out burger joint.   Yes, yes, yes, the waitresses are attractive, and they can hold a conversation, but when I go to eat that is not all I am going for.   Service was very pleasant, and timely. The was served by three different people. All were pleasant. Short polite conversation kept the 25 min wait time acceptable. But I don't know if everyone would be so accommodating.   One neat thing is that they list how cold there Draft is. 29.7 degress. I do like a cold beer and  I would like a visual of how cold there draft is.   Btw, I ordered my favorite drink, Greatful Dead, and while this is not a hard drink they figured it out and it was Fantastic!   So:  Food 3 star Service 5 star Drink 5 star  Thus may rating...."}
{"text":"I love going to Twin Peaks, the food & service are amazing! i can set here all day writing good reviews about this place. my advice you have to try it :)  EA"}
{"text":"Samantha was a ten and the restaurant was always a ten great job. Cheers!  Okay ......my wings were great, they fell of the bone, service awesome...... beer 28.6....... the combo crazy good.  And the scenario awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in a few weeks ago and didnt get the best service but decided to give this place a second chance. Our server DREA was amazing! Not only was she friendly, funny, pretty and courteous but she had excellent knowledge of the drinks and food! Thanks for the redemption in this place! Will be back again soon! A+++++++++"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  It was if you were inconveniencing them that you actually walked into their restaurant.  Little snotty girls that couldn't care less about providing prompt, good service.  Asked three times to have the Nationals game put on the TV and all three times we were basically ignored.  Left after one drink...and it took about ten mins to even get that one drink.  Come to find out after going to another place close by that is the reputation of twin peaks with the other establishments in the area.  Do not go there unless you don't care about being treated like crap and provided poor service!  Not even worth one star!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Memorial Day with my husband and his airmen friends. Our group was seated quickly on the 3rd floor and we eventually ordered drinks. The airmen received a free meal with a purchase of a drink. So we went ahead and ordered our food. My husband ordered a cheeseburger with fries from the special military menu,  and I ordered the philly cheesesteak. The food WAS DELICIOUS!!!  The place is really nice and bigger than what it looks like from the outside. This place has 3 floors !!!!   The girls here are very pretty here and quite friendly.   Our service was consistent with Colleen as our waitress. We watched the game while we ate and it was a really relaxing time. There's A LOT of TVs here. Each booth gets its own TV, but there's plenty of big screen TVs on each floor if you have a table  ."}
{"text":"Great view and awesome service. The view of the strip is absolutely amazing. The food is really good. The food quality is excellent and came out really quick. Ashley is awesome and an amazing bartender. She is extremely friendly and service was outstanding. Will keep coming back"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I had heard SOOOOO much about this place and it did not deliver.  Granted, I was going for a bear and to see beautiful women with large breast. Not a high water mark to meet, but they didn't.  The place had no energy, the staff only as much charm as needed before they turned back to convo they were having with the other girls in the corner. They all looked like they hated being at work and they were completely bored.   The appetizer platter was ok and the beer cold, but it was Friday happy and it was LAME.  I wasn't won over in the least AND their boobs weren't big."}
{"text":"This is had been great every time I went the beer it's at like 34 degrees and food is good service could be better but it's not like a 4 or 5 star restaurant or anything so over all go here for some good food and drinks"}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Twin Peaks. It's got a Mancave type layout, plenty of TV's and good looking waitresses. It was packed during the after-work rush and the ladies were hustling. Service was excellent but the food was disappointing. Obviously, no one comes here for the food but with so many dining options near the Biltmore, its a waste to try any food here. We had the sliders, chicken fingers and Cobb Salad. (All were sub-par)     Tilted Kilt is miles ahead of Twin Peaks with better atmosphere and food. I'd even say Hooters is superior. I'm not a fan of the Cold Beer gimmick or Shot-skis but maybe I'm just getting old. Who's down for Sizzler, next time?"}
{"text":"This place was started by the former CEO of Hooters which is not at all surprising. I guess he figured that scantily clad servers with enhanced boobs is a concept that can't fail as long as there are men in this world. And maybe he'd be right, if it was located in an area that didn't have so many other places that offer equally attractive servers, better atmosphere, and better food.   Unfortunately, it just feels like Twin Peaks is trying too hard. While the waitresses are attractive, I didn't see any real effort being made by them to interact with the clients. The food, while better than Hooters, is nothing special, and my order of fish tacos came out of the kitchen far too fast to have been made from scratch which leads me to believe that the food is prepared elsewhere and likely just warmed up or microwaved at the restaurant.   Finally, the atmosphere is supposed to be like a hunting / fishing lodge, but with such a giant building, it really felt more like a warehouse with some outdoors memorabilia stuck to the wall.   Maybe I'm wrong and the chain will be a huge success, but I just wasn't impressed. With all the competition in the market, Twin Peaks really doesn't differentiate itself in any meaningful way."}
{"text":"Billie and Marisa are amazing!  Great bartenders and beautiful woman!  I really enjoy when they are my servers"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day. It was ok. Menu is pretty small. I have to agree with the other yelpers... Why are you serving beer slushies? Had the brunette which was descent. Time to change the temperature gauges on those reach ins girls. Now to the girls. Cute outfits. Fun concept. Very pretty ladies. Applaud you for using your assets and making those tips but please get a little training going on here. I couldn't get a straight answer for any of my questions. They just give this blank stare. Seriously, I only asked where the bathroom was and what was on tap before I decided it was a lost cause. I had to laugh it off. Now if I were a sports fan or a guy I could totally see the appeal with the tvs and the boobs. I might go back if someone else insisted but not on my own."}
{"text":"I give this new place 4 stars mainly because of the friendly service. Thalia is an awesome host. And Monica was a great server. Or was it Madison? Shoot I forget her name. Cute brunette. Anyways they were super friendly and she even didn't charge for a salad I ordered due to a \"mistake\". Lotta tvs to watch sports. Everything's new. Thumbs up ;)"}
{"text":"Spend your breakfast and lunch here watching the NCAA tournament. Shay & Cherina provide fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Restaurant roulette brought us here tonight. We also got a coupon for free Chipotle Queso and chips from Yelp on our first check in.  The dip was enjoyable, something different and nice. Hubby had a cup of Venison Chili. Said it was ok, but tasted like beef. I ordered the \"girl size\" Twin Burger and he ordered the \"Smokehouse Burger\". My Twin Burger was okay. The meat to bun ratio was off. Basically, the burger could have been thicker.  He enjoyed the Smokehouse Burger. Said it was good, but too big. Waitress was sweet, she paid A LOT of attention to my hubby, as she must have been jealous my \"twin peaks\" makes hers look like gopher mounds."}
{"text":"Always watch football, ufc, or boxing games. Big TV's and the food is decent! Always a winner when I choose this place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Good food but service lacked...  The husband and I wanted to try this out since they opened this new location on Eastern not too long ago.   The place is huge! There is huge bar in the center with lots of tv's lining the top.  They also have a huge patio area with many tables for the al fresco diner.    We were seated right away with time to look over our menus.   A lot of time.  By the time our waitress came over to get our drink orders and they were actually brought out, I was starving.  We decided to split the queso dip with chili.  This was delicious!  If it wasn't frowned upon, I would have licked the bowl.  A different server even brought us extra chips!  Nice touch!   For the entree we split the Chicken Philly Texas Style.  Texas style means they add jalapeÃ±os and queso.  Can't go wrong with that!  We waited quite a while for our sandwich to arrive but I was pleased with the flavor when I bit into it.  There was a great amount of chicken, peppers, jalapeÃ±os and cheese to fill my half of the sandwich.  The fries were ok but nothing to write home about.  I would suggest saving the queso dip to have something to dip the fries in.    I think we saw our original waitress twice during our visit...  once for our drinks and once for the bill.   The restaurant manager even refilled our drinks once.  For not being overly busy, there wasn't any excuse for poor service."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place...we ordered a few appetizers and destroyed them (wings are comparable but a little better than Buffalo Wild Wings). And yes the girls are scantily clad as some other reviews may state HOWEVER the ladies still remain beautiful, classy and tasteful! (Men, keep your hands to yourself and simply enjoy the view....it's not a strip club; ) Portions of the main entrees are not too large so I'm glad that we had appetizers + main meal. No room for desert, so no feedback on that one...I don't believe we even were offered. The rock climbing wall is cool and staff regulates patrons to prevent ones too drunk from climbing. We saw one of the sexy waitresses shimmy up the wall as if it were a walk in the park. Vegas has two locations...we are going to check out the other one in Henderson next.."}
{"text":"My ex and I decided to give this place a try as he had been told by a customer where he works that the food was good.     Its a sports bar which for me is OK.    I just would have been more comfortable if it was not but like I said, we didnt know what we were getting into till we got there.      The waitresses all wore very skimpy outfits.   Underwear and a bikini top basically.   I suppose for men who are there to watch sports, drink beer and stare at pretty girls its a great place.     Was a tad bit uncomfortable but that says nothing about the restaurant.   The food and servce was excellent!  Sienna was our server and she was very friendly and I asked her for a bloody mary without vodka as I cannot drink and she was like-sure, no problem.   I ordered fish and chips which were perfect and my ex got the grilled turkey sandwich which he really liked.  The Die made him try chicken fingers which were great and I had to try The Blonde Bean and Bacon soup which was very good!  The tv at the tables is an extra bonus again for those that like sports  :)      Not sure we would return though as comfort has to be a high priority and neither of us felt that comfortable there.     :/"}
{"text":"Samantha is a great server with great customer service!!! She accommodated what I needed before I asked.  Great food great service!"}
{"text":"Great location!  Amazing views of the strip! Fun and a great atmosphere for watching all games!  Service and food was awesome!   The girls are so pretty and the manager, Kristen was so nice! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I walked in with my son last night to get a few drinks. We were warmly greeted, and quickly found a place to sit. Unfortunately that was the highlight. It was moderately crowded but not packed. As we sat there five different servers walked by without managing even eye contact. We waited 10 minutes before leaving. As we were walking out we noticed 3 waitresses sitting as ta booth in the back texting. If I owned this place O would fire the entire staff. Just horrible. And now with the Tlted Kilt closed I suppose they think they are the only game in town. Instead I would recommend heading downtown to Blonde In A Bottle."}
{"text":"Consistently good food brings us back to this place.  Would rate the pricing as $$-$$$, but portions are large so you do get your money's worth.  Lunch menu has choices like a half sandwich and soup option, so you don't have to spend a ton if you don't want to.  Our favorite appetizer is the double nachos (we do chicken), and it is plenty for even 5 of us to share.  Crisp chips and great toppings have caused several of us to order it as a meal in itself!  Burgers & sandwiches come to the table fresh and hot, with nice crisp shoestring fries.  Hubby's new favorite is the Grilled Ranch Chicken Sandwich.  Very generous sized chicken breast on a soft bun, with lots of bacon and chipotle mayo.    This is one of my favorite places for low carb eating.  Ask for that same Grilled Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich without a bun and it is no problem.  The Chicken Cobb salad is full of spring mix greens (which I wasn't sure I would like, but it is very good), cubed grilled chicken breast and plenty of real bacon pieces.  It comes with bleu cheese crumble and honey mustard dressing, but I hold the crumbles and ask for ranch dressing.  If you don't have a problem with the slightly skimpy outfits ( we did see a grandma drag a grandpa out once she say the waitresses!), do give it a try."}
{"text":"4 stars for the name alone.  I went here with my oldest cousin ~40 and my youngest brother, 16.  We bonded."}
{"text":"Excellent delicious food with amazing staff. Kaely is the best waitress ever. Must ask for her. She goes over and beyond to make sure you have an awesome service."}
{"text":"This a good bar it has great drinks the girls are awesome !! Managers check on you and even bust tables !!! Music is kicking !!!! The margarita is great ! Also the manager racist and I'm black and the treatment is one sided I love the food and majority of the staff"}
{"text":"We came here for my bachelorette get/together on a Thursday night in March. We were so impressed that we received such great service and have never had a friendlier server. She was so very cute and on top of her tables. Our server was Cheyenne. She was always checking on us, and asking how things were I really appreciate the extensiveness of her service, she was so personable. As for her outward appearance, she's a 20/10."}
{"text":"My brother made me come here because he didn't want to eat where I wanted to. I had never been so I said okay. The only good thing here is the girls look good and their outfits are cute. The food is not something I'll be going back for and just like at hooters the waitresses aren't that attentive. The one thing I did love was that they had a family bathroom, I thought that was a nice touch especially since most of their customers seemed to be male and they sometimes need to change diapers too."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Yeah the girls are good looking, but if you have a party of 6 and the tip is guaranteed, you can be sure that no one will follow-up to ensure you're enjoying your food or you need anything else.... They won't even ensure that you received everything you ordered. Betty was our server and her level of service was way below par.  Never coming back to this place again... Oh and the food is edible by the way."}
{"text":"People. If you rate this place poorly because the girls weren't hired for their brains you don't belong here. It's called Twin Peaks, what on earth do you expect? They are hired for their willingness to wear the little tiny uniform and for their ability to deal with men ogling them and make inappropriate, awkward comments.  Girls are nice and most are pretty. They have tons of tvs, very cold beer, and the food is decent. End of story."}
{"text":"Typical atmosphere for this kind of place. Service is a bit slow, usually bar type food. The best part is that there are lots of TVs to watch the game and Ice Cold Beer!"}
{"text":"Standard Twin Peaks, nice girls, good food, and cold beer. I had the burger which was nice and juicy, and a man size mug of cold brew."}
{"text":"I've been back 5x since coming here since this review.  I can't say anything bad about this place.  The girls are friendly, on top of their game, and make the dining experience very pleasant.  Very interactive and make you feel very welcomed.   I asked them to turn on a game on one of the tv's closest to my table.  No problem at all!  I ask them for a condiment or extra of something.  No problem at all.  The half off apps and beer is just an amazing deal.  I tip extra for their service.  Highly recommended!   GO!  Thank me later!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been coming here about once a month and I have warmed to the place more.  There are some very nice girls working here (not all but some - look for Lexi, Logan, Emily in particular (or Holly for  a treat for the eyes).    We have found some food we enjoy.  My friend always get the Rib Eye potroast and the bites I have had were quite good.    the chips are queso are a great app, don't bother with the add-ons.  The quesadilla app makes a great follow-up main course.  The mini tacos are decent.  The burgers are consistently good.    The nachos are HUGE and addictive especially with some of the queso sauce.  I don't particularly like the BBQ sauce on it but it didn't keep me from stuffing myself.  The customers can be on the douchy side some times but we keep coming back.  Tip: Buy a calendar and get some great coupons each month.  We have been here at least a dozens times (Saturday lunch time) and have never had \"horrible\" service.  Sometimes it is better than others but we always get taken care of, and this isn't a bad place to have to wait a few extra minutes for something."}
{"text":"Twin peaks is a nice restaurant for its ambiance, service and unique business model. They have beautiful girls as servers and bartenders that ACT like they care about you and your feelings, but all things considering it's like a strip club with food and no nudity. Clever business model but they have to pay these girls more since they could practically be strippers but decided a more ethical way. Anyways those extra prices trickel down to us consumers so you'll need to ask yourself weather it's worth it to yourself but it's a really nice place with good attitudes. Hard to beat that except for the $$$."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch. She works across the street and informed me this was the 1st week this establishment was open.   The interior is very nice, new, sorta has that \"Flagstaff\" feel to it. We walked in during noon-ish so it was busy. I immediately notice that the staff are all women, hot women. Unfortunately they aren't the brightest. Example....the hostess checked her seating chart and asked us if we would like a booth, we both said yes and then another waitress arrived along side her and they both commenced to bickering about sitting another party at that booth.  We both let them continue for a few minutes because it was amusing seeing this then we finally chimed in and said the bar will be fine. lol  We sat at the bar and I started to look around. I noticed, and so did my female friend, there were hardly any women customers in this place. hahah I counted maybe 3 including my friend.  Okay so if you weren't aware and I wasn't either the servers all wear skimpy outfits, very similar to titled kilt's.  This location is located in the heart of the \"corporate business park area\". So literally 90% of the patrons were middle aged men, in business casual to corporate suites, probably 70% or more married and come here to look at the women, I always wonder why that does it for most men, I mean why not just go to a strip club at least there I know and expect what kinda service, vibe I'm going to get, plus the beers are cheaper and you get a better view if you know what I mean, but I digress.   So hardly any women customers, we both ordered a drink from the bartender, she came back with my IPA beer overflowing, probably the most horrible pour ever but I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Oh she asked me if I'd like \"the girl size beer, or the man sized beer\". I'm not sure if that's company policy or she was trying to be cute. I mean I wasn't offended but it felt like an awkward question to ask, I went with the girl one, I admit.   We both ordered food, I had the ranch grilled chicken sandwich, with fries. The bartender seemed very ditsy and clueless but she managed to get our orders correct.   The sandwich was okay, at first a little bland but once I got to the middle it was actually tasty.   We paid and left. I'm not sure I'll make an attempt to come back.   I have a feeling after a few weeks, months the hot waitresses will probably quit and they will have to hire better customer service, more competent women to fill those server spots. I sorta got the feeling that when hiring they just put out adds for hot girls in their early 20's and if they were hot enough, they were hired, no matter of their skills......that will only last for so long, it's a restaurant, not a strip club."}
{"text":"The third floor bar where we sat was great. Plenty of screens for the games and a view of the strip. Eve was our bartender and was exceptional.  Happy hour 3 to 6 I think gets you most of the apps at half price and a big reduction in the cost of the girl size beers. Yes as some have mentioned the food is not gourmet, uh it is a sports bar and with that in mind we found it darn good and the beer is ice cold. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"They were very accommodating to my family, got us set up in front of all the big screens to watch the USA play Germany in the World Cup. We were all surprised how good the burgers were and you can't find a colder beer in Vegas."}
{"text":"VERY unimpressed with Twin Peaks #twinpeaks restaurant!! Tried to go watch UFC tonight and agreed to their $10 shakedown only to find out that didn't include a seat, table or anything else! RIDICULOUS!!"}
{"text":"So I will say this about the place.. The women, the women, the women are ok.. The food is ok. The atmosphere, OK.. I chilled here and it was ok.. So to sum it all up, I'd say that this place is OK.."}
{"text":"Let me just say I love this sports bar. Very clean. Nice seating. Beautiful girls. Food is just as good. Try the cheese bits and Fish and chips. Lastly my server is also one of a kind. Haley was beyond proficient. She has exceeded my expectations of the typical sports bar server. Got my food back to me quickly. Beer was always cold. And constantly check on me and my party. I will definitely be back thank to the customer service. See you guys soon !"}
{"text":"This place is great!  At first I was pretty surprised at the overall rating, but after reading the reviews, I understand. I think most of the negative reviews are from people who say \"I get the concept but...\" and actually DON'T get the concept. I've been here twice. Both times with a buddy to watch sports and have drinks while snacking on bar food. Mission accomplished. We weren't there to judge a beauty pageant or compare it to Hooters (although every girl is a 10!). We weren't expecting a 5 star Michelin meal. We weren't there to get their mixologist's latest handcrafted cocktail. I do think the beer selection and prices could be improved. I also don't like how cold the beer is served. Then again, to each their own. I work at a brewery, so I'm not looking for an ice cold Bud Light.  The bartender was happy to pour their Ballast Point IPA in a non-chilled glass for me though.   Management was more than appeasing. During my visit on Opening Day for baseball, my buddy and I wanted the TVs changed more often than I'm sure they liked, but they did that for us. Randy also charged my phone for me!    The service was great. I've been to plenty of bars and never have I gone expecting white tablecloth service or for my server/bartender to know how many years distilled their vodka is or from which farm their chicken was raised. What I didn't expect was for my server from my first visit to recognize me when she saw me the next time I came in. Kudos!  I do hope they add some more craft beers and get away from serving the beer so cold. Adding a happy hour would definitely bring me back (as well as other people in the industry) more often. I'd like to see them get the sports packages as well. Vegas is very diverse, so there are sports fans from all over who want to watch their hometown team.   I hope this place stays and does well!"}
{"text":"Great  place to watch any sports event. Staff is super friendly and accommodating! Food is served in large portions and beers are pretty  cheap! Nice place!"}
{"text":"Sydney was super awesome and friendly, typical bar food was good. Beer is served below freezing so is super awesome."}
{"text":"Right now there are 6 waitresses standing around.   We came here and it was apparently the change of shift. Our first waitress told us that she'd get us water and the gal coming on shift would take our order. 25 minutes later another gal approached us. Seriously? What a waste? We were just about to get up and walk out. After all this time the food came out lukewarm. I will never return here. Shame on my friends that hyped it up.   Let me add that we complained to the manager and he didn't do a damn thing. This is by far the WORST service that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love going to this place. Great burgers and decent service. Best place in town for an ice cold beer, literally so cold that it forms ice in the mug."}
{"text":"#1 Worst service ever! This place is worse then a damn MVD, McDonalds gives better service! Please think 3x before considering this place! Sitting at the bar is going to be your best bet! So unprofessional the waitresses just standing around not doing shit!   PS: you give good service you get tipped great just saying"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location to meet up with a friend and grab a bit to eat. The service that we received from Marisa was attentive and pleasant. We ordered the fried pickles, fish tacos and sliders. Everything was delicious. Would easily go back again!"}
{"text":"Went in for my birthday with a coupon for a free entree. Service was slow, negligent, and uncaring. Food was ok, not exceptional, but not bad either. Asked for the check and the waitress only took a very inexpensive thing off the tab, saying this was only good for sandwiches and they take off the cheapest thing. So I asked to see the coupon back, since I knew that it said otherwise. Then she brought it back, reluctantly, and tried to argue with me that she was right, despite it being clearly and obviously otherwise. Then the manager had to intercede, and he handled it, but not very nicely, very condescendingly and again completely uncaring. I come here at times, and it is just inconsistent - sometimes fine and sometimes not very good."}
{"text":"Good food cold beer. What more could you want. Check it out and the girls are so nice! They even have a patio outside with a fire pit for those cold nights!"}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch and I had the nachos which were absolutely fantastic. The best part of my meal today was the service. As much as I love with the food our server Shey was the best server that I have ever had at this restaurant. She was friendly she was helpful she gave suggestions for food and when she suggested the beans to come off of the nachos it made me like her even more because I do not eat beans. Not only was she a great server but she was very nice to talk to and look at. She also told us to come back for Black Friday and see her in black lingerie. I hope the owner of this company or her manager read this and give her a big bonus and makes her the girl of the month because she was fantastic. Thank you for being so good at your job"}
{"text":"I don't mind girls doing their job. It's the fact that when we walked in the host greeted my boyfriend and asked where he'd like to sit and didn't acknowledge me. Then was trying to talk to him while he was watching the game about the table and I was just like ummm like ok I'm here too, u can ask me he'd not even paying attention. Whatever, wasn't really tripping. Then when our server came over she also just said hi to him and asked if she could get him something to drink and it's like ok cool I'll take a water thanks. After forever and a half she comes back to take our order and asks if he'd like something to eat. Now by this point I'm like common courtesy u should probably ask his girl first or even look at her. Just super rude. I order a beer later and she comes back and drops it off to him and says here's ur Coors light like no u dumb broad I ordered it from u, like hello, stupid ain't a good look. Then another server comes by to ask if he's doing ok if he'd like a water, by this time I'm irritated like fall back. It's just super disrespectful. I don't mind gawking girls, just have enough respect to acknowledge his girl too so it's less obvious u trying to cross a line"}
{"text":"I come here fairly often especially during football season.   Today's experience was one I'm very familiar with. Over 15 minutes for a beer. Not to mention you have one tender on the well and one for the entire bar... seriously??  Not only did it take 15 minutes she didn't pour my beer while waiting for my other half to decide on continuing with a beer he asked to sample.   They get two stars because the food is decent, but even that takes a long time as well.   Not sure why they call their beer a dirty blonde when it's technically a wheat beer.   I need a new football bar."}
{"text":"So I am sure you would say having a Fantasy Football Draft at Twin Peaks in Las Vegas is a bit pedestrian, since you know, Twin Peaks are everywhere. Well, normally I would agree, but after 2 days of spending lots of money and walking all up and down the strip, we just needed half a day just to relax.   We walked into Twin Peaks around noon on a Sunday and it was pretty sparse as to be expected on a Sunday without football. That worked out great since our waitress sat us down in a booth, giving us ample room for our drinks (those bigass 32 oz. icy mugs) and get our draft going.   The food at Twin Peaks is as you would expect, pretty solid sports bar food (I went with the wings). Our Waitress Andrea was awesome, she had a great sense of humor and came back frequently to check on our drinks and any requests we had.   If you are like us and you just need a place to relax for a bit or are a bit turned off at all the other expensive options for hosting your fantasy football draft, just try out Twin Peaks. Sometimes familiarity can be a good thing."}
{"text":"I came here with guys from work for the, eh, scenery. The atmosphere was cool but the servers are not hired for their serving abilities. We waited around before anyone got to us. It took forever to get anything. I had a chicken sandwich that was really good and the queso dip was amazing (thank you to my Yelp! check in that got me that for free!) If you don't care about timeliness this is a great place to go if you are into that type of scenery."}
{"text":"This place is known for the girls. Much like Hooters or Tilted Kilt they market the girls to bring in the guys. I like the lumberjack outfits and let's be real, this is a great place for guys to enjoy a few beers/cocktails with a great view. The food is extremely average but no one is coming here for the food. A friend of mine was playing in a band here so we made a night of it. I may go back for the scenery and a beer but wouldn't go too far out of my way for it..."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment to women.  This is not a place families should be taking their children for dinner.  The wait staff are dressed like prostitutes and the male customers were salivating over them. I couldn't even enjoy the food.  Very disturbing.  The bad thing is I have visited other Twin Peaks which I had good experiences at. Not sure why the girls here feel the need to dress so inappropriate.  Sorry to say that was my first and last time going to the Twin Peaks in Winston Salem."}
{"text":"My experience was amazing, my waitress Cam gave me and my girls excellent service!!!! She was very outgoing and definitely kept us entertained!! she definitely gets 5 stars for her great attitude and bubbly spirit !"}
{"text":"Twin Peaks has become my go to place. They have decently priced drinks and good options for appetizers. Claire is an awesome waitress and always makes our visits to twin peaks fun. If you go to twin peaks ask for Claire !"}
{"text":"Great place for nearly frozen beer! Great cocktails to I recommend the Moscow mule! Food is good & portion are big. If your really hungry try the chicken fried Steak!! Enjoy!!  Palo"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple friends and got the nachos and French fries. They were both delicious and affordable. Louise was our server and we absolutely loved her! She treated us like we were all her friends and was very attentive to anything we needed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who was looking for a great sports bar. (:"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Twin Peaks twice juring our recent trip to Las Vegas. We absolutely loved this place! Mary and Kathiee took great care of us.  Drinks were cold and food was great. I highly recommend it. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food with reasonable price! Great chicken wings. Our server was nice. We had a great experience."}
{"text":"I just started going to this location recently. I've been to the location on the Las Vegas Strip (which features a rock climbing wall that the servers climb periodically. This location does not have that unfortunately). This restaurant is located in a developed shopping plaza that's always pretty busy. The plaza is populated with a DIVERSE array of restaurants and other services which is generally great for everyone. This restaurant is a stand alone building and one of the biggest independent buildings in the plaza (right off Eastern Ave., you can't miss it driving on the street). With that said, the restaurant is pretty big inside with a ton of tables and an outdoor patio with additional seating. My favorite part of this restaurant is the big bar located in the middle of the restaurant. It's very inviting and great for watching sports on one of their many high-definition TVs above the bar. It's one of the larger bars (seating wise) that I've sat at in the city. The staff is also great at serving drinks and conversing over the bar. Beer is really the drink of choice at Twin Peaks (I love their in-house Dirty Blonde). I love that they're served in tall ICEY COLD mugs. The beer on tap is also super frothy and icy which makes it all perfect for hot summer nights in Vegas! They also have a fully stocked back bar and food menu (which is pretty standard)."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at twin peaks and decided i should finally post something here. I come with coworkers on a weekly basis and enjoy phenominal service from Genesis and the other girls at the bar every time. The pot roast is a great hearty lunch and the billionaire's bacon is every man's dream for an appetizer. Definitely recommend coming here for lunches and the UFC fights!"}
{"text":"Twin peaks has really cold, good beer. That's about it. The food is nothing to be impressed about. I had the fish tacos and the burger on a couple of occasions. Nothing tasted fresh and everything is greasy. However if you want a cold beer for a fair price stop on in. Not a family establishment."}
{"text":"I can't give it anymore than 2 stars because I don't like these places that objectify women. If there had been male waiters with skin tight shorts so their balls are hanging out, then ok. At least it wouldn't have been totally sexist. I had the bean with bacon soup which was very tasty. I could taste the beer in it. I also had a turkey avocado sandwich which had plenty of meat and was also very good. The sweet potato fries were nice and crisp but a little too salty. Otherwise they would have been perfect. Our table was a bit dirty, some dried up wing sauce on the top and the plates they left on the table for sharing had a large hunk of sauce dried on it. Our server was very nice. The doors in the ladies bathroom stalls wouldn't latch. I just don't like that type of atmosphere having boobs in my face and I just kept thinking how I wouldn't want those disgusting pervs staring at me like that. I won't be back and neither will the people I was with."}
{"text":"Went on a night with some buddies. Asked the waitress to turn up the lights because it was so dark we could barely read our menu and she legit said \"we are trying to set the mood, don't ruin it\". Fuck me right???? I'm just a paying customer...beer was good, but at $10 a beer I only had two. Had their wings which were average. When asked about the lighting situation was told the district manager was present and said that's how he wanted it...needles to say I will NOT be back and will advise as many as people as possible to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Bartenders are pretty cool here. Love Kayli, Emily and Stacey.  Servers on the other hand are terrible.  Alyson had to be the worst.  Gorgeous girl with an ugly personality and terrible customer service skills.  Don't let your looks get the best of you."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports and the staff is always a good time,  I really do enjoy coming here but I have to get real for a minute,  the food is where they drop the ball.I love the bar and this must be the coldest beer in town, love that no doubt,  but again, not a fan of the food.You can survive off great wings alone and I found them to be average at best.Not trying to be a punk but a sports bar should have  better  bites, sorry.I go often but don't eat much, hope to see that change."}
{"text":"Came here to watch some playoff games for NHL and NBA. Plenty of screens and they were only showing the hockey games when I came but I requested if they could change some of the TVs to the NBA game and they were kind about it and changed the channel. Great service and they were very polite!  Pretty good value in terms of food. I ordered the pulled pork sliders and they were pretty delicious. Went well with the cold beer that I ordered and they were quick with refills too. The beer was nice and cold.  I usually sit in the bar area because I focus on the games and eat and also play a little on the machines. Pretty cool spot and has a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Worst customer experience ever! First of all, I get there at 12:09 pm, I order a big stella, at 12:24 pm a big Heineken comes, ok everybody makes a mistake. 12:39 pm stella comes, but the server gives it to the wrong table, they take it. I'm getting pissed! Then that tables two drinks gets to their table. My friend has to go in there to explain what happened, not that our waitress checks on us. It finally comes at 1:04 pm, 55 minutes to get a beer, not bad. I could've gone to bj's ordered a beer drank it and come back to my seat! Why bother? Instead of comping it, which is what I would've done, oh I'm sorry, but you're still paying the $6.50 for it. That is the last $6.50 twin peaks will ever get from me! Word of mouth guys! If long wait time for beers then twin peaks is the place for u! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and happy hour! Very friendly staff! The bee is nice and cold, the food was good!"}
{"text":"So slooooowwwww!  Took 40 minutes for two sandwiches.  We were told it was the turkey burger...which when it came out was so over cooked and the sweet potato fries were potato sticks.  We'll come back for drinks but not the food."}
{"text":"I was suitably impressed.  Service was solid (my personal feeling is that the server \"uniforms\" are a bit too skimpy for decency, but that's a plus for some).  My server's recommendation was the Philly Cheesesteak \"Texas\" style - queso cheese sauce and jalapenos - and it was hella good.  (It also burned all the way through my digestive tract well into the next day - my colon felt lightly braised afterward).  Fries were basically salt magnets - they were well cooked but dusted way too heavily with whatever fry salt mix they used.  Beer really is served at 29 degrees (they have a monitor over the bar dedicated to telling you the exact temperature of the kegs at any given moment.)  I really enjoyed the hand-twisted pretzel as an appetizer - it was better than Hofbrauhaus's version.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Big salads, good wings,cold drafts!! Nice change from buffalo wild wings or hooters , salads were to big to finish, and wings were nice and meaty, and some of the coldest drafts around"}
{"text":"Place was good, The ladies are fast and efficient  sad they anit have Hennessy but they made up for it . Sports channel is always on   Had a good time"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Atmosphere is awesome.   Food is 4 stars when it comes to bar food.  Secret Menu - Pulled Pork Sandwich is perfect.  All the girls are sweet.   TVs are everywhere.  Great for games and UFC events"}
{"text":"My server/bartender was Selma. Super sweet person! I ordered a salad and wings. After informing her of my gluten allergy, she warned me about cross contamination so I ordered smoked wings instead (which were pretty average/okay). The service was a little slow and there was only a dozen people in the entire restaurant, but I think it was my NY Super fast speed mentality kicking in."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a good experience here. Actually, better than I expected. We chose this destination to watch Super Bowl 50 and we sat on the patio. The ambiance was very nice, and the food was pretty good. The cocktails we a little weak, but it's OK, because it saved me from a bad hangover. ;-) I would come here again."}
{"text":"Best and coldest beer in town. Nice (and beautiful) staff. Food is decent. Tons of TV's. The management change they made a year or two ago really saved this place for me. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time ever at Twin Peaks, great food great atmosphere really enjoyed the service, Britney our waitress was awesome really enjoyed the dinner. All the way around two thumbs up..."}
{"text":"Hanging out at twin peaks for game 4 of play offs. Great cold beer and food! Shak and Hannah gave fantasic efficient service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here, the blackened haddoc tacos are awesome.  Angela was server.  Great time and great service."}
{"text":"Meme was great and very sweet. I will definitely be back. She really made us feel welcome and kept coming back to make sure everything was good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Twin Peaks. The service was questionable at the beginning but it got better. The food was awesome! I had the turkey avacado sandwich...Soooo good! The FREE chips and queso were great thanks to yelp!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent craft beer and casual entertainment on the strip, this is a decent place to check out. My group stopped in on a late Friday night and had a great time.   Food: it's basically the same as every sports bar. Nothing spectacular but not bad.   Service: had a great waitress and friendly staff all around. One of my friends insisted I climb the rock wall and have a waitress race me. Turns out they have a dedicated employee who kills the rock wall. She destroyed me. I didn't even make it up. I lost my bet to her and my friend.   Price: this is why they earn the 4th star. It's hard to find a decent place to eat on the strip without breaking the bank, eating junk, or taking forever.   Stop in. Check it out. It's a chain, but it's a fun time."}
{"text":"Awesome lunches and great atmosphere. Come here with co-workers often. The guys really love this place too."}
{"text":"The latest meal has lifted the Peaks to an A cup..aka 5 star review. The pot roast was exceptional. A large pile of tender meat (no fat) was next to a nice seasoned scoop of garlic mashed potatoes and a green bean with bacon side dish also was quite tasty. It does seem worth $15, but luckily this was a birthday meal and you get to choose almost any entree for free. The birthday photo was also a nice surprise and trust me it's way better than some off tone teenagers singing you a song."}
{"text":"Nicoley and Selena were awesome! Will be back because of them! Come here every year and never disappointed"}
{"text":"I had been here only once with my mom, the service was really bad and the drinks were bad we didn't get to order food because our server came around once every few hours. Although she was nice she was very inattentive and we ended up getting the check after one drink."}
{"text":"I have been going to Twin Peaks on Las Vegas Blvd once a week for 3-4 years now. The quality of the staff has been on steady decline for the last six months now. But when you sit at the bar and have an empty glass in front of you for 15 minutes without any response. It has hit an all-time low.  Maybe the management needs to hire better quality staff that will engage customers, like it used to be.  Cody thank you for the lack of service today, this now gives me good reason to try other establishments.  #poormanagement #twinpeakslasvegas"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet since I'm currently eating here. A more more elaborate review will be written later.   This is by far the best restaurant experience I've ever had, bar none. The waitresses are beautiful, the management is awesome and the food is absolutely incredible! It's a model of what every restaurant should be."}
{"text":"First I will say, the restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL inside. I love the open space, and furniture. Aside from that, our service was horrible. I work in the service industry, and it's easy for me to distinguish wether a server may be having a bad day or just doesn't care about their job. There were 5 servers on the floor with maybe three tables in the whole place. It took almost 15 minutes to be greeted by ANYONE. Where I work, if we see another server caught up or in the weeds, we help out and at least get drinks started. We were greeted as if we were an inconvenience. By the time she came we knew our complete order. Mean while all the servers huddled at the hostess station and we had to almost beg for refills. Either way the service ruined our experience. We tipped appropriately out of respect for the job but I doubt she cared if we left anything at all.."}
{"text":"I have to say that if you sit at a table you will be waiting for a long time just to be recognized let alone get a beer. I sat at a table for 10 mins and watched two waitresses talk to one customer then they both walked right by me without even acknowledging me. Bar service is a much better way to go."}
{"text":"I like coming to Twin Peaks because the service is always great, and their food is surprisingly good. I say \"surprisingly good\" because I expected chain restaurant taste, but they pull off that great comfort food flavor by cooking everything in house as our awesome waitress explained.   They also had some good drink specials, and the quesadillas were on point--super, mouth wateringly delicious!   Come from 3-6 for $2 off apps and beer. Good stuff all around!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give it more than 3 stars but...  We ended up going to Twin Peaks twice in our recent stay in Las Vegas (the first to watch the Tigers and have a few beers before we went to play in a poker tournament, I came in 2nd in that one :) the second at the end of a late night).    I've described the bar to a friend as \"Hooters except Awesome\".    The positives:  The bar has a number of TV screens on each side of the bar that you should be able to catch a game that interests you (in addition one screen plays an internal channel that shows various funny \"catch on tape\" incidents as well as various profiles of attractive Twin Peaks girls in-between).  The beer is advertised as coming out below freezing (with a nice little electronic sign showing the temperature that the beer is coming out at) which worked well.  Considering that the attraction is pretty much T&A I have to say that the bartenders we had each night were very, very good with the customer service.  In addition, craft beer fans, the company apparently makes at least 2 of its own beers, which are choices (\"The Dirty Blonde\" which is like a Summer or Hefe, and the \"Naughty Brunette\" which is a darker beer, I liked the darker better).  Also, its kind of neat but they do have rock climbing walls on one side of the bar and you can have Twin Peaks girls cheering you on as you climb (no, I've never climbed them, still thought it worth mentioning)  The negatives:  $10 a beer?  Serious sticker shock.  I can't tell you about the food as we used this as a sports bar to watch the Tigers and have a good time at either the beginning or the end of the night.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I apparently can't rate it 3.5 and its a better time than 3 stars.  Would I go again?  Yeah, because this is a pretty good place to watch sports in Las Vegas and this was actually the second best time I had as a nightspot on my vacation.  This place is located on the recent upper level construction that is on the side of Planet Hollywood with the Evening Call, Bubba Gump Shrimp, Eli Roth's haunted house along with others and is not (as far as I know) accessible from inside the Casino itself.  I thought I'd add that as many reviews are not super specific on its location."}
{"text":"Amazing wait staff, drinks on point, great rapport building skills. Great atmosphere and customer service. Smiles all around."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Cherina and Shane behind the bar. Beers were ice cold and the food was tasty. Always  love stopping in when I'm in Scottsdale. Have been here 3 times in the last week....lol"}
{"text":"Another great MLB playoff game, made even better by the great service from my favorite new server, Ashley C.--the tall strawberry blonde. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch on Wednesday, the place was packed, but we were immediately seated, and then greeted by Lauren, our waitress. She listened well, got the orders exactly right, and kept in close contact for any refills.  We will be back!  Upbeat atmosphere, good service, a range of food choices, and great customer service."}
{"text":"If the service here was as good as the servers looked, would be talking a different story. At the bar by the entrance, the bartender there like whoa: poster model of what Twins Peaks should represent. When we were taken to the second floor of the restaurant, there were a number of waitresses walking around, nothing like the one by entrance though. After we were taken to our table, nothing but tumbleweeds. 20+ minutes no one came to tend to our table so we left. What was the tipping point was after 15-20 minutes, a group of two sat at the table next to us and were served immediately. Never in my time dining have I waited over 20 minutes and not even been tended to. Unacceptable and bye Felecia"}
{"text":"Ok so it's a great location on strip, patio outside has good view, hot girls, and beautiful inside cabiny feel. So for you boys it's a nice drinking spot. But I had the chicken fried chicken and I could barely find the chicken just a lot of breading, Tacos blah , drinks good. But I won't go back to eat there. But a drink on the patio for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and the beer get a 3... The idea of being served by a beauty pagent is not my thing, the over the top \"yay! When I ordered fried pickles was my last straw.  If you're the type of dude that likes boob bars, this is your joint, if you're the type of dude that feels annoyed because you have to spend more time with the server than your friends, don't go here"}
{"text":"Your experience here can be dynamite or ice cold.  I've had great waitresses who are fun, engaging, and focused on service and I've been there, sitting for literally 10 minutes waiting for service. When it's happy hour the drinks are a great deal and the food is usually pretty solid most of the time.  Best feature is all the TVs for sports and that you don't have to listen to commercials - music clicks in - which is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!!! I've been coming here, almost every day for about 3 months. . . and I'm addicted. When I walk in the girls call me by name, know what I drink and treat me like we're old friends. The food is incredible and the beer is served below freezing. All the while the waitresses and bartenders are walking around in skimpy shorts and low cut tops. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh. So meh. It's like Hooters in a cabin in the woods. There's animal heads and bear skins adorning the walls. The waitresses wear itty bitty flannel shirts, booty denim shorts, and boots. There's a bar in the center of the restaurant (no gaming), tables and booths around the bar, and an outdoor patio area. There's lots of TVs around the bar. The servers are friendly and attentive when it's slow. When it's busier, you have to flag them down and it'll take many, many tries to get their attention. The beers come in girly and manly sizes. I ordered the manly just on principle. The beer list and beers are total meh. The appetizers we had were quite meh. Barely edible. So yeah, I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Phoenix Town Country Location. Great place see sports, good food, Best server's in State.  This great place with vast array TV's & good sounds system.   Laken is best server I have ever had at any establishment!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer and chicken strips. The Henderson location has a way better happy hour, a man size beer for $3.50!! Opposed to the Las Vegas location, the girl size beer for the same price. The bartenders are awesome here, my favorites are Nicoley and Ashley, super humble and take great care of"}
{"text":"We came here on a fight night, great deal on that $5 bucks for UFC and you get $5 off coupon for next time(so almost a wash). The place was packed heading into the fight with college football and MLB playoffs, even with the traffic our server was always attentive and checking to see how we we're doing. Dishes did pile up a little but totally understandable. The food was solid and came out fast, only thing negative is its somewhat limited menu (a page for drinks & a page for food). Overall it's a fun place with good food, atmosphere and scenery."}
{"text":"My first time here was so much fun!! I went with a group of friends and Daf was our waitress. She was amazing! She was very professional and attentive but was so funny which we loved. I didn't know what to expect when going in but I'm glad we did, I enjoyed a michelada and some wings. Food & drinks were made well and i'm glad our waitress made it a lot more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to stare at your \"twin peaks\" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend, had a great time! Then cheese bites were amazing and nachos we're even better. Also the gigantic sized beer was pretty awesome for my hubby. Bartenders Nicole and Ashley were so nice. Enjoyed our visit and meeting new people. Food prices were fair and same for alcohol. Clean and very nice staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"For those looking for a bar out near the Parlor in Biltmore - then Twin Peaks is an option.  Went there after eating dinner at the Parlor - it was pretty empty at around 10pm on a Friday night - not sure why.  Service was good as we only ordered drinks.  I've been to Twin Peaks in Dallas during a peak time and the experience was great - similar to my experience with Tilted Kilt.  Not exactly the same with this experience but willing to give it a second chance in the future."}
{"text":"Decided to hit this place up for UFC night. It was a good choice and I would go there again. They had a $5 cover and a drink minimum but why not spend if you're at a sports bar. They theme here is very simple:  beer and breasts and yes there's lots of it to go around.  Pros:  1.  Good beer in good amounts. You don't get a simple little mug for your brew, you get a big, manly mug!   2.  This place must have been inspired by The Man Show. The theme is simple, a sports bar with some serious hotties helping you out. I would definitely say they have the best looking staff out of any \"breastaurant\" I've visited.  3.  I ordered a poblano chicken sandwich. I would say it was pretty good, lot's of bun (no pun intended, or maybe?), and seasoned fries. It was a good filler for my night of fight watching.  4.  The staff is definitely friendly but when you're a girl working for tips from a mostly male clientele it's part of the job. Still did their job very well.  Cons:  1.  Parking was very well advertised so I ended up parking in a far-away spot. Just learn the area first.  2.  Major sporting events might charge a cover but it was cheap. Get there early as well or you'll be stuck standing around. Luckily I'm intrepid enough to ask to share a table with people.  Overall it's a good place to be a man, do manly things, and feel like a man when leaving. Not sure what that actually means but it works for me."}
{"text":"Came this evening with a party of 21, place was pretty dead, and it was kinda late. Food was fair. We had Mac n cheese which was smoked, quite dry as the steak was that we ordered.   The rest of the party ordered a variety of food items, which were a step above McDonalds. The waitresses were so so slow at bringing drinks, food and the checks. I never did get a water. Terrible, terrible customer service  The ladies were too worried about chatting it up with the single men at the bar area, then servicing our party. 2 waitresses and had to physically go get someone to help us. Very disappointed with this establishment.Waitresses acted like this was a strip club versus a place where all ages can go with or without families. Only place open late after graduation.. None of my party of people will be returning ever again ."}
{"text":"Visited this location for my daughters birthday, with a party of 9. Great food and location ! The servers were attentive, sweet and interacted with the entire party. Loads of fun, We will be back at this location!"}
{"text":"I've been toTwin Peaks on numerous occasions and it's one of the best sports bars in the  valley. The beer is cold, wings are decent, and tvs all over. If you're looking for a place to watch a sporting event, Twin Peaks is your spot."}
{"text":"1. Greeted right away when we walked into the restaurant.    2. Ordered cheese sticks or tots rather and a glass of white wine.  Good.   3. Country fried chicken, mashed potatoes with sautÃ©ed veggies were very good.  Fresh and delicious.  Gravy made it even better.  High recommended.   4. Cheese Burger with two patties. It was 7 of 10...same quality as the five guys.  Fried were okay. Only had one.  Not a fan of their fries.   5. Waitress was very nice.  Good service overall.    Would I come back? Yes. Prices is same as the ale house next door.  I loved the decor and big TVs."}
{"text":"Eh, I was really disappointed in this place. Probably because I didn't know what I was walking into when I just wanted a bite to eat pretty late on a Sunday. I was really excited for this place based on the name because I was   juvenily thinking of the television show. Anyways didn't expect half dressed waitresses and ogling men to be the first thing that greeted me at the hostess table.    We walked in to that and the men didn't move out of the way and let us talk to the hostess to be seated, we had to talk around them. We were then seated and our waitress came over. We checked in on Yelp and got a free chip and queso which was cool, so we ordered that, a Moscow mule, and a beer. The drinks came and the mule was extremely watered down, if you're headed here I'd suggest beer over a mixed drink, and we ordered food. I got the chicken ranch and my boyfriend got the tacos. During this talk with the waitress we realized she almost seemed drunk, when we asked between the burger and the tacos which was best she compared how long they took to cook as means of deciding which to order. she then left and put our orders in and stopped by our table multiple times asking the same question and told us she'd bring us water two times before she actually brought it. It was odd to say the least.   Finally we got our meals and I was pleasantly surprised because my sandwich was really good and the french fries, while few on the plate, had an awesome seasoning on them that made them a bit spicy!    I think maybe we just had an odd/off day experience but we probably won't be back anytime soon.   Soon after my first experience here the manager Colby contacted me and I feel a lot better about this place! Honestly if you know what you're signing up for the food is pretty good and they really do try to take the best care of you as a customer as they can."}
{"text":"Fried pickles I would've never tried this but I did and they were delicious believe it or not ,The service was excellent"}
{"text":"Such an amazing Happy Hour!! $6 huge drafts..super cold and delicious! Service was great. They were always ready to refill and that I appreciated greatly"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Great happy hour. Lots of beers on tap. Servers are very friendly. Lots of tvs too!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and a ton of fun! The food was delicious and plentiful! We would visit often if we lived here."}
{"text":"Service was on point. I had smoked wings with buffalo sauce and fries. Food was good, smoked wings were excellent, (I smoke me own wings and these are better than mine). Price was good and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"We stopped by to watch a couple of NBA finals games and I love the atmosphere. I love how crowded it was, love how cold they serve their beer just really enjoyed the vibe. But other than that, the food was ok -- typical bar food, nothing special. Definitely a good place to watch games but other than that I probably wouldn't stop by here on an ordinary day."}
{"text":"Just off the plane and starving not expecting much. At first though the skimpy outfits were gimicky but was waitress was a blast. She convinced my wife to go rock climbing up the restaurant after ordering food which was surprisingly fun! Good beer selection and the food turned out excellent.  The price wasn't bad and the view of the strip was perfectly scenic. I got the fish tacos grilled (choice of fried, grilled, or blackened) and it tasted very light and fresh. Wife got the burger and it tasted great as well with good crispy fried.  Ultimately still very chain-like and basic options for food but I really had a good time and pleasant experience here. Recommend going if your looking for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Rolled in here the other day, with my Scottish homie.    Our server was a lovely blonde twin (forgot her name), who provided great service with a bit of NY'er edginess which I miss and absolutely adore.  Food was excellent (I had the chicken cobb and homie had a burger).  Beer selection would have been 5 stars, except they were out of stout and the Guinness in a can option was average at best.  Every brewery should have a stout option at all times, in my opinion.  Other than that, we had a nice time enjoying the bevvies, scran and eye candy.   Good times."}
{"text":"I have been at Twin Peaks couple times and one server remembered me and asked exactly I always order(Dose Equis).  The service is amazing.  Every employees are friendly.  Very casual and always have great times with friends."}
{"text":"Went to Twins Peaks with a couple friends. This was my first time. I order 12 piece wings with fries. I like the selection of flavors for their wings. I order half Nashville Hot and Lemon Pepper. They were great. The fries were crispy and flavorful. I also ordered the dirty blonde beer. It was really good. Our waitress was a bonus. She was really nice and helped me make my selections of food and drinks. I will be returning for more wings and beer."}
{"text":"Great place to eat descent food, drink super ice cold beers and look at smokin hot women wearing small, tight outfits!   I am usually here for lunch with co-workers during the day or with the club on the first Tuesdays of the month for \"Bike night\". The staff is always accommodating and super friendly.    My two favorite meals here are the chicken fried chicken or the pot roast, they are both a must try!   I suggest getting on the mailing list, they send you a free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"A hard place to find My wife and I set the gps to find the restaurant on customer appreciation night for dinner. Most of the places are easily seen from the street. We pulled into the shopping center, and still hard to find as it is tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center, by a hotel, with most of the sign lights out - \"eaks\" is all that was lit. we parked, and started to walk over, and then noticed the lower signs \"parking and door on the other side\". The patio which was dark, and on the back side of the restaurant is what is visible when we drove up. We went around to the front door, and no lights at that door either. It turned out to be a very slow night for the location, on customer appreciation night, as the hostess was already sent home for the night, and only 4 waitresses at the time. We waited at the desk a moment till a waitress noticed us standing there looking around for someone. She ended up being our waitress. Towards the end of meal, she was cut for the night also. She bought the check over for us to pay before she could go home. The bartender, and other waitresses had time to visit with customers. No promotions on the social media for this location, and hidden away in a dark corner of the shopping center. This might explain a very slow dead night at that this location on a night that should have been busy. This is the only location that we have seen that wasn't busy when we arrived, or while we were there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on the lack of servers during a weekend lunch. Food was good, but we will not go back if this management problem is not fixed. After all, we really did not come to \"twin peaks\" to see other men. By the way we are in Las Vegas...... really?"}
{"text":"Meh, is the best I can do for this place. I've been here a handful of times & each time I leave wanting."}
{"text":"Would be tacky anywhere else but Vegas, but there it fits right in. Perfect for lunch with your friends the day after a night on the town!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday (early afternoon) we were seated right away. We ordered a $6 mimosa and mozzarella cheese bites as an appetizer. The bites were delicious. I then ordered the haddock tacos, personally I don't like flour tortillas so I didn't enjoy them as much. But not bad. The waitress was very nice and checked up on us every 5-7 minutes"}
{"text":"Yes the beer is always cold... the blonde is my favorite beer! Turkey smash is by far my favorite sandwich. And the manager Angel is incredible. She always remembers us and stops by to say hello. The food here is great. The service is great most of the time. Only had one visit during football when the service was so-so. And another waitress came by and grabbed us drinks to make up for the slow service. They always have on lots of sports or they are willing to change one of the TV'S to put Chicago sports on for us. Really fun and always a good time."}
{"text":"Horrible time and will not return more than likely.   The menu seems to be just thrown together, like typical bar food with some random other specialty dishes here and there. However, when I was in I was told they re-did their wing's sauces, which turned out to be okay. That is probably the only thing worth buying there, the wings but it is still pricey for the price you can get wings typically.  I was charged for extra ranch when I didn't even ask for extra ranch. The food came with two cups so I thought it was the norm and since most places provide you with two servings when you order wings. I was also charged for getting their wings smoked instead of traditional fried. No one informed me of that extra charge also when I was putting my order in. Not that the extra charge mattered but its nice to be informed. Any good waitress would inform their customers of the charge as courtesy. You know, some people are on a budget but they have spare change at times!! Also when my food arrived one of my dishes came out cold!!   The girls there are pretty, but who isn't these days? First of all, the girls here need to understand, you are at work. I am not coming to look at you. I am coming to eat so PLEASE DO YOU JOB!!! IT IS CALLED COMMON CUSTOMER SERVICE. YOU SHOULD BE NICE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS . THEY ARE WHAT MAKES YOUR BUSINESS! I understand that I am a girl, so I may not tip you as well since I don't care about how much of your ass and boob is hanging out like Jake on the other side, but please I am still paying for food that translates to what pays your company to give you a paycheck. Yes, I get that the environment is suppose to have the girls dress like that and that is the appeal of this place but still it doesn't mean women can not eat here nor should be not be served with the same courtesy. We are all paying customers! Also if the girls being half naked bothered me, I would not have came. It didn't, so I AM BOTHRED WITH THE FACT THAT THOSE GIRLS DIDNT THINK I WOULD TIP AS WELL AS OTHERS!  With that being said the day I was there, the TWO not one but TWO hostess were there to look cute! Excuse me, but you are there to work and your cuteness does not matter to me even if I was a talent/model agent. If you can't do your current job duties, then why would I even want to look at you for my agency?!?! Also they had their phones out - so UNPROFESSIONAL! I AM SO TIRED OF THIS GENERATION AND THEIR CONSTANT NEED TO BE ON THEIR PHONE ALL THE TIME. One of the girls even had the nerve to take a Snapchat of the crowd. YES, it included me!! Again, the constant need to be on their phone and updates on social media.    Also while social media was trending with our hostesses, there were tables that needed to be busted and a few clean tables that should have been occupied already. When I was given a table, after a few customers had brought to the attention of hostess of the empty tables, she proceeded to seat me at a table. She was aggravated of course because the whole crowd was aggravated for the false wait time they had presented us all and so she slammed my menus on the table and rolled her eyes while she told me my waitress would be with me shortly. It ook about 10 minutes before I was able to grab a waitress to address my table. YES I WENT TO GRAB ONE SO THAT I COULD GET ATTENTION TO MY TABLE!!  The waitress I grabbed also happened to be the one who had our section. She proceeded to tell me she thought my table was already being helped due to the fact we had A drink present. A drink for a table of FOUR?!!? REALLY?? Oh so the other three people are there to look cute too? Hello!!??? With the business and wait time to get a table you don't think your customers would have stepped to get a drink while they waited to be seated? Even then, we clearly were in your section and we still had menus in your faces!!!! Would you not think to check on your section anyways??!?! COURTESY!!!   I did bring this to management's attention and about my dissatisfaction with the rudeness of the hostesses and service. I was unhappy with the service and environment so more than likely I will not return.      I did notice the level of comfort and niceness that was presented to some customers. I assume they were regulars to the waitresses based how formal they interacted. So if you are a regular then it must be nice to be pamper and treated with undivided attention because I saw many waitresses addressing a few tables that of course was not in their section but they went out of their way multiple times to check on them. So I can't have ONE waitress to check on my table, but 4 can check on this guy's table within the 10  minutes of me waiting?? If the waitresses are allowed to check one another's sections and multiple tables to extend their customer service, that's fine but I didn't see it happen to all the other tables only a 'special' few. BUT STILL it took me HAVING TO GRAB A WAITRESS  to address mine.    SO as a regular you are good to go."}
{"text":"Good food. Good view of the strip. Water was terrible. It tasted like they didn't clean the cup. Also, they had some girls who looked anorexic so it was uncomfortable environment"}
{"text":"Cold beer, decent food, friendly service (usually).  Great TVs for sporting events. Individual seating, the bar and the rail seating all have good views of the TVs.  Good for football Sunday s."}
{"text":"Pulled pork nachos were wonderful.  Atmosphere is great for watching the game and the customer service is unbeliveable."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about going here to eat you better wait a few months. We ate there yesterday and everything was a mess. Ordered a Leinenkugel summer shanty, and received a Samuel Adams. Ordered a simple cheese burger with no mayo or tomatoes and I guess they decided to remove the onions and mustard also. Also forgot the ketchup. No pen to sign the bill. All and all they need better management. To many employees standing around. Wait a few months before going is you best bet."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this bar and like it a lot! Their beer is good and the happy hour prices are awesome. They have lots of tv's and big tables for large groups. Our food was good. Loved the bacon jam sliders. Megan our server was perfect! Cute, friendly and took care of us really well. We will be back."}
{"text":"your typical breastaurant. Many TVs. No pool table. There is a fire pit on the patio."}
{"text":"Do you like boobs? Do you like meh food? Do you like to drink?   Then you will like Twin Peaks.    The only good thing about this place was the view of the strip.   Pretty mediocre. Like Hooters."}
{"text":"On business travel and TP recommended by hotel staff. Went on a Thurs night for dinner alone at bar and place packed with bikers, yuppie bikers, UFC misfits, and 25-30 yr hat backward wearing tight \"Affection\" shirt guys. Ok, I will give it try. Sat at bar and took 15 mins to order a beer and menu. Waited over 20 mins for server to follow up with me or even take my order. Had enough of bad service bars with 22 yr gals dressed in slutty outfits to know that nothing (food) good is going to happend out of this experiment. Paid for beer and gone. This place seems to be more focused on their sexy waitresses' than service. BTW, not very bright gals working here. Nice clean place, but a mix of Road House, Porky's, and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times over the last year and it is the same thing every time.  The food is good, but the service is not so good.  Cute girls with no sense of urgency.  Don't show up for lunch and expect to be back to work on time."}
{"text":"Came in tonight to watch the UFC pay-per-view  and had a fun night. The food was okay but the service was awesome. Lots of tv's and plenty of space at the bar tonight. Bathrooms were super clean and had a tv, which was great to not miss a moment. I think we will return for my pay-per-view nights. The half naked girls don't hurt... thank you Valentine's Day! (sidenote this place is a little dated- but good enough for fight nights) I appreciated how much the bartenders cared about the service and experience. Way more attention to detail than most bars"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant once before and it seemed like a good vibe type of place. The second time going was very awkward I guess I could say. Me and my boyfriend waited to be seated, whomever was suppose to be the host wasn't there. A lady finally comes but she had a real awful vibe like if she didn't want to work. She asked if we wanted a table or booth and we stated table. She walks away from us saying nothing else. Comes back and point to where we were going to be seated. I suppose people aren't walked to their tables anymore. They must have been short on staff because everyone seemed like they were irritated. After a good 30 minutes finally a waitress came to take our drinks and orders. The food was good however, their staff needs to brighten up a bit. Customer service is everything and today they just didn't have any of it unfortunately."}
{"text":"Bad service at bar. No happy hour? Gets two stars just for the delicious Blonde beer on tap and the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Prices are decent, portions are good sized, food is better than average,  beer is Cold, personnel could use some more common sense."}
{"text":"I got my beer fast but I was more hungry than thirsty. Sat around for 30 min and and not one girl came by to take my food order."}
{"text":"Service sucks!  Food is mediocre, at best.   Beer cold.   Scenery is nice.   You make the call, but remember--service is horrible."}
{"text":"Stanley Cup Playoffs-Vegas Golden Knights ONLY 2 bartenders? Who did the schedule? Duh!  It's wrong! This shit is ridiculous!! ALL drinks should be half price!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a Thursday and tried the fish tacos and they were very good I sat at the bar located on the second floor near the balcony and the place was not busy when I got there so there were plenty of seats although the balcony area was full the sun was just too hot to sit in that area anyway. The bartender was very nice she was pretty good looking as well.  Total bill was under 20 dollars but i did not order any alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"As a lover of hooters I couldn't wait to try out twin peaks. My entire table was trying hard to be patient with the training waitress with the name tag bambi. She had characteristics of a drug addict and at one point didn't check on us for 45 minutes to an hour. Luckily we were chatting with friends.. it took us about 3 hours total to be served and complete the check."}
{"text":"Jeesh, I'm so late in trying out Twin Peaks, but better late than never! Of the two comparable restaurants (Hooters and Tilted Kilt), Twin Peaks definitely comes out as the winner!   Of course, the restaurant is themed, so it's all deer antlers and rustic wood, with the cute eye candy waitresses wearing khaki short shorts and low cut plaid shirts. Lots of tvs around and a personal tv at the booths, so definitely a good spot to watch sports.  The menu is small, just expect the standard bar food and you'll be ok. They also have a pretty big selection of beers on tap. I'm not really a beer drinker, but I was talked into getting a man sized blonde something or another, and I actually finished it! Yay me!   The food was surprisingly good, though! We had the fried pickles for an app, and the batter was perfect- not too much, right amount of seasoning, nicely fried, served hot. Really probably the best fried pickles I've had. I had a sampler of the fried chicken sliders served on a biscuit (1 slider = $2). I didn't even know that was an option, but our cute waitress told us. It was pretty good, the biscuit was a tad dry and crumbly, but I liked the cream gravy on it.  My Hangover burger was great! They don't ask how you'd like it cooked, I believe they are prepared medium well done. It was juicy, meaty, tasty- the bacon was amazing, and the egg really added to it. I enjoyed the fries as well, just a little crunch on the outside, nice and soft in the middle, and served hot.   Twin Peaks, i may climb a mountain (or at least a small hill) to reach you! Worth the trek to Henderson for sure!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were in town for a overnight stay on Monday night and we have never been to a Twin Peaks. We arrived at approximately 10:30 pm for a drink before heading back to our hotel room. This place caught my attention with the outside bar area, and we were very pleasantly surprised upon entering. The late night crowd was low key, service was prompt, and a few gas firepits were lit. We had a couple drinks and just enjoyed the atmosphere. Katie was our bartender that night and she was awesome. She has a flare for bartending and making each customer feel appreciated. We did not eat on this visit; however, I did review the menu, which I felt was a small menu for this type of restaurant.  Katie explained that the special prep in slowing cooking the roast beef, making a homestyle meatloaf, etc was why the menu is limited. Basically, the quality of the food overshadows the quantity of food selections. This is a place I would make another stop at if ever back in the area."}
{"text":"This place was a bit small for my liking.  Would've thought it would be larger IMO.  The service was prompt and courteous.  I had the chicken sliders served on a biscuit bun and fire fries.  I likened this place to a Tilted Kilt with different outfits.  Not a bad spot to catch some games and some bar food...and of course eye candy.  Beer was also very ice cold."}
{"text":"There are two main reasons I keep coming back to Twin Peaks. No, not those two.  The restaurant's name is a barely cloaked reference to breasts, which actually are fairly well-cloaked here. And while I'm a fan, it's the football on dozens of TVs every Sunday that draws me. It's a better assortment of football games than most Las Vegas bars can offer, in a smoke-free environment.   The waitresses' friendliness is part of the experience, and I enjoy that as well as camaraderie with fellow football-watchers. There's generally lots of cheering, which can be a tiny bit annoying when you've just awakened and more than a little annoying if people are rooting against your favorite team.   Free Wi-Fi is a bonus for those of us wanting to check our fantasy-football scores regularly. A word of advice: If you've got a particular game you want to watch, make sure you request it. Sounds intuitive, but if you see your game on a particular TV, don't assume it's going to stay there. If someone else \"requests\" a different game on the TV you'd been watching, the channel is changed because no one officially requested the game you'd been watching.   I'm not a fan of the food here, but it's not entirely fair for me to judge because a.) I go gluten-free, and b.) I'm not into greasy fake-bar food. The only things here I can really eat are salads, chips + queso and venison chili, the latter of which is solid but unspectacular. I usually go elsewhere for lunch between games. The beer selection appears to be good, but I'm surprised to see icy heads on many of the beers. I don't get the ice-cold-beer thing; it must be my European side.  Be advised that if you show up on a Sunday, you likely won't find parking right away. There's some sort of a market held in the lot outside Twin Peaks that takes up a fair amount of real estate and draws numerous visitors."}
{"text":"Attn: NFL fans; Twin peaks mgmt is Terrible, terrible, terrible. Absolutely the worst customer service in Las Vegas. They don't want to change channels, turn up sound, or cater to the NFL fans spending money. I had written a bad review previously and was assured by the GM that was during preseason, \"preseason doesn't matter\". Well once again today, Week 11 when I decided to return they are back at it. The manager Jimmy wants to spend his time flirting with his staff by setting up a table for himself with all the female servers gathered around him. When I asked for the TV to be changed to the game I requested I was referred to \"the map\" which tells me where to sit so I can watch that game.  Really? Nobody in the place for a 10am game but this guy acts like they're packed. This might fly in a town without the powerhouse of sports bars Las Vegas has but it won't here. I didn't hold my tongue after quite a few expletives and closing my tab I left. Enjoy your 5 years Twin Peaks Henderson,  that's the most you have left. If you didn't have the girls you would already have the \"For Lease\" sign up."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place.  I went here for lunch (first timer) just to check the place out and sample a few of their offerings.  Firs, our waitress was Francesca, and she is off the charts amazing, very attentive and personable.  When you go in ask for her and tell her \"Attorney Steve sent you off Yelp\"  As far food, I tried a few things I didn't love, but found paradise in the doublecheeseburger, macaroni and cheese (make sure you ask for double cheese or you will get a noodle dish).  There are sports TV\"s EVERYWHERE, which is amazing, but also a very cool rustic cowboy theme that is really fun.  As for the beer, they had a nice selection, best bet is the \"Manly size\" (more bank for your buck - plus all those cute girls there will look at you funny if you roll up for the \"woman's beer\" as they call it.  Go big or go home as they say.  All in all, we will not be driving by and missing this place as much as we have done.  Its a great place to head to when you want burgers, beers, sports, and hot friendly waitresses in a cool environment.    Well done gang!  Attorney Steve Vondran, Esq. The Business & Real Estate Lawyer http://www.vondranlegal.com"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times now, and I really like it. I could care less about the \"scenery\", and it doesn't bother me. The food is always good, and the beer is always really cold! I like the BELT, the fish tacos, the green chili meatloaf, and the chicken fried steak (yes, I sample the rest of my family's food) The waitresses are always very nice. My daughter asked for a raspberry lemonade, which they didn't have, but the waitress suggested that she could do a lemonade with some Grenadine in it, which thrilled my daughter. We will continue to frequent here for dinner."}
{"text":"Great bacon, adequate fried pickles, customer service sucks!!!!! Bears game on Sunday nite on 9 x TVs. Asked for one to watch Cubs, some reason they couldn't do it."}
{"text":"the place is pretty cool in terms of decor and wait staff...its a lumber jack theme...they even have a rock wall you can climb...i saw a patron race a waitress and she smoked him....the big schtick here is the beer served at 30 degrees C....or somewhere around that...its cool to see the ice forming on the beer...but it really doesn't make that big of a difference for me in taste...  i may or may not come back, but you never know"}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink and catch tonight's game. Super cold beer on tap and decently friendly staff. If you happen to have a less than desirable experience.. top notch management staff will resolve it for you."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken fried steak with jalapeno gravy and mashed potatoes and vegatables with sweetened iced tea. Everything was excellent. My server was Alyssa who despite being busy gave excellent service."}
{"text":"Our waitress Heather H was awesome! Very friendly, down to earth and on top of things. I hate fake/phony waitresses at these places and she is not one of them. Food was very good, manager checked on us as well. This was better than my prior experience where most of the waitresses had zero interests in serving us but 1 who was awesome."}
{"text":"Over all, this is a great place to drink some beer, stuff your face with better bar fare and watch sports. The staff is friendly, Beer is ice cold and food is hot and tasty !!! what more can you ask for.... Great looking women you say??? they have that too!!"}
{"text":"SABRINA was absolutely awesome! Very friendly and helpful! Definitely one of the best workers they have."}
{"text":"Cannot believe how well our fantasy draft went. Our server angel waited on us hands and foot but yet still waited on a dozen other tables. Will be drafting here till eternity."}
{"text":"Well it's easy to see why this place is full of dudes: pretty girls showing extra skin and questionably placed tattoos... sports, cold beer, men food. It's a guys spot, for sure.  I went there the other day to watch a soccer match, being a World Cup fanatic. I was literally the o my female in the entire bar, aside from the servers of course. So keep that in mind again; it's a dudes place.  The beer was cold, the burger was tasty, the prices were fair and the tv was showing my game. Not sure what else can I say, but for a sports bar, it did its job."}
{"text":"Love this place the burgers were amazing I just had a fried pickles and jalapenos basket but the guy next to me got a bacon burger that smelled phenomenal their bloody marys are great to include in a piece of bacon inside the Bloody Mary I know it sounds weird but it tastes great the staff were very polite very attentive and easy on the eyes great food good beer selection and eye candy what's not to love I wish there were one of these in California got hooked up with a calendar and had one of the girls on the calendar who is now a manager come personally to bring it to me say hi and autograph it for me will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas until they open one in California."}
{"text":"If today was Halloween and every girl dressed up as a slutty lumberjack, that's about what the staff at Twin Peaks looks like.  The place is enormous - three stories with awesome TVs everywhere.  There is a rock climbing wall where you can occasionally catch a scantily-clad girl shimmying her way up.  There are tons of windows facing the strip.  There are side balconies and rooms for private parties.  All told, this place is great for watching a game, watching the strip, or just watching the staff.  To be fair, I did not have any food.  I only had some beer - their Blonde beer which is basically blue moon.  The taps have a temperature gauge on them to tell you how cold the beer is - proven by the mini icebergs floating in the mug.  The girl-size beer is a joke, dont even bother.  Our waitress was very pleasant.  She laughed and joked with us, and generally didnt seem phased that she was dressed like the trampy younger sister of Paul Bunyan.  Overall this place looks like it could be a lot of fun to catch a game.  The food smelled good, although strip-priced.  I'll definitely check this out again, probably when my dad is in town.  This is pretty much exactly where to take your dad when your mom is at the spa."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour for the first time. Not impressed at all from the moment we walked in the door till we left. The place itself is big, great set up to hang out watch the game and what not but horrible service and for the food not much to say.   So my girlfriend and I came in stood at the front for about 5 minutes until someone finally took the time to approach us they didn't say anything just stared at us up and down and we responded \"Do we seat ourselves?\" The host said no and continues to stare us down as she grabs menus. We ask to be seated outside it was a bit crowded inside  so we felt like outside seating would be our best option.   The server who helped us was friendly at first gives us their crappy \"Happy Hour\" run down. Super limited BTW its not worth it. We order, she cards us and then leaves. Our food arrived quick. At this point we had our third guest join us. He places his order and from there it went downhill. Took 15 minutes to get water and when my water arrives there's some black dirt floating on top of my water. I let my server know she laughs and takes my water back. We asked for napkins she pulls out this wrinkled napkin from the bottom of her apron and says \" Aww I have this one or do you want me to get more?\" What do you think the answer to that would be? NO I don't want that nasty napkin that came from the bottom of your apron.   By the time we tried to pay it took an unrealistic amount of time. Our server was missing for who knows how long. Finally when we get our bill we inform her to deduct the cash from the total, split the bill in half with both cards and add a burger to go on this card. SIMPLE MATH!!! She took over 20 minutes to return with our payment brings it back completely wrong I have no idea where she pulled the numbers she gave us I had to physically correct her by pulling out a calculator and did the math for her. I then had to write the steps down on the receipt so she could comprehend the math.   It literally took us 1 hour for the payment process. I believe our server wasn't sober. This place is a great spot to hang out and has a lot of potential but I'm guessing they market towards men who want to stare at their practically nude bodies and hustle them. By all means LOOK good and show it off but a girl with LOOKs and NO brains are only good for one thing.... From the 5 girls we came across that night they where only good for 1 thing. So by all means if your the type that likes to look come here and get hustled."}
{"text":"When you're in need of an ice cold beer while walking the strip, it doesn't get any better than Twin Peaks selection of below freezing beer served by Lori and Codi!! Third floor indoor/outdoor bar is a must!!"}
{"text":"Try a 22 oz draft beer that's 29 degrees or less and watch over the las vegas strip. At Twin Peaks on Las Vegas Blvd next to Planet Hollywood Hotel  and Casino."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out this Vegas location for months and finally made it happen for their 1 year anniversary party yesterday. The restaurant has 3 floors complete with a rock climbing wall that spans all 3 of those floors. The 3rd floor has comfy booths with individual TVs as well as outdoor patio seating with great views of the Strip. Every floor has a bar and plenty of TVs and projector screens located throughout.  During the party we tried various appetizers including 4 different flavors of wings, sliders, mini hot dogs, and nachos. My table enjoyed plenty of Stellas, Coors Light and Bud Light in large ice chilled 29 degree mugs which was awesome, but also made it more difficult to chug lol.  Having only been to Twin Peaks in Texas where this franchise is a dining staple, I was pretty impressed with this one, especially with how large and spacious the venue is and the speed of service given how packed it was when we were there. The girls were friendly, efficient and sexy as with any of their locations. I will definitely be back. I just wished it wasn't on the strip because it makes it a pain to get to, especially PH!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch a game. Friendly staff and cold beer. Recommend the bbq pork nachos. Also like the knotty brunette beer. Burgers are good, nothing to write home about but you are paying for the atmosphere. Warning against climbing the Rock wall........  Tell Kate from Wisconsin (hostess hi when you stop in). And tell her Jake is still a sore loser."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports with good food. Had great service as well. Our waitress was Taylor and she was friendly and prompt. Will be coming back.,"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location about 3 weeks ago. We didn't have one by us in California and have been wanting to try it since we moved here. The food was decent but the atmosphere was little to be desired. We have been to both Hooters and Tilted Kilt, since they all 3 seemed to be the same style in going to compare them quickly.  Hooters = horrible food and bad uniforms Twin Peaks = okay good and okay uniforms Tilted Kilt = great food and great uniforms  We won't be returning because it didn't offer anything extra special that we can't get anywhere else."}

{"text":"Started off with a side of Billionaire Bacon & some original Hot Wings. Both were excellent; Bacon was sweet and chewy with a nice little kick to it. The wings were crisp and juicy. The Billionaire Burger rocked. The combo of pimento cheese and bacon melded well.   The only minor faults were the patty was a bit undersized and could have been a touch warmer, but a very solid and scumptious burger. The sweet potato fries were thin cut and above avg."}
{"text":"Great place to watch march madness. Place was pumping and the service was outstanding. Our waitress, Sara, was on the ball and never let our glasses go empty."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Lunch today, not impressed. Had the chicken ranch with fries. Not the best cut of chicken. Nothing outstanding that would want me to come back. Others in the party had burgers. Nothing to write home about.  Just average."}
{"text":"Am a regular here, food if decent, atmosphere is excellent, beer is cold, and Bianca is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to Twin Peaks for the ASU game a few Saturdays ago and the service was BEYOND awful. We requested our bill and a togo box.  40 minutes goes by and we finally get the bill. My husband had to go to the manager to get the togo box so we could leave. I understand saturdays and game days are busy but our waitress was so terrible (Lillian in case management is interested) that I would never consider returning. PS our guests were also displeased that the drink menu does not show prices. What are you trying to hide?"}
{"text":"Madison is an amazing server, she's super nice and bubbly. She was very informative on the menu and offered great selections"}
{"text":"Liz and Leamsy are the best, they make this place so much better! Food was good, but the service from these two were so much better!!! I loved my Mexican server es muy caliente! Ayayayayaya"}
{"text":"Came in here just for some beers to kill time. Sat at the bar on a Monday night with no issues. Service was great."}
{"text":"All the food I've had here is good! Except I don't care for their chicken wings. I had a coke here once and I swear it was the most delicious coke I've ever had! However, the service here is terrible! One girl we had wouldn't stop swearing and saying inappropriate things to my friend. Even when we've had really nice servers they were hardly ever around, they were too busy jumping rope."}
{"text":"Super rude staff. The hostess, who probably makes 10 bucks an hour, has a bad attitude. Bold girl working the 3rd floor. Don't come here it's not worth the walk or the hassle. To the rude ass staff, if it wasn't for people like us you wouldn't make $10 bucks and hour."}
{"text":"We were in town and decided to try a new restaurant. We didn't know it was a cold winter in hooterS. Yes, basically hooters with less clothes on or maybe more. The food was okay. It was nothing major to talk about. The menu selection was small and it seem more of a bar atmosphere then a restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had! Waitress is sooooo bad I have to go to bar or ask other waitresses for help she started off saying sorry I was in the back on my phone after we sat for 10 mins with no acknowledgement."}
{"text":"We came here for a grad party with ten people. We did not have a reservation but were seated right away and they had a table that could accommodate us. Our waitress was Nicole. She had drink orders in for us before we even looked at the menus which is in heard of for a party our size!  We rate on four areas: 1. Atmosphere: plenty of seating with numerous TVs playing various programs, they even TVs in the booths! This is a sports bar with waitresses dressed like sexy lumberjacks. This place was fun with a really cool vibe.  2. Food: Don't be fooled into thinking this is just bar food! The food is actually really really good. The menu was diverse with items on it that you don't typically see at a sports bar. You must get a beer! It's the coldest I've ever had!  3. Service: I was amazed with the service considering the size of our party. My drink never went empty before she ordered me another. Thank you Nicole!  4. Other observations: the parking is confusing. The front door is on the backside of the building where there is another parking lot that we didn't even know was there. They have really cool sinks in the bathrooms.   Overall great place and I would definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"You get a loud welcome from the girls when you walk in. The restaurant is covered in animal heads, antlers and tvs. Our server was Julia. She was very nice and attentive.  All the servers are pretty cute, fit, and young.   My bf ordered the chicken strips.  She asked what sauce, so our friend said honey mustard, my bf and I said ranch at the same time.  I pulled her aside and said we could just share one ranch.  I also ordered ONE pretzel.  Our order was brought back and we got 2 pretzels and also 2 ranch(there is a charge per ranch).  I asked about the pretzel, they were willing to take it back. However, the boys agreed to eat it.  The food wasn't bad, typical bar food.  Actually better food than the restaurant most adjacent.  Our friend joined the table much later. Very quickly our server came to ask what he would like to drink. Good job!  My bf ordered another small beer but then she brought back the large one.  We never had to wait on our service, but she did not always get it right.   They offer a fun 4 person shot on a ski. Chanting, \"shotski! Shotski! Shotski!\"  At some point some hip hop music was blasting loud on the speakers during the shot ski. (The speakers were LOUD)   This spot is like a hooters but with mid drifts.   I think this location is more attractive than the one on the strip.  Will for sure be a hang out for us close to home.  I'd say generously 3 stars for food.  And an extra one for the experience the boys enjoyed the atmosphere.  Wish the girls stopped by our table more, I feel like since I'm a girl maybe they didn't want to?"}
{"text":"Just like hooters but even worse service! I've never been so disappointed in a bar. The food was decent, wasn't expecting much but for bar food it was ok. The beers were nice and cold (that's for the 2nd star) but the SERVICE.... I don't know how they couldn't even call it that? She came to our table 2 times and she wasn't hesitant to drop the bill off before our party was finished. Even worse she never came back to get it and someone from our party had to get up and personally ask for a Togo box from the bartender. Will definitely not be returning!"}
{"text":"I had been a fan of TP since it had opened.  Unfortunately at the beginning of my last visit, I was informed that they were \"tightening\" up their policy on requiring a credit card up front in order to be served lunch.  Quite frankly, this rubs me the wrong way. I am sure that the problem of a few deadbeats leaving without paying is NOT a problem unique to Twin Peaks.  No other restaurants in the area shows this amount of disrespect to their customers. Its like they want you to come in their business and spend your money, but treat you like a crook in the process. No thanks for me. I don't care how good looking the waitresses are, or how the food is, I will not be back!!"}
{"text":"I came in about 2 weeks ago, just after it opened. Wow. Atmosphere of a ski lodge; Hooters-style barmaids swarming everywhere in obvious, ridiculously, almost tauntingly-provocative outfits; no choice on size of beers (although they brew their own, and I gotta hand it to them for the effort to do so in a town dominated by Four Peaks) - they serve 'em tall! Okay...I did talk to one really cool girl who is a drummer with a great, friendly personality. We talked music. There was a communication there - aside from \"salacious eyes and pouty attitude serving it up to supposedly drooling middle aged men\", so I'll give the Twins 3 stars. Maybe I'll be back to talk more music with their best asset."}
{"text":"So you're in Vegas, and you've been to all the buffets, and you're feeling the burn in  your wallet. Enter Twin Peaks. A typical chain restaurant that as you look over the prices you feel of wave of relief pass over you because the typical chain restaurant has the typical chain prices.   The food is meh. I mean, it's a Twin Peaks. I didn't expect it to be amazing, and it wasn't terrible. I probably wouldn't come back for the food. I would come back just for the experience and the fact that it doesn't hurt to pay the prices.  I got a margarita. It was strong, and it was delicious.  Our waitress decided to flirt with our friend, and we decided to pressure him into competing against her on the rock wall. And yes, he did get his butt kicked pretty badly. But it was worth all the additional tip we gave our waitress."}
{"text":"Server: Judy... What on earth would possess you to stop taking our order to check your phone and say \"people keep calling me, leave me alone!!\" Really? We probably wouldn't have known your phone was even ringing until you drew attention to it. Worst idea ever to do when your working for tips and serving a table full of locals in the industry! Not what a company wants representing them! If your gonna sneakily have your phone on you, the best idea would not be to bring it out at your table and in the middle of taking their order!!!!! Picking my jaw up off the ground and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour specials! Service is decent,  good whiskey selection,  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Whoa Dorothy were not in Kansas anymore... eh I mean Las Vegas. We are somewhere between Colorado and a strip club.   9 months pregnant and feeling like a blown up cow probably wasn't the best idea to come walking into here. Of course the ladies were nice and kept saying I looked tiny. Bonus points for that.   Walking in the hostess and waitresses, eh I mean snow bunnies (as it said on the sign) were wearing bikinis and very friendly. Def the place to come if your a guy with your guys friends. Don't come here if your the super jealous time. I am quite content with my relationship and had no problem with the half naked snow bunnies. They actually were cute. I mean, if you got it flaunt it. What I didn't like was that I felt we got less attention and service than the table next to us. The table was five guys drooling over the woman serving them. She would deliver their food or beers and then spend five to ten minutes talking to them. I get it to a degree but I don't like that we asked for a refill on our beers and waited 15 minutes. We had to ask a second time and then get her attention for our bill.   The decor was very cool. I'm way into deer antlers and the rustic look. We even have a deer wall in our living room. The food was good. Reasonable prices and specials. I had the breakfast sandwich. I downed it and asked for grilled onions on it.   This place was mediocre due to the inattentive snow bunnies."}
{"text":"BEWARE this restaurant - went here for a quick drink on 12/28, paid our bill and left. Was mobile notified that we were charged an extra $30 and went back to inquire.  'MARLEIGH' was our server and said she accidentally charged us the next person's table. The manager JUSTIN credited the overcharge and that was it. At a minimum, this is poor customer service. At worst it is fraudulent activity. I don't know which. Was a previous regular and will never go there again."}
{"text":"First time coming to Twin Peaks and I had the best customer service ever! Christie was amazing, knowledgeable, and was just a very sweet girl! Since coming back, I have requested her twice!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.. the ladies are always nice and they have amazing happy hours. I opted to try the hangover burger today and it was delish. Only reason why I have 4 stars is because they charge for ranch and I barely had any fries and their prices are a bit high. However, the Bloody Mary is really good. If you want a good place to hang out with friends, watch sports or enjoy some good appetizers this place is it. They have plenty of flat screens for everyone to watch."}
{"text":"Okay, I know what you're probably thinking.  Five stars for a sports bar?  I must be one of those \"superbro\" types.  I am certainly a sports fan, but I can assure you I very seldom frequent sports bars.  Typically because the food is terrible, the noise level is over the top, or the service sucks (see my review of Half Moon).  Or perhaps you're thinking I'm one of those dudes that gets starry eyed by female waitresses in skimpy outfits.  And sure, I (generally speaking) find women attractive, but pretty girls alone aren't what gets me out to a restaurant.  Whether its a sports bar, a regular sit down restaurant, a food truck or whatever, I usually only give high marks (and recommend return trips) to establishments that deliver a quality experience.  Great food, great service and great atmosphere are all necessary to get high marks in my book.  If I came here more frequently, perhaps my feelings on this place would moderate a bit.  But tonight was surprisingly awesome on a number of fronts.  Most shockingly, the food.  Twin Peaks has locations all over the country, but tonight was my first time coming here.  I was invited to meet up with some guy friends here to watch a college football game (it also just happened to be UFC fight night).  I agreed, but my expectations of the place were pretty low.  This location is set back in the corner of a shopping complex on the southeast corner of 20th Street and Camelback.  Be sure to park south of the restaurant as parking north of there can be a chore.  As the restaurant's name sake suggests, the restaurant's look resembles that of a high country hangout.  The interior looks like a giant expansive cabin that just so happens to have a sports bar inside.  The place is remarkably clean and well put together for a sports bar almost to the point of being refined.  Theres a ton of seating and TVs as you'd expect.  And there's also a sizable outdoor patio with plenty of TVs to boot.  This place is truly built for big events (NFL, UFC, etc).  At first glance, the menu isn't anything impressive.  Sure, there's burgers, salads, various appetizers that you would expect.  But one item in particular caught my eye.  They prominently advertise a pot roast dinner that includes potatoes, green beans, carrots, and a pot roast smothered in gravy.  All in a cast iron skillet.  I figured why not.  Again, my expectations were low, but my attitude about this place changed instantly with that first bite.  The pot roast itself was insanely tender meat that cut easily with a fork.  The veggies were blanched just right and soaked up that delicious gravy beautifully.  And those lightly seasoned, thick cut potatoes were also a delicious accompaniment.  Seriously, there isn't a single thing I would've changed about this dish.  I was so impressed, I figured I'd give one of their desserts a try.  So I went with a blonde brownie topped with two scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream.  Again, a solid dish.  A soft warm brownie filled with nuts and topped with two very generous scoops of vanilla.  Really meant to be shared, but I took care of it on my own since no one else wanted dessert.  Our server Lindsay was extremely friendly, professional, and attentive to us even with a packed house full of football and UFC fans.  She came by no less than once every 5 minutes to check on us and refill our drinks.  Also, the manager was nice enough to give us a pass on paying the usual $5 UFC night cover charge, asking only that we tipped our waitress generously (which was fine as she certainly earned it).  All totaled the final price for my pot roast dinner, brownie, two beers, tax and tip came out to $40.  Given the portions and the quality of the food, it was money well spent.  We had a great time watching the game and even partook in UFC watching for the evening.  I can't speak for the other Twin Peaks locations, but this particular location exceeded all my expectations for the evening.  If I need a go-to sports bar with the guys in the future, this place will be right at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Let me give you some tips about this place.   First off don't tell my wife I come here, she might get mad. But if you did, I would just tell her that I only come for the food. That's what you should tell your wife whenever she gets mad at you for coming here too because it's true. They actually have good food. Also you can tell your wife that you just watched sports and fail blogs on TV and didn't see none of those ladies. Because that's true too, they have a lot of TVs playing sports and fail blog videos. Also if you buy a calendar or mousepad or something, keep that at work...I don't know how to explain that one man."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. The food was not good. We ordered nachos with chicken and some of the nachos were crispy, but some were very soggy. The chicken did not taste good and the texture was similar to if it had been frozen and thawed several times over. The fries were served to us on the colder side. The service was horrendous. Our waitress kept reminding us that \"the place is 3 floors and it's really busy\". We also overheard her telling this to every other table she was serving. I get it. It's busy. But then the manager should put more people on shift. Everything about our visit here was a negative and I regret having stopped in!"}
{"text":"Review of food only. Very limited \"bar food\" menu and the quality is completely forgettable. Had the fried pickles which were good. Philly cheesesteak \"Texas style\" was nasty, served on dry bread and very little meat. Try Uncle Sams for the best cheesesteaks/hoagies/grinders in this area. My wife, one of about four non-employee females in the place, had a hamburger. Thin patty and not very good, should have eaten at McDonald's next door.   Positives: staff was good, great TV's, eye candy staff was hot if you're into that. But if that's what you're looking for check out Tilted Kilt which has much better food and the same caliber of talent."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service, Zoey our waitress is the best all around awesome attitude.  She made us all so happy very kind and joyful pretty pretty looked great on her outfit"}
{"text":"Move over Hooters, you have legitimate competition now.  Twin Peaks is a sports fanatic dream with 95 TV's, college girls wearing cool Midwest themed outfits, high vaulted ceilings with the Bass Outdoor camping theme.  Oh are you hungry.  Their sports bar menu was extensive, good size portions, and better than average fare.  Beer, OMG I lost count how many they had on tap.  Had excellent fried naked wings in a red hot sauce with blue cheese and ranch dressing on the side.  Plus those crispy bite size and yummy mozzarella bites with marinara dipping sauce.  My belly was happy.  The waitresses provided very good service, everyone looked happy.  My new Sports Bar go to place for sure."}
{"text":"I give Twin 3 stars... 1 for the TV's, 1 for the beers and 1 for the boobies!  The burgers are terrible!  The steak salad is good but not sure how many people will be writing reviews on the food when there is sooooo much to see."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible service.  went in solo, sat down at one of long tables facing large tv's, waitress asked me if i would sit at smaller table, told her no, and asked why, she because big party might come in. Told her if that happened i would be happy to move.   DUH, no big party came in, restaurant less than half filled. Ordered beer and Philly Cheese Steak.  Beer never came, waitress never checked in on me to aks wassup. Have frequented restaurant regulary, will now find new go to place."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for awhile! My boyfriend and I absolutely love coming here for drinks and food!! We prefer Hannah to wait on us because she is hands down the most personable and attentive server! However, we have not ever experienced bad service here! I highly recommend coming to this Twin Peaks! Great place to bring your family and friends!  All the food is great too! The service doesn't change when it's crazy busy or slow I've noticed! This is definitely our hangout spot!"}
{"text":"June 10 Saturday 11pm wife and I was guided off the strip to this place to have drinks 3rd floor .We paid $54.00 for nachos barley any meat and 2 drinks .With the coupon 2 for 1 that was never honored by waitress .Heres the crazy part I paid the bill anyway for the 2 small cocktails And nachos I gave here $100 dollar The for the bill I watched the bartender give her the right change then she stuffs 10 away I watched her and she brings us 45 bucks.So I go to the bartender she tries to cover for the lil Asian girl but When I tell her I saw her give the right change she laughs and says I'm right.I tipped her anyway but not only did she steal she still had the nerve to lie about it .The thirst is real and I'll never go there again easy math I'm no retard Straight ripoff.."}
{"text":"I have been to a Twin Peaks before and really enjoyed it. So when we were in the area looking for a place to eat I suggested we come here. It wasn't busy when we came so we were seated right away. We ordered the sampler appetizer as well as the queso dip (because Yelp gave me a free coupon). The food and drinks came out pretty fast. After eating the appetizers we went ahead and ordered our main meal. I got the billionaire burger that had pepper jack cheese and bacon. The burger was actually really good. They couldn't go below medium (I always get mine medium-rare) because they have ground pork in which the burger. It was a little spicier than I thought it would have been, but it was still good. Our waitress was really nice and made sure to check on us regularly. I think that if I am ever back in the area I would come back."}
{"text":"Nearly 5 stars, which is ridiculous for this type of restaurant, but they get it right!   Twin Peaks is located two blocks from my job, so I'm there a couple of times a month for lunch. There aren't a ton of food options, but what they do have is really good. I've tried just about everything on the menu, and have no complaints. The service is amazing. You'll never wait for a drink refill, and just about everyone who walks by checks on you.   If you're looking to catch a game, they have a ton of TVs. There are even booths with personal TVs.   This place definitely doesn't have the Hooters vibe. Yes, the girls are nearly naked, but it just doesn't seem trashy. If you're in the area, I highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Better than Hooters! As a local it's a great view of the strip. Parking is easier if you go straight to the top floor."}
{"text":"Cold beer and a great sandwich while watching college football - with Arizona sunshine and mild temperatures  we waited all summer for these days Oh yea- the food.  My first time for their version of a Philly cheesesteak. (Remember - I learned Philly cheesesteak at Pat's in Philadelphia.).  My bud is going with a tried and true cheeseburger. Ok results are is. Gary's cheeseburger is the winner. If I ever do a cheesesteak here I will go with the TEXAS style. Many better items on this menu. Still a fun place for a bite to eat and a cold beer"}
{"text":"Fast Service for a place that's packed for Saturday football. Nice service staff worth coming too not overly over the top on outfits at all...foods is served hot and fast for a packed house at lunch"}
{"text":"Let's be real we really go here to see the ladies so don't be like this one dude who pretended to read the newspaper when we all know what your doing. This aint a coffee shop. Ok so we're really here for food and drinks but the ladies are an excellent complement to it all.   I'm fan of their chicken wings, they're plump and juicy.  Actually they're a lot better than those on the Strip when it came to plumpiness and juiciness. When I order them I usually get the green chile parmesan. GET THEM!! Tasty, they're my favorite I don't even know why I ordered the tried the other flavors. But if you must know they have them BBQ flavored which I didn't like, some ghost pepper flavored which was alright a little sweet than hot, and a red hot flavored which was alright. It's a shame they can't make the chicken tenders in green chile parmesan.   They have the Hangover burger which is your usually cheese burger with bacon, red onion, mayo, lettuce, tomato but with a fried egg. Fried egg on anything makes it instantly good especially a burger. It should be a crime to have a burger without a fried egg.  They have a venison chili burger which I had to try just because it was venison and I don't usually see that. It was ok. The meat tasted the same as if I was eating a beef burger.  I've heard about the meatloaf. Still haven't tried it but maybe I will next time. And their nachos look huge.   I'm a fan of the woodsy cabin/ sportsbar environment with all of the stuffed animals and TV all over the place. When it's nice outside they open up their outside patio area which I'm sure everyone wants.  The staff are always friendly and handles whatever the size of our party is, large or small. Very accommodating. Most of the customers I've seen here are guys but I've occasionally seen guys bring their family (wife and kids) here I'm sure they didn't mind it and sometimes other ladies there. It is a place to eat and drink after all.   They restrooms signs crack me up. Family P, Stand 2-P, and Sit 2-P. What if a dude wanted to sit or if a female wanted to stand!? I'm pretty sure it would be awkward haha. Nice restrooms too though TV inside.  Don't be shy take a pic with the ladies."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the 10th time.  Great beer, great scenery, and OK food.  The waitresses are usually pretty attractive and their attire appealing to the fellas.  But the best features are the bar layout and great TVs/screens.  Best sports bar I've been to in a long time!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Nicoley!  Come here every time I'm in Vegas. Good food, great beer and excellent service. Always a good time!"}
{"text":"OK - overall, the food is really a 3 star, so why 4 stars? Fundamentally, the queso dip - yeah, I'm addicted to it.  It's really the best thing on the menu, but, if you want something to go along with your chips and queso, for the current menu, I'd recommend the Buttermilk Chicken Biscuit sliders (tasty fried chicken sliders on buttermilk biscuits with white gravy), the meatloaf (yeah, seriously - it's good) or the fish tacos (my wife's favorite).  Other reasons to go, TVs - lots of them - keep up with your sports team (and every other game that's on at the same time, and watch the house channel for humorous mishap highlight reels during commercial breaks) - and, there are those Scenic Views they advertise - sexist?  maybe, but, to quote Nigel Tufnel, \"What's wrong with being sexy?\"  The Peaks is a good place to grab a bite and watch the game/fight.  Not a bad spot for lunch, either."}
{"text":"First restaurant I have ever walked out of. We were greeted and seated in a timely manner, but that's were the service stopped. We waited patiently for about 15 mins, just starring at the menu... The place was half empty with more than enough staff to at least take our drink order. Will not be coming back. Walked across to BJ's, and had a a great meal!"}
{"text":"Walking along the strip, you can stop in here and refresh yourself. with good food, great beers, lots of tvs for the games, and the staff are very nice. what more would you want. basic bar food, but kind of better, not sure why, maybe its the rock wall, maybe its the multi levels of staff and seating, what ever the reason every time we went we had a great time. place was always clean, staff was always nice and helpful, food was always cooked well, and served hot and on time. I will return !"}
{"text":"Love this Twin Peaks and I've been to a lot of them.  Girls are cute and friendly.  Food is great. Let me specially mention Kim our server.  Beautiful woman but excellent at her job.  Great eye contact, really cared about our needs.  Knows the menu inside and out.  We will come back for Kim!!!!!  A true gem!  She really makes the experience worthwhile.  When you come ,  ask for Kim!!! Incredible ambassador for the Twin Peaks franchise!  Let me add a shout out to the manager Miguel.  Very attentive. Greets all the clients personally.  Makes sure everything runs smoothly !  Love Miguel"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I want to like this place the atmosphere is fun, the staff is pleasant but it seems every time I go there, they have changed their specials, times of their happy hour, what's on the happy hour,... Anyway the times I have gone there the food is good the beer is cold and we have had a good time. I just wish they would not change things up so much also try the wings they are excellent and their draft beers are super cold!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place, great food, cold beer and great service. The \"DÃ©cor\" is outstanding."}
{"text":"As far as breastaurants go, so far this one takes the cake. The food is consistent, the servers actually provide a service (unlike Hooters) and the cold beer, will you can't beat that in the desert heat. We have eaten here probably twenty times and have only one time had a mess than stellar experience. The girls are great, and I never get that weird vibe that I'm affecting tip money by being a woman that I get at Hooters. Plus, the uniforms are a thousand times better."}
{"text":"Nicoleyoley and Selina are the greatest bartenders ever! I drive in from Southern California every weekend not even for the delicious billionaires bacon but to enjoy the company of these two beautiful ladies!! If you want great laughs, music, sports, and atmosphere Peaks at PH is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Been to TX and CO Peaks and the experience is pretty much the same across the board.   Best time to go is Happy Hour, as their appetizer deals are pretty good: lots of food for a low price. And cheap beer. Had the fried pickles, and they were executed well, like I've had at other locales.  This particular location is HUGE. Originally a White Chocolate Grill, then one or two other restaurants after that, before becoming a TPs, and them taking on this cavernous space. The bar is probably the biggest one I've seen in a Twin Peaks. As such, probably need an extra \"girl\" back there vs what appears to the be standard 2 \"girls\" behind the bar at other locations: the ladies there were constantly running, trying to cover the extra real estate, and were not as hospitable as the ladies at other locations due to trying to keep up."}
{"text":"I've only been to Twin Peaks twice. The beer is really cold, which is nice. I like the server, Tiara. She is really nice every time. It's not my favorite place to go because there are older men in there. I prefer a younger crowd. I live right next to it so my friend and I go over there sometimes."}

{"text":"The beers were in frosted mug and the burger was not too bad. The girls were pretty and friendly. I would definitely go back. I saw two girls taking shotskis! If you don't know what that is, look it up. The local brews are where great."}
{"text":"Great place.  Amazing service.  Go see Alyssa. She will take care of you. Food is awesome sauce.  Drinks on point and service is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the place to go and watch sports if you want good TV viewing, good sound, a good menu, and most important, GREAT service.  I was there with a group on May 7th watching the Blues/Predators game.  The manager moved us to the man cave to watch the game, since we were outvoted by a larger number of customers on what was being broadcasted over the sound system.   Thank you Twin Peaks Management on great service."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I have been here twice.  The first time was just me and a girlfriend.  We were just grabbing a drink before going to a movie.  It had been open maybe a month by that time and it was pretty full.  Of course there were mostly male customers, which is to be expected.  I will admit that many of the servers are attractive.  However, I wonder if they have little experience serving or just don't like female customers.  I'm a server, so I don't feel bad criticizing.  You're supposed to get the customer to come back and you also want them to tell their friends.  My friend and I did not feel like a priority for the server, she did not spend much time talking with us at all.  For all she knew, we could have money to burn, but because of the service, she gets a crappy tip.  The second time I went, my girlfriend and I both brought our significant others.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  Once again, we were just grabbing drinks before a movie.  Maybe due to the fact that we weren't ordering food or staying longer, she didn't feel that she needed to put more effort into her service.  If you ask me, that's when I, as a server, spend more time making sure that the customer's visit is a positive one.  The server spoke very softly and didn't seem confident and lacked personality.  I wonder what qualifications these girls need to get hired....24\" waist and at least a \"C\" cup??  At a nearby table, we saw a male customer massaging the shoulders of one of the servers, which we thought was highly inappropriate, but the server obviously didn't mind at all.  There are short video bios of each of the girls on several of their tv's.  It's pretty cheesy.  Oh yeah, they don't do frozen margaritas.  What the french toast."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos were a solid choice as is the Poblano Chicken sandwhich.  My friends have raved about the Roast so next time I will give it a try.  The Food is even better than the servers and that is not a diss on the servers as I would even eat here if the food was not good. LOL.  If you like cold beer keep an eye on the Temp Gauge and order when it is at its lowest point.    I am not sure my wife would like the skimpy attire but she would love the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. cold food... forgot my fries with my order!! Never checked on  us to see if everything was ok... had to get drinks from bar or staff .. not from our waitress!! Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch at Twin Peaks, our server was Cindi Lou who was friendly, beautiful, and on point with excellent service. Cindi Lou was great throughout our meal. I had the delicious 12 piece boneless chicken wings which were great. Highly recommended for lunch and a place to grab drinks!"}
{"text":"Good people,  great service with Linzy! Patio was nice !!beers are super cold, and you great a different girl for each order you do,  great place!"}
{"text":"This twin peaks was so great! Linzy Granger was our server and she had our beer out within the first 2 minutes of sitting down. Not to mention that she is really pretty with a gorgeous smile. Our food came out quick in a packed house. Thank you Linzy!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  For six years we've been coming here, spending hundreds of dollars during game time.  This year we're told 'no reservations' by some gum chomping, Miss Attitude, at the front desk.  Cool.  THERE ARE A MILLION PLACES who have amazing service in Las Vegas.  Twin Peaks, get a grip, you're not all that. Give me an f'g break.  Kerri killing of your clientele.  Good luck.  Go to Nacho Daddy instead, right around the corner.  AMAZING SERVICE and great prices. This place is an unknown at this time, they are going to boom! My friends and I will drop our $500 here! Screw TP."}
{"text":"The food is the main attraction here... Well, not really. Look, the foods great and the beers are cold, but the servers are the bomb. Honestly wouldn't recognize them if I ran into them on the street as it's tough move your eyes much past their shoulders :)   Just kidding, all are very cute, curvy and friendly.   In all seriousness, this really is a cool place to hang out, grab a drink and get some decent food. It's sort of like hooters, only much better food. Has a midwest vibe to it, which I dig."}
{"text":"Loud music, was dark, kind of like a dungeon. I felt sorry for the girls working there it was a little cold in the place, most of the girls I saw were rubbing their arms to get warm. As far as there lunch menu, it was  limited, and what I felt over priced, They had no mild wings, and no option for boneless either. They chairs and tables, I really found them uncomfortable, they were to high for my tastes. Well will I ever go back no, it was something I wanted to try, but to me it was just an overpriced copy of Hooter's, and nowhere as good."}
{"text":"3.5 *'s rounding down.  For pub grub, the food was definitely above average. We really liked our wings, and my burger was perfectly medium rare. Good beer selection on draft - though their policy of serving beers at 33 degrees does a number on a Guinness.  Titillation aside, the service was pretty poor - it took a long time to have anyone take our order, and it was a slow night."}
{"text":"I give Twin Peaks 5 stars for the visuals and 2 stars for food, overall that comes out to a strong 3 star rating. Let's be honest, if you're heading over to Twin Peaks you're not going for gourmet dining. You're probably going with a few buds, grabbing some beers, maybe a few apps, watching a game, and enjoying your surroundings. This place is perfect for just that.  Honestly, I had no idea what Twin Peaks was beforehand (no, seriously, I had no clue) which is why I laughed really hard inside when I walked in with my wife and was greeted by some peaks. I like this place a lot more than Hooters, which I'm sure it's commonly compared to. The atmosphere is better, TV's great, service was pretty solid also. We had burgers for dinner, nothing flashy, and they were alright. Nothing to rave about. I'd definitely come back under the circumstances I opened with, but probably wouldn't run back to dine with my significant other, lol. I do appreciate the super-duper ice cold beer that they have. It's exactly how every beer should be served everywhere.   A night out with the boys, a few beers after work, catching a football or basketball game, something along those lines would bring me back to Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"First off it has nothing to do with the show Twin Peaks, so that was dissapointing.   The drinks were meh and wait staff was very slow even though it wasn't busy.  We ended up dropping cash just so we could pay the bill and get out as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was salty.  I was really disappointed with the hypocrisy of taxidermy animal heads, torsos, horns and furs hanging everywhere and a National Parks poster on the wall saying \"Preserve Wild Life\"."}
{"text":"Inspired no doubt by Hooters this place could use a little more attention to the food.  The beer is cold and the place is clean and full of TV's but seriously lacks in the smaller details.  The chair that I was in had crumbs on it, like the server or busser wiped the table on the chairs.  The food however was a little disappointing. On the pork sliders the slaw was limp and flavorless while the bun was almost inedibley hard. Was going to get the Shot Ski but was told we couldn't get one of each kind, we had to pick one.  So because we wanted to try 4 or the 5 varieties we would have to pay full price so we just passed on the ski.  Last, but seems to be a problem at a lot of Valley eateries, LEARN TO COOK A BURGER, ordered medium and it came out rare, then it came back medium well close to well and very dry, like they pushed all the juice out of it.  The place is nice and big and the prices aren't to bad."}
{"text":"I ordered their cheeseburger and it was just ok, but I really enjoyed their queso and chips that's definitely a winner! The service is great the girls are real attentive and nice!"}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to see someone with such a positive attitude, energy and drive.  Kayt made the dining experience fun!!!  You need more like her."}
{"text":"Fun place, good food. I go after work. Nice staff. Easy parking. Local hang out!! I like nice boobs, and good bar food!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, no complaints.  The service, however, left much to be desired.  We were seated right away, then waited 15 minutes for a server.  I ordered un-sweet tea.  Wife ordered a beer and ice water.  Wife never got water, I got sweet tea, sent it back, and  I never got my tea un-sweet tea. They tried to charge me for it anyway.  My fish and chips arrived 10 minutes before the wife's chicken sandwich.  I timed it.  10 minutes.  So I had a choice, be rude and eat before all the food was on the table, or eat cold fish.  I recommend you avoid this place."}
{"text":"It bills itself as a sports bar but doesn't have all the NFL games, super odd.   The bartender forgot our waters and forgot to ask the manager to change one of the televisions; she needed more help and was definitely overextended.   Beer selection was good and reasonably priced...for Vegas.  Food looked good."}
{"text":"Changed menu and not for better. Girls have new uniforms and all buttoned up, I guess management wants more wholesome family type sports bar. Why come here? Just another sports bar now. Lost me."}
{"text":"Fast casual food made fresh to order. We like this place for carry out lunch or sporting events. The chicken fried chicken is my favorite item in the menu.  Staff always cute and friendly.  So many TVs to watch pretty much anything in the sports world. The baked wings also a favorite I like the Cajun or lemon pepper."}
{"text":"I would qualify my four stars with a \"for a place like this\" note.  If you're looking for a really loud, obnoxious sports bar with waitresses acting way over enthusiastically about everything to upsell you on drinks...well, this is about as good as it's going to get.  I'll also have to give them big credit for actually having really good food...was not expecting that after I walked in and checked the environment.  A note regarding the sexy girl staff....A+ on the week night I was there :-)  But since I attended with my girlfriend...well, you know...had to practice a bit of \"eye control\".  Even considering the intended environment, I'd say the music is too loud.  You're going to have to speak very loudly to even have a conversation at your own table.  It's a symptom of poor acoustical design...for probably several thousand dollars in consulting and several thousand more in equipment/materials this could, and should, be fixed."}
{"text":"Love the cheese bites. Great beer specials."}
{"text":"Been a regular here about 2x a wk for the past year and it was always enjoyable. BUT lately, it's like management is trying to make a fun social environment into an Olive Garden. My clients and I come here for the experience and that's it. The food has always been sub par but the wait staff has always been on point. Lately, all you hear is management screaming hands and walking up to the girls while at our table telling them how to stand and their posture. It's like they lost the vision of what kind of place this is. People do not come here for the food. People come here for the ice cold beer and the personalities of the staff."}
{"text":"I've been here three times while working in the area, and each time my order is short. It's like they can't remember from one minute to the next. The Venison chili and wings are good though."}
{"text":"Good place to be if you plan to sit at the bar. Bartenders are stunning. Servers not so much. Food portions are very small but taste good. Beer is as cold as advertised. Overall if it's close by and you want to catch a game and sit at the bar not a terrible spot. Wouldn't recommend for a sit down with your buddies."}
{"text":"Dropped in to see what the breakfast was like here. Turns out they only have breakfast tacos and potatoes. They were very tasty and the salsa that came with them was excellent! They make the salsa in house. I will be back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Some might be intimidated, but I'm totally ok with going there! Smokefree bar (no gaming machines), a bunch of tvs to watch sporting events, good service and tasty reasonable food."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff! Had the steak salad, was really good! Service was fast and courteous. Chel-c is the best!"}
{"text":"Madison and Diana were great bartenders. They were attentive to my friend and my needs. We were never without a drink, the entire 2 hours we were present. Their bubbly personalities made me smile and made my experience a very positive one."}
{"text":"Ok the views draw you in, but the food is really good, the servers are friendly and good conversationalists, We enjoyed our veterans award entree's, very generous portions, they respect Vets!   They have really cold beer almost frozen!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been there. Wasn't impressed the first time so I thought I should give it another chance. It was no better. Ordered a beer and was automatically served a 22 oz beer. Can't drink that and go back to work. Had to leave half of it. Supposed to be a hand\" smashed\" Burger. Noticed several items were\" smashed\". Burger didn't have much flavor and the bun was ice cold. Waitress spent more time flirting than serving. 30 minutes to get food and another wait for my change.  Won't be making that mistake again."}
{"text":"Just a quick review.  Went to watch the nba finals and yes the beer is very cold.  I didn't really eat much just the chips and queso and not much to say about that.  Waitresses are hot and I must give props to Kayt who has hoolahoop skills and killed it on the rock wall.  I will be back to take in the rock wall and Kayt.   Good place for beer and watching sports.  Sure beats watching at the sports boom at the encore."}
{"text":"SO BEWARE!!!  THE DRINKS ARE COSTLY, THE SERVICE IS MEDIOCRE AND THEY STEAL!!!!!!!!!!   DO NO TO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!    My husband and I stopped by for an after dinner drink for his birthday.  I ordered a margarita, it was ok, there was only salt on half the rim but I wasn't too concerned that is until I got my bill and saw that that 16 ounce on the rocks margarita cost $17.99!!!!  I was in shock. I asked the waitress if the price was correct and she said yes.  Now there are no prices on the menu and it didn't say it was top shelf or had extra shots.   I didn't think to ask the cost because I was thinking it would $10 or so, it is the Vegas Strip.   I did not leave a tip and then when I got back home and was checking my bank account I see that our very unhelpful waitress added $6 to my bill.  She stole herself a tip!"}
{"text":"I love their veggie burger So that's the only reason we go there. The whole vibe and the servers outfits (or rather lack of them) doesn't really work for me."}
{"text":"Terrible experience at a restaurant chain that I expected more from.  With a table of 8 our server had trouble keeping our beers full.  Out appetizers came out with our main entrees.  The bathrooms are designed for a man that is 4'2\".  Not to mention our waitress was pregnant.  All in all worse experience at a twin peaks.  For a proper Twin Peaks experience head the their location in Scottsdale at Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a twin peaks restaurant. When we visited there were maybe 5 other tables with people at them. The building was very clean and had a good atmosphere. We were seated and 5 min later the waitress came and have us a 4 min speal about the restaurant. She took our drink orders a beer and a water. It was over 20min until we had our drinks. The waitress then tried to leave without taking our food order. In total we saw our waitress 4 times in 1.5 hrs after our food came I asked the other waitress if the manger was working and if he could bring our check to us. I told him that we were pretty sure his waitress was high or something and the quality of the service received. He thanked us for letting us know and stated that she did seem off tonight. The manger then proceeded to confront the waitress while we were still there and on the floor with customers and other staff around VERRY CLASSY! The waitress apologized  and said that she thought she let us know what was going on.  Overall the food and beer was very good however the service and management is that of the worst restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Cold beer on a on a hot day?  I can dig it.    Located on Eastern right next to BJ's (thank goodness this spot has finally found an establishment that'll probably stick around; so many restaurants have come and gone through this place!), Twin Peaks is everything you can expect from a bar (hence why I'm giving it 5 stars, I don't expect too much from places like these lol)--boobies, beer, bar food, and TVs.  What more can you ask for?  I've only tried their appetizers, which are half off during happy hour, and they're actually pretty tasty.  The quesadilla and hot wings are great!  Other than that, there's really nothing spectacular about the food.  My favorite thing about this place has got to be all about the beer--it's worthy of 5 stars in my opinion--especially when you've been walking around outside in triple digit weather.  The beer is served so cold, that snow flurries ice over at the top of the mug.   Service is cool.  The place hasn't been open too long so service is kinda so-so.  The chick that served us one day thought it was happy hour, so we ordered a bunch of appetizers, thinking it was half-off, but at the end of the meal, she comes back, apologizes, and said she forgot that it wasn't actually happy hour, and we were forced to pay full price. Boo. Whatever.  They're all chicks (which may be a good or bad thing lol), dressed in super short shorts and tiny tops that expose a whole lotta skin and cleavage (think Hooters or the Tilted Kilt).  The ambiance is set to look like a log cabin, with deer and bear heads on the walls.  My only qualm about the place is that the beer selection is not as big as I would have liked it to be, but hey, I'll take a \"Man size\" of their \"Naughty Brunette\" any day."}
{"text":"The wings were delicious! They were moist! the Parmesan wings were tasty but if you like spicy wings do not order these. They are not spicy at all. They do have ghost pepper flavor wings for brave eaters. The burgers rank 10 out of 10 for flavor , texture , and size. The waitresses are cute. This place is waaaay better than hooters."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy hour, the prices were OK, the service was acceptable, and the food was average. Typical chain style Bar/restaurant, nothing wrong with that just nothing memorable about it.  The beer was absurdly cold...like a beercicle. No micro brews or fancy beers, just your basics. Would stop in again given the chance. A-OK."}
{"text":"This place is everything you wish a Hooters was - hot looking waitresses, good food, cold beer, and reasonably priced. And the outfits are 100 times better than Hooters.   Went here for lunch the other day with a few coworkers while traveling through the area. We were joined by two hundred other dudes and maybe 3 adventurous women. Yes, it is a sausage fest, but they make up for it by having more waitresses than I have ever seen working in a single restaurant.   The food was way better than I expected - fresh and not super greasy. And their beer is seriously cold - so cold they have the temp displayed on a digital meter above the bar. Frosty cold.   It is a good thing they do not have one of these where I live."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Lindsey is our favorite Twin Peaks girl! Always smiling and is just an all-round great server!"}
{"text":"The service at our table was horrible . Deeply disappointed.  Bar service was wonderful as usual.  Had to  flag down our server to ask for salt and ketchup. We were celebrating my birthday and our wedding anniversary..... total disappointment.  It may be a while before we come back."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place, it was great!   Service - we were seated very quickly and served quickly too. Our waitresses were polite and very attentive especially when our drinks were empty.  Food and drinks - food portions were huge!! But can't complain about that. Great selections of drinks   Overall- I will definitely be coming back here on my next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"Food is ok. This is hooters in lumber jack clothes. I don't think I will be back. We sat next to a group of guys that must be regulars.  Not the atmosphere I was liking for."}
{"text":"The girls are super snobby, act like they're right out of high school and are constantly on their stupid phones taking selfies."}
{"text":"Had my first twin peaks experience last weekend. Here's my review: 1. \"Scenic Views\" - Excellent!  The girls are hot and also personable (at least our waitress was personable).  I joked with my friends that they must recruit at eating disorder clinics as the only chunky girls or girls with any fat or cellulite in the place were customers. The waitresses here stop to chit chat with their customers not just drop off food and drinks and run.    2.  Sports watching: Good.  Lots of TVs ring the bar. we were there to watch Sunday NFL games and all 5 of us have different favorite teams and we were all able to see a TV from our table that had our respective games on them.  Of course you're only getting sound from the big draw game going on but that's everywhere.  3.  Food:  Average/Fair: Nothing memorable, and not a very big selection of food offerings.  The waitresses, who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products, definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were. Not that the food was disappointing or bad, it was just a little over exaggerated/oversold. I and a couple others had hangover burgers which is an average burger with a fried egg on it,  Burgers comes with fries which are the thick steak fry kind and they are seasoned. For the price it would've been nice if it had a couple more topping options were offered with the burger, but how it came out was adequate. My friend had the Philly cheese steak which I had part of.  Now a disclaimer: I'm from Philly originally so rarely do I give a cheese steak outside of the Philly/NJ?NY area a positive review because so often they are missing one or more important parts of what makes a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Twin Peak's version was no exception...I'd call it a decent cheese steak but not a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Another friend had the pork nachos which were good. We had to send something back to the kitchen (not me) due to temperature not being warm enough, but that was quickly rectified    4. Beer: Good! Had their Hefeweizen which was cold and tasty.   Only negative was when the bill for me and my girlfriend's portion came, the waitress had my GF down for 3 big beers instead of the 2 beers she actually ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she first tried to convince me that she was almost 100% positive my GF had ordered that many beers, however my GF is tiny and she would've been on the floor if she had that many beers in that short amount of time.  Finally the waitress had her manager remove the unordered beer from the bill, but was kind of surprised the waitress argued with us initially.    So I'd go back for the beers, game watching & scenic views.  I'll probably eat elsewhere though before I go."}
{"text":"Decent. Didn't realize the wait staff were all naked , beer was cold, food was good. No more than that."}
{"text":"I think with the 3 star review Im giving the benefit of the doubt here.   Iv come here a fair amount since it opened as its up the street from my place.  My first time here was amazing, the service was amazing.  Every single time I have come here after....the service has really been a let down.  I get it...the place is always busy, the girls are pretty and they are busy selling their mouse pads and calendars n crap...but seriously, the waits for food and especially drinks can be out of control.  The food is so good tho, and the beers (if you wait 10-25 mins for them) are VERY cold.   I keep coming back.....so I guess Im not too bothered by it."}
{"text":"We were in the area and we wanted to eat Service was good and the food was above average. We were told of the free meal to honor the Veterans. It was on the 13th since there are so many offers on Veteran's Day. We came back and the food was good and more than enough. Kelsey was great making the experience even better. Now one of our go to places to eat. We want to have a good experience and good food since we only go out to eat once in awhile. The Manager was friendly and checked on us both times."}
{"text":"Great misters surrounding the outdoor patio.  They really brought the temperature down to a more comfortable range.  Our service from Summer was outstanding.  The beers were very good.  The food was very good as well.  I had the shrimp and catfish combo blackened with a salad instead of french fries.  The salad was fresh and flavorful with very good blue cheese dressing. The shrimp and catfish were very tasty. The only negative was the presentation of the seafood. They were plated by themselves and the plate appeared somewhat bare. I would have appreciated a bed of rice or some vegetables such as sautÃ©ed brussel sprouts.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars as the draft beers r served ice cold and our server was super great.  We expected to see staff females running around in cut off jean shorts and skimpy flannel tops; however I did not see a one so that was a disappointment to our group.  If ur into watching the game this place has TVs all over so that is good.  Food is mediocre, not much flavor but probably good if ur drunk, like u should be! Hey it's Vegas people! Alas we were sober...Le sigh...  Thanks for the read.  CJ"}
{"text":"This may be a decent place to kick back and relax, enjoy a few drinks, and watch a game or two. During commercial breaks, there's plenty of scenery to enjoy.  I don't know about the food. I ordered the barbecue burger, and it was decent, but by no means anything special. The fries were pretty good, topped with some kind of seasoning that works well.  I'm sure I'll be back once in a while, but I don't think I'd add this to my list of places for a good burger."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any sports games while drinking a beer and eating wings, they always treat me well requesting seattle games, always at the bar and Cindy and Kayla are the best bartenders you can ever ask for!! Two thumbs up! They both love  the Seahawks especially Cindy!!"}
{"text":"Great service and Beer could have done without the girl pushing a survey. will return when in town"}
{"text":"Oh why not. Typical sports bar on the strip. Fun atmosphere, nothing out of the ordinary. Will say burgers were awesome and fries well seasoned. Buddies got run of the mill stuff like sandwiches and wraps. They didn't complain. Nothing out of the ordinary but a cool place to grab food. However it was empty and still took a while to get the food out so maybe that can be worked on. Otherwise no complaints !"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Vegas Golden Knights game since they claim to be a VGK bar. It looks the part.  You are greeted by a VGK sign when you walk in, and the servers are even wearing tiny VGK shirts. I was concerned because because they were playing basketball instead of the hockey pregame, but I was assured by the hostess that the game and audio would be on at puck drop. They put the game on a couple of the many TVs but never put on the audio despite my waitresses reassurance that they would. I left after the first period and went up the street to a real hockey bar,  Born And Raised"}
{"text":"There are TVs everywhere, including personal screens in every booth where you can pick your game of choice. Portions are big, fried and delicious. Definitely recommend as sports bars go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"On the busy lunch day when my (female) friend and I visited, there were only 2 other women in the whole place.  Once we got past the heavy male presence and the scantily clad girls, the restaurant was great!  Lots of TV's!  The food was really good!!  I ordered prime rib sliders and fries.  They were so tender and really tasty!  I can't recall what my friend ordered but she enjoyed her meal as well!  Sign up for the email club and receive a free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave 2 stars because the service was decent I wouldn't say it was good but just depends food was not very good I had the venison chili burger and my wife had the poblano chicken burger neither were very good and was charged eight dollars for a glass of supposed to be sweet red wine for my wife and it was not a sweet red wine and was a very cheap wine probably won't come back unless it's to look at them boobies"}
{"text":"Holy moly, worst service ever!!If you get Ambere for a waitress, RUN!!!!!!!  She gives you the shortest answers, doesn't smile, and tries to walk away as fast as possible. My friends actually left our table and went home because they hated her so much.   As far as the place goes: lots of tvs, food is okay and the uniform is hot."}
{"text":"Chill place never been here before . Food was ok beer was good . It's like Hooters but with a lumberjack feel."}
{"text":"Bartenders were wonderful and no not just to look at, although that was nice too. Still very friendly. Had some very good local brews, never ate just came here for sports and drinking. The drinks were very good as was the atmosphere and people. Very down to earth and good conversation."}
{"text":"Stoped by for lunch after a day of shopping with the girls. First I was like omg the music is loud, then it hit me... it's a bar! Lol nice set up with TV's all over and I loved the that they had large booths. The staff was truly nice and Rylee our waitress was a sweet heart. Loved her smile and service. I did notice the girls uniform (short shorts) was a little much... but it's a bar, lol . So if you are a jealous lady please don't go here with your husband. I had nothing to worry about cause I am gorgeous . Ordered chips, salsa, and queso. Salsa was warm, different but yum! We all ordered the Phili sandwich, 3 different ways! They got it right and it was amazzzzzzzing! I truly must recommend you try this place. Again the music is louder then it should be but the food and service is yaasssssss I am going back soon."}
{"text":"NO STARS FOR THIS PLACE!!! We wanted to eat here only because they had charging stations for our car. But guess what 2 suv's were parked in the spots and the sign clearly states NO PARKING UNLESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE  thought maybe the manager would help us out but he basically said F U... Not getting my business guess I have to at least give one star but can't make a review with no stars"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Twin Peaks in Scottsdale. The waitress (Nichole) helped me decide from the menu. Great Food and Nichole provided great Service. I will definately go back to enjoy. And by the way, the scenery isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Ok for me 3 Stars is average..so not really good..but not really bad. The menu itself is a little overwhelming and our server wasn't the most helpful with suggestions.but hey I am grown up so let's just pick something and move on right! The food that I ordered was flavorful and hot. My wine was a good value for the brand and the size of the pour. The service however was a little lacking. Water refills never came, had to ask multiple times for sweet tea. Maybe it's a little better when it's not race week?"}
{"text":"Came her on a Friday, service was okay. Came back on a Sunday and had a better experience. Tried sitting at the bar but we couldn't get staff to change one of the 20 tv's at the bar to the game we wanted to go watch. After requesting a booth with a  tv (which didn't take long at all) we got a waitress by the name of Jessica, she was very good about keeping our drinks full which is important to us. As far as food we had hot boneless wings and burgers and they were both delicious. Thai is a good spot on a football Sunday for sure."}
{"text":"This is your typical sports bar. Nothing amazing worth mentioning, but nothing bad either. A good place to go if you want to watch some games or watch some UFC fights."}
{"text":"I loved the wings, the pretzels and the service, our server was very sweet!  I wish I could same the same about the burger, I was a little disappointed but the rock climbing challenges definitely made up for it. It was great to see our server (the spider monkey) challenge the hostess. Very fun place for any occasion, I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"This is a cool concept much like hooters with beautiful girls walking around in next to nothing serving the drooling males  but they are beautiful so I get it. I think that's the only way this works but nevertheless I enjoyed the pork sandwich I had and the beer was super cold so I enjoyed that as well. They have plenty of TV's if you're into sports and I think they have a pretty good happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with work and ordered the salmon kale salad. Not having high expectations, it actually had a great oriental taste. The salmon was a little overlooked but the kale was delicious. This is a good bar to come to for some food, drinks and sports."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at twin peaks and I absolutely loved it. I first started out at the bar while waiting for my friend and  Stephanie the bartender greeted me right away. She was very nice and sweet. When my friend arrived she wanted to sit at a table so the hostess took us from the bar to a table and were aging greeted within seconds by Chantelle. She was also very pretty and nice. The service again was amazing and the food was absolutely delicious. Multiple girls ran our food and drinks and the woman manager even came to check on us. She was very nice and you could tell that everyone loved her. She like the server did told us about the upcoming events and invited us back. All the girls were happy and you could tell it was a very fun environment to work in. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Nice cold beers and amazing food and pretty girls you can't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  We had the grilled chicken sandwich.   Very good."}
{"text":"Food was good. Probably could have had a heads up that this was a hooters on steroids. We probably wouldn't have brought my 82 year old mother and step-father!!!! Lol. They even comped my mother's lunch because it was her birthday!!"}
{"text":"I'm not just hating because of the skimpy outfits (that most of the women don't have the body to pull off)...the food's just bad. I was excited to see something go in where Earl's was because it has a great outdoor space (even though it's right off the freeway) and went shortly after they opened, but was quite underwhelmed. I have heard they have a great TV set up to watch football games though."}
{"text":"Amber the bartender was wonderful. Very attentive and friendly. I would come back because of her service. Thanks twin peaks"}
{"text":"On the Las Vegas strip and need a fun place to grab a bite to eat?  You admittedly have a lot of choices!  However if you also want to climb a 3 story rock climbing wall, Twin Peaks Las Vegas is unique and the only choice!  This is a great sports bar, with 3 actual bars and lots of tvs!  They have great bar food, home style food and even good deserts!    They have coke products and their draft beer is a cold 28.8 degrees!  Their menu can vary slightly between locations!  The servers are generally fun and the food is hearty with large portions!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Heather is an excellent waitress and very attentive. Lots of TV's, good music with just an overall good feeling. Fish and Chips are great!"}
{"text":"Loved this place went fathers day with my son and his family the girls are so great had great service Tommy my the waitress was great"}
{"text":"First walked in and atmosphere was pretty cool with pretty ladies. It was kinda confusing at first on who to go to cause there was like no one at the front desk as a hostess or something... But some guys told us to go to a lady and we just said for 5 people and was basically trying to get a fast but good service. Now speaking of service, we had one girl who basically took our orders and stuff, but said that someone else was our server. About 10 minutes later, our real server came and since we were already taken care of by the other girl, I felt like it should've just been her who received this table as hers and receive the tips... But anyhow, our server wasn't as interactive as I thought she would be... Reason for saying this is because if you want good tip, just bullshit something or say something and chill a little bit... Whistle while you work... She checked up on us about 3-5 times about how we were doing and just awkwardly but quickly left after saying anything to us. When we were finally leaving was when she actually stayed and laugh a little with us... So ehhh, might try this place again, might not."}
{"text":"Never been to a Twin Peaks so was happy that my coworkers picked it. Knew what it was about so wasn't bummed at all.  Kind of like hooters but way better.  Atmosphere, look, cleanliness, food and of course the girls are way better to look at. Way more friendlier as well! I like the log cabin/lodge feel so it made it much more inviting.    As for the food I got the Bacon Jam Sliders and they were pretty good. Wasn't looking for a full meal but I have to say they filled me up.  Also got the side of bacon! Who doesn't love bacon and when a place has a side of it on their menu you order it.  In luck cause it was awesome.  Very tasty however kind of spicy which I wasn't expecting. The spice was a little much [for me] so it may be perfect for you.  Everyone in my group couldn't get enough of it so I recommend it for sure.    Beer was good and pretty typical for this type of place. Wish I had checked in to get the free app but I'll save that for another time.  We had Kayla as our server and she's was great. On top of it, friendly and of course super cute!"}
{"text":"I came in from the rear because there was construction in the front and since it was my first time here I really didn't know were the front was anyway. So as I was walking up I noticed a load smell in the air. At first I thought it was someone in their car. So I walked in through the rear which is the outside seating area and guess what? 3 people sitting there smoking that dumb shit. U know; the M-word stuff. That was my first turn off. 5 stars off! Once inside I decided to add 4 stars back just for the girls.  Anyway, I couldn't help but wonder where was security: y don't they kick them assholes out on the patio smoking that garbage. It kept dwelling on me. So I ordered the queso and a lemonade. The queso was too salty. So there goes 3 stars. I'm done. Maybe next time it'll get better.  And if u need a bouncer I'm available."}
{"text":"Reluctantly came in for lunch. Obviously I'd much rather drink beer then eat food at Twin Peaks however I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food but most importantly by the level of service that we received from our waitress Alex. She was attentive, polite, outgoing and super fun to talk to. As a sales manager I wish I had three or four sales people that have the same outgoing personality. She certainly serves as a great ambassador for the Twin Peaks brand. I'll go back when I need a cold beer and hopefully I'll be able to sit in Her is section."}
{"text":"Finally went in to check out the new neighborhood place at Eastern & Richmar. This is the fifth restaurant to open in the same building, so I hope they do well. Twin Peaks is a chain sports bar made up to look like a hunting lodge and has stuffed animal heads, pelts and antlers everywhere. The girls that work there are all very good looking and nice, so that makes the visit worth while right there. The menu is very limited. It has the customary hamburgers, chicken tenders, fried pickles, some salads and soups. Doesn't really have many entrees, I had the backed trout which was very good while my wife had the venison burger that was also good.  Nothing to do cartwheels over but definitely a fun place to hang out, have a snack and drink while watching a sporting event. They have TVs all over the place, including an outdoor patio and TV monitors at all the booths."}
{"text":"Great sports bar for lunch or dinner.  Stopped in today for lunch and had the chicken fried steak.  They give you a crazy large portion, that comes with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  It's crispy goodness covered in gravy.  The wait staff is always for friendly and the food is consistent.  I took a star off because they took the rainbow trout off the menu - it was amazing!    Define will be back - great place to watch games or UFC matches!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beers, great scenery, excellent service, and stellar food quality."}
{"text":"Lindsay was amazing! First time at this location and I couldn't be happier. She was very attentive, knowledgeable and very easy to talk to. She recommended some great food items. I had the Turkey Avocado Smash and it was A-mazing! Will definitely return. Thanks for the great service Lindsay!!!"}
{"text":"I went into Twin Peaks with a girlfriend, and was treated amazingly by a waitress named Tatum. She was very attentive and a lot of fun to talk to! She made us feel like she was listening to every question we had about the menu."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and I must say it was nothing special.  The service was lacking but the food was at least decent.  I ordered some drink but don't remember what it was.  Again it was nothing special.  The environment was good and the atmosphere was nice.  I'd visit again if I want a place to meet friends or to watch a game or something.  I don't think I have experienced any other ruckus here."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. We got seated after a couple minutes then we waited for 15 minutes, nobody came and asked for a drink order. I finally asked for a manager, she came out. I explained what was going on, no Im sorry, I got \"I'll get someone.\" So I go back and sat down, 3 minutes later, still nobody. We get up and walk out. The manager looked so confused. As we were walking out she passed and said \"I was gonna......\" and we continued walking. Absolutely ridiculous. We will not be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just spent my 49th bday in Las Vegas this past week. We stayed at the Aria...side note, LOVED it there!!! We both are avid MMA fans so we asked the concierge for the best place to watch the fights. He quickly suggested Twin Peaks...without knowing what to expect, we headed over. The place was packed but it was obvious the manager knows how to staff his shift. There plenty of stunning waitresses buzzing around, quickly attending everyone's needs. The wood lodge dÃ©cor gave a friendly feel...and wall to wall big screen TV's make for a great sports viewing experience.   Food and beer (ICE cold!) selection...EXCELLENT! We were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and prompt service! Everything we nibbled on was tasty...I can't wait to try the other entrees!    Staff...hubba hubba lol Pretty girls with friendly smiles...that aside, the prompt service was icing on the cake. I would be remiss not to mention one person in particular...our bartender Sara(h?)!!! OMG she was an absolute doll!!! Talk about service with a smile! Super friendly and kept our glasses full. Our friend showed up late, but she managed to squeeze him in so we could watch the fights together...she didn't have to do that, but she went out of her way to make us happy. Honestly, If not for our dinner reservations, we probably would have stayed there all night! I can't thank Twin Peaks enough for helping to make such a memorable bday evening!   We found our new \"go to\" sports bar next time we visit Las Vegas...Twin Peaks!!!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times. Haven't been back in over a year until last night. They were having a twin peaks bikini contest last night & my bestie was in it, so I decided to come support!   Upon entering you had to pay 10$ to go upstairs for the bikini contest, fortunately I was put on the list so I got in for free. Yay! Twin peaks is a pretty large establishment. 3 stories and by far the top floor is the best. It has the greatest view especially at night. The first floor has a rock claiming wall where you can have some drunken fun.   This place was the place to be when it first opened. All the girls were friendly, knowledgable, fun, & on fire! Last night I had a few different servers due to my table hopping. Our first server was extremely nice & checked up on us constantly to make sure we were doing alright. I asked for prices on drinks & she had no clue of it & was just guessing the prices. Other than that she was a doll.  Now, other server wasn't too nice. Her demeanor wasn't to great. She didn't look like she wanted to be there at all. She took forever to bring drinks. Even longer to check up on you. She would cut you off when you tried to tell her things. Not a good look.  Atmosphere is very laid back and fun at twin peaks. Probably will return when I need to for friends, but randomly coming in to eat here, probably won't happen."}
{"text":"The best food with the most beautiful servers. Highly recommend. We stayed for a few hours waiting for a flight and they loved having us and kept the drinks flowing!"}
{"text":"Light snack after dinner \"18 piece buffalo wings / House Sampler\" POGIBALLS overall rating 4 Stars Food 4 Stars Service 4 Stars Restaurant Cleanliness 4 Stars Restroom 4 Stars       The 18 piece buffalo wings was cooked well. The different kinds of sauces mixed well with each other. The sampler was also good but it could lose the breaded cheeseballs, they actually had no taste but that was fixed with red pasta sauce. The fried zucchini was okay and the boneless buffalo chicken tenders were all so worth it.     The service was good for the amount of people in the restaurant, and the restroom was clean.       I would dine in here again."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. The people that work here really like their job.  The girls are very interactive and will even sit and chat with you about your stay in Vegas.  Some of them can even help give you pointers to where to go on certain nights.   I got the steak salad. I was impressed with the steak. It was right on for med rare!  My friend ordered their burger and was also very happy.    All in all a great place to stop in to eat.  It has an amazing view at the upstairs bar as well."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, and the atmosphere was great!  Especially, with our  attentive server (Clarie), whom made our evening a joyful one with her outgoing and charismatic personality!    It's individuals like herself that will keep us coming back to the Twin!  Happy Customer!"}
{"text":"I'm always reluctant to go to these breasturants, the food is usually lousy and served up with a side of tude. THANKFULLY, the only lousy service was from the food expediter, she threw the wings on the table and ran before I could get the words out of my mouth, \"can I get a napkin!!?\"  Anyway, Vanessa took care of us and she was a delight. Eye candy yes, but her best assets were her smile, sense of humor and menu recommendations.  Mom's Pot Roast was actually rather amazing! Now, if you're competing with my Mom's cooking you better be good. Portion was decent, meat fell apart & perfectly cooked.  Mini apple turnovers for dessert - sounds silly but they were flippin awesome - too much for one person.  The place is huge, inviting and a TV from every angle. Beer is served at 30 degrees so it comes with an ice cap - just the way I like it.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Fun place and great environment. There TV's are everywhere so you won't miss a play. Staff are friendly and nice. Beers are ice cold, comes out frosty."}
{"text":"It's safe to say that I will never  return to Twin Peaks. I went to  this location Thursday night for happy hour I love their cheese bites and while I order them every time this time it was delivered to us with a thin sharp piece of metal sticking out of it. Thank God my Husband seen it before putting it in her mouth.The waitress apologized and gave us a new order of mozzarella bites the manager also came over and apologized and took the cost of our drinks and appetizers off of our bill. We are very grateful for that and enjoyed  the rest of our night, however I returned today two days later And ordered the bits again.  All of us at the table we're halfway through with our mozzarella bites when I felt something funny in my mouth and pulled it out and it was a piece of plastic. I decided not to say anything This time due to the fact that I was just here and had an issue so I decided to write a review instead and never return."}
{"text":"My friend Jake and I stopped by to eat here,while waiting for his tire to be repair at Discount Tire down the street This been our first time here my first impression was ,this looks like a Hooters with all the girls(only girls wit staff) wearing very tiny shorts and plad shirts and some sort of skimal boots so its a place for the eye candy also all very young girls ,sorry no older ladies here ;) The food menu was limited but the drink and alchool menu was bigger We both had the chicken Ranch with veggies  It ussually comes with fries,our waitress a cute brunette name Dana took our order with a little doubt in her face because the first thing she said after her very little voice speech was \"what kind of beer we wanted ? So we neither of us drink also too Due to us asking for some modifications like no mayo and no cheese and just veggies"}
{"text":"Been going for a couple years every once in awhile. Pork nachos are not as good as they used to be."}
{"text":"The waitresses are very attentive. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak Texas style and it was pretty good. Also had the angry orchard on tap and the bread pudding. The bread pudding they should just remove totally from the menu. It was horrible. Nothing impressive here besides the massive amount of tv's. Pretty much par for a sports bar and nothing separates them from the rest."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good burger. Easy place to unwind after day of travel/meetings. Pricing very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food and cold beer. Excellent service. We loved our server Chloe. Moderate pricing. Burger was great, loved that they have protein style options! Fun place to watch the UFC fight."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was very attentive! So many places in Vegas expect a tip, but the bar staff definitely earned this one! If you are tired of entitled servers, go here. Great time!"}
{"text":"Great place food is good beer is super cold and cheap price during happy hour. Have good looking girls bringing the beer. Second time here I will be back."}
{"text":"The menu is very small. And very greasy. Not good beer selection. I understand it's a Hooter's-esque type of establishment so I won't knock it for that. The decor is appropriate for it's name. I probably won't go back. Not a place for a foodie like myself."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a bachelor party with a bunch of married guys? This is the perfect place to check the cliche box of seeing some skin without the risk of getting anyone in hot water with their old lady.   It's like Hooters only with much better food and a fraction of the \"Delightfully Tacky\"-ness. They had some decent drink specials and about 100 TV's with every game you could possibly want on. Between being hungry, thirsty, and having a couple of bets in at the sports book, Twin Peaks was a one stop shop to just dude out for a few hours.   We left less broke and more full bellied than we would have at a strip club. If your group sounds anything like ours was then this is an awesome alternative to the Spearmint Rhino."}
{"text":"Great TVs cold beer outstanding service. Try the pot roast-best thing on the menu. Wait staff is very friendly and attentive. Any small or big sporting event this is the place!"}
{"text":"My one star is for tje effort of the establishment,  The service is extremely horrible! The management sucks they have no clue on how to operate a sports bar specially when there's big events, the front desk/hoestess broads are ignorant, they we're Obviously hired on looks not for knowledge, they have their cellphones taking selfies and a whole photo-shoot, applying makeup, socializing instead of taking care of guest. The manager that was on duty had zero clue on how to operate the bar when is full capacity. Also the bar is pretty big U shaped but all the bartenders are hovering in one spot so is difficult to get a drink. I probably won't go here again, it is Vegas and is full of BARS!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely good, the service was great, and the beer deals are pretty hard to beat.  The problem I have with this place is the hammered bros hanging out at 11:00 am screaming at televisions.  That is fine if you stick to the bar area, but not in a restaurant where people are trying to eat lunch while possibly dealing with the night before."}
{"text":"The previous reviewers could not have said it any better. Walked in with my boyfriend for lunch and could initially see the first hostess was miserable and proceeded to navigate us to the main entrance.   As soon as we walked over to a group of 2 waitresses and hostess we turned around and walked out.   They looked at us head on, made eye contact, gave us a rude, pissy ass look and continued to carry on their conversation.   No greeting, no hi do you mind waiting a moment,no nothing!!! Completely dirty looks and the worst attitudes I have been around!!!! Fire your staff. Not acceptable for any business and especially if your clientele comes from all the world.   I get it I use to be a waitress and would have those days, but never treat a guest with such rudeness.  First time in Vegas and we wanted a great burger, great drink and good service as we have had at other Twin Peaks. Harley Davidson received our lunch business."}
{"text":"Get past the girls and the food was really good! Girls were friendly and of course it was packed with guys who can't get a date! LOL"}
{"text":"We were reluctant to eat here due to questionable reviews, but we needed a place to watch a hockey game. We were pleasantly surprised by the food and the service. Twin Peaks offers better than average bar food in a fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was tentative and friendly."}
{"text":"I hope you don't think that this review will include fine dining excerpts from wine and country. This place is another tilted kilt / hooters restaurant with half naked woman that are decent and somewhat nice. The menu was heavy and especially for Vegas since it was 115 degrees and a meatloaf doesn't sound too tasty. The prices are crazy, but you are paying for a great view of mountains."}
{"text":"I came into twin peaks today for the first, it was an amazing experience. Tina was my server she was amazing. She gave outstanding service and was so funny. Tina is very gorgeous and i will defenitly be coming back to visit her and have an ice cold beer. The food was also really good."}
{"text":"Went in tonight with my buddies and had Brashtynn has my server and it was absolutely fantastic! She had a wonderful smile and connected with the table very well! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very average food, but a fun place to bring a customer to. Our customer stared and really didn't say much which in itself was amusing. Our service was good...probably better than their food."}
{"text":"Be warned. Everyone working here is naked. Once you get beyond that, people are very friendly and the food is good. Our food took a bit of time to get to us, but it's the strip so I understand."}
{"text":"Ok, a chain restaurant, I know, but super convenient when at concord mills mall. I dropped in and had chicken slider appetizer that was great!  Fried chicken pieces on biscuits with bacon. And sweet potato fries that hit the spot.  The inside was nice, pub/sports bar vibe."}
{"text":"Here with Kat & Shak drinking up a storm. Love this place. Great scenery, great drinks, great food."}
{"text":"So I really hate to do this because the food here has been pretty decent until lately due to the downturn in service. The last 3-4 times we have been here, the restaurant has been nearly empty however our servers have either  1. Been too busy flirting with customers to pay attention 2. Forgotten parts of our order 3. Forgotten to put our order in altogether  4. Left our food sitting in the window in excess of 15 minutes while we stared at it waiting for the server to notice  5. Not come back throughout the meal to even refill water  One time a server completely went and sat down with a table of dudes for over 30 minutes until someone who I assume was her boyfriend showed up and then she was all up in his face. She was so clueless that when she finally decided to come back she either didn't care or didn't notice the dissatisfaction on our faces.    I just cannot with this restaurant anymore.  My former 4-star review is below:  At 10:00 pm following the whole Christmas shopping mall frenzy thing: 1. We were famished and 2. Every other restaurant was closed or closing. I had only been to TP once before several years ago for drinks and couldn't vouch for the food so we tried it.   AMBIENCE Twin Peaks is kind of like a mix between a bar, a restaurant, a cabin, and Hooters, set in Aspen lol. They have 2 huge bars and in the summer (last time I went) the indoor/outdoor seating thing is great! All the servers are women and since it was Christmas time they all had on skimpy Santa costumes that were quite revealing----twin peaks. In the summer, same thing. I know it may be the concept of the place so I'm not dinging then for that but it just felt weird. Like the women are on display in a bar area full of drunk men. Gross.   CUSTOMER SERVICE Phenomenal! Our hostess was super nice and our waitress had an amazing personality. She kept us laughing, our drinks full, and when our smoked wings (yaaaaaassss gaaaaaawd) came out mixed instead of 'all flats' she not only fixed it but brought us a box for the other ones.   FOOD I honestly didn't have high expectations because again, the place sort of reminds me of Hooters but I was totally wrong. We started with the Chipotle Queso Dip (well because we got a free coupon for checking in on Yelp) and it was great except for the broken, greasy tortilla chips that came with it. The dip was really flavorful but definitely a lot of cheese. Our sever happily replaced our chips and they came out much better.  We also ordered the Green Chile Chicken Soup. It was flavorful but I personally thought the broth tasted fatty. My partner loved it. I know that sounds weird but also I just...well never mind. Lol.   We ordered the Smoked Wings and House Salads and we were NOT disappointed. These wings were awesome. The are both smoked then grilled and can be tossed in a variety of sauces. We tried the Asian Thai Chili (my fav), Lemon Pepper (classic), and Garlic Parmesan. They came out hot and were delicious. The salads were yummy too. They add cilantro to theirs so if you don't like that make sure to tell them.  We were way too full for dessert but maybe another time.   VALUE For all that we ordered and the great service, it was inexpensive and priced just right.   STAR DEDUCTIONS The only major complaint I have is the bathroom. It was like going in a nightclub. Toilet paper strewn all over the floor, Rolls not on the holders, and didn't smell pleasant at all. It needed to be cleaned and cleaned up and that's a huge turnoff for me.   Ultimately our experience was great and I'm sure we will return."}
{"text":"We have our own tv to watch ufc! The food and customer service is very good too. Not too crowded for a friday either. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing for the hubby who promised to take me from Tucson to Phoenix just for me to try the one meal he had absolutely  NO complaints about, a garlic buttered steak accompanied by broccoli that was perfectly steamed and marinated in the same garlic buttery sauce the steak was.   Just transcribing his words make my mouth water thinking of it. I can't wait."}
{"text":"The sports bar that takes a ski lodge, whips up some solid bar fare, and peppers the place with more 'friendly' waitstaff than you can handle. Order an ice cold beer and you'll likely find bits and pieces of ice floating around that might make you think they tapped a glacier. If that glacier was a brewery. Get the Hangover burger, man-style. Two patties, a fried egg and load of french fries. I like to meet up here with my friends to watch the game and don't worry, the ladies won't make fun of your fantasy football talk!"}
{"text":"They have San Tan and Four Peaks beers available which is a great start. The best 'environment' of any restaurant/bar I have been to and TV's as far as the eye can see.  I had the Poblano Chicken Sandwich and was hoping for a little more heat but the basket with fries was very good. Beers served in a chilled mug and decent prices."}
{"text":"Cindi is amazing! She somehow makes the food taste better! Pretty sure she sprinkles magic flavor dust on it as she's bringing it to your table!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was super sweet and tried everything to keep us happy but I was defiantly over it by the time our drinks even showed up.  Our food took an hour to come out and it was wrong. The manager failed to even come to our table and apologize and check on us after several attempts to contact him. The food was pretty good, when it finally showed up and like I said earlier our waitress was really apologetic and kept trying to get the worthless manager to help out."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive bartenders!  Had a good time watching College Basketball there. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm usually a regular on Friday's but for the past few months the service has been worse and worse...  They couldn't get our checks right tonight and now I'm over it, won't be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Stephanie, Priscilla and Halle were great! Enjoyed the chicken fried chicken. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The cheese stick bites rocked my world. We didn't have to wait at all to be seated and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it all around.  We had a great Bloody Mary and bourbon and brew followed by awesome queso and chips and Philly cheesesteak Texas style.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot on the strip.. sit on the patio overlooking the strip with a pretty good view.  chicken and shrimp tender - tasty.. the shrimp is very fresh which was surprising. Fire fries is decent..  Beer is cold. not cheap tho.. in fact nothing here is really 'cheap'..  I prefer the sandwich joint nearby (Earl of Sandwich).. but if that place is the usual 20 ppl line up, this isn't bad."}
{"text":"Well what do I say, food is good beer was cold service sucked. Haley was not attentive and came back to my table and didn't ask for a refill on my beer. The kitchen or you forgot a item on food and could get attention for ten min. I went to WA twin peaks they rock. So these two stars are for you. I'll be back maybe give it one more chance hoping that this isn't the way the whole place is."}
{"text":"First Time Visit...Loved that it was the Coldest Beer in town!!!! Great service, yummy appetizers...we will be back!!! Lots of tvs...watch any game you want!!!! Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nicoleyoley and Jazzy were our super cool bartenders. Great service, delicious drinks and a fun atmosphere! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Me thinks not. Good happy hour great atmosphere music wise but the girls just don't smile. you can tell they are complaining to one another about patrons and other mundane bs. Service was horrible and despite the ladies all have smoking hot figures their tude was just whack. I would rather go to a hole in the wall where you can get decent service for the same price of cold beers."}
{"text":"I recently attended an event here to watch some college football with alumni from the two schools. We had the twin servers attend to us and they did a spectacular job of making sure all our food and drink orders were satisfied. One small glitch was when someone turned all our TV's on to a Tennis match during our game, WTH? Fortunately, that only lasted about twenty seconds.  Note to Management - Get a beer menu with a larger typeface so you can actually read the menu and see what's on tap.  Yes, the waitstaff is very attractive. That's part of the charm of this place. After all, it's one big man cave. The beer is frigging ice cold, below freezing in fact. That's how beer should be served; especially when you start drinking at nine in the morning. I had a burger to soak up my brewski's. The burger and the fries where excellent. One guy ordered an Average Joe which was three 5-6  inch spicy sausages (Bratwurst). The server was saying that she loved Average Joe's, lol.   The only downer to the day was that the bad guys won. But at least I left comfortably numb.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUYzQaCCt2o"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & our friends only come here for the happy hour. It's not that bad, if you like beer ofcourse, plus the queso & chips are unlimited so I thought that was cool. Only reason this place doesn't have 5 stars yet is because of the service.   I get that this place is great for guys to get together to watch games & stare at some cleavage but until there's a sign that says NO WOMEN ALLOWED, I'm gonna need some decent service and not have to wait for my server who's flirting across the way at a table with a bunch of guys just to get my water refilled."}
{"text":"Best Bar experience.  Kayli and Kelsi are fabulous women with goals. Came back 3 times on our Vegas trip. Coldest beers in Vegas.  Entire staff was great. I'd go to Twin Peaks before ever going to Hooters.  Great time.  Thanks again for enhancing our trip. Your new older fans from Northern California. Terri and Joe"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the portions were quite small. I ordered a bowl of Venison Chili, but it was really a cup. It only came with half a slice of toast too. The waitresses were nice and cute, though."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here and try this place out for a while. Finally did tonight. The food and drinks are great and at reasonable prices. My main concern is the lack of customer service and personality from the girls working there. From the moment we walked in, they did not give us a friendly greet and it was like that the rest of the night with our waitress. Never checked to see if we needed anything else and was very unfriendly and bothered if we asked for something. Maybe I will try another location in the future and hope the service is better."}
{"text":"Came in for an after work drink with a friend and sat at the table waiting for 17 minutes while watching the tables next to me being brought multiple refills and their food but couldn't even pop over to our table to say anything about it'll be just a minute or to apologize. Waited another minute or two and still after no server came by we decided to walk to out with no order ever taken. While walking out we were told told \"thank you\" though. That was the only positive experience but the wrong timing."}
{"text":"Bought my family here one night (kids) and they decided to change there Outfits to bra and thongs not cool.. bring back the red tops and khakis shorts. Or make it 21 and older"}
{"text":"I expected Twin Peaks to be like a Lumberjack type of Hooters, and quite honestly it is in some ways.  The decor is very cabin like, but much higher ceilings and animal heads all over.  The food was OK for the price, nothing which makes me want to run back, but wasn't a complete rip-off like I feel Hooters is.  Service was friendly and our waitress refilled my drink several times without me having to ask.  They have a \"first come, first serve\" event line-up for fights with reasonable cover, however the hostess said it gets really crowded and you aren't guaranteed a seat.  I can't imagine- the bathroom was pretty small, it must get pretty gross when it's busy."}
{"text":"Cold beer. Great location. Nice atmosphere. Frances won the Girl of the Month. Bravo! Now, let's throw her name in the pot for Girl of the Year. She knows how to provide service with a smile..."}
{"text":"Plenty of tv's to watch whatever game might be on. Place seems to do great business. Has a nice covered outdoor seating area as well along with tv's to watch. Ice cold beer and great burgers!"}
{"text":"i eat at the local twin peaks where i am from at least 3-4 times a week and have for over almost a year. it is by my office and i love cold beer and good food. but i am just a another customer. i went to las vegas in september and went to the twin peaks there. i always sit at the bar. when i sat down the bartender was one of the nicest girls i have ever met. her name is veronica. we talked about things like we had known each other for life. we laughed and she was just so pleasant and funny. i went back and ate 4 more times and she was there and would remember what i ordered what i drank and we would talk more. i got a shock one day, a very tall blonde bartender came and took my order,when she brought me my beer some how she was now pregnant. after a look of surprise i had to ask, thats when i met the twins, kelsi and her sister. kelsi is the sweetest hard working girl. again real pleasant and friendly. i had alot of shopping bags with me and she noticed they were full of purses. we talked about my daughters and their taste in gifts. she told me about her son at home who is still a baby. she was excited about having another boy. i came back in october. walked in and veronica was the first face i saw . she smiled remembered me, gave me a big hug and she too was pregnant or had been and was beginning to show. we laughed and talked and picked up right where we left off. i saw her and kelsey a few more times along with pricilla. just great people. well i went back in december and of course went back. when i got there i met selena, and again just a great girl even if she is an iowa hawkeye fan. the next day i had selena and pricilla and pricilla remebered me from october, what i drank and ate. kelci was there too and it was a real nice feeling to be remembered. a few days later i saw veronica and we picked up where we left off. long story short i got to meet their manager shelly and got the chance to tell her how nice it was to come into that place and her staff be so caring and real. best to all of you girls. thank you for the kindness you have shown me and you all are wonderful. good luck with the babies veronica and kelsi. remember kelsi keep thinking the 27th. if you go to las vegas make it a point to stop in and eat and have some beers. the girls behind the bar and shelly will make you feel good about stopping in. take car all. tony from north carolina."}
{"text":"Decent apps. Like the fried pickles.  Service is just ok. Remember to order your apps way before you order your entree or both will come out at the same time.  I'm sure many people go more for the atmosphere than the food though. In that case, good place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Manager was actually helpful. I don't know what everyone else is doing or where they were. Took 30min of wait to get drinks, that never came. Food wasn't good, fries over salted(not sweet potato fries). Waitress is overloaded with WAY too many customers that she can handle. Not coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to sports bars when I'm in North Scottsdale! The food is absolutely top notch for a sports bar. Love the outdoor fire pit. Fried pickles are the best & cant forget about those dirty blondes.. try this place out if you haven't been there before. UFC fights and big games are perfect for this joint; tons of tvs and it's a huge bar. Always has more ham enough waitresses and bartenders staffed so that there aren't long wait times on drinks/food/service. One of the better sports bars for sure"}
{"text":"i'm going to keep this review short and simple.   hot girls. tasty pulled pork nachos. hot girls. cold beer. hot girls. sports. literally saw some scenic views.  do i need to say more?"}
{"text":"Food was incredibly disappointing, service was a bummer, the drinks were priced well. Honestly, I went here once and never went back. I prefer the Carolina Ale House right next door. Food and service - so much better"}
{"text":"Our beer was cold and so was the food the wait was way to long and the  service was slow not a place to take the kids the wait for there food was so long they fell a sleep"}
{"text":"Twin peaks is exactly what you expect it to be no matter what the location. It's ok beers, decent bar food and scantily clad waitresses. There is nothing wrong with Twin Peaks but nothing excels at this place is.   It's exactly what you expect to get out of a restaurant like this when you decide to go.  The one thing I will give them credit for is they are pretty on top of things on fight nights (was there for the recent Rousey fight to watch my future wife get another win) and I don't feel like they under deliver for those. They have a plan and execute and food and drinks come at right about the pace you would expect for a busy place if not even a little faster. Also did a good job handling split checks."}
{"text":"Right on the strip. Great HH, but ends at 6 Chicken fried chicken is huge!!   Beautiful women and lots of tvs.  Enough said"}
{"text":"Service was great . Haley is very helpful. We got our food on a timely manner .Such good service and a great smile."}
{"text":"Read some of the negative reviews. Surprisingly, it's much better than I had expected. Reasonable prices and I found the some fault with all the negative posts about food and service. Somebody was bashing them and I don't understand why. Walked in, in the late afternoon on a weekday, so service should be easy and fast, but it seems well staffed and management seems to be on their toes. I should know about this since I come from a restauranting family in business of alnost 70 years."}
{"text":"I love this place! My girlfriend hates it. I think that sums up all you need to know.  I would say go with the guys. Lots of pretty girls to distract you."}
{"text":"I love this place. Not because of the attractive girls. Because of UFC!!   They are one of the only bars near me that plays the fights. We go to every fight there.   They have cold beer and I have always lived mixed drinks there too. Good bartenders.   The food is fantastic. Their chips and Queso is to die for. We order it every single time!! Good is great too. Love their salads a lot.   The environment is awesome too!! They have a cabin decor inside. And a fire pit outside to hangout around.   Hands down best bar in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Horrible service, it was pretty empty. Took forever to get our drinks. We ordered nachos & they were cold. Server would just disappear. I had to get up to get a set of utensils & one napkin. She never checked up on us. When we ordered one more drink, it  took another century to arrive. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"\"Pay per view\". The service is really friendly and welcoming, i went with my husband and a friend and we all agree you pay for the view ( that is their concept), The food is just bar food a little too expensive. We did loved the beer, it is cold and they have good selection. If you just want to go to get a really cold beer and have a good time with friends you will be fine, just don't expect the best food for the prices in their menu. Last thing, this place will be awesome for football season! their screens are awesome!! So saying that i will give 4 stars because of the screens, beers and friendly staff, but only 2 stars for the food!! so yay i am a fan when i go to get some beers and football!"}
{"text":"March Madness Happy Hour at this place is awesome.  I mean it's Vegas so don't expect to get a \"deal\" on anything even at happy hour, but the ambiance and drink menu/food prices are fair.  The views of outside are awesome if you get them, there are plenty of TV's and food/drink variety.  I will go again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Similar to tilted kilt/hooters/etc but much different menu variety than the others. I tried the fish tacos this time and there are no complaints from me. Perfect amount of meat to veggies and dressing within the tortilla that I almost couldn't finish the 3 tacos.   I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you haven't been before. If you don't go for the menu or the sports, then maybe the women who will be bringing you your food will get you to give it a go."}
{"text":"Stephanie and Shey always give impeccable, A1 service! Highly recommend hanging out at the bar with them for a 29 degree draft beer"}
{"text":"I came here recently while on a business trip and I brought my 15 year old son......I know, call CPS I am a bad dad!  I didn't know what to expect other then the \"twin peaks\" so I sat down and ordered a cold beer and a burger.  While I wasn't impressed with the menu selection, it was really scaled back, the food was pretty damn good.  Oh and the beer, lets talk about that, it was pure icy goodness in a glass.   The service was pretty good and the young ladies paid a lot of attention to my son.  Oh yeah and they were hot!  I will love to come back here again when I am in the area and try something else."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot for chicken wings.Great chips...Free with Yelp. Try it you will like it. A lot."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and service hasn't been bad. When we actually got service today, it wasn't bad either. That's why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1. In the first 10 minutes we were there today, 3 servers walked right past us, including after we got the attention of one girl. They appeared to be socializing with another table. Our server was very attentive, as I said. She did a great job. The highlight of our trip was when one of the hostesses walked past out table yelling, \"Someone's gotta pee! Someone's gotta pee!\" over and over again. I guess in my profession that's something one keeps to oneself."}
{"text":"I had Courtney D. as a server and she was so sweet, amazing service, engaged, quick with drinks and food, and made my experience the best I've ever had at this establishment! Request this amazing server when you eat, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was great, drinks were good, Shak and Krystal really took care of us and it was a Monday night. Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Coldest Brew House Beer Is Served In Cold Mug at 26 Degrees IceBeer Good Happy Hour Food  Recommend Chicken Fingers & Blackened Chicken Quesadillas Were Delish!"}
{"text":"What the..? A Hooters facsimile but better in EVERY way? Well. Done. **slow clap** So, if you're into 80's decor, poor food, outdated everything and other nightmares, head over to the Hoot. If you want the opposite of that, come to the Peaks. Besides the fun people-watching from the balcony (facing the strip), there are probably 100 tv's around to keep an eye on your (losing) bets. The beers are cheap and come with half-off refills if you get a ridiculously large one (they filled one of those with a vodka soda for me, which is absurd... and awesome). The food? Modern and tasty. You can go fried or get avocado things. Something for everyone. The ladies... are wonderful people :). Anywho, you get the point. If you thought coming here would be awful, boring or tasteless, you're wrong. Get on out, grab a 64oz drink, some wings and hit the strip!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming here on a Tuesday night. Was told a 20 minute wait when I walked in the door. After 45 minutes, asked a waitress how much longer? She replies \" there's no way to tell\". After an hour I ask the  manager how much longer as we've been here an hour. He says in a very condensing tone \" I have no idea, what do you want me to do?  \" Really? Don't ever make the mistake of coming here. OK, so to continue on with the rest of the visit, we finally were seated after an hour and a half. After we got our drinks, security comes to our table and asks us all to leave. We are a party of 5 adults and 3 kids mind you. Completely shocked as we've done nothing wrong, we suggest they have the wrong people. After asking us 3 more times to leave, they finally realize they indeed had the wrong people. What a nightmare! The only positive I have to say is that the waitresses are amazing and do a great job. Management needs a serious overhaul!"}
{"text":"We go here quite often.  Today we went so we could watch the hockey game.  I know they are busy but a wait list is just that.  But apparently not here if you know someone.  We were on the list and a woman behind us knew a waitress and got right in. No waiting.  Same number of people as us. This is not the first time this has happened.  Size apparently matters as well.  About 3 weeks ago we were again waiting for a table.  Six skinny chesty young ladies came in and were seated right away.  Again a waiting list is a waiting list. I don't care who you are or what you look like if you have a waiting list then they should honor it."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend in Vegas for my birthday this past weekend and after about 28 hours of drinking decided that we really wanted some wings before heading back to the airport. We stayed at the Cosmopolitan, so Twin Peaks was just across the street. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, plenty of TVs and a good selection of alcohol. Since my buddy and I were craving wings we each got a 12-piece order all of which was good and plenty of food.   All around, it was a nice experience, the food was good and drink prices were on par with most other places on the strip. Would not hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"So went here with my hunny the day we flew into town figuring a descent burger for me and a nice view for him. Not a bad way to ease into the craziness of Vegas right?? Not really.  The waitresses were kinda cute the food was really like Applebee's with Tiny uniforms. The part that kills me is the ok burger was $10. The badly made long island was 12.75. The drink list has no prices.  Wtf? I could see $13 for a good drink in a bit bigger glass or less ice but for what it was it's not worth it.  All in all not a place I'll go to again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple drinks & sat at the bar. Not very crowded at all but we got quick service. The girls were really hot at this one :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I have had a hard day at the office, I head over to Twin Peaks, but I only come when Nicole is working, she really knows how to help me put my head in the right place.   She is always happy to handle a large group of guys.  She bends over backwards to service her clients. There is no job too small or too big that she wont grip with both hands and work it till satisfaction.  She has the best assets for the service industry, and her chest contains just the largest heart.  She knows just how to handle hard clients, and isn't afraid to get her knees dirty, and do the hard work.  So when you go to Twin Peaks of Scottsdale ask for Nicole, and she'll give you a big head by making you feel special.    Oh ya and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Cold cold cold beer.  Ice on the glass. My favorate beer is dirty blonde. Their bone in naked hot wings were awesome. My favorite flavor is garlic parmesan and Lemmon pepper. Our waitress was very helpful and sweet. I don't remember her name. She is from Idaho. They have a lot of tv's and nice patio. I want to say One thing.  They supposed to open 12pm but kitchen close early , people start to clean floor too early. We couldn't even stay  there until 12pm. That's why I give them 4 star."}
{"text":"I love Cassie at TP it's my spot every week!  She's the best part of TP! We all adore her!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, the fries are top notch as are the ladies waiting on you. This weekend they are decked out with bunny ears and tails for easter! The beer is also served ice cold, literally it was coming out of the tap at 26 degrees this afternoon."}
{"text":"Still love the Scottsdale location better but this one had some charm. Our server Maddy was awesome. It seemed like she was taking care of most the tables in the building.  My buddy and I were doing an online football draft and had to move tables for outlets and everyone accommodated us. Although my draft doesn't look good I don't fault Twin Peaks for he cold man beers and fried pickles.  If it's game time you should be here."}
{"text":"Came for a light meal and drinks before a show. Was not expecting much more than Lulus, Hooters, or Bdubs but was surprised that the food was better than expected. We ordered the pork sliders, a basket of fries, hot wings and the 29 degree dirty blonde beer. The beer was delicious, get the one that resembles Blue Moon. The fries, hot wings and pulled pork were flavorful and well seasoned. A great value! Good loud atmosphere with plenty of screens within view to catch your team in action! Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped here under the recommendation of my friends cousin, who's a Phoenix local. A few of us decided to join the party a little late, because we weren't that hungry at the time. My brother changed up and ordered a side salad while I added some chicken strips to a separate order.   The food for the others looked decent, but no one was finishing the food after claiming to be so \"hungry\"  They mixed up orders, were slow on service, and while some of the food had no flavor(pot roast trio with Mac and cheese), or was cold (the chicken wings, which looked great!!) my chicken strips were decent, and the beer was good.   After all of that the server tells us \"the system is down so we have to wait for it to get our bill.) yeah right, call the manager! I had to make him calculate our order by hand after waiting 20min for the system to recover. I won't need to come back here but hope this location tightens up!  Atmosphere was a cool large sports bar vibe with a lot of TVs."}
{"text":"Really neat place for casual/mid eating or hanging out. Plenty of screens, and good beer selection.   Millionaire (billionaire?) bacon was awesome."}
{"text":"Cold beer ...now I know why they charge your credit card  when you arrive..service is terrible..girls are cute..beer is cold food is mediocre...can't seem to keep game on tv you request...anyway did I mention that the beer is cold and girls are cute if your a pedophile..lol.."}
{"text":"Had a ten top on a busy night. They cannot handle it. Me and a buddy at one of the table kept getting orders to our table when all we had was 1 beer and wings. The orders should of been going to the other end of the table. When we got our wings, 1/2 of the were cold but the manager took care of that for us. As we continued to get other orders to our end of table that we didn't order, we realized our fries which we also ordered did not come. When we brought it to the waitresses attention she asked \"do you still want them?\"  We said no she walked away and the fries miraculously appeared. Not happy. The manager was the only helpful and FRIENDLY person."}
{"text":"The corporate hierarchy in Addison, Texas is working hard to ruin the chain. The bean counters are nitpicking pennies by forcing the bartenders to intentionally under-fill the beer glasses and put more ice into the mixed drinks to cut back on the \"expensive\" ingredients. The corporate lawyers are overreacting to a single bogus sexual harassment claim by one of the money-seeking waitresses to impose stringent restrictions on the behavior of everyone else in the whole chain. Now, the rule has come down from the top that no customer is allowed more than two drinks.  (Do I really want to come watch my favorite team only for as long as it takes me to drink two beers??) All of this puts the restaurant managers in a real squeeze.  As a group, they are all about trying to satisfy the customers and maximize profits, but the corporate rules turn them into unreasonable automatons in the eyes of customers and employees. Twin Peaks used to be a really fun place to enjoy cold beer, good food, and the game of your choice.  More recently, it has turned into continuous arguments between the customers, the waitresses, and management. Is this really the way that the big boys in Addison want it to be? I have been a loyal customer of TP for the past five years, but my wife and I are on the verge of quitting the place. Wake up, Addison, you are screwing up big time.  Also, can you put the carrots back in the Mom's Pot Roast please?"}
{"text":"By far the most relaxed TP location I've been to. My waitresses, Shak & Alyssa were delightful and attentive. Beer was cold and happy hour for $4. Definitely unique to this location IME to have some beers priced out of happy hour but maybe it's a Vegas thing.   Substituted asparagus for fries cuz I'm trying to be healthy, while enjoying the bacon burger without the bun, of course.   Brandon made sure that everything was good and thanked me for checking out this location which i thought was very courteous of him.   Fair number of people enjoying their evening but plenty of space to be had around 1030 on a Monday night.   I like the mix of food I can eat while maintaining Keto, affordable beer, sports & highlights, and world class scenery."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Uniforms alone are worth checking out.  Grab the hottest server and challenge her to the rock wall !"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Renee is so fun and nice, not to mention how great a server she is!"}
{"text":"First time at twin peaks. Went on a Wednesday was pretty busy. Sat at bar. The service was good not great but they were busy so I will be easy on them. The beer can't complain about, it is ice cold, so good. I had a mixed drink that was also good the titos tea just got it without the splash of soda. The food I ordered was great! I got the chicken fried chicken it is amazing, I was hungry but still. Going back for sure. I did think my bill was kind of high but them cold beers go down pretty fast."}
{"text":"We always figured it was just \"another chain restaurant\" so we have never stopped by.  While waiting for our tires to be put on next door we decided to stop in. It was fantastic! The staff are fun, friendly and make you feel right at home. The food was delicious and now we know they are the home of 29 degree beer. What more could we ask for. We will be back. Casey our server was awesome, but so was everyone who stopped by whether to say, hello, or drop off our food. Great place! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What's not to like about a hunting themed bar full of scantily clad, attractive women. I stop by here from time to time to enjoy a dirty blonde. That would be one of the house brews on tap served at below freezing temperatures.  There is a temp gauge at the entry that fluctuates around 27 to 29 degrees.  This indicates the temperature of the beer on tap. Yes, there are ice crystals in your beer that also arrives in a frosty stein. The staff is always flurtatious and helpful, which adds to the experience. The small menu offers some slightly different tasty treats. Hamburgers referred to as \"man burgers\" are tasty and fulfilling.  They also offer the biggest slab of chicken fried steak I've ever seen.  I have only enjoyed watching people try to eat this bohemith of a plate and haven't yet tried it. They offer the token bar food with some slight twists.  I haven't had a bad meal yet. The interior is adorned with huge racks.  I'm referring to the mounted antlers which are quite the display. There are many tvs to watch any sport that's playing at the time.  It's a cool place that will remain a mainstay in my places to hang out."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Food is crappy and service is even crappier! The only good thing about our visit was our bartender Courtney with the beautiful red hair. Shes the only one who provided professional service. Everyone and everything else sucked!!!! And the management allows creepy old dudes to sit around taking pics of the girls. Piss poor management and the staff treated each other and customers with such disrespect. Never again. This place just needs to put us all out of our misery and close down!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch, because it was right in the area we were shopping. Food was okay, but the service was bad. They took forever taking our order and then they would completely interrupt my husband and I talking, it's fine once but they did it so many times it got annoying. The music was so loud you had to yell to hear each other. Just not a great lunch experience, won't be going back. Might be good for a bunch of college guys that want to yell at the game and drink beer."}
{"text":"Umm it's gonna be an absolute NO for me! Twin Peaks is awful to say the least... I really was so disappointed with my most recent first visit with friends this weekend. When we arrived first of all there was not a person in sight at the door welcoming or even directing where you can go to be helped. My friends and I decided to head up the stairs and just so happened to run into one of the waitresses who said we could sit wherever we wanted and that somebody would be right with us. Direction as followed we were eventually greeted by a waitress who took our drink orders and then disappeared... About 15 minutes later she showed back up with our waters and took the first order which was the mozzarella cheese bites as an appetizer.   After placing this order about 20 minutes later the appetizer came out and we then placed our order for the 18pc lemon pepper wings with a side of French fries.. It took no lie about 45 minutes for them to arrive. To my terrible surprise, as I took my fork to scoop fries onto my plate there was a long piece of black hair that came out right along with the fries attached to one of the pieces of chicken! Yuck! .. Just great.. At this point everybody was extremely frustrated and the fact that these wings came out with hair on them they weren't even hot. You can tell that they had been sitting and clearly weren't fresh.   I mean c'mon now if you are going to have people wait that long for their food at least bring it out piping fresh. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of care from the waitress because when we brought this to her attention she was super nonchalant about the whole situation and just shrugged it off like \" oh well this happens all the time\" kind of attitude.. With that being said we paid for the cheese bites and left as fast as we could... this was crazy and so unexpected because I actually had a great experience in one of their locations in Atlanta, GA and sad to say that my own city couldn't even deliver just as well...."}
{"text":"I was just here on Sunday in the upper patio bar level.  Great place to watch the games with a nice Vegas view. The beer and food is great too.  My favorite is the billionaire bacon!  Do not miss it.  I've also had the chicken and grilled shrimp,  which were both good.  Service was excellent!  Especially Selena and Ashley, who were so nice and of course beautiful!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or the UFC. TV's all over the place. We were dining with someone with a broken leg and the staff was very accommodating to him. Food was good. Wide variety of drinks. Girls were beautiful"}
{"text":"Carnivore. That's it. Get fed like one, have a cold brew and then it's back to the strip. Lol yea right. You won't even walk after a meal from here. This is a big man cave with a few hotties roaming around. They know their job well so don't be a jerk. Service was perfect. Waitress made all the right suggestions. Hats off to the folks running this place."}
{"text":"This visit was my last! I knew that the service was spotty as I mentioned on my previous review but this time was just horrible! This girl was high or something and she literally forgot everything that we ordered. Food was wrong and forgot to bring our drinks. Usually the drafts come so cold it hurts in your throat but because they were sitting for 20 minutes at the bar they were warm. When I told her she got mad and said that they work as a group and someone else should of brought the beers. Honestly she was flirting with the manager by the kitchen the whole time and forgot about it. When I asked her for BBQ sauce she got me mash potatoes gravy lol and still charged me .50 cents ahhaha never again! Food is great but I cannot stress this much to have a good meal! Bye"}
{"text":"Great fun place to grab a bite to eat and a cold brew! It's especially fun because it's bikini week here! The girls here are cute as a button and they are clearly staying nice and cool in this Las Vegas summer heat ;-) Service here was prompt and the food was delicious! We  loved our server, Michelle!"}
{"text":"Beer was cold. Food was better than expected. Service sucked seems the wait staff forgot to take there midol. Seriously thought I was at ducks last resort with the attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"They have seriously improved on there food.   Been going there since it opened but haven't been in the past year till now.   Will definitely be coming back.   Get the chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Carley and Erica took care of us throughout the night. A beer never went half empty without an offer of a fresh one. They went out of their way to make a great Monday night football experience during my buddy's birthday celebration. The place was sufficiently staffed and the food was out in minutes. We never felt neglected. We will be back often."}
{"text":"I really liked this place when it first opened, over the years the menu has been cut back and quality has slipped. I havent been in a few months so i went today was really craving the steak fries. I ordered a burger and fries, wellllll burger arives they now serve it on a small bun like u would get at food lion ehhhhh and too top that they do not have steak fries anyl longer, just normal generic skinny fries. I just took one bite of my burger and just slid my plate over and walked out. Im not paying close to 15 bucks and a tip for that. Not tipping a waitress who barley said 5 words to me and every time i looked over she was on her phone. This place is horrible now"}
{"text":"Fantastic once again. Such a good time for work lunch breaks. One thing I don't recommend is sitting in any of corner booths, you will not get seen for 10+ minutes."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place...Hmmm...how can I put this... Sausage Festival.  A strip club where the girls just wear slutty lingerie and don't get naked but still act like dick teases. A want to be Hooters.   So I am not sure what is going on in here...I mean if you like to watch sports in a bar...yea...they got that going for them, that and Ice Cold cheap tap beer that's why they get two stars.  Not really anything on the menu that is very healthy, If you want straight junk bar food than yea they got that too....the decor makes no sense, you got girls wearing next to nothing, Ugg boots, and then have a bunch of taxidermy on the walls...not sure what the hell is going on in here. And god help the lighting...its like walking into the sun, I assume they do this so the middle aged perverts that frequent this place don't try to get handsy with the barely legal waitresses.  And this place is over priced, besides the bar, everything here is about $2 $3 more expensive then most other places serving the same menu items and the quality is generally shit.    I would go here to watch a game once in a while, but most game days, there is a line out the door. And for special events like fight night they want to charge a cover to get in like there a god damn night club. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good place! Come here for lunch usually with the guys from the office. Food is actually awesome! The Meatloaf, fish tacos, and the blackened catfish! Service is good, not just based on looks. Maybe one day I will play tourist and make it down there after the office to enjoy some cold craft off the tap!?"}
{"text":"Great hostess. Seated right away. Unfortunately waitress was more concerned with the table of guys next to us. Never checked to see if our order was correct -which it was not -thru the entire meal. Food was average. Service was poor. Would not want to be here at a peak time"}
{"text":"Well after hearing about Twin Peaks up in Scottsdale I decided to check it out down in the Biltmore area.  I must say what a waste of time.  The food was barely average and the idea that the girls that work there are \"hot\" is really subjective.  I suppose waitresses that are barely one step up from a strip club could appeal to some.  I say save your time and money and go to the Tilted Kilt.  Much classier place."}
{"text":"Not sure who does the laundry for these girls but you might wanna turn the heat down on that machine. You've shrunk everything!!!!!  UPDATE:: Andy, I had a great time! My Mrs was working locally and I had to find somewhere to kill time. Thought about a movie and a coffee and walk in the park but then came back to the real world!! Lol.  I actually didn't eat coz I was waiting for the Mrs and we went out after her appointment (a happy wife is a happy life!) but the food I saw come out looked yummy.  I sat there for 4 hours and all I drank was the Nutty something. Damn that stuff is good.   I was gonna ask to talk to you while I was there coz I wanted to praise you for actually responding to people and giving a crap about your reviews! That's honestly one of the reasons I came to your establishment. I'll sure pay another visit when I'm back.  The girls were cute and I was just messing!   Thanks for caring man!!!"}
{"text":"My love - hate relationship with Twin Peaks continues.   I posted our pics from last nights supper.   As I have posted before, their Billionaire Burger is one of the best burgs in CLT, if you are a bacon lover, it is absolutely terrific.   However, my wife went with the Salmon Dinner, it was nasty, fishy and lacked flavor.    The manager came to ask about our meal, we told him about the Salmon and asked if it was frozen, he said it wasn't and comped her dinner.  So, I see a lot of posts about bad service or bad management.   The manager above came to our table twice to check on our meal and seemed genuinely concerned once we voiced our complaint.   Furthermore, the servers were on par.   My wife and I have been to this location about two dozen times, we have never really had an issue, but based on last night, it seems they are giving customer satisfaction and extra boost.   Good for them, driving return customers.  As usual, I would like to thank Twin Peaks for supporting, Mothers Day, Fathers Day and Veterans Day with Free Meal offers.   Those little gestures makes us come back time after time....."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard mixed reviews, so I was apprehensive to check it out. However, I'm glad I did.  This concept is a Country version of the Tilted Kilt. I do like the vibe of the place and it does have a family appeal aspect too. The outfits are cute but not overbearing .  The service here was good and all of the staff friendly. That was par for the course and met my expectations. It is next to Colonade Mall and has tons of stores to experience and coffee shops too. Good location as well.  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #Irishcatv2"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for hot wings. The wait staff did not follow up with us. Eventually,  we asked for the food to go, but we continued to wait several minutes."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by in Vegas if you wanna climb the twin peaks. Don't let the ladies fool you! They can do it in less than 50 secs! TIP: The one of the side of the rock climbing is the hardest don't pick that pick the one to the right of it.  The bartenders are great and super friendly! It's like hooters but mountain climbers style! LOL Food - who's paying attention to the food! Awesome beer selection!  It's on the strip so easy access!"}
{"text":"Very excited to see a location down here in NC. We visited once but that was in Vegas years ago. The waitresses were very nice & welcoming. We used the free queso and chip offer as well for our app. Drinks were good. We will definitely be coming back for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Had never been to one of these places before.  Have to say the ambiance is like hooters with a rock climbing wall inside of it.  I guess anyone can climb it if they feel like it, we saw several people doing it. Different form of entertainment.  The waitress wear the minimum clothing requirement (which hubby loved of course).  Its got a lot of TV's for the sports fans and food was actually fresh and decent, although I think a bit pricey for a burger joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Thursday night. It was fun and the food was exceptional. We had the BBQ pulled pork nachos, the chicken sliders and a hangover burger. Delicious! All the waitresses were beautiful but it's really too loud to talk to know how friendly any of them are but our waitress kept our drinks filled and although our appetizers took too long and were luke warm by the time we got them, she was on it the rest of our stay. I would definitely go back to catch a game and eat a"}
{"text":"Went to check out this place since it's close to home. Great place to watch a game. Beer was ice cold, the food was delish with the ghost pepper wings and pretzel w/ beer cheese a must try. The waitress \"Ursula\" was super nice and nice to look at...wink wink!!! The service was excellent too with her being knowledgeable with menu suggestions and attentive at keeping my beer full. She even suggested the honey badger shot which is now a new favorite as well. Check this place out! Did I mention my waitress was hot!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Twin Peaks twice.  If I wrote this review after my first visit, I would have most likely given it 4 stars.  But today, my second visit here, put it over the top for me.  The reason for the extra star was our phenomenal bartender Kathiee.  Not only was she one of the friendliest people I have ever come across, she was rocking out cocktails, draft beers, and refilling our drinks all while striking up a conversation with my party as well as the others sitting along the bar.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp basket and asked my chicken be tossed in their green chile parsesan sauce.  Kathiee was so great that when my food arrived, she made sure my chicken was tossed in their wonderfully delicious green chile parmesan sauce.  This level of attention to detail really meant a lot (the waitress at the Henderson location just gave me a cold side of green chile parmesan and forgot, or didn't care, I wanted my chicken tossed in that sauce).  So great job Kathiee!!!  Not to be forgotten, the shrimp in my basket were huge!!!    At this particular location, I have had the green chile meatloaf and the chicken and shrimp basket.  Both items were very good.  The meatloaf is smothered in mushrooms, onions, and gravy, but the green chile in the meatloaf adds a unique and delicious kick that I can't get over.  I would have to rate it the best meatloaf I have had.     I believe I saw 12 beers on tap from Coor's Light to an IPA to their very own house brews.  I've had both the Knotty Brunette and Dirty Blonde house beers.  The Knotty Brunette tastes like a good brown ale while the Dirty Blonde is a nice Hefeweizen.  Both are worth a try.    On both my visits, the staff and service was good.  Everyone was friendly and food came out quickly.  Not to mention it is bikini week, so that is definitely an added bonus.  But if you happen to be there when Kathiee is working, definitely hangout at her bar.  Not only is she a great bartender, she is a huge foodie and is a big fan of yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, if Brianda is working, you need to sit in her section.  This girl is on point with her service.  Very friendly and welcoming.  Very attentive to her tables.  Appetizer platter, green chile meatloaf, hangover burger, smokehouse, and pot roast are my favorites.  Food is always good.  I sometimes wonder if I like the food or girls better.    They show all major sporting events as well as the UFC.  There is a nominal cover charge of $10 for the UFC.    Huge HDTVs all around the bar and throughout the restaurant.  Makes you feel like you're always in the action.  The bar is gigantic and can seat an army.    The entire staff is very friendly.  As soon as you step foot inside the girl up front greet you with a smile and a hello.  The dÃ©cor has sort of a lodge feel, but its not dark and drab.  Lots of eye candy.  Definitely a good place to grab some food, drinks, or both."}
{"text":"Twin peaks is amazing. Had the best service ever thanks to are waitress Indiana can wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place was not what we had hoped for.     Food was terrible,  service even worse.   This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"It's 420pm on a Wed. and we've been sitting at the upper level with no server in sight.  Empty beer glass and getting ready to walk out.  Horrible"}
{"text":"Christie and Meg M are the sweetest!!! I've been coming here for about a year and they genuinely make me feel right at home. Thanks ladies!!!! Would recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks and Scottsdale were made for each other. After taking a much needed day off with a buddy, we decided to take in Happy Hour at Twin Peaks. I should have known better after being at The Yardhouse DR several months earlier, and seeing the opening team come in for a meeting before they opened. They all looked miserable, and the look of utter contempt on the blonde girl's face is something I'll remember forever.   I digress....  I was dressed in board shorts, t-shirt, and Rainbows. That's how I walked in. I saw a visible sneer on the hostess's face as she looked over my very comfortable, and very functional attire. Forgive me, girly, but before you condescend to my attire consider that I have worked 7 days a week for a year straight, and decided to take a day off at the pool. You're a hostess, not the fashion police.   That sort of set the tone for the place.  We got seated, and it just sort of felt like being in a strip club. Most of the servers look like they hate their lives, and aren't having fun, the manager looks like a sleazebag, and the girls are just there to get tips. The girls' make-up looks like spackle applied with a knockdown knife. And they use fake names. Our server was flat (personality wise, anyways), dry, boring, and pretentious. Honestly, while I love to mess with pretentious snotty servers, I had been at the pool all day, was quite sunburned, and just wanted some cold beers, a little food, and a friendly server.     When I asked what beers they had on tap, she acted like I asked her the formula for the circumference of a circle. I had to get up to go look at the beer selection. And... It's not printed on a menu anywhere. Happy Hour menu is $1 off the beer. Yep. That's it.   So we ordered the BBQ nachos. And two beers. I like cold beer, but when it turns into a beer slushy, I'm not so hip on cold beer. She said the nachos were one of the best things on the menu. REALLY? Ummmmmm. Ok.    This place is a bust. See what I did there? Great big boobies. Great big attitudes. And very little substance. If you're 22, and think you can go hit on a server and score, this is the place to test your game. If you score, you GOTTA post it. I'll bow down at your Alter of Game. If you like good food, good service, and a quality Happy Hour, I can recommend about 5 other places for you. Tilted Kilt is better than this place by a large measure. Four Peaks, a local brewery, would be another solid pick."}
{"text":"After the first review of Twin Peaks, here is an update: The food has really improved with new items on the menu.  The management has changed and things are a lot better than they were before. Overall, I recommend Twin Peaks as long as they keep up the changes.  Original review: I came yesterday with my fiancee and we are regular customers. We would give a solid four stars if we didn't have the bad experience last night.  There are several servers we know after coming quite often and it is just a shame we cannot ask to be served by a server of our choice. We have had great experiences but last night... The service was simply horrible. The server didn't care about us at all, would barely make eye contact, and was more interested in chatting with a few guys only on other tables taking selfies. I had to ask 3 times if we could change the channel of the TV right next to us so I could watch the Women World cup soccer game between USA and Nigeria. I lost 15 minutes of the game before being able to watch it. I finally got it changed after asking one of the servers we know from our previous visits.  A lot of people were there as well for the Basketball game and one of the managers was more interested in seeing us leaving as soon as possible by turning around a couple times and saying out loud \"No, 13 is still here!\". We ordered food and beer but we totally felt pushed and ignored.  At the end, we complained to the manager who kept saying \"Oh... Really!\" multiple times as if we were lying. Then he said, \"I took care of the check for you\", no discount, nothing, barely apologizing. That was very rude. The food has been a great reason we came to Twin Peaks. This has not changed but other places serve great food as well! Better management is needed when it comes to serve customers who are not just a bunch of guys who will leave a big tip because they had a good chat with the server.  By the way, we usually give decent tips (10 dollars is the usual) but last night, our server didn't deserve a penny. Couples are customers as well! David, the previous manager would have never let that happen...  Not sure at all we will come back. But for sure, the experience last night was one star only!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place more than the guys in my group did.  We came here to try to catch a basketball game.  They have Pac 12 for all you college sports followers.  I noticed right away all the exceptionally hot waitresses dressed in lingerie here.  I guess they are normally dressed as sexy lumberjacks, but we stumbled in during lingerie week.  The atmosphere is your typical sports bar, with scantily clad servers.  There is a fire pit and a fireplace out in the patio.  Not a big selection of food to choose from which is fine as long as its good.  I had the poblano chicken sandwich.  It was okay.  The fries were decent enough. I did enjoy my bloody mary and ordered a couple of those.  I love it when a bloody mary has bacon in it.  I was honestly expecting poor service.  But our server was great.  She was super friendly and very efficient.  And yes she was hot.  I actually had fun here, but then again, I did do a couple of shots.  Its pretty much an average place with above average looking girls."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Twin Peaks because I heard great things. Sat upstairs with the great view. Waited about 10-15 minutes for waitress to come to the table. She took drink orders, brought non alcoholic drinks right away. 20-25 minutes later (had not ordered food yet) had not received alcoholic drinks. In the mean time, we saw our tables drink order siting on the bar. Came back to table to take our food order and has no idea about our drinks. We left, bad customer service. My Bloody Mary looked very good, too bad it took so long and couldn't try it."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is actually pretty good.  This location is very pricey, all restaurants on the strip are tho."}
{"text":"Good food, nice waitstaff, they accommodated a group of 20 without a reservation, much nicer then Hooters."}
{"text":"Awesome place to catch a cold beer, get some great food, watch sports all while having GREAT service. Lori was the best bartender/server and an asset to the place."}
{"text":"Hostess/servers are to busy flirting with guys to notice or help anyone.... we waited in the front, and the hostess was to busy flirting with 3 other guys while we just waited and waited until we finally had her attention she asked us upstairs or down though all she was looking at was those 3 guys and that carried on through out the whole time I was there"}
{"text":"I want to meet the red-blooded American who can give Twin Peaks less than 5 stars?!?!  I already had high expectations because some friends had been here shortly after opening and the group of guys had a blast.  Personally, I've never been a fan of the gimmicky-restaurant (Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, Hooters, etc), so I wasn't expecting more than gratuitous T&A with barely-edible food.  I'd much rather go to a hole-in-the-wall dive that has great food and great service.     But then there's Twin Peaks...  We went today for lunch and had a little trouble finding the restaurant...at least the parking.  Twin Peaks is located on the 2nd floor of a building on Harmon & Las Vegas Blvd - right across from Aria.  We ended up parking in Planet Hollywood Casino and walking over.  Not sure whether that's the best option, but I don't believe they have their own parking.  Once we arrived, we were greeted by a few beautiful girls in short-shorts and tiny plaid shirts.  The girls had big smiles and sat us in the awesome patio that overlooks the strip.  We probably had 7-8 different servers (all beautiful girls) stop by our table when walking by, greeting us with smiles, and asking how we were.  The service here was probably the best service I've experienced in years.  No joke.  It could've been 7-8 ugly dudes and it still would've been outstanding service.  The fact that it happened to be a bunch of beautiful ladies...well that's just bonus!!  The food was great as well.  We enjoyed the Blackened Fish Tacos, Buffalo Wings, Steak Sliders, and Smokehouse Burger.  Good portions and delicious food at reasonable prices.    Interestingly there were many groups of ladies who came to the restaurant, which is great because it's not a dude-fest.    I will be back for the food, for the atmosphere, and for the beautiful view!!!  Haha"}
{"text":"Kaely is an amazing server that is full of energy and very fun to be around and amazingly beautiful"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place over looking the strip. Our waitress was an air head but she got her act together as the night went on.   Decent food, try to sit on the third floor over looking the strip next to the glass."}
{"text":"We came here last night around 11pm with a friend but they just passed by us 5 times they wont even serve us! We waited around 20 min its like they never see us. Oh well we went somewhere else instead!"}
{"text":"We came here just because we saw it on Undercover Boss.  We don't have Twin Peaks in California, so we wanted to try it out.    Over all, our visit was ehhh, not so great.  The place is more like a sports bar rather than a restaurant.  Lots, and lots of TV's, really noisy, but a good place for a bunch of guys to hang out I guess.   The service was less than ok.  Our waitress  was not very attentive, didn't seem interested in waiting on us at all.  Maybe because my husband and I came a child, rather than being a group of guys.  There were two tables full of guys less than five feet away from us.  She probably checked on them every five minutes, while we only saw her but two times our whole visit; she took our drink and appetizer order, and brought us our check.  Someone else came and served our food.  She was more interested in visiting with the two groups of guys than actually doing her job.  Or maybe that is job, to only be attentive to the large groups of men entering this establishment, as this place is definitely geared toward \"sex sells\".  Anyway, we were here to have dinner.  We started with an appetizer, which was the pulled pork nachos.  We came with an appetite.  We planned to order dinner, but after the nachos came, there was seriously no need.  The nachos could literally feed five people.  Definitely worth $8.50.  They were really good!  A little different.  I've never had pulled pork in my nachos before.  But good nonetheless.  So, if you plan to come here, and want good service, make sure the majority of your group is of the adult MALE species.  They won't look at you twice if not.  If it wasn't for the good food, I would have only given one star.  If this is how Twin Peaks operates, I won't ever come back.  There are definitely a ton of better places to go to in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time goer to this establishment. I was beyond disappointed. The scantily dressed and way over face product used servers were MORE than incompetent. Waited 12 minutes to be recognized by a \"Hooter's\" wanna be woman. Then another 6 minutes to receive libations. Our server proceed to explain the remedial menu to no avail. When asked if the steak was tough, she rolled her eyes and said \"it should be, unless \"they\" are in a mood\". When the appetizers arrived another server asked \"you want plates?\". NO! We'll all just wear the food! When finished and needed a to - go box AND bag, the bag was forgotten and requested numerous times. Needless to to say the food was almost inedible and the service was terrible. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to twin peaks in concord tonight!the bartenders were Saqueena and Courtney S. They gave excellent service and provided great energy at the bar! The food an drinks were great! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Going to  keep it simple.  Pro's  Atmosphere- very good job. TV's everywhere.   Service-friendly-pretty ladies Beer is definitely cold! Menu is limited. We ordered a variety of stuff that came out ok(bar food).Portions, price ok . We had sandwiches which were fine and a Cobb Salad.    Con's For lasting power in an area with lots of bars and competition they need to cater to the locals- - No Happy Hour - limited menu - No advertised food or drink specials -Not open 24hrs - Pricey for drinks -UFC $10 per person- but they carry it. -limited wine menu-really not much at all and horrible selection. -No pitchers of beer or bottles of wine for purchase. -Football season will be interesting because all other places offer specials during the games.  The splash is now since its new however, I'm confident someone will consider a few of the above. With that said it's worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"I would love to give you more stars. But the waitress has the personality of a dead fish. Sorry to put you out by asking for two separate checks. That doesn't mean you try and charge me $2.75 for a child's $1.00 ice cream. You suck!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply put. Not good. I attentive servers and not up to company standards of appearance"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy hour from 2-6. Sat at the bar and ordered the pork sliders and the quesadillas.  The quesadillas were very good and flavorful with the black bean Pico.  I didnt care for the pork sliders since the bun was dry and we'll ad the meat.  It did come on a very cute plate though.  One thing I didn't like was the service.  We sat at the bar and it was me and my girlfriend and the waitresses did not pay attention to us.  One walked by and saw my friends empty glass and didn't even ask if we wanted another drink.  You can tell these girls just care about tips and boys and don't care about customer service.  I would come back.. But only for the quesadilla... To-go :)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. The servers are very sweet and obviously good looking. But they have yet to get our orders correct.   The first time, we sat at the bar. There were about 10 other people there. It took a solid 5 minutes to be greeted. Once we ordered our food, she read back the wrong order. We corrected her, and the food still came out wrong.   The second time we went with another couple. Again, our server was super sweet, but knew nothing about beer (asked us what a wheat beer is). And, once again, our food came out incorrectly.   It's a great atmosphere. Nice, open space. TVs everywhere (and I mean everywhere). Not too loud. But the service has GOT to get better. I have a feeling they hired a lot of girls with zero service experience, which is fine. But you've got to train them not only on beer basics, but how to take an order correctly."}
{"text":"I just want to leave a comment letting Andy Bayless, Franchise Owner of Twin Peaks know that he doesn't have to respond to every Yelp comment. But GOSH do I hope he responds to mine!"}
{"text":"I went to Twin Peaks for dinner with a friend the last time I was in Las Vegas. A friend of ours recommended this place as a good sports bar with pretty good food and a great atmosphere so we wanted to check it out.  The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived but we did not have to wait at all. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located right on the Strip, which makes it a great stop if you're planning a party night. Unfortunately, the restaurant does not offer parking but you can easily park at one of the casino's nearby.   We share the combo basket and we chose to have the shrimp, chicken, and catfish fried. Even though it was very unhealthy, it was also pretty good for a bar chain meal. It's a pretty great deal if you can share it with someone else. This meal also came with fries which means that we weren't hungry afterwards.   The good thing about this place is its atmosphere and the friendly waitresses. Our waitress in particular was very helpful and friendly.  Overall, my experience with Twin Peaks was very positive and I would recommend it. This is a pretty great sports bar. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"They actually have great drinks and a fair whiskey selection for the connoisseur..... The stone sour is awesome for a cocktail."}
{"text":"I have been in the Phoenix location 4 times now and it is the best sports bar in Arizona. Caroline the manager is the best bar manager in the business. the service, food, dÃ©cor, atmosphere are second to none. I will be back and will suggest the location to anyone asking for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer at Twin Peaks Hendo  Very Awesome and Friendly service. The Manager always comes by each table to say Hi and points out how COLD the Beer is. Happy Hour is the Best!  Must tries: quesadilla's and pork sliders are Yum & Yum  Lots of big TVs inside and outside the patio  The whole restaurant is open floor plan which gives off a great vibe. Everyone has their own table but connected in a one big chill environment We always ask for our favorite waitress before seated. Got to try it!!! You will Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Bottle beer not that cold. Food not that good and sides undercooked or cold. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Great food and good times with Princess and Janese. Good drinks, fun atmosphere. If you're hanging on the strip stop by and have a great break from the heat. Impressive cocktail options with unique twists on classic favorites."}
{"text":"Overall like the place, but got a little irratated when my beer was $7.35 instead of just $7.00, then the girl brought me $2.00 change on a ten, when I asked here to check the change she looked at me like I had some nerve!! Then she brings me $0.50 back and said they don't have dimes or nickels, REALLY!!....Dingbats you better get that part straighten out if you want me back, that goes for the managemnet too."}
{"text":"This is your typical sports bar.  Lots of TVs (even some of the booths have their own built in TVs) and lots of waitresses.  They have an extensive bar for sitting and mixing, but their beer menu was highly lacking, mostly consisting off the macro Budweisers and the such.  They also did not show prices of mixed drinks on their menu, which is always a huge pet peeve for me.  If you're looking to watch a game, you can find worse than Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the facility and the staff at the Las Vegas location above the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile, the entrance is outside off the street. Everyone was very friendly, the food was very good, and there is not a bad seat in the house to watch a sporting event. I will definitely return here on all my upcoming trips."}
{"text":"Had a few beers there with some friends. Very packed. Seemed like a nice place. Food was tasty. Waitresses are pretty sexy."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a bite to eat and watch a game on the multitude of tv screens.  Due to the scantily clad female servers, not a place to bring kids, and I wouldn't choose it as a date location (although my wife is not offended going here).  The food is good, but not great.  So far, this is exactly the same review I've given to The Tilted Kilt, and the two locations are very similar in terms of atmosphere.  There are two important differences between the two.  First, the menu is much less extensive here than at the Kilt, but the food which is served is better here, and much more plentiful.  Second, the set-up for watching sports activities is much better at Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now and each time it's fantastic! The atmosphere, people and food are great. The happy hours have great prices, the management is top notch and they really do take care of their customers. If you're looking for a great sports bar than this is it! I've been all over the valley to different sports bars and pubs, not many can stand up to this one. Try the grilled wings or the new 6 ounce burgers, medium rare please. Be sure and say hello to some of the wonderful staff such as Dana, Karissa, Rochelle, Bianca, Kimmy, Mercedes, Janie, and the other beautiful gals are awesome!"}
{"text":"today was first time ever been to twin peaks !!! i get there no one had a clue what was going on ! servers  didnt know happy hour specials ...half of these servers were underage and couldnt bring your beers ... so confusion set in .. bills were overcharged ... i was there for 4 hours and i did not see one manager walk around and ask how things were going ... place is 2  weeks old that should of been first thing they should of been doing ! very dissapointed ! will not be visiting anytime soon will keep my biz at buffaloe wild wings ..."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to watch sporting events since they have a bunch of televisions. Food is edible and the beer is super cold.   Wait staff has always been a little slow, and we've been here many times. We've been here during busy times and slow, and the wait staff has always been just a little behind. They've always been very friendly albeit, but we've always felt like we've waited way longer than we should have for food and drinks.  Oh well, it'll still be our bar of choice for the ALCS match ups nonetheless."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on Friday around 12:15. Seated right away.  Friendly faces. A little louder than I expected but tolerable. We sat in booth near back of restaurant.  Table had its own TV, which was pretty cool. Started with chips and queso for appetizer.  Cheese seemed a little runny or watered down, but had great flavor. Chips were salty just the way I like em. Had chicken ranch sandwich which had good flavor too. Chicken was a little flat. The bun was way too much. Had to lose the bread and just eat the chicken filet. Better than the burger imo."}
{"text":"Been to several Twin Peaks restaurants. This one definitely hits the target. It was their opening week so I was a little concerned. However the staff did not disappoint. Too many staff actually. But would rather have too many than too few. Service was spot on. Greeters at the door. Lots of servers and managers. They have several bars to choose from. One in the center area and one off to the side that is actually an indoor/outdoor bar. Plenty of bartenders. Plenty of T.V.s to watch. Had the queso and chips as an appetizer. It was as good as I remember it from other TPs. Ordered grilled chicken fingers for dinner. They were a little over done but ok. I will come back. I hope it stays this way with great service and great food. Bartenders were Kimberly and Cheyenne. They were awesome.  The only negative I could see was the parking lot. They share it with the adjacent olive garden. And the parking lot itself is about the size of a postage stamp. Have to park in nearby mall lot. See you all next time."}
{"text":"Jasmine was the best, they are so helpful and had great customer service, the kids loved the rock wall!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and the service and atmosphere was amazing! Our server Shelby was extremely attentive and friendly! She went out of her way to find a copper mug for my mule! All around great experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After watching Under Cover Boss my husband and I were excited to try this Twin Peaks. The CEO seemed genuine and we are for business that are ran with heart. We went to get a table and the hostest first off had an attitude and was rolling her eyes. Then we found out there is a $35 min. Per person. We left. They did not get our business today and more than likely neither will any other chain based on first experience."}
{"text":"The manager came to our table and made sure it was a very happy birthday. He offered to buy our current round of shots or the next. Plus, our TP girl is awesome! Thanks for the birthday assist, Twin Peaks!"}
{"text":"When people in your group leave the restaurant,  it's a bad experience.  Someone recommended us to try Twin Peaks for our annual dinner after renaissance festival for my pirate group because there's lots of space. I think we came on a bad night and the manager on duty, Dawn, was not the most accommodating.   We made reservations for 20 and a few extra showed up which ended up being an issue. As our party trickled in, we filled up our assigned tables and we started to sit at additional table next to us. I was not the organizer and didn't engage in conversations with the manager, but the gist of what I heard was first someone had that table reserved, but they couldn't tell us when that party was coming. Then we were told there wasn't enough servers to cover our section and they were short staffed so our overflow couldn't sit there. As a result, three members of our group left. That's money leaving the restaurant. After, that happened they said we could use the table and they finally assigned another waitress to help with our overflow, but by then it was too late. There are several issues here.  They should have assigned more than one person to our group to begin with. If the table was an issue, they could have suggested that some of our group go to the bar and order which wasn't too far away. And the manager should have been helping the one waitress assigned to us. I only saw her come over when someone wanted to talk to a manager. She was not accommodating to our group at all and that's bad since we all spend money on drinks and food. That's a lot of money coming into the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  I am a patient person and thought maybe once we were settled service would get better. It didn't. With a large group, I'm surprised waters weren't brought out to everyone to start while drink orders were taken. I managed to get my free chips and queso for checking in. That came out before my beer which probably took 20-30 minutes. So I had chips, but no drink at all for a while. Some group members started to go to the bar to get drinks because of the slow service. It took a while to order food. It did not come out all at the same time and when it did food runners didn't know who had what so every order was shouted out loud. And some people got refills, but it was wrong like sweet tea instead of unsweet. I could tell our waitress was frustrated from the beginning and even though she smiled you could tell it was a forced smile. I think it came down to management and not assigning a more experienced person or additional servers to our group.   The only redeeming quality was the food was better than what I expected. The queso had a nice kick of chipotle and it was smooth and creamy. The chips were oily. I also got smoked wings in jalepeno butter sauce and a side salad with cilantro vinegrette.  I loved the wings. They were tender and the jalapeno butter was a sweeter sauce than I expected. I wish it were a little spicier because it was listed as a spicy sauce. Their wings also can be ordered fried and battered and fried. I liked the salad. Some pieces of lettuce were too big , but they add cilantro to it making it more refreshing and the cilantro vinegrette was a delightful addition.   For me, it was an unpleasant experience and most of my group. My impression was slow service and bad management. Hopefully it's better for smaller parties, but I do not recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"Large restaurant in a great location. I have been twice and prefer the top level  where it is open and you have a strip view. Staff is friendly. Menu is lacking. They really, really should add some more variety to the menu. The pork nachos for example, why not have a chicken version? They do have chicken on the menu, so just makes no sense to me, i'm pretty sure people would order it. The pork nachos we had was $12 bucks and lacked a decent amount of pork, piled high with nachos and very , very messy to eat as the nachos keep falling off the tiny plate they serve it on. The burgers and fries are good. Overall a great place to get a beer, eat a burger and watch sports. They just really need to add a better variety of food to the menu. For an outdoor themed restaurant, with all the damn stuffed deer and moose heads mounted to the wall, they should at least offer a rib entree?. The price for the wings is way ridiculous, pretty much a $1 a wing, whatever."}
{"text":"Came here today to watch some college football. Place wasn't packed which I love. Was sat and waited almost 10 minutes, still no sever greeted us. Had go up to host stand and ask manager if they were short staffed? Saw people being sat after us being served??  She had a server come over within 1 min and comped our wins appetizer for the inconvenience. The way the GM handled it was appreciated. Will be back with my group. The servers were friendly and checked back regularly. Food getting better here. Had the NEW guacamole burger with bacon. Delicious. Fries were a little under cooked but made the best of it. Great place to eat and watch sports. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Menu is actually kinda lacking. Variety is weak. I got a burger and liked it. Prices are ok. The girls are mostly cute and half naked. They are VERY young. Been there twice and both girls were 20. Would be nice to have a better variety of mid to upper 20's. The servers have no real dress code as one girl was running around dressed as a balerina and the others dressed in garters and lingerie? These girls are 1 step away from being strippers.  I think it would look better if they all wore the khaki shorts with the plaid shirt top.   The atmosphere is cool, TV's at each booth. Service was ok, I ordered a beer and waitress forgot it. The person i was with ordered the venison chile and that never came out. It's a coin flip for me between here and tilted kilt."}
{"text":"Stopped by Twin Peaks for an early dinner during my recent trip to Las Vegas. My boyfriend had been to the one in Houston but it was my first time. I'm a fan of breaded bone-in wings and love Hooters so wanted to see how these compared. I got the sweet chili wings and an order of fried pickles. My boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak sandwich with fries. Our food came out and the cheesesteak meal looked amazing! My boyfriend said it was really good. The wings were great but when they came out I was missing the pickles. I flagged down our waitress and she apologized and said that she forgot to ring them in. It was nice that she owned up to her mistake so I won't dock them there. I still wanted the pickles so I agreed to wait. They came out a few minutes later and were really good. All in all a solid experience but nothing amazingly over the top. Typical bar food but I would visit again."}
{"text":"We were so impressed with the service, food, and atmosphere at this location that we ate here twice on our trip. Our first visit we were waited in by 2 adorable twins at the bar. They were attentive and personable. We ordered The Hangover Burger, and it was delicious. Our second visit was on game day Sunday. Great atmosphere, great manager, great service. Their Dirty Blonde beer is top notch. This is a must stop in Vegas. Don't forget to bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This was my first time really hearing about  Twin Peaks! It is definitely a men cave with tons of tvs for sports and staff confidently showing their peaks and valleys. However it is not too overly done so women are quite comfortable as well. There isn't a huge food selection but what they do offer and present are far beyond the cost. I ordered the Fish Tacos while my fellow foodies has chicken & shrimp and a chicken dish. Everything was prepared and presented well. O was pleasantly surprised with the quality as the prices were very affordable. All in all... We will be visiting again. Especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"First time i have been here. Decided to come because i had read the reviews from other yelpers. Had been shopping all day was in the area and wanted to catch the last half of a football game and have an ice cold micro brew. The brew was awesome and cold. My server Tina was on the ball , she really took care of us even tho this is suppose to be a man cave(as usual i was on an adventure with mom, which is always fun). We decided to split the fish tacos(always my favorite)because we heard they were so good (dissappointed) were not that good. We mentioned it to Tina and she had David the manager come over right away and he took care of the problem. we switched to the chicken tacos and they were awesome. We will deffinetly go back. Loved the service. Thank you Tina for your service. Thank you David for taking care of the problem. BTW We do not find the servers outfit offensive or riskay at all. They were very cute."}
{"text":"Well, what else can I say that hasn't been said in previous reviews?    I am a Twin Peaks first timer also; there aren't any in the Northeast yet. Hopefully they will expand there soon.  I've been in the area for about 2 weeks due to work and have been coming to Twin Peaks almost every day after work to relax and watch the games.  It's amazing how many TV's are inside.    The food is great, not just your typical bar food.  Definitely try the pot roast, it is pretty good.    The place has a fun \"cabin-like\" vibe to it. The girls are a real treat to see, I cannot complain about their looks.  They are some of the most attractive girls I've seen in a while.  I happened to stroll in for the first time during Halloween and all the girls are dressed up in very sexy costumes, real eye candy.  Most of the girls are super nice and will strike up a conversation.  I've had a few different waitresses during my visits, all were great and attentive.  I think I had Hannah two or three times now and she is definitely my favorite so far; she really took the time to get to know her customers, a huge plus in my book.  Thanks Hannah!  All in all, this place is great place to sit back, drink ice cold beers and unwind.  I will definitely be there again today and anytime I'm in the Scottsdale area, a visit to Twin Peaks will be a must."}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are awesome, and the food is always fresh. Thanks, ladies! #humpdaaayyy #jackieandshak"}
{"text":"First and foremost our twin peaks ambassador KAT was outstanding and got our  tourist party started properly! A really fun and engaging experience. Also... SHOT SKI SHOT SKI!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overall impressed with this place. The menu is very small. I had a poblano chicken sandwich, it was alright. Their fries was pretty good though, I liked the seasoning they use. I really like that the beer comes out super cold and icy. The service was not great at all, they just hire pretty girls to work there, probably with no experience at all. I think maybe on a weekend, the place might have a fun environment, but I went on a Sunday afternoon and it seemed pretty dead in there. I probably will never go in there again."}
{"text":"Oh Twin Peaks... These girls were not hired for skill. It's almost like they were too air headed for Hooters so try were hired here. Ok I get the theme. And I must say that's pretty cute, great concept. But this is a local spot meaning the slutty outfits arent gong to excuse your lack of skill and knowledge for long . Here are two conversations that actually happened last night...  First Bartender- hi! Welcome to ..... Twin Peaks .she obviously forgot what the place was called.   Me- hello I'll take a scotch and soda with a twist Bartender- I don't know if we have that She stands and stares at me Me- ok could you possibly check? She leaves and comes back 5 minutes later Bartender- what kind of soda do you want Me- just soda water Bartender- oh like sparkling water? Me- that would be great She leaves comes back after talking to every bartender there Bartender- I'm sorry we don't have lemon twists Me- do you have a lemon wedge? Bartender umm let me check ...is this real life... She comes back with a lime wedge and a bourbon and water. I figured that was close enough so I head over to the table to join my group. (i was the late arrival since I was coming from work and I figured going to the bar to get a drink would have been faster since my bf informed me of their slow service at the table)  My second conversation was with our waitress.  Waitress- can I get you any drinks? Me- do you by chance have Pinot Noir here? I knew it was a long shot but I figured there had to be at least one red wine here Waitress- ummm  Me- pinot noir is a red wine Waitress- ohh! No, all we have is canyon red.  Me- that's a red wine? Waitress- yea that's what the bottle says Me- ok I'll take a glass please. We waited about 10 minutes and the waitress came back to tell me a manager had to \"get the bottle open\" so it would be right out. Don't order wine here btw, words can't describe how disgusting it is.   Bartenders that don't know what scotch or a lemon twist is. A waitress that didn't know there are more then one type of red wine and a whole restaurant that doesn't know how to open a bottle of wine. Good luck Twin Peaks... Good luck.   Btw what's up with the random girls walking around to give out \"free hugs\" I wonder what they'll put on their resume for future jobs.  Skills: friendly, outgoing, great hugger   Smh Smh Smh Smh Smh ok now I'm dizzy."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place I like the vibe they have. Food was really good and the servers are cute and friendly :)  only bad thing I have to say is our server Renee seems like she didn't wanna be here or something. I think only reason she checked on us was to refill our waters, didn't really ask how we were. Her answers were pretty short and didn't even smile. Not a big deal but she didn't say happy Father's Day to my dad :/"}
{"text":"Better the Hooters  The food was great. I had a surf and turf platter. The steak was cooked perfectly and the skrimps (lol) had a nice flavor. Skip the mashed taters...boring.   The service was great, she was really attentive.   They will upsell you the dessert and swag. We bought a calender for the young man in our group. There are some great coupons on the pages. ahhhemmm no really there are coupons.   The building was not a strict man only type place. I would bring my kids here."}
{"text":"Officially - meh.  There was nothing bad.  Service was acceptable.  Food was OK.  We did have to explain our drink orders to the wait staff when she took our order.  Nothing complicated, but when you order a Bourbon & Coke or a Vodka Soda, the name of the beverage is also the recipe - shouldn't be too hard.  I shouldn't be training hem on how to make a Vodka Soda - Its vodka, and club soda.  I know a lot of the allure of a place like this is the skimpy dressed ladies.  They do have an attractive wait staff if that is what you are going for, but I'm past all that.  It adds little to my experience and the conversations feel a little like forced flirtation.  Really, I just want a burger and a drink with out having to conduct a class on how drinks are poured and burgers are made."}
{"text":"Still our favorite place for dinner and game-watching! Never disappoints; consistent food, drinks, and service.  Still the best game-watching local spot. We've tried other places but keep coming back for the good food on the updated menu, reasonably priced drinks, great music and sports!"}
{"text":"Kinda like an upgraded version of Hooters. Service was good considering I came in during peak hours. Had the turkey burger which was okay, but nothing special. Definitely recommend a side of Mac and cheese with whatever you get. I really like the knotty brunette house brew."}
{"text":"Definitely and mans type food spot. Upgraded hooters in terms of waitresses and food. Had the steak salad that was excellent. The customer service was awesome. TVs all over the place. Great place to watch a game and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Great location just next to planet Hollywood and across from the Bellagio. Has a manly wood tavern feel. The servers and bartenders are beautiful women! Food selection is ok but the atmosphere makes up for it. Amazing spot to grab a beer. Try racing the girls up the rock wall if you dare!!!"}
{"text":"A very diverse menu...from Mom's style pot roast to awesome looking burgers!  And the girls young enough to be my granddaughter's are very sweet, especially Haley in Scottsdale who was our waitress!  And the queso with venison chili dip was awesome!!  And tv screens everywhere."}
{"text":"I LOVE Twin Peaks! Regardless of what anyone says, I went for the FOOD!! ;-) The girl who took care of me, Carley, was very beautiful and friendly. The atmosphere is nice and the food really was great! I was hesitant when my buddies told me where we were going because I was disappointed with my first and only experience at Hooters. In the end, I was happy I went!"}
{"text":"Great service from Kat and Genesis at the bar. Draft beer selection is good, but I have to admit the menu is a bit lacking. Overall, my buddy and I had a good time and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Twin Peaks!!! The Beer is the coldest, so delicious and refreshing..  Food is Bomb!   Chloe, our server rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch it was not crowded, we got seated right away. Waited 15min and nothing no water, no hello, NOTHING! We got up and left and the hosted wished us a great day. Went across the parking lot and ate at Honey Pig that was amazing and great service."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is where we go when we watch UFC fights. It was packed as usual. We waited about 25 mins for a table for four which isn't bad. Our server was nice. We had beers and ordered chicken tenders. Chicken tenders took exactly one hour and  ten minutes. We followed up several times and seemed like the server forgot. She did say the kitchen was busy. I'll still be back of course but maybe just order drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. I had the pot roast, and good lord, it exceeded my expectations! Shawna is an amazing server!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Came here with a group of people from work.  I had a half glass of iced tea and stayed for about 30 mins but during initial greetings and service, I was pleased with their friendly service.  I came in with them to make sure they get started.  Next day I found out how much drink they had, I am sure they really had a great time.  Since we came in as a large group, they set us up at the outside patio.  Patio allows for smoking.  Although we were outside, and I only stayed for 30 mins, my hair smelled like smoke when I left.  If they want to come back again, I will make a phone call to make reservation but I won't be accompanying them unless we get table inside without any cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"I was with seven other people and at first we were having a hard time being seated by the hostess. When we were finally seated one of the girls came up to us and said, \"Uh, did you talk to a hostess about sitting here?\" And after I told her yes she disappeared in the direction of the hostess stand. We were then greeted by a manager who told us we needed to find some place else to sit. Some of the people I was with were fed up and they decided to leave. We moved at sat at the bar and it was the best decision we made. We had very prompt and friendly service by Amber and Priscilla. I ordered the wings with a side of fries and my boyfriend also order a side of the fries cheese (mozzarella cubes) everything was so good. Since I moved here I have been looking for a place with crispy meaty wings and they definitely have that!  I know many people are tourists that come to these sports bars and they are quick to write a bad review because they weren't seated right away or god forbid they were accidentally given fries instead of chips. Relax, if you're on vacation act like it. Please come try this place out and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Man-sized beers. This is a place I like to come for a beer or two, catch some sports and enjoy the scenic views. But it is not a place where I want to eat. The food hardly meets average bar food standards. Also, the last time I went, they had taken a couple of good craft beers off tap, and replaced them with some more generic, everyday beers, which disappoints me. Good beer should also not be served in an ice-cold glass, but the ice-cold glasses are part of the shtick, so I enjoy it anyway."}
{"text":"I popped in here for a late night dinner and they hit the spot. The place is pretty cheerful,  like the love child of a sports bar and a log cabin. The menu is pretty limited but they serve late, so I enjoyed yummy fried mozzarella bites, grilled trout and a side salad, washed down by a dirty blonde. Everything was good-not GREAT but good value for what you get in my opinion.  AND I got a happy hour prices on the mozzarella bites and my dirty blonde.  There are tons of tvs so this is great place to catch your favorite sports game. The talent here is FAR superior than either Tilted Kilt or Hooters (even when school is in session). The talent working on this particular wren beautiful and very warm and funny so this is not a bad place to check out by any means."}
{"text":"I just saw it and camr in at open. The service is super nice and on top of that they got an indoor rock climbing rig. Go fig! Shoot may wanna climb it before you eat a meal. There menu is very diverse so be prepared to take your time. Ask for Vanessa, she's super sweet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed meeting our friends here.  The place is pretty new,when I saw the sign that said scenic views I thought wth how can there be senic views at this location?  Then we stepped inside and saw my my friend John picked the place.  There icy cold beer and the large number of tv screens of course."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken quesadilla...get extra salsa or sour cream or your choice sauce tho cuz they kinda skimp on it! Totally recommend you stop here on a shopping break! The chicken wings are decent too. But...it's soooo backwards, don't get confused if you have to go in through the patio in order to reach the front hostess...I think I've only found that entrance convenient once....psst it was when the boyfriend was driving haha!"}
{"text":"I finally found a friend to check this place out with me on my lunch break yesterday.  She didn't know what she was in for but I knew she was an open-minded, up for anything type of gal.  I had been to the restaurant when it was Earls so I was shocked when we walked in and the place looked absolutely nothing like it's previous establishment.  The vibe is set as an outdoorsy/hunting/sports bar.  The girls are adorable and they have cute lumberjack tops, daisy dukes, and an assortment of boots.  Once we were settled in we looked around to see we were the only girls dining at the time.  It wasn't uncomfortable for us though which is extremely important.  I think the atmosphere is fun and a definite stop for happy hour soon.  I ordered the philly and she had the fish tacos.  My philly was excellent but I will most likely try something along the burger lines next time.  She couldn't stop ravings about the tacos so I assume they were pretty good.  I would recommend checking this place out when you can have a few beers and enjoy the patio.  Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be dragging more friends here."}
{"text":"We went there tonight so on a Tuesday night.  We were seated promptly by one of the hostesses that greeted us.  The place is pretty noisy and hard to have a conversation even in a booth with the person across the table.  The server Kat came to our table very quickly and took our drink order.    I ordered a Cazadores Margarita on the rock with salt rim...which came extremely shaken to the point that it was foamy.  Kinda odd.  We ordered the Pork sliders with side of tomato soup, the Smokehouse Burger and Fries.  The place wasn't very busy but the food took at least 20-30 minutes.  When the order finally came to the table...the pork in the sliders looked like they scraped the last of the pulled pork that was overdone from cooking all day.  The fries were old and cold.  As the server asked us if there was anything else we needed...we told her about the fries which she took away promptly.  Half way through the burger the manager came to our table and asked how everything was.  We told him about the fries and how long it has been and he quickly went to the kitchen and came back immediately with fresh fries.   I didn't finish my 3rd of 3 sliders, tomato soup was very mediocre, and my wife didn't eat the other half of the burger because it was so greesy and the bun was now wet.    Other than the nice and very beautiful servers...this place is horrible.  Bad Food and Poor Drinks.  Why spend $$ on a bad experience.  We will not return."}
{"text":"High end hooters.  You're looking at the next generation of strippers and nightclub cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  I don't mind."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Food is decent.  I was here on Super Bowl Sunday and it was packed.  I'd consider it again as a place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Love spending My Tuesday lunches at twin peaks Henderson!! Renee is awesome very sweet and attentive server, she's my favorite !!"}
{"text":"Being the Towne & Country Center during a weekend during a peak hour, the parking was kind of scarce. Later on, that clears up.   We went inside and were seated immediately...I asked for a booth and we received a booth. There was plenty of seating available. I guess they weren't that super busy. The waitress said that they get really busy during fight nights and such...makes sense.   Girls: Cute Clothes: Scantily clad Satisfaction: Decent  The place was quite cavernous inside. It kind of seemed like it was decorated by whoever decorates Cabela's to be honest. I didn't mind. There was also flat panel LCD TVs everywhere. Also, there were small 15\" TVs on each booth. Quite convenient.   Now, as far as the food and service. It was stated that the happy hour was from 4-7PM. It's like $2 off draft beer and appetizers, if I remember correctly. I asked for the chicken tenders and chips and dip since I already ate pizza beforehand. I got a Angry Orchard since when I rarely drink beer, I prefer a cider for the crisp, sweet taste. Friend got a hangover burger for his hangover.   The food came relatively fast. It was a few minutes for the beer, another 10 minutes or so for the appetizers, and then another 5 minutes after that for the burger. The burger was good he said. I ate the chicken tenders, fries, chips and cheese dip and they were very good. The cheese solidified quite fast though.   The service wasn't bad. Wasn't great either though. Our waitress seemed like she tried her best but didn't come around as much as I figured she would. We were there for like an hour and a half and she came around like 3-4 times even though there wasn't many customers. In any which case, the bill came and it was like $23 for two people. I figured that wasn't that bad.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again but more than likely it would have to be happy hour again."}
{"text":"Good food for the money. Way better than I expected. Our gal was AMAZING. Would've have them 5 stars but the bread pudding had raisins."}
{"text":"Horrible food, mgmt rather gawk over the 17 year old staff members than actually help you... good luck having a good experience..."}
{"text":"we tried this place for our fantasy football draft party. they supply a small board that is different from other boards. but its free and small, which is good because there were no high walls to use. You had to out them on the table, which was not cool. they slid some tables together so all was good... Food is really good and fairly priced. The draft goodies were cheap trinkets and the nachos they supplied was one order, although it said they would supply throughout the draft. The girls all looked completely miserable. I mean every.single.one.  they were hard to find at times and none of them looked they wanted to be there. This happened both times we visited. None of them smiled, like ever. Tilted Kilt girls are always happy, but this place was actually a downer. One girl looked like she was 10 years old and everyone was making comments about her. One guy mentioned it looked like her daughter....yuck...Now for the totally gross part. There were two really old guys there sitting in a side booth. Two of the girls spent very long times sitting in the booth looking like they were ordered to do so. Then it happened...one of the old 60 year old guys starting massaging the girl with neck and shoulder rubs. This went on for about 10 minutes. Not sure if he was the owner or a pimp, but the one getting massaged look like she hated every single second of it. It was straight up disgusting. The manager was very helpful, but he looked miserable too. This place needs to be looked into by the labor board or something. I have never seen a place with such miserable employees. Such a shame. As for football drafts....try someplace else or you can stay here, but you are on a time limit. if you are on a tight time limit. Two stars for food but i hope those girls find someplace else, because something about that place isn't right. I guess giving massages to the staff is part of the benefit package? Or is it?"}
{"text":"Sports bar and restaurant similar to a hooters. Has lots of tvs for watching sports and they have a good selection of beer. They have a digital thermometer above the bar that tells you how cold the beer is on tap. It fluctuates through the day so you can time it to get cold beer. The food was ok. Typical bar food. The fries were cold and weren't that good.  You come here to watch sports though not for the food. It was a very rainy and cold day so there weren't many people there for NFL games. Overall was a little disappointed at least in this location after people hyped it up to me. Maybe will try another location such as the one in Vegas with a rock wall in it."}
{"text":"I love twin peaks! Mainly because of the freeeeeeezing beer that I crave like crazy! The girls are always nice to us and the service is fast. I think only one time the girl took forever to come to our table. But they just opened so ya know.... Try the freezing beer :)"}
{"text":"1st time here and I had the Moscow Mule, Green Chile Chicken Soup and Cobb Salad.   *Waitress is super friendly  *Lively atmosphere  *Food is alright and inexpensive  My 2 thumbs up..."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here with friends Sunday and sat upstairs, there's a great open feel and view of the strip! What a blast! Lots of TV's, super nice, smokin hot waitresses and freezing cold beer! We had the pulled pork nachos and pork sliders, both were delish!  Love all the T and A but it would be nice for us ladies if they'd put some hot bar backs or expediters though...then I would give 5 stars! :D"}
{"text":"I first of all found it odd that a place would open up called Twin Peaks when there is a 4 Peaks around the corner.  A bunch of us decided to give it a try for happy hour & it was ehhh at best.   Visually inside it is nice with the cabin feel and young girls in next to nothing. But the bartenders were weak, food was nothing to go back for and it felt like a JV team at best. But also taking in to consideration it did just open and the girls are not hired based on performance.   The only thing it did have going for it was the people watching.  With a ratio of 1 girl to every 5 middle aged dbag it made for good entertainment."}
{"text":"Fun place. Our waitress was very fun and we enjoyed chatting with friends and enjoying the scenery."}
{"text":"We went for the UFC on November 12th. The reserved table we paid for was not ready and the asst. manager had to remove people from our table and they were not happy. Then the table was dirty and we had to ask the server to clean off the table and wipe it. Then she was only over to our table about every 25 minutes. The food was fine. They sell so many standing room only tickets for the UFC that people stand directly in front of you with their backs touching our backs and pushing on our chairs. A group of people start to argue and get ready to fight, the bartenders, waitresses and managers do nothing to stop it, and MANY staff seen what was happening. The people involved in the fights were over-served by the bartenders and were drunk. When a brawl starts with punches flying and a table top being broken off the pedestal, security takes way too long to get to the fight, in fact they were so slow that customers took the guys down and held them on the floor. Then security gets to the fight and they let the guys argue and continue to fight with each other instead of removing them from the situation. After they finally take out the guy that starts the fight, 10 minutes later he is back into the restaurant again. The sound on the system was too low and you weren't able to hear the UFC. When i called the general manger the next morning to tell them how pissed i was that we paid $40 for four of us to watch the UFC and had a terrible time she said (and i quote) i can talk to you if you make it quick because I'm trying to get the TV's turned on. I said I'm pissed about last night. She then said \"about what\". I said don't you know you had a brawl in your restaurant. She said ya i know there was a brawl, and then she said (and i quote) what's your problem? I said they were over capacity and handled the brawl terribly. She said (and i quote) we weren't over capacity and i don't have time to get into it right now because I'm trying to get the restaurant ready. I told her don't worry about it, i will call corporate and tell them about it. They WERE very over capacity, very unprofessional, and obviously don't know how to run a restaurant or handle customer complaints. I am a former general manager of restaurants myself as were two others at our table and we are very disappointed at the Twin Peaks manager and some of the staff. I guess that is why when you go to Twin Peaks Henderson on any day that there is not a UFC or football game going on the place is not busy at all. I will not be back as they DO NOT care about their customers."}
{"text":"Chelsey is one of the best servers in town!  Great food, best place to watch any sports game in town!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another place, food is ok! Nothing spectacular, is that loud that you can't talk. I had the feeling that I was in another hooters."}
{"text":"Food is average at best.  Third time here and the peaks are the only attraction.  Way better than hooters.  Plenty of tv's to watch the games.  Great location.  Don't make a special trip for the food"}
{"text":"First time at this place, heard good things about it so figured I would check it out. Went during lunch, was busy but got right in. The service was not the best to be honest, server either had too many tables or just did not Cole around often enough, food took a while to get out and we ended up getting the wrong nachos ( ordered chicken but got steak) didn't say anything because we were here in our lunch break. Portions were good size, food wasn't that bad, just wish the service was better."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both to eat & watch UFC fights. The first time, I would've gave my experience 5 stars. The cover for the event was that you have to purchase a minimum of $30 per person in food/ drinks. I loved that because it makes sense & ended up spending $50 myself, not including tip.   The second time they charged $35 at the door, not including food/ drinks. That may be normal for most places, but it's BS & the only reason I came back was because I had liked their process before. So this time, I barely ordered anything & will not be coming back for the fights.   They said the process changes based on the fight card. However, PPV prices don't change, so...? No thanks.   Outside of that gripe, it's not better or worse than any other chain restaurant I've been to out here. The servers are great though."}
{"text":"I found Heaven.... and it's called \"Twin Peaks.\"  I landed at the airport and was picked up by a couple of buddies. It was a Monday night and I told them I was starving. They said they knew just the place. A short drive later we went to Twin Peaks.  I asked the buddies what type of place this was and they said comfort food and bar. I walked in and it looked like a huge log cabin.  I looked around and the servers were classy but definitely showing assets.  I asked my buddies why they called this place \"Twin Peaks\" thinking with the mountain theme and such, it's based upon a region. They gave me that, \"Are you that stupid\" look and I quickly realized what an idiot I was.  Twin Peaks,, servers wearing tight shirts, duh.. ok, ok, I get it. Even tho the girls were showing what they have, it was done in a classy way. I refuse to go to Hooters because it's sort of trashy, from the servers to the food. This place shows all others you can have both, great food, sexy servers and still be classy where families can come.  I ordered a cold brew and their venison chili. Both great. Chicken wings and everything else ordered was awesome. The prices were also impressive. Can't say enough about this place.  I discovered they have one in vegas which I will make sure I visit next time I am there.  TV's were everywhere and wish they had a place like this near where I live."}
{"text":"The food and refreshments were great. The servers need a bit more work. Over the course of our meal we had 4 different servers with only a couple mix up with our orders. Over all the experience was good. Again, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great soup...try the Green Chili Chicken soup to make up for a rough night in Vegas. The Greek salad with steak is a good choice as well.  Nicole and Salina rocked the bar!!"}
{"text":"The Food was pretty good and the girls are so pretty.  The service is great , We normally get there at 8:30 and starving but thanks to the fast service we get to eat quick."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago.  I tried the pot roast and it was surprisingly good.  The employees behind the bar were all polite and friendly.  I normally go to higher end restaurants so am used to good service.  The only thing that unnerved me was that both of our plates sat in front of us for 15 mins after we were done.  I even pushed our plates in towards the bartenders to show we were done.  The bartenders walked by our dirty plates at least 12 times and no one even thought to pre-bus.  What kind of bartender doesn't pre-bus after they have been done for over 10 mins.  I will not go back because of that."}
{"text":"4 of us stopped in on a Saturday during peak nfl playoffs. It was packed, and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table.   Not too bad, considering the little bar across the hall. They had $2 coronas to keep us busy! Once we were buzzed for our table, we were seated promptly.   The beer really is ice cold, and the food is pretty good. I'd recommend the nachos... They're huge!   We have a few TP here in Houston too, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if the app would allow it. 2nd time here and both times were exceptionally bad service. I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they had one crappy, dishonest waitress the first time, so I came back, but no, the 2nd time was even worse. Rude, inattentive, forgetful,  and slow service staff. It has been the worst two dining experiences I've had in the last few years since moving to Vegas."}
{"text":"I read all the party comments, but want to give another perspective. My friend and I come here to just hang out for a couple hours most days we visit Vegas. We are tennis fanatics and this is the only place near us that has tennis channel.  So let me get to it, the service is outright AMAZING! The timing, the extra care given to hear preferences, and just the fun - over the top. The food is excellent bar food. The music at lunch is loud enough to enjoy, but you can still talk over it. Individual TVs in the booths and a bank of other ones to watch. And of course the umm other view is amazing."}
{"text":"This entire company exists as a cautionary reminder that man (or woman) cannot live by T&A alone.  I'd offer you something witty and insightful about the food and drink if I was ever served. Instead, after 20 minutes of being actively ignored by a parade of sorority stereotype nightmares masquerading as professional bartenders, I abandoned the mostly empty breastaurant in frustration.  But perhaps Twin Peaks is not to blame--after all, I'm the fool who chose to stop by."}
{"text":"I like that the beer on tap is 30 degrees or colder.  The choice of beer mugs is a bit lame - you can have the baby size at 10oz or the larger 22oz.  A 16oz would be nice.    The waitresses are all cute but it's expected from a place that bills itself as a breastaurant.  Food is pretty weak even by bar food standards.  Lots of TVs if you want to watch the game."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good, service was great,  Britney was the best, we had a blast. Can't wait to do it again, want to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Our waitress Amanda is great! Foods good and there are multiple tv's playing Sunday night foot ball as will as others games. The main issue is that on the commercials they play music and then at this location the woman in charge of turning the games sound back on is to busy fucking around to turn it back to the games sound and the cliental has to yell several times  and wave at her to get it turned on. Tonight's management is not paying attention to what's going on, even when it happens in front of them."}
{"text":"the wait staff is amazing, friendly, efficient, able to keep the drinks filled and  great looking too!  BUT, the back staff (kitchen staff) can't seem to prepare food in a reasonable amount of time or correctly. Went for lunch and we left because after 35(or more) our food had not arrived, it wasn't busy (I know why now) only about a third of the tables had people at them and most only two people. As we got up to leave the manager came over and told us our food was up and that it was going to be on the house, did we want it to go or did we want to stay and eat it there. We sat back down and again it never showed up, we walked out. If you want to give it a try remember to eat a snack and be ready to wait 45-60 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"The over-the-top attempts to sell to some sort of manly stereotype is pretty annoying (\"Would you like your beer man-sized or girl-sized?), but once you get past that it's a decent basic pub.  The menu is a typical limited bar menu with some good items.  The Texax-style Philly, with jalapenos and \"nacho\" style cheese, is pretty interesting and quite good.  For the days I want lighter fare, they have a rather good steak salad.  The fries and sides aren't outstanding, but are good.  There is a decent selection of draft beers aside from the usual Bud/Coors/Miller swill.  Overall I'd never go out of my way to come here, but it's a decent place to hit when I'm in the area on other business.  I'd like to give it a 3.5 instead of just a 3, if Yelp would allow that."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon and sat at the main bar. Rosay, the bartender was nice, but rather slow. Maybe over worked, but it took awhile for drinks. We ordered burgers and that took another 25 minutes. When they came, we waited another 5 minutes for napkins and stainless. Refills on the drinks was another issue. It'll be awhile before I return. Fair food, bad service."}
{"text":"WOW! the beer really is cold. 29 degrees as advertised. they even have a temperature scoreboard that let's you see what the degrees are! i love me some icy beer! mozza sticks are fabulous and the chicken fried steak is huge...enough for two people. so happy this place opened near my house. i want to try the outdoor seating next to the firepits!"}
{"text":"While the ladies are beautiful and that's what they go for at a place like this,  I still want good service and good food. While service lacks for the most part the food is sub par and lacks flavor"}
{"text":"We actually have come here every Monday night for football since they opened. Service is almost always mediocre, but we are fine with that as long as the cold beer keeps flowing.  We've learned to order when half done because servers usually take a bit longer than other places. Food is pretty good, best fried pickles!! But the last time we went I was appalled by the service we received. We all were. Our server was a newer girl, it took 30 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them!! That could even be forgiven.... When it was time to order food, she set dirty plates from another table on ours to take our order!! She did this on two separate occasions!!! Several items came out wrong and had to go back, our daughter couldn't get a spoon for her ice cream and then the check was wrong we were over charged. All the times the food went back and she rerang the order they tagged it on our bill and she presented it to us. We spoke to management at the end and she said she would reach out to us and never did, this was two weeks ago. I was hoping for some sort of correspondence to show we are valued customers. No such luck. Fair warning, if you go and Hanah is your server ask for a different section!! This girl was sweet but does not understand health codes or have any sense of urgency!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here in Las Vegas the girls here I felt like they were better looking that the girls at hooter. I got a burger there which was pretty big it will definitely fill you up. The service was ok. You saw all the waiter talking load and playing around with each, which was kind of unprofessional even though it was a bar."}
{"text":"Is this a daycare center or a bar? We came here last night to watch the fights and noticed not one but three waitresses, two of which were holding kids on their hips walking with them to tables and the last one consoling her crying son for a solid 10 minutes at the table next to us. It was awkward and inappropriate. She kept telling her kid \"mommy has to work, you're going to get me in trouble,\" and \"you're pissing me the f*ck off, sit down.\" Needless to say we left after the kid continued to cry hiding behind my chair. The wings and beer were good which is why I'm giving it a 2."}
{"text":"The nachos are pretty good. And beer is always cold. Service has always been good. Have yet to try anything that we didnt like"}
{"text":"I met a friend from out of town at Twin Peaks  for a few drinks. It's a place inside with a rock climbing wall that patrons and the staff can both challenge themselves. I was just a spectator but had a few laughs at other peoples expenses. The bartenders were a little slow. It was that crowded but they seemed more interested in their own dramas rather than serving customers. Myself and several other thirsty individuals had to sit around and wait for refills. Too many other options on the strip to have a drink than to waste time at this place."}
{"text":"The reason for four stars is strictly on the service.  Short brunette girl, used work at a casino, I don't remember her name!  But she was so friendly and nice!! Made sure we always had drinks and kept checking on us  Food was mediocre at best. We were just hungry, and it took awhile to come out for it not being so busy.  Other than that it was great experience"}
{"text":"This one here very disappointing nothing compared like those in dallas tx my order was wrong (app) not even busy to take my order wrong and then my entree order sliders bread was hard and kind of warm...."}
{"text":"Starting off with the pretzel tonight. It's actually pretty good! Crispy, flavorful and comes with a cheese dip & a honey mustard . I had the chicken fried steak, it was HUGE!!!! Covered the whole plate!!!! It was tasty, but thin. My guy had the chicken & shrimp plate, the shrimps were big and not overly covered in batter. There are small flat screens at each booth that you can control the channels on, and above and around the bar are big screen TVs with all the games on. 22oz domestic beer for only 5$!!! Great food, good beer and great beer prices!"}
{"text":"I always go here with a group of people on weekend nights. The food is great, I've never had a problem with it. Their drink specials are pretty great too! Only bad thing is for the amount of waitresses they have and the fact that there's never that many people in there, service is not good. We very rarely get checked on and are always waiting for the check. The waitresses disappear half the time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for high-quality food in a sports bar environment that makes you slightly uncomfortable because of how the girls are somehow wearing less than the girls at Hooters, then this is your spot. I love it for any game night and because if you check-in on Yelp you get free queso! Seriously, free queso. I should have led with that and ended with everything else less important, which is where my review on the Cold War begins. First, free queso, then EVERYTHING else."}
{"text":"My husband and I only went because friends in town wanted to go. I wasn't expecting to like it and I was pleasantly surprised. The waitresses were friendly and attentive and the food was good. We all ordered something different and everyone liked and or loved what they got!  Oh and the draft beer was ICY COLD... SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Bacon is fantastic and beers are perfectly chilled.  Excellent tv coverage.  However the wings are awful.  Not crispy, dry, and undercooked.  If you don't do Wings well at a sports bar then I think you have to max out at four stars.  I do love the hunting decor though and they serve chicken fried steak sliders.  Yum.  Would rate five stars if wings were good."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant very much. My wife and I have had only one bad experience. Before I jump into the that, we've enjoyed their food every time. I normally get the Shrimp and Chicken combo, doesn't matter if you get it grilled or blackened, it's delicious. The wings are also delicious. Service has always been great and TV's galore! Plenty of TV's to watch and there's a TV in every booth as well for you to control. So the only reason why I'm not giving this place 4 or 5 stars is because at our most recently experience, we were sat in a booth on the North side near the restrooms and a bug bit my wife right before we payed. Everything was going well until we were given the check then all of a sudden my wife felt something crawling on her left arm and felt a bug bite her. Of course, naturally she jumped and hit the bug away. She was so gross out she just wanted to leave. I didn't want to give them two stars cause we've always had good experience except that one time."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Very attentive. Beer COLD food needs some work. If the food would improve it would be 5 stars. Need burgers shrimp calami salads wraps Chilli and hot blue cheese chips etc"}
{"text":"My friend and I received a coupon for this place when we were asked to rate a tv show so we decided to go there for dinner. The menu had mostly standard bar food for reasonable prices. Once we sat down, we realized we were the only women there which makes sense because of the scantily dressed waitresses. My friend ordered the hangover burger which she enjoyed and I ordered chicken and shrimp which was good also. Both meals arrived quickly, very hot, with awesome fries, and many sauce options."}
{"text":"Soo my first 20 minutes here where awkward sitting all the way in back where nobody was. Second the wait for somebody to ask us if we wanted drinks was about 15 minutes the manager even made eye contact but nothing. Third apparently the word i want to use i cant ill just refer to them as kids because they act like retarded gang bangers. Me i am a veteran and we were here way before these kids even sat down they got served first and even got drink and food orders before we did. Fourth the girl who took our orders interrupt to go serve them in the middle of our order so un professional. Then so couldnt even remember a simple order of a beer and some chip and dip. I wouldnt recommend anyone coming here i would of been better off at a food truck at least there better personality there than this place i always heard good things here but after this experience i would not be coming back i love there beer but does not excuse horrible service stuck up girls and server favorite getting served first soo everybody stay away go find something better isn't the whole point we go out to eat for the experience hope this helps everybody who is wonder about coming here go to the rey del tortas soo much better then this dump"}
{"text":"Alright. My first time here and it was different. I anticipated the menu to consist of  variety of wings, I was wrong. I guest I stereotyped it with hooters lol.  What we ordered: Chicken wings as appetizer Smokehouse Burger Chicken and Shrimp baskets A dirty blonde (essentially a blue moon)  The food was impressively delicious. Wings had good sauce, baskets with the chicken were really really good and the fries were addicting with whatever seasoning was on them. My cousin who I usually has a problem finishing his food, just killed his burger. It looked tasty.   Update: Got a better server and had a good time with great food.     The service just kills my rating. This waitress, very sweet but had to be her first day. Took a while to get the drinks.Ok, not biggie but it wasn't too packed. We ordered the food and we received just chicken tenders and no shrimp. She returned the baskets to the back which she ended up returning them to us and saying these are on the house and we will make you a new basket with the correct food. Okay thats nice, also the manager came and apologized and told us to about the mishap. Fine, however after this our waitress just about disappeared on us and the table behind us. Had to flag her down for napkins multiple times and to get out check. It was too much of a hassle.  Food was great, nice people I just wished this waitress was trained a bit better. I will be back as the food was great, in hopes of a better trained waitress and posting a new review."}
{"text":"For ice cold beers and sports, This is the place to be! Great wings great service and great \"view\"  Its a bit pricey for a local bar however (strip prices) I would give it a 4.5 if they gave me the option.  Give it a shot, its worth it."}
{"text":"If you like boobs, sports and HEAVILY peppered food, this is the place for you.  We needed something fast and this place was pretty empty on a Friday night so we went in.  We sat down and waited for 15 minutes for someone to notice us (we were seated by a hostess so you would think she would have made sure a waitress came over, especially since place wasn't busy). Once a waitress did come over, the service was decent. We were served by several waitresses and they were very nice.  There are many, many, many large screen TV's playing different games (really, too many TV's).  The customers are mostly men. There were a few women; only saw two kids the entire time (not really a place for kids).    The food was OK, but like I said, you must love pepper to enjoy it.  Everything had pepper, a lot of pepper. There are only two wine selections, but I suppose you go to this place to drink beer.  As far as cleanliness, the seats were pretty dirty and there were French Fries on the floor under our table when we arrived."}
{"text":"First Time Here, Food Was Really Good! Definitely Sports Bar Atmosphere. Sit Outside & Have A Great View Of The Strip. Pulled Pork BBQ Nachos & Wings Were Good! Wings Were Juicy! Ice Cold Beer Too. Service Was Very Good From Vanessa. She Always Made Sure We Were Satisfied With Everything."}
{"text":"So we decided to check this place out for a quick dinner.  When we got here it was 10 min before the waitress even came to say hi.  A refill on soda took 10 minutes.  The place isn't very busy.  There were 4 girls standing around at the door and had to wait for someone else to seat us.  There were only like 4 tables and it took over an hour for a burger and chicken tenders.  I'm sure there would be more customers if the service wasn't so horrendous."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Courtney was our server and she is the best.  We came in after a long ride looking for a great place to eat and we found it at Twin Peaks. Seating was fast and Courtney was quick to introduce herself and go over the menu and drink options available. I ordered the BLT and my lady ordered a chicken sandwich and both were very delicious and priced just right. Thanks to you Courtney for making our first experience at Twin Peaks memorable This place has definitely earned our repeat business when we are in town."}
{"text":"The manager Adam is the most unprofessional, rude, racist person I've ever seen. I had watched how he handled a customer complaint and it sickened me to my stomach and to top it off when he was done you could hear him walk away and continued to say racist rude remarks. You need to be retrained or take a leave of absence to work on your attitude or you shouldn't be in customer service."}
{"text":"Kim is my waitress again and she has been perfect. She remembered me from last time and ordered my fav drink without me asking. I'm going to have to come all the time if the service continues to be like this"}
{"text":"Well I was contacted  by Tiffany B from twin peaks customer relations department ,She was very pleasant to talk too and gave me a gift certificate to try the store in Scottsdale Arizona . I'm sure the next visit will be a good one . I'll post a review once we try it"}
{"text":"Wow! We had Whitney for a server today very pretty and friendly  wow for good  service wow for good food . I would defiantly go back to this location way better than hooters and jaw dropping girls."}
{"text":"THEY CARRY THE BEYOND BURGER! (Google it) I'm officially returning by choice thanks to their new menu! I've dined at twin peaks multiple times before for lunch or drinks and dinner and I've always felt the food was little too americana with tacos made with hamburger veggie toppings or very non inventive dishes where all steak or fish is served with a starch and a veggie. However NOW I will say they've added new items to their menu and I'm thrilled! I'll definitely be coming back! They've just now added a vegetarian option (outside of ordering a salad) being the Beyond Burger and it is amazing! I had it substituted into one of their traditional burger selections (BBQ Honey Cheddar burger). It was great paired with a Dirty Blonde house beer in the overly frosted mug. Can't wait to go back for the Beyond Burger again."}
{"text":"We kind of ended up here by mistake.  We wanted to go to Four Peaks but didn't realize this wasn't it until we were inside, so we stayed anyway.  It was quite busy for a Saturday at 3pm, and a service was slow.  We ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out.  About 20 minutes later out came our appetizers...with our food, and an apology from the manager.  Something about our appetizers order getting lost.  Anyway, they took the apps off our bill, so that was good.  Had the mozzarella sticks and the queso and chips.  Both were pretty yummy. I had the blackened fish tacos which were ok...nothing great.  The flour tortillas they use are WAY too big though.  I had to tear a good inch off the top, and the fish filet inside didn't even reach the ends of the tacos.  Everyone else had burgers, and they said they were good.  All in all, not horrible, but I don't see us going back...not when there are so many other restaurants nearby.  My 3 teenage boys thoroughly enjoyed the scantily dressed waitresses though.  My one son said \"this place shouldn't be called a brewery, it should be called a boobery!\". Too funny.  (this place is not a brewery, but we had told them were we're going to four peaks)."}
{"text":"Aside from the ladies wearing lingerie (not kid friendly)  I enjoyed my visit here. Friendly and attentive staff. Food was delicious and didn't take very long to be served. Variety of drinks, not just draft beer. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"The waitress will steal your money!  This is my go to place whenever out of town friends come visit me. Everything was going fine till the bill came up, 34$. I gave a 50$ and told \"Big boobed brunette waitress\" that I just need 4$ back for cigarette money for my smoker friend and she can keep the extra 12$.   Because I dont want to use my credit card on that shady liquor shop at the back.   And I dont want to be that guy who makes uber stop at the ATM, then the gas/liquor store, then drop my friend off MGM, tehn home. I DONT WANT TO BE THAT GUY.  She took her sweet time. Stalling and stalling. I knew the jig was up. I reminded her of the small 4$ of smoke change we needed, then we'll be out of her hair. She smiled and still kept stalling. And stalling. Until I called her for the last time, and this time she became annoyed and some light argument ensued and we ended up just walking away because we didnt want to ruin our night.  Long story short, I BECAME THAT GUY. I made uber stop for ATM, then gas store, then MGM for my friend, then home for me.   Yeah, it was a hassle. I don't get it, this was my go to bar for dear out of towner friends, why all the fuss? Well, not anymore. I'll go find some other bar."}
{"text":"Awesome waitress Chloe fantastic service energetic personality with quality humor and outgoing customer based excellence"}
{"text":"First time here but will for sure will come again next time I'm in Vegas. The food was amazing, good drink specials and the girls are so sweet. Totally recommend the loaded tots"}
{"text":"This was the 4th time that we have visited this location. It is definitely a sweet spot when we are in the area. Great service,food and entertainment from the Ladies.  Super cold beer."}
{"text":"The food and service are great... It's too bad they let people like the Hells Angels be there in their gang attire.  This was taken on March 10th about 4-5 in the afternoon. We made staff aware of their presence as soon as we saw them."}
{"text":"So I did the first review of twin peaks vegas and now I'm gonna do another one. I STILL LOVE THIS PLACE!!! They have the coldest beer in Vegas by far. I like to drink the 29 degree Knotty Brunettes, Dirty blondes, and Dos equis(Really good ice cold with 2 limes). Now yes these man size beers are like 10 bucks but so worth it. They have a thermostat that shows you exactly how cold the beer is at the time.   This last Vegas trip was the first time I ever had anything to eat there other than the Chicken tender basket. I had the chicken and shrimp and it was probably my favorite meal in Vegas. Also did the mozzarella sticks and those were soooo bomb. I don't understand how anyone could not like the food here. Exactly what other places in Vegas have better food for the price. I would love to know.   The girls here are super nice. I was eating at a table with my friends and when my friends left....she let me move over to the bar to watch the game. There were these 2 twins working the bar that were super hot. Yeah they most def got a tip lol.   My friend did the wall but not something I really want to do. If I have one problem with Twin peaks it's that they have some strange cheese burgers. Burgers with eggs and mushrooms and stuff. Why can't they just have like a double bbq bacon burger or something. To be fair my friends loved their burgers. I just stick to my chicken and shrimp though.   Every guy in Vegas should come to twin peaks at least once. Check out the man size Dos equis with 2 limes. It's so damn good."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Friday lunch shift and Britney was our server. She was amazing. Not only did she keep our beers full, but she kept us laughing. She also engaged and brought other girls to our table like Smashley, which I hope is not her rear name. Nonetheless Smash was smiling and happy to bring us our drink refills. The manager even came by to welcome us and invited us back. I love Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Had a football draft with a $45 minimum per person, it was really hard to do. The server was terrible.  Won't be doing it again next year."}
{"text":"We never, ever go to Las Vegas without stopping at the Twin Peaks in Henderson. Great food and great service. Danielle was our waitress this time; she is awesome. Between Happy Hour and Bourbon Day Week, the prices were really good, too!"}
{"text":"Good fun, great time, really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Shak was fucking amazing. Checked on us often and made sure we exercised all of our options. She knew the amount of food we got was gonna need boxes and she was on top of it. The other waiters were amazing as well. If you are in Vegas get your ass in here. (side note the beer was on point)."}
{"text":"Fun, and good food!! Ella made the experience even better than it normally is.  She served us with a bundle of great energy, and what a doll she is as well! We come here all the time and she reminded us why we do today!"}
{"text":"Breastaurant...don't recommend it for families or fouples.  Probably great for horn old and young men.  Food mediocre at best."}
{"text":"During our annual \"Boys Weekend in Vegas\", it's become a ritual to stop in at this TP location and watch the NFL playoffs. Another year has passed and, once again, the folks at this location did not disappoint.  As for the service, we were tended to this year by Yasmine on one day and Nicoley on the next. Both were attentive and friendly (in addition to being gorgeous). These gals hustled and seemingly took good care of all of their tables. One of the Managers we encountered previously (Miller) was there again this year. He too seems customer service oriented and is often visible on the floor (vs. hiding in the back or tapping away on his phone). Real good guy.  As for the food, I noticed a few new items on the menu. I especially enjoyed the smoked and grilled wings and spicy chipotle chicken. The burgers I've had there are comparable to elsewhere. The kitchen got our orders out in a reasonable period of time, despite being busy. I've seen some places struggle with this.  Please note that this location usually has a $45-$50/person minimum during NFL playoff season, per game. I noticed many folks walk in & right back our because of this. Funny thing though, most folks will easily toss down 3-4 beers a game and a plate of food. Guess what, you just hit their minimum without realizing it. Start drinking those fancy beers, and you've exceeded the minimum."}
{"text":"This place is really really bad. It's Vegas. There is Cleavage and Butt (to say it nicely) all over. So what is going to make you stand out and get repeat customers??  Our service was awful. Slow. Wrong. The food was gross."}
{"text":"First timer to Twin Peaks, I've been to The Tilted Kilt before, but this place was pretty awesome! Jewels was our server and she was super cute, quick, and had a great personality and attitude! She made for an awesome experience, you rock girl!"}
{"text":"Second time going to this location, food is mediocre (typical bar food) but I am writing this review because I was pleasantly surprised with my service both visits. The employee's were not only super friendly, but very attentive. Definitely deserving of a great tip, I will be back."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is definitely a must go for all Vegas visitors. They have daily happy hour specials and the best wings in town. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend getting the breaded wings and the chicken ranch sandwich (ask for the breaded chicken instead of the grilled).   I'll definitely be back the next and every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A common complaint is service.  I've been here about 8 times service was great 7 and so-so once. Great place to watch college football or MMA/Boxing.  Decent wings and a great change of pace take on nachos.  Lastly - COLD COLD beer. Plus I like their spin on cuties.  Don't over think it. It's a great place to warm up or cool down. My stars are based on it accomplishing what it intended to be."}
{"text":"This is the WORST place we have eaten in Vegas to date (out of over 100). The waitress SUCKED, she was VERY slow and ignored my wife and I for the most part, instead spending time flirting with the two guys next to us. They were sat 10 minutes after us, but got their drinks and food first and even got a second round of drinks after she kept walking by us with empty glasses. She was obviously inexperienced and this might be why she had no clue that people like me tip 20-30%. Oh well. The drinks were decent (the one round we got). The food was CRAP. We were stuck there for almost an hour for a couple bad sandwiches and one round because we were ignored. We had plenty of time to look around and found that this place will not last very long. The waitresses are not that good looking. Half of them were just in bras and no uniform. And if you call a place twin peaks, you expect to see something. Nope. The person doing the hiring must be a member of the itty bitty **tty club because there was nothing but skinning girls with no figure and a bunch of piercings to look at. There are MUCH better places on the strip to eat, drink and look at the various views"}
{"text":"Super cold beer. Pub food.  Countless HD TV's. Servers 1/2 naked and sassy.  Is this Heaven???"}
{"text":"Great place for a large group to host a get together.  Has lots of tables and very roomy.  Food was ok and drinks a little too pricey for happy hour prices.  We had a great waitress by the name of Linz.  She was friendly, attentive and efficient with our needs.  Music was too loud and it was hard hearing each other."}
{"text":"Expecting better service especially after watching Undercover Boss. Ordered a steak salad, a bit on the dry side.  Husband had to flag down a bartender lady for another beer, it wasn't busy. It was a Monday afternoon. Our bartender lady seemed to enjoy talking to her co workers than serving her customers. The other bartender girl had tons of customers and she helped us, felt bad for her.."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday night being as a friend and I had just flown in from St. Louis a couple of hours prior. We called before coming and were informed that the kitchen was open until 12:30. We arrived at 10:55. Order queso dip from our server at 11:05, which didn't arrive to the table until 11:30. Entrees took even longer. The bus boys and multiple other staff were working on shutting down the patio around us and turning off the heaters and they could all easily tell we were being neglected and I'm also sure that there were in contact with the staff indoors via earpieces and microphones that they wear, but none of them bothered to attempt to assist us. I went inside to find a manager, who after I finally talked to he never even came back out to our table to check on us! I asked the server for a water while waiting for entrees and it was never delivered. When our entrees finally were delivered we didn't even have any utensils to eat our food!! Seriously what a joke of a restaurant with absolutely pathetic management. Whoever owns this company would probably be very ashamed of the staff and management on the night of Saturday March 9th of 2014. Literally you guys ruined our evening to the point where all we could do was laugh about what a horrible experience we had."}
{"text":"Came here as it seems every other restaurant in Scottsdale closes at 10 pm on a Sunday, and I just got off a long day and they were open.  The beers were excellent.   Served at like 29 degrees in ice cold mugs....sure made them go smooth.  Ordered the Sicillian sandwich.   It was tasty and spicey.   However, lime another yelped indicate their bread was stale......sure seemed like mine was that way too.....maybe they wanted it that way?  Service was really good and attentive.    Might try again if ever back in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch today. I told her I found a place that served venison chili and she knew I had to try it. When we arrived my wife kinda rolled her eyes when she saw the servers outfits, or lack thereof. Ah well. The decor was quite enjoyable. We sat on the patio upstairs and the view was very nice.   Our server was quite friendly, we ordered appetizers, which arrived before we even ordered our entrees, about 10-15 minutes later. We had nachos, and a (SMALL!) cup of the venison chili for appetizers, very nice. For entrees we ordered the pulled pork sliders and a poblano chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken sandwich fell apart as I ate it. It seemed to be possessed by a McDonalds hamburger. One bite and everything wanted to fall out of the far side. Our server at this point seemed to disappear. When finished eating and waited a good 10-15 minutes for her to return with our check. She seemed more interested in socializing then tending to the needs of her guests.   All in all it was a very nice experience, but honestly I could flip a coin about returning or not. If someone else, say from out of town, wanted to try the place, I could go back, but I might try thinking of other places to go as well."}
{"text":"Prior time that I went everything was wonderful. This time I went to go see the USA v. Ukraine soccer game and the doors were closed although they state they open @ 11am. A call was made after 11 am and nobody answered. Considering they are so new they are not doing a good job in opening in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Stopped here in early September, lunch time. Sat at a table in the ground floor bar area. My server was Sierra, very helpful and cheerful. So much so that I asked forvher when I returned the next day. Had the fish tacos, they were awesome. Enjoyed their Dirty Blond beer. Such a positive experience I came back the next day.  Next day was a college football Saturday. Girls looked cute in their (abbreviated) favorite team jerseys. When I was informed Sierra wasn't working at the time I decided to sit at the 3rd floor bar. Good choice, awesome view of the Strip. Fun atmosphere with all the key games on TV. Although it was quite busy received great service from bartenders Megan and Ellen. Chatted with a couple of the regulars and downed several of the Dirty Blonds.  Both visits were a big improvement from my May visit. Just goes to show, a lot of the make/break of a visit comes down to your server or bartender. Definitely looking forward to stopping by my next time in Vegas.  And bonus for me, as I'm walking out the entrance who's \"manning\" the beer tub but Sierra! Way too many beers in me at that point but got to chat briefly."}
{"text":"First visit here. Had the Fried Pickle appetizer and a Philly Cheesesteak. Food was excellent as was the service. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot, the service is always friendly and fast and the food is great. My favorites are the buffalo wings, chili, and the pot roast dinner. The beers are ice cold. I would say it is a little more expensive than other places and there is no gaming stations. The waitresses always sit with us and seem to enjoy their job."}
{"text":"Walked in the hostess was spot on and very nice---that's where it ended. Got seated in a area with a couple of other tables occupied but not to busy. Waitresses walking by the table left and right. Sat there for over 8mins no one even came to our table. Go up walked out and told the hostess on the way out. Sad you can't get served in a restaurant that is suppose to be selling a atmosphere. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The blonde waitress working here (the only blonde in-house tonight) 1-15-18 10pm to closing, spent the entire 2.5 hours I was here flirting with two guys at one table. I'm pretty sure the outfits and smile are supposed to make ALL feel welcome...but she was my waitress too and barely said a dozen words to me all night.  Don't get me wrong, if she's dating one of them it makes sense. Otherwise, it's just unprofessional in the extreme. Us guys don't come here for the food :p"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place to eat and drink, crazy they can't figure out how to roll the price of ranch and salsa into their margins. I hate the management decision to nickel and dime the customer. This place is way too overrated."}
{"text":"I've driven by the place a few times, and a cyber-bud of mine works at one of their restaurants in another state. So, I decided to stop by today for lunch.  My hostess/waitress, Laken was polite, and professional. She took me to my booth. Now, either the benches are too low, or the table is too high, as the table top came even with my upper chest. She gave me the menus, and asked if I would like a drink. Since, I had a good drive ahead of me, I passed, and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menus.   I really liked the rustic appearance of the place. Though, I found it amusing, having the waitresses wearing \"diamond\" necklaces was out of place with the shorts, halter tops, knee-high socks and \"boots\" that make up their uniform.  I ordered the Beer Battered Fish and Chips, and that was brought to me by another waitress. And I must say, that the food was pretty tasty. The natural cut seasoned fries were hot (though, they cooled pretty quickly since they were spread out on the plate under the fish). But, the fish was piping hot! From the first bite, to the last (4 pieces later; was too full to get the last piece), the fish was hot. Might be a bit greasy for some people, but I really liked it.  However, like Benjamin B., I too noticed where the waitresses (sometimes 2 at a time), would be chatting with customers (regulars, I think, since the guys was much older than the girls) at other tables, whereas my conversation was limited to the basic order, meal check and check. Though, the hand written note was nice to see.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dear Twin Peaks,  On the door of your restaurant, your hours are stated as 11am-midnight.  However, I came in this evening about 11:30 and wanted to order to-go food and the bartender informed me the kitchen closed at 11...why in the hell does your kitchen close at 11 but your restaurant closes 12?!  Whatever, your food isn't that good anyway, I was just hungry and desperate.  Went next door to BJ's and they close at midnight and surprisingly enough, their kitchen was open too!  What a concept..."}
{"text":"Now I know why they call this place Twin Peaks!  Wings were good def better than Hooters."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are OK. Service is good. Not a place for kids. Tits and ass everywhere. Would be a great spot for guys night out. Not for family night out."}
{"text":"Visited Twin Peaks with the bros in October during our trip to Las Vegas. Firstly I would like to say that I don't really get excited for tits so this review will be more of a food, drink and quality piece.  We were seated and ordered. I had an ice cold 29.345738459 degree beer. It was like a frozen coke AKA shit. Half way through it I was wishing that I had taken the coke sample. I had the smoke house burger. It was acceptable. The fun part of Twin Peaks is the interaction with the waitresses. They are obviously forced to talk to the customers and they stand over you awkwardly while you are eating. We took this opportunity to tell the waitress that cheese was illegal in New Zealand (where i'm from) and that I am the number one importer of illegal cheese in New Zealand. I then told her i'm the Al Capone of cheese. She then went and told all the other waitresses. Hilarious.   Bathrooms are clean. Lots of TV's, lots of sports.  The following day my bowel movement was smooth. Didn't hurt and their was no blood so that's a win for Twin Peaks as far as i'm concerned.   Would visit again."}
{"text":"Garbage customer service. Conceited bartenders who will treat you at their mercy, as if they were Gods gift. I asked for a coaster for my beer, she gave me ten of them. I also asked for napkins, she gives me paper towels. Watch out for Ashley's little attitude problem along w her little minions, who will throw in their pathetic little jabs. I will not recommend this place to anyone. That is how they thanked me for my service to this great country. Steer clear!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of co-workers and I came here for Happy Hour on a Friday afternoon and we had a great time.  They had some decent happy hour prices for a variety of drinks and everyone seemed to be able to find one they liked.  The fried pickles were a delicious appetizer and the chicken tenders were good as well.  We stayed for a couple of hours and the waitresses checked up on us frequently to ensure that we were all taken care of.   Overall: A Great happy hour.  Good service.  Delicious fried pickles!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner so the hubby and I will stop by sometimes for late night happy hour. Great deals! Ice cold beer always! Food wise, everything that I've had here is really good too. You definitely get your money's worth in serving size! Only reason I gave 4/5 stars was because sometimes the girls working can be a hit or miss. Some are nice, but then I've also had some waitresses that are just rude. Food is good and happy hour deals are too so that's why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  The service was super slow and not friendly. The bartenders are poorly trained and don't know how to multi task properly or make simple cocktails. The bartender was more concerned with talking with the busser than the patrons.  That same busser later came back and starting dusting the TV's over the bar area, with the ice wells open. If the health department would have come in they would have been marked for multiple infractions. I wanted another drink but the chance of dust on my drink made me leave.  This is completely unacceptable and I might just call the health department myself and tell them to come by tomorrow night at 10:30 so they can see what I saw.  Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party of nine, and they were able to seat us right away upstairs.  Out of all of the waitresses working, we all agreed that we got the best waitress there. Our waitress was named Tina, she's blonde and from Idaho. She had no problem splitting our tabs up, and was very friendly. A Latina girl who's name I didn't get was the one that brought the entrees out and she was a dime piece as well. Lol.  As far as the food goes, I had the hangover burger and it was just okay... the fries come seasoned similar to Red Robin. I paid $20 for a \"32 oz.\" beer that came in a cool souvenir cup, but was very disappointed to reuse it later and discover a 24 oz. tall can fills the same cup up! Tina was either mistaken when she told me it was a 32 oz. \"Vegas size,\" (I forgive her) or they're cheating people out of 8 oz. of beer, which would be wrong. There's no way to really know, since it's not listed on the menu, but explained by the waitress. Those beers are served at 29 degrees too, which I liked, but one of my buddy's didn't since his kind of slushed up.  Overall, this is a cool place, there's a lot going on in here: rock climbing, \"shotskis,\" and plenty of TV's and eye candy. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I just have to take a second to give a compliment to the bartenders I had today. I come into twin peaks quite a bit and these three girls are always on point. Big shout out to smashley,tiffani,and Sabrina."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  Of course it's normally full of guys looking at the TnA that their known for.  To me, that kind of stuff doesn't matter.  However, this place is always at the top of the list when colleagues want to meet up for afterwork drinks.  A highlight of some of the items I've ordered here:  Chips & Queso http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=Y_MkEfV_dZ_-Yw7pYTbk7w#Y_MkEfV_dZ_-Yw7pYTbk7w  Mozzarella Cheese Sticks http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=OktAQMHD9Wh2iPh2ZkmEjg#OktAQMHD9Wh2iPh2ZkmEjg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=FUjWWxUEC3H_amfkNBUgfg#FUjWWxUEC3H_amfkNBUgfg  Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=-NdNiCM2OQQraB8rVzuJ9g#-NdNiCM2OQQraB8rVzuJ9g  Cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=pClRyNnl_14wcjKTvCI97Q#pClRyNnl_14wcjKTvCI97Q  Twin Peaks Sundae http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=Ij4QKzBbG4aiYfm4hxI3gQ#Ij4QKzBbG4aiYfm4hxI3gQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?select=XmAfjb4_07p3TN8x7dAaTA#XmAfjb4_07p3TN8x7dAaTA  The Chips & Queso are very good...and addicting.  The Cheese Sticks and Burger are so/so.  The Cheeseburger is average.  The Twin Peaks Sundae is huge and very good...the highlight of their Dessert Menu.  Overall, it's an average place to me.  The TnA factor doesn't do anything for me at all....as a married guy, to me it's pointless.  Most of the girls are super young and are \"faking\" it when they come up to your table, so to me it doesn't add to the experience at all.  If that's your deal, this place is for you.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Great food and corona on draft! We had the sliders, which were very good. We will try this place again when we get back to Illinois."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the view was not worth the wasted time. My family came in and ordered Chips and Queso to start pretty simple, after waiting a half an hour the chips never came and they brought out a cold chicken philly cheese steak when my husband ordered a require philly chesse steak. At that point we lost all desire to continue on with this pathetic experience and gave up and left hungry after explaining to the manager why."}
{"text":"Great views of the strip on the top level bar. Burgers are very good if not a little thin and overlooked (reason for four stars). Service was exceptional at the bar."}
{"text":"I think my colleague said it best when he stated, \"you come here for the peaks and not the food\". They have a really cool system that almost freezes the beer and shows the temperature it is being poured at. The food here is nothing special. I recommend not getting to adventurous as your will probably be disappointed. I had the nachos and wings and they taste okay. I really only come to this place for one reason. The UFC!!! The atmosphere for the fights is unbelievable and the staff does a great job with the busyness. All in all a nice sports bar with a uniquely dressed staff that I am sure attracts some regulars"}
{"text":"Cold beer and nice eye candy!!"}
{"text":"Selena and amber are the best ever! I will def. be back to see their beautiful faces! Oh and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Nice place kinda log cabinish, indoor & outdoor seating, lots of tv's, wasn't very impressed with the menu choices. Staff seemed nice & friendly. The need a menu revamp."}
{"text":"Went to Twin Peaks on Friday, June 7th and had a wonderful time.  If you are looking for good looking servers, very cold beer, good HD TV screens....then this is your place.  Food is so-so but who cares when you have \"twins\" to look at!"}
{"text":"We come here often for lunch as it is very close to the office and the food is out of this world. We always receive excellent service but this visit was special. Britney B. Was our server and she was beyond outstanding. My drink was never empty, my food was out quickly and tasted AMAZING. It was our friends birthday and she made it extra special!! We appreciate you Britney B."}
{"text":"First time trying twin peaks but I wad surprisingly pleased with my order.   I got the nachos which again to my surprise were super delicious. They were very close to the champps mile high nachos (there's no champps in the Phoenix area) so I was very very happy because I have been craving those nachos from champs since moving out here.    The restaurant was very fast with our take out order as they had it ready in 10 min! On a Friday night at that!   Saw other things on the menu I can't wait to try, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went in for afternoon beer and appetizers. Beer was cold, food was great!  Kayleigh made sure we didn't want for anything!"}
{"text":"met some friends here for lunch last week and had never heard of the place.  Upon walking in i was PLEASANTLY surprised!  The name \"twin peaks\" finally made sense and i was greeted by 7 girls wearing VERY not much, and that was nice!  the place was full of big screen TVs with all different sports on so that was nice.  the burgers were decent and the price wasn't too bad, but the waitresses were defiantly the best part!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sports bar in town! Came to watch the hockey game and requested for Brashtynn, of course!! She did wonderful and her sister TPG Adela did wonderful and was looking mighty fine! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such good service!!! Leeann was amazing!!! Good drinks good food!!!  I would recommend the fried pickles yummy!"}
{"text":"I see why people would go there and there is a nice view of the strip and you can sit outside on there patio but food wasn't that great so depends what you are looking for out of this place"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football or other sports, there are a million tv's and some even at the table you are sitting at.  Beer is cold and the waitresses are friendly.  Food is typical bar food but yummy.  I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in Vegas!  :-)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was so amazing!! Servers are fabulous as well. This is not the type of place I would go to but  I'm so glad I went, so much fun and great food!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good environment, great spot to watch a game.  However, I showed up for a one and done sort of night. I ordered a Mcallan 15 neat. After 2 sips, I noticed  there was shard from a glass rim at the bottom of my glass. Took it directly to the bar and showed the bartender.  She asked what I had, I mistakenly said Macallan 16 and all she had to say was \"we don't have that\".  I corrected myself and she just said \"it won't be on your bill\" and poured another. I'm happy it was comped but it seemed like nobody cared that it was a potentially dangerous situation if I wasn't paying attention to what was in front of me. They didn't even apologize for the mistake.  Let alone answering to how a glass shard could be in a glass with ONLY whiskey being poured into a fresh glass. And this is not me being an unreasonable customer, I've earned my living as a bartender for the past 5 years."}
{"text":"I mean it's Twin Peaks!! Great views and great selection on Brews. This one has a really nice outdoor seating section. The servers seem to be pretty heavy handed  cool modern bar food. Service was cool. Modelo on Tap!!! My personal favorite. They come frothy which is always a plus. Not sure what people expect from this place buts its a sports bar with hot chicks. Big Flat screens throughout and the manager came over to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. I wouldn't take my boys here but did see some kids?.?. Great place for an after work"}
{"text":"A must visit location on the strip!  Smoked/grilled wings are amazing!!  We had garlic Parmesan - WOW!  And classic - very good.  House salad - very fresh!!  What a great place.  Gabby our server was super friendly."}
{"text":"Bartenders not very attentive. Girl in the front asked if I would like a shot and when I replied no and was still trying to tell her that I was going to have a smoke and would order one when I came back she interupted saying have a nice day like 2 or 3 times. I guess that she gets to dismiss customers like trash. I like the one in Henderson better."}
{"text":"Good food and Kristen had great service! Highly recommended for drinks, food, or hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic lunch! Halle P, our server was attentive, knowledgeable, fun, and bubbly. Food was good. Huge beer selection was ice cold. Atmosphere was great. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Beer is ALWAYS cold! Food is ALWAYS good! How can you pass up the views?!?! Two story rock climbing wall and bar tenders, Nicoley and Selena, are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Was seated promptly and we sat at our table for 45 minutes without a one server coming to our table to take an order or even ask is how we were doing.  Had to walk up to the bar to get a beer and the place was half empty.  Had two beers without seeing a waitress at our table one time.  Truly dismal.  This place seems far more impressed by the temperature of their beer than they are with customer service.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Came here for the UFC fight. We had great seats, food came out quick and our server Alvion was great. If you're looking for a chill place to watch fights or the game, this is your spot."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to visit. The staff is upbeat the beer is very cold and my server Cassie is supper friendly.  The loaded Nachos were the best I've ever had. I'll come again soon..."}
{"text":"Love this place the way the girls promote it definitely caught our eye and the rock wall is a big plus! Would like to try their food next time. The atmosphere was definitely fun though!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The service is great and the food is good. My friends and I are here every Sunday to watch football. If you want to have service with a smile with great looking servers. buddy's love it. You need to spend some time here. This is the place to be with the friends!!!"}
{"text":"OK so after my first time here and the bad review management reached out and had me back with a gift certificate.  I stopped in for lunch.  Nice layout to the place.  Good service which is actually an oddity for these types of concepts.  I got Philly cheese steak with the jalapeno and queso option.  It was not just better than expected it was actually good.  Unfortunately the breastaurant concept just isn't my bag, but if I would definitely recommend this place over any others in the genre though.  That aside it is a cool bar and if the drinks were just a tad bit more reasonable I could actually see myself watching sports events here, but I understand the premium price for the concept so no hard feelings."}
{"text":"Nachos were very good but Cadillac margaritas were $14.99 and so NOT worth it!  All ice and sugary mix.  Waste of $30!"}
{"text":"The photo says it all............I walked in, and left.    Snottsdale has sadly turned into a Breasts on Parade town,..and in this case, midriffs and booties as well.    I've now heard the restaurant nicknamed Four Cheeks....:(  It's an insult to see these young girls foolishly putting themselves on display.    Having said that - it's really loud in there.....rustic decor....  Head to Four Peaks Brewery/Restaurant in the same parking lot......the girls there are intelligent and wear clothes."}
{"text":"Racist waitresses, horrible service. I'm hispanic and our waitress humiliated us and tried to act like she didn't understand what I was saying. Then processed to walk away and talk shit to her coworkers. She slammed the cups when I asked her to take away our dirty cups. After that she never came back to attend us. She was extremely rude and I'll never ever go back there in my life."}
{"text":"Scantily clad waitresses who are relatively friendly but will make fun of you if you don't want a giant beer. I liked the frosty mugs, the number of tvs and weird decor. The outdoor area had misters going which was helpful. Probably won't go back but it's basically a Buffalo Wild Wings with hot waitresses and it's better than Hooters."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar so we could get our food and drinks faster ... The service was great the food was awesome my lemon drop martini was awful sour and just bad ... the beer is served below freezing in an ice cold mug which is on point ... as far as cocktails go the selection is limited and the bartender was not familiar in making the few drinks I asked for so I settled on the martini bad choice ... If you stick to ordering cold beer this is the place ..."}
{"text":"Had drinks and apps at this location. Check came for 3 of us with 19 large beers. Told the staff and 3 different managers that it was incorrect and they threatened to call the police. The police had been in house an hour prior for the same reason. They apparently checked the cameras and came back and took off 3 beers, Not willing to admit they over charged us for the number of beers on our check.  Completely disgusted with the level of CS when dealing the management. They completely abused us as customers and made us feel like cheating them. It's concerning they would treat their patrons in this manner."}
{"text":"Good beer options.  Not a fan of objectified girls.  Scantily clad and went there only cause I wad getting an oil change."}
{"text":"Ever get the feeling you're not welcome to be someplace?  Yeah, it's like that.  Greeter was njce enough then I got shamed for not ordering a \"man sized beer\" which is 24 oz.  instead, I ordered apparently a \"girl sized\" beer which is 12oz.  I am pretty confident that I know how much beer I want and I don't need a little scantily dressed 21 year old waitress up selling me based on her perception of my manhood.  After the first beer, the food arrives and it was ok then she asks if I want another and I said, no, I'd like a water round please.  Next comes the handoff of the water and the check.  I guess I'm done.  The game is in the end of the third quarter but I guess I need to go someplace else to watch it so she \"Taylor\" can get a \"real man\" or more at her station.  This isn't the first time.  If a guy orders a \"girl sized\" beer the smirks and the eye rolls always follow.  Seems to be pervasive here.  Well, I can always drink at home and don't need to get drunk then drive away.  Could I tell a manager?  Sure, then they offer a dessert or something to appease me.  How about being professional and making people feel welcomed when they arrive and you can keep more of your profits."}
{"text":"Kim is THE BEST server at twin peaks hands down. A1 service I've never experienced anything better."}
{"text":"I loved the upbeat atmosphere of this establishment. It was a nice night so the back wall was open letting the night air in, it almost felt like you were sitting outside, even when you were inside. The queso is amazing! Just make sure you check in on Yelp to take advantage of their free queso offer while it lasts! My friend and I did some cheap ($3.00) shots of Jack Daniels and some other well-known liquors. I almost thought it was too good to be true to get shots of that quality for that amount of money. I had their chicken and seafood combo, it was AWESOME! I will definitely be coming here to eat again! Oh! I can't forget! The waitresses are very friendly and lovely to look at."}
{"text":"Only been here once for lunch, it went good.  Meant to go to Four Peaks and accidently walked in here.  Pretty good hamburger and fries, I like the lay out of the place, lot's of tv...I like the patio.  The only thing I didn't care for was the horde of girls in the front just socializing.  Doesn't seem really professionally ran.  I know it's a place to have a good time but places like these need to have standards.  Hooters does but their food is disgusting and Tilted Kilt has the worst service and biggest snobs of waitresses ever."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and steak nachos..its good but the meat is so tiny like for toddlers to eat..its ok"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and Jackie is awesome!  She is always good conversation and makes me feel like she cares.  The food is great and the beers are cold, it's a great place to go with friends, watch sports or UFC!"}
{"text":"I was there a few days ago for late dinner. Very simple place, good service kinda like an upgraded hooters!"}
{"text":"I usually do like twin peaks but the last couple times it's gotten worse. Just walked out because I sat there with my buddy for over 15 minutes with nobody asking what I wanted to drink so we walked behind twin peaks and sat down at PJs and had a drink with in 2 minutes and there was just as many people and staff. I'm giving it two stars because the hostess was nice and at least offered a water while we waited for our waitress to come and acknowledge our existence."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Not anything to get excited about. Ok service and food. Its nice to have girls in skimpy outfits serving you food, but they should be better trained. That's managements fault. Once we finally got the attention of a server she did a good job. My Texas style Philly was pretty good, just kinda skimpy on the meat. The others in my party had a BLT and wings. Both said it was ok, but not great. Went there to watch the baseball wild card game, it was on a lot of tv's,  but the music in the whole place was so loud you couldn't hear the game.  Seemed like most people there were here for the game, but still no sound. Kind of a bummer.  3 stars tops, really 2 1/2."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!!! Be sure to ask for Indiana when you come! Such a sweet heart!"}
{"text":"Why is it during football season the bimbo in charge has the same game on 4 TVs? Wouldn't it make more sense to put each game on the 13 TVs that are on each side of the bar and let your customers know where the games are? This happens every year... The food is decent but better planning by the management would satisfy more customers. We heard everyone complaining about this issue.."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Allie was a great server. She also made great recommendations. The twin peaks brunette beer was ice cold and really good. Had the naked wings. They were very good. Mozzarella bites were good. Fried pickles were awesome and there were a lot of them.  The chicken sliders were amazing.   Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Huge place. Lots of TVs to choose from. Traditional American fare but limited options. Everything was just OK. It didn't blow my skirt up but they didn't do anything wrong. Trout ok. Cosmopolitan ok. Just ok."}
{"text":"Myself and the wife stopped there after the car show. Was a little surprised on the garnets they were wearing. But should have figured. When we first walked in. The ladies at the counter where they seat you. Pretty much ignored us and we had to asked about being seated.  Once we sat down the service got better. The food was surprising good and so was the beer. They had a lot of tv's for sports. I will be going back when ever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you are going to order a Moscow Mule from this place, prepare for them to get your drivers license and not give it back until they make sure you didn't steal their cup. Seriously, not only is that so offensive (coz how dare this establishment assume I will steal their Moscow mule mug) but definitely not safe.  Imagine giving them your Drivers license that has your name, address and date of birth.. And then later provide them with your credit card?? That's a recipe for fraud right there. So not safe. So Twin Peaks, why should I trust you with my license and credit card and you insinuate I cannot be trusted with your Moscow mule mug?? Such an insult. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Tried out this new place in the neighborhood for lunch.The girls twin peaks are definitely highlighted in their uniforms! I found them to be very friendly and service was good. The decor is very lodge-y and tons of BiG TVs! Nice sports bar ambience.Had a cheeseburger and it was awesome! So good! BF had chicken fingers and they were good too.Fun new place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for beers on our last afternoon in Vegas.   The girls were dressed super skanky, but they were all very sweet. There were sports games playing on multiple screens throughout the place. I know nothing about sports, but one of the TVs had some crazy ice race thing going on, so that was nuts and moderately interesting for a minute. You might hear classic rock playing, but it's not so loud that you can't hear your friends. It's a decent enough place to chill for a beat.  Whatever you do, watch the Twin Peaks promotional videos. They're really funny.  The pricing wasn't bad at all, the service was quick and it was a clean restaurant. Beers were super cold (the glasses were frozen). We got a nice seat in the sun on the balcony with a good view (as good as it could be for the location of the restaurant).   As a side note, and I'm not counting this against them, there is absolutely NOTHING on the menu for v*gans (asterisking it so it won't show up in searches). It would, of course, be nice if they had something, but nowhere do they claim to have anything, so I can't fault them for it. I ordered chips and salsa because it was the only thing that looked veg. Hopefully there was no lard in the chips... But I'm not sure.  Overall, it's basically Hooters. Not the classiest joint on the strip but not bad. Just a place where the waitresses happen to be wearing a tad less than what might be considered typical."}
{"text":"Well this was our first time here and will probably be our last.  Went in for lunch on St. Patrick's Day and I felt like I was walking into a strip joint.  All the females were dressed in what looked like bras and panties....not quite a thong but their butt cheeks were hanging out.  Some had one fishnet stockings and others a garter belt with stockings.  I asked our waitress if management supplied them with their outfits or if they had to buy them.  She said they had to buy them and they have to dress up at least once a month and there are times when they have to wear the outfits for a week.   I dislike the fact that management is using these girls in a sexual way to get men in the door.  If I had known what type of a place this was I never would have gone there.  Let's just say that at least Hooters has some decorum, this place just looked trashy.  Oh and the food wasn't anything great, just average."}
{"text":"I usually go to this place when shopping at concord mills mall. I've been going there for 4yrs. The food is mediocre.  Beer is always cold. Services is usually fine except for one waitress. She use to work tables so you could avoid her by going to the bar. Every time I go she is just not friendly to anyone. I almost got into an argument with her because she's rude. Watched her treat customers pretty crappy around the bar. Waited 20-25mins for dessert...it wasn't crowded and when I asked about it she got snappy. Anyway I won't be going back."}
{"text":"\"All that is man\" ... in a little IKEA box.  The food is... meh.  I guess if you never see nothing but your fat ugly wife at home, I could see the appeal of the Breastaurant... But its another TGI Fridays, or Chili's... or Hooters, but in lumberjack form."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was very quick. Waitresses were great and even occasionally sat down at the tables to chat with there customers which is nice. Would go back"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow as far as drink refills go but that is my only complaint. The food was delicious and made up for it. Their billionaire bacon is on some next level shit"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for the coldest beer in town and sports. I gave this review a 5 star because the service is always on point and fantastic. Elizabeth was very friendly and attentive, the store manager touched our table just to greet us, we are never disappointed. The Pot Roast is a must, Pulled Pork Nachos are huge and a great portion for sharing. I've had their fish basket and it's great. The kids menu is also perfect for the kiddos. Speaking of they are always super nice to my kids. Great neighborhood hangout spot. Go hungry! They have a great happy hour with half off apps and drinks! And I forgot to mention, food arrives fast and hot."}
{"text":"My husband and i decided to try this place out on our first night in Vegas 4/3/14 We wanted a view so went up to the third floor only to be told we couldn't sit outside due to a private party. The waitress (Judith) was very friendly ordered our food but wow did it take forever specially the mozzarella cheese bites. Manager brought them herself and apologized. i got the red hot wings and my husbands got the BBQ wings i loved his more , but omg the fries are to die for defiantly recommend this place if you don't mind prices. pretty pricy $$$"}
{"text":"This is a unique restaurant it offers a sports bar type atmosphere and cozy hang out all in one. It is more of a men's restaurant but went with a couple friends for drinks and burger. It was surprisingly a great burger. Fresh and done the way I ordered it. With beer everything is better and we enjoyed the game and our evening. The server was great coming around whenever needed and kept the water full, the beer cold and running, and our team won."}
{"text":"Picture A Hooters Restaurant in a lumberjack's cabin.  That's Twin Peaks.  Denim booty shorts, cut off red flannel tops, and Uggs galore!  Our waitress was very sweet. I'm sure she was just excited to finally have another woman to talk to. The majority of their clientele is obviously of the male variety. While we were there we were probably the only women eating there.  The food was decent.  It's kind of funny because a lot of their food reminded me of food from other restaurants.  Their fried pickles were good and reminded me of Hooters.  Their fries were good and reminded me exactly of Red Robin.  Everything else was pretty non memorable. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and the bun was mushy and soggy.  I'm going to stick with Hooters.  Nothing personal."}
{"text":"First hostess had a personality like a 2x4. Then we waited at table for half hour with no service. Thirsty and needing to be somewhat timely to afford time to get to airport, we were forced to simply leave."}
{"text":"It's like Hooters with updated decor.  The inside is actually HUGE, with a really big patio, too. When we went (Thursday evening), there were a good amount of customers, but, because of the size, the place feels empty.  Service was prompt, if not overly-friendly.   Beer selection is decent and they're very cold (as advertised).  I had the steak salad, which was actually quite good, although I might ask for light dressing next time. My husband had the chicken fried steak and it was ENORMOUS. Seriously, like 4 chicken fried steaks all put together. It lays on top of the potatoes and veggies and totally covers them and the whole plate. And hangs off the sides of the plate. Whoa. I had a bite and the meat was good, just a little bland on the gravy side.  Overall, there's nothing to complain about, I just don't think it's special enough to earn one of our few nights out."}
{"text":"Bartenders were fast and friendly. Got the loaded tots and Sicilian. Way to much food for one person, but was so good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Natalie at the bar was awesome. Natalie let me special order my meal and it came the way I ordered it. Natalie was very friendly and attentive and never let my drink get vey low. I had a great time and looking forward to coming back and sitting at the bar with Natalie."}

{"text":"I've come here many times with the guy to hang out and usually get pretty good service but today was the exception.   The place was it's typical busy but not slammed busy.  We ordered drinks and some food with our waitress who seemed distracted.  It took about 30 min for the food to arrive as drinks got here just before that.   I got the wrong salad and no sauce came with the chicken wings.   We ordered more drinks and they took an additional 25 min and and then my salad finally came.   Still no sauce.  So we asked for a Mgr and his excuse on the drinks was \"we ran out of shot glasses\".  How does a bar run out of shot glasses?   When he was also told about the sauce and he said oh well I can get the sauce.   By now the wings are cold and we told him that.   He said ok I'll get too another order of wings.   He left and no one came to clear our table so we ended up clearing it ourselves to give us table room.   Needless to say it has now been 20 more min and they just arrived.  They might be having a rough night and I get it but that was too many things happening for one night"}
{"text":"Ahh my first \"Breastaurant\". And it was pretty darn satisfying. The place is new with a northwest hunting lodge motif. 2 stories, with the second story having an open deck and awesome view of the strip. The food was actually decent, better than most chains and I had a HUGE chicken poblano sandwich for $10.95. Oh did I forget to mention the place is staffed by tiny, super friendly, half naked tree-nymphs ? Seeing is believing. Stay thirsty my friends."}
{"text":"Out of all the breastaurant options out there, Twin Peaks is my champ as they are the most consistent in what they do well..  Twin Peaks Service:  Consistently good throughout my visits, the servers have always been friendly and great with checking back at the table.  I've never had to worry about getting another drink filled and everyone is upbeat which brings a good vibe. The kitchen gets the food out pretty quickly as well.  A couple of years, we did our fantasy football draft in the booths and they were all good about it.  They had outlets to plug our laptops in and we parked, drafted and drank for hours. Excellent  Twin Peaks Cuisine:  This is definitely bar food land, so stick to what they do best: burgers, chicken Wings, nachos, etc..  Salads and soups have been hit or miss with me.  The Hangover burger is my #1 burger here and fish and chips also work.  Be realistic of what you're ordering in your environment and all will be well.  The beers always get served Ice Cold.  I always order beer here (vs cocktails) on this alone.  Twin Peaks Ambiance:  The decor, server uniforms shoots for this mountain log cabin vibe and it works.  There's an awesome overkill of monitors and big screens to watch sporting events.  The rectangular main bar is huge and is stocked with everything you need to get your booze on.  If you have an issue with the servers being all female, wearing very short khaki shorts and tie up flannel shirts that expose the bare midriff, Twin Peaks is probably not for you.  Twin Peaks provides good: service, drinks, and basic bar foods to snack on.   The monitors makes it a great place for sporting events.  To expect anything else is unrealistic.  See you at the bar, cheers! =)"}
{"text":"I've often passed by Twin Peaks during my annual trips to Las Vegas but never stopped in for a bite or a drink until this past January 2018.  I was meeting someone and we wanted to decide where to go. He mentioned he didn't want any place really fancy. We also wanted some place on the Strip. It was my first evening in Las Vegas and I normally stop by Shake Shack and In-N-Out at least once during any trip to Las Vegas so those were two of my suggestions along with FatBurger. He mentioned Twin Peaks and asked if I've ever been there. I mentioned that I've never been there BUT I was familiar with the type of place (Hooters type place) and was fine with it in terms of food options and location.  We met inside Planet Hollywood Casino and walked over to Twin Peaks. Upon entering, the place was relatively busy so if we wanted a table, we would have to wait. We decided to eat/drink at the bar. We walked around and found 2 bar stools so we sat down.  We were provided with a menu which I quickly looked at and decided what I wanted. One of the hostesses (but not the \"main\" hostess who served us for the remainder of the evening) asked us if we wanted something to drink. I opted for a large Coors. My friend had a beer as well but decided not to order a large since you told me that he would probably have problems finishing it. She asked us if we wanted a tab and my friend said yes so I also said yes. She asked us for a credit card. Since we were paying separately, we both gave our credit cards. When she returned less than 1 minute later, she gave us our credit cards and put a bill/paper into each of the glasses in front of us.   Our hostess (Nicole) then showed up and brought our beer. We asked if we could order the food now and she took our orders. I don't remember what my friend ordered but I decided to go with the fish and chips. After Nicole took our orders, my friend told me that service would probably be slow. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long for our food orders.  I liked my fish and chips and decided to have another large Coors. The first thing I have to say about the beer is that it is ice cold. It is the coldest draft beer that I've ever had. I mean, there were ice crystals in the beer and even though it wasn't hot outside (after all, it was January in the evening), it really hit the spot. Nicole was very friendly and nice. She also dropped by during our meal and asked if everything was okay with our order.  The hostesses around the bar (including Nicole) were wearing bikinis, winter boots, and some type of fur hats. I'm not sure if this is the standard attire but based on the show \"Undercover Boss\", I was expecting the \"lumberjack\" motif/style.  After finishing, we decided to pay and leave. I decided to pay with cash whereas my friend decided to pay with his credit card that he had used with his tab. He asked Nicole if she needed his card again and she mentioned that it wasn't necessary.  I would have no problems returning here... although 2 days later after we ate at a burger place, my friend did ask me if I wanted to drop by here again for a drink and I mentioned no since I was full and wasn't feeling at 100% during my vacation."}
{"text":"I hate to leave anything less than five stars because I love Twin Peaks I just drove by this location for the first time wanted to come and watch some Sunday night football the hostess at the place wasn't that busy and after 15 minutes with no one showing up I got frustrated and left it's a Sunday night at 9 o'clock it was really slow and"}
{"text":"Well Jackie (hostess) was kinda snotty.  Yes snotty when I wanted a Snapchat but I'll let it slide this time cause I love this location and have been coming since Sabrina . The hot blonde   This time my food was good and service was great.   I love Linzy.   great service and an amazing smile.   Always happy   Beer is cold and girls are hot.   Much better then spring 2017"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and the service and food were great. We had the Venison chili and the Sicilian sandwiches. Would have lunch here again."}
{"text":"Ill make this quick and to the point. The food is good but not great for the money, i had fish tacos and they were tasty but not anything i would go through the hassle of parking, walking, and getting to this place to have again. I sat at the bar up stairs on the 3rd floor to watch some World Cup action. Lots of tv's and really glad they play the sound over the speakers to follow the announcers. The bar tender (i wish i remembered her name) was super sweet, and attentive with drinks and the food. I think if your looking for a place to check out the ladies working, and on the strip to watch a game then sure... this may be right up your alley. If your like me who likes a good bite (maybe a little less expensive, drinks) and just wants to watch some soccer action, a pub might be better for you. We had 2 fish taco plates, 3 beers, and a 7&7 and my bill was in the low $80's not exactly a budget lunch but to the right person they might not mind paying for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed. The cute little waitresses were not interested in serving a lone woman.  My food was not served according to my request.  They were poor at stopping to check even though they placed near the kitchen where they walked past frequently.  Guess I was masculine enough."}
{"text":"Cold beer great food good scenery what more can you ask for definitely a good place to come"}
{"text":"Gigi takes care of customers needs...very very good service.. drinks are great... perfect place to unwind"}
{"text":"Hit or miss food mixed with a staff that really hate their jobs.  If you can ignore those factors, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and shrimp and the teast was great but the services were awful and waitress was really rude. All tables were empty and they do not let us even have our food just push us to leave. Middle of food waitress came and gave us the check. She brought wrong drinks for us. I can say choosing this restaurant it was my bad for having a good food with my friends."}
{"text":"The service here is atrocious... It's completely non existent. Came for fight night and paid 40 dollars for a table only to go 45 minutes without getting greeted, a glass of water, a smile, NOTHING. It took me complaining to the GM for us to get a server over here, one who told us she was \"brand new\" I'm sorry, this is a busy night clearly.. Maybe you should have people with experience working the crowds.. Oh wait, they are all busy flirting around laughing with their friends then caring about customer service they should be providing. I'm bummed that I have to sit here til the fights are over because this place is a MESS. I would rather spend the money for the fight on paper view and watch it at home instead of ever coming here again."}
{"text":"Went here right after they opened. We arrived on a night that had a UFC fight showing. The first thing we were greeted with we \"THERE ARE NO SEATS LEFT!\" from the girl holding the door WAY before we were even there.  No wait time, etc.   I have been to the Twin Peaks on the Strip with GREAT results. The staff is great the food is great. This location needs to import some of the professionalism from that location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately me and THE LEAGUE OF MISFITS have lost interest in this place. The Misfits like to hangout from time to time. On two different occasions we experienced BAD customer service. Our first visit the waitress took our order then returned 30mins later and asked if we were ready to order. That made us laugh a little so we reordered our food. Stuff happens. #2 visit the waitress took our order then returned 45mins later and ask if we were ready to order. Mind you this is a different waitress this time around. Instead of getting the manager she got the head waitress who was as useless. At that moment one of the Misfits asked for the manager. He came over and did a top notch job. He took our orders and discounting our meals. The group decided to not spend  anymore money there. This place really needs to work on customer service."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. TJ the manager went above and beyond with a small issue we had. The food was fresh and tasty, will definitely return. Our server Smashley was great!"}
{"text":"29 degree beer was awesome.  The food was decent and the sites were relatively good.  The customer service though was slow and well frankly bland.  I realize you want to take your time at places like this and soak up the atmosphere, but I do want my beer, food, and bill in a timely manner.  Service was just slow."}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews but had to take time for this one.  Had an amazing experience.  Megan was one of the best servers I've had in my life.  Great Customer Service.  Highly recommended.  Try the chicken sliders."}
{"text":"This my (and my family's) favorite place to got. Service has never been bad (I come here pretty often). I looove chicken tenders here and wings! Also their blue cheese souse is the best ! Place is kids friendly and so it's a pretty good spot to go with you family or buddies. Love it !"}
{"text":"Had such high hopes for a casual dinner at this location been to other locations across the country and always had a good time. The experience at this location was awful! Bad food and terrible service, the only part of the night that we enjoyed was the beer was fresh and cold.. The disappointing part was no one seemed to to care, the manager passed our table a dozen times and never though to ask is how we were doing.  The server disappeared for long lengths of time and the place was more than half empty, she could not have been busy.  Will never return!"}
{"text":"I had the pot roast by recommendation from our Twin Peak Girl Courtney and it was Delicious. Our service was great and the drink glasses were never empty. You can bring the family or your buddies."}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good and the scenery is A+!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Everything was very tasty and really hit the spot. Service however was lacking. Waited almost 20 minutes for our drinks. Hardly saw our waitress, who never asked how everything was. Ordered a second drink from a totally different waitress about 2 minutes after food was delivered and got it about 5 minutes before we paid."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst.. everything tasted great and the servers were all scantily clad in flannel tops cropped below their boobies, and shorty short shorts.. so if that's a reason to go.. you're all good.   We started with a beer, and two margaritas. The 22 oz 'MAN SIZE' beer is $9.. the regular pint-glass sized margarita.. was $20. Yeah.. we found that out at the end of the meal. Wasn't a bad margarita, didn't taste like a $20 margarita though. I am aware that balancing the cocktail comes into play, thus not tasting too strong or too weak.. but one shot of tequila in a pint glass makes for a slightly weak, unbalanced margarita. So on to the food. Most prices are $20 and under for entrees.. good sized portions and quality tastes.   We started with the mini Bratwurst, called the 'AVERAGE JOE'S', I believe. 3 to an order, 3 of us, so good to share for a hungry group as we expected the main course to be filling. It was.   I had Pot Roast, perfect.. hard to mess that up, but if they did it would be a disaster. It was well cooked, not over cooked, and delicious. My two dinner companions had a Pablano Chicken Sandwich and the other, had a burger.. called the 'Twin Burger' . Both were really big sandwiches and both were served with Steak Fries. (I LOVE steak fries.. these were all under-cooked and not crispy.. ) We also ordered two small sides of mac and cheese that had bacon crumbles on them.. very good, nicely al dente.. not soggy and plenty of good cheese. These were like $2 sides are were plenty due to everything else we were eating.   All in all, if you are there, near Planet Hollywood.. check it out. It's not expensive, nothing to really wow you.. but nothing bad about the food. Filling and good. My only real complaint was the $20 Margaritas. (See Photo)  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Coldest beer in AZ for sure. Chicken tenders and BBQ nachos are my personal favorites, and their sliders are all really good. The patio is huge and you can smoke on it. Ask for Cassie she will take great care of you."}
{"text":"A great happy hours at Twin Peaks.  The extremely cold bar always under 31 degree and awesome waitress.  Our waitress \"Kim\" was awesomely cute and with great smile.  Cold beer, cute waitress and decent price.  What else do we ask for me?  I wish that I take a picture with \"Kim\" : )  I might go back again... someday."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, the food was good. The house wine was bitter, although my wife told the waitress it was fine, the beer was ok, but this is not the waitresses fault, beer is beer. We had the wings however napkins were never brought out so my wife had to go inside to get some. :( is that normal that your customers have to wait on themselves in your restaurant? Are your waitresses not aware that chicken wings are eaten with your fingers? The waitress we had (long dark hair) was not too attentive but again that is to be expected when it is a couple and not a table filled with just men in a place such as this. Sad they do not treat everyone equal. We all like sports which is why we stopped in to watch the baseball game. We were also sat at a table directly under the misters when there were several empty tables away from them.  Needless to say we will not return to your place of business. There are other places with good food but better service...The Tavern Grille for one....Excellent food, amazing service and very friendly staff and great prices!!!"}
{"text":"They keep changing what's on the menu for happy hour but I keep coming back for the cold beers! Good food. Good beer. Come in to watch any game on tv. I usually come in on Friday nights for late happy hour 9pm - close. Haley sat us the other day. Sweet gal. The manager Anjel is the best. She always coming around checking on everyone. Try the chicken wings tossed in jalapeÃ±o butter . Damn good!   Update. Late happy hour doesn't start til 10pm . Bone in chicken wings off happy hour too....Boooo I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"First let me say that the women there are beautiful !!! Our waitress was very friendly and welcomed us promptly , she went over the menu and told us her favorites and took a drink order and left us to decide on what we were going to eat , we started off with the appetizer sampler , which was actually quite good and large !! Buffalo tenders , fried pickles and fried Mozzarella nuggets which were the star !! Crispy on outside and firm with just the right amount of gooey!! ( the whole plate could be a meal ) next came the hangover burger , a little on the small side for a \"mans restaurant \" but tasty  and cooked med well ( no temp was offered) the fries were covered in some kinda of salt but were cold ( no biggie cuz the appetizer had enough fried food to last me awhile ) my friend had the meatloaf which he said was very bland and he didn't finish ( which is an odd thing, lol) no dessert cuz I was full but all in all , if beautiful girls and average food is your thing , this might just be the place for you !! Will I be back ??? Idk nothing stood out that I would crave or want to waste another trip here! So probably not ! It's not bad ,just not my taste !!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero star but the Bloody Mary's are amazing! All I can say is don't do it! Our food came out separately, like 20 minutes apart per plate and then the food was cold and dried out. Definitely nor Las Vegas quality."}
{"text":"\"She's got legs and she knows how to use them.\"  The girls at Twin Peaks have legs for days and they show them off with their short shorts. Add to that the plaid shirts, sports on the big TVs, cold beer and the look of a mountain lodge and you have a little slice of masculine heaven. Aside from the pleasent scenery you have some good food too. I came this past Tuesday for my first visit. I had an email coupon for a $5 Philly Cheese Steak with the purchase of a drink. How can I say no to that?  For my drink I ordered a Twin Peaks special known as Knotty Brunette. It came out tall and icey. They serve their beer at 29 degrees. Crazy cold. Perfect for a hot Vegas afternoon. This brown ale has a rich flavor with a nice balance of hops and malt. It all pairs well with the strong beef flavor of the cheese steak sandwich.  The sandwich was a good size. There was a fair amount of beef, grilled onions and bell peppers amd MUSHROOMS. It is so hard to find mushrooms on a Philly. I was very happy to see those little fungi on there. Oh yeah, and a lot cheese too. The meat was a little bit charred which provided a nice textural element and that beautiful char flavor that I love so very much. The sandwich was a little dry but overall satisfying. The fries on the side weren't half bad either. I don't really care for shoestring fries but they were well cooked and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Where I got frustrated on this night was waiting for my check. My server, Nia, came by to clear my table and asked how I was doing. She asked this a couple of times as I sat there with nothing left on the table but some water. I finally told her I was ready to settle my bill. I suppose she was waiting for me to order another beer. No go. I was too full at that point."}
{"text":"Food was very good, pretty good customer service, my husband and I placed a To-Go order 30 minutes before closing, they were friendly but I could still tell they were bothered we came so late (We were from out of town and didn't realize.) The food was good, my nachos had real grilled steak I was very happy. I'd order food to go again."}
{"text":"Nice place but a little confusing finding the entrance as it is in the back. The service is very slow, it took 25 minutes just to get a beer. The nachos were sub-par, but given it was only their 2nd week open I'm sure they will work out the flaws."}
{"text":"Invited to watch a UFC fight here by a friend, my hubby and I joined him. It was $10 pp to watch the fight, and we ordered food. Items ordered were a gigantic soft pretzel with a yummy beer-cheese dipping sauce and mustard, buffalo wings, grilled chicken sandwich with grilled poblano, side salad. Everything was very good. Our multiple waitresses, each scantily clad with either a lumberjack or rockabilly short shorts and push-up bra, we're all very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is noisy, to be expected of a sports bar. Would I return? Possibly, I love a good soft pretzel."}
{"text":"The girls are smokin hot!  The green chile meatloaf is awesome. Also the hangover burger is great."}
{"text":"In terms of food you can find better things to eat in Vegas.   But one must consider other factors when deciding to come to a place like this.   There is a view of a TV from every angle and almost every table.   Many scantily clad servers. On this particular visit I cannot say that anyone of them were friendly or look happy to be at work. The prices are fair and the food was acceptable."}
{"text":"This place is a complete dump. The food is awful and the servers are drug addicts. Never will I return."}
{"text":"Classic bait and switch.  You get lured in by gorgeous, friendly, flirty hostesses then you sit at the bar and get ignored by a morose, lugubrious, desultory, unhappy lady who is destined to work at Dennys"}
{"text":"Both times I have visited this restaurant I've had a great experience with the customer service and had amazing food. The out door patio is perfect during this beautiful weather to rehydrate your body with cold tasty beverages and refuel with amazing hamburgers & wings.  We sat around the fire pit after dinner and played corn hole to relax and talk about our adventures paddleboarding on the salt river.  I highly recommend the bacon  billionaire burger and dry rub spicy hot wings. The tall frosty beers were not bad either !"}
{"text":"Hooters in a log cabin on testosterone. Fun for the whole family. Well, maybe. At least the kids won't be bored. Every TV seems to be on a different station. Music is loud but not offensive. The chipotle chicken is great (unless you're on a low sodium diet). Much better than anything at Hooters. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I got good news and bad news.   First, the good news:   The best wings I've ever had. Meaty, moist, FLAVORFUL. I had a Thai flavor, delicious. The guy next to me had his wings \"naked and dry\" so no flavor other than chicken and he, too, said they were very tender. Best!  BE SURE TO ORDER NAKED, BONE-IN AND BAKED. YIU CHIISE THE SAUCE.   Now the bad news: another \"breastraunt\" where the chick bartenders can't stop f-ing with their hair...and then handling fruit for drinks and plates of food!  DISGUSTING!  If I can see this, why can't management?  Hmmmmm.  Come to think of it, I never saw a manager...during Sunday football...I guess they were busy...???  Maybe somebody from the county health department could have a look."}
{"text":"Chain restaurants!!!! Ugh! Mediocre food served by a waitstaff that must watch their weight. If you like Hooters, then you will love this place! 18 to 20 somethings in tight clothing serving cookie cutter food with beer so cold it is a slushy!!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow... Amazing experience. My first time here from visiting out of town. Our servers name was Daf... Beautiful and charming person with a great smile and personality. She walked me through all the different specials and was every helpful with drink selections and food options. If you're in the area come visit and ask for Daf. Super sweet person. Cheers"}
{"text":"Want to eat AND have the TV at your table? Then this is the place to be! Great place to watch sports. The food is average at best and even though the TVs are at your table, they are not HD. You end up trying to watch TV on one of the walls instead. Customer service was below average and it took awhile to find our server to pay the bill and took twice as long to sign for it.   I only recommend coming here for the big TVs at the bar for sports."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot or a great place to watch a game. Food is good but limited and the help is even better! This place is for the Al Bundy in all of us!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night drink and a snack. They have a climbing wall and for 10 dollars you get 3 tries and a free shirt if you make it to the top. They didn't seem to have a lot of info about it so we decided to pass.   The beers are cold and reasonable for Vegas. The selection is decent, there are good beers but not a huge selection. We also ordered the cheese bites and they were really good.   I'd stop here again to check out the third floor (it was closed) and maybe attempt the rock wall"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch  there food was great. A special  thanks to Brittney and Shey behind the bar.  They made lunch fun.  They are very professional at their jobs. I will go back again  soon."}
{"text":"Never had any issues with this location, or the franchise really.   The waitresses are friendly and attentive.   My favorite the Queso, and the chicken ranch sandwich!"}
{"text":"Waitress was not knowledgeable about pricing and drinks.  Let her know we were going to patio to smoke and come back to see all our food gone.  Manager never came to see us.  Very disappointed. Seems the issue is coming from hostesses.  Food was great but the experience made this one no good.  If you're willing to risk it I'd recommend the pulled pork nachos."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because it was literally steps away from the hotel where I stayed on a recent business trip. It was late-ish on a Tuesday night, and the place wasn't exactly hopping. But, our server was very friendly and attentive, the food was fine, and the beer was cold. They have an outdoor patio with tables that allow smoking, which of course blew my little Californian mind."}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer , 5 stars for the bacon, 1 star for the Mac and cheese. Service was great but the Mac and cheese was not, tasted too oily and bland. After ordering my M&C i was so disappointed that didn't ordered food and instead kept the dirty blondes coming. We got there right on time for happy hour (from 10-close) so instead of paying $6.50 we paid $4.50 for the man size beer. Is 2$ off drafts   Would I return again? Maybe but only for a beer."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a frosty pint with amazing views behind the bar and behind your seat. Head up to the top level bar for views of the strip. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was decent and I ate at the bar. The service was below average having to request silver ware and other simple things. The bartenders were not that busy and spent a lot of their time gossiping."}
{"text":"I have to say that the service and food were very good on our trip to watch the second half of the cards game.  However, the real reason for my post is to give a big shout out to the manager, David.  I left my iPhone on the patio (stupid me) and he went above and beyond to help me and my patient husband retrieve it.  We would come back here any time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a multiple floor bar/restaurant with tons of TVs everywhere. You can even do rock climbing. The food is pretty good, the girls are gorgeous. There is a blacony on the top floor that overlooks the strip. I'll probably come here every time I go to vegas."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since it open and have always enjoyed myself. I stopped in last night for dinner and a got a BIG SURPRISE when the bill came. They charge me for 3 refills on my ICE TEA (WTF)!! I was in a hurry and in such SHOCK i paid the bill a went on my way. I frequent both locations here in phoenix but will have to RETHINK...TILTED KILT here I come!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times for private events and it's been a decent experience. The rock wall is always fun to watch, but most people can't climb it if they are dressed to be out on the strip. I've sampled the food from buffets and they have always been pretty middle of the line. It's hard to know how long before it has been prepped for a private event. Overall, I don't mind it and the waitresses are attentive so I'll rate it right in the middle."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with the boys watch a game or bring a non jelous gf. Food is a bit over priced typical bar food nothing special."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and quality of food. Great to sit with friends (one noob) and amazing service. Food was finer licking good, and drinks were cold and frosty as per usual. Will definitely be back for more very soon. Milana was amazing!! Attentive and kept our drinks refreshed!! If I could give 6 stars... I would."}
{"text":"First time in and it was an experience.   I know the main attraction is the women and the sports. Decor was pretty cool but the reason for the stars is the service. Megan was our server and she was great! Very personable and enjoyable to chat with on a dead afternoon. She made the experience for us while we were there. Great recommendations on beer and food and really knew her stuff when it came to the beer menu for my father who was not a beer person.   Burger was typical berger you can get anyplace. Fries were good but the ICED COLD BEER stole it. Love how they keep it so cold so that it can be enjoyed just that much longer before you have to start to chug it so it doesn't get too warm, especially in the AZ heat."}
{"text":"I work at the location in Texas and I loved it here! The fire pit is an amazing asset to the lumber Jill look and the food is of course amazing! Beers are cold and girls are sweet! Only put down is being there with my family, I was greeted late by my waitress then she didn't tell the next girl we wanted to open another tab at shift change after we closed out. Second waitress was amazing though! Her name is Ashley and she remembered everyone's names and our drinks, very attentive and observant to her customers, loved it and hope to be apart of their location in the future!"}
{"text":"Good looking girls, terrible service, and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I love this location! Great food, good prices. They have really good Greek salad and veggie burger. We always get seated right away, and have good experiences with the waitresses. We love coming here during games to chill and enjoy a night together :)"}
{"text":"Wow! (owen wilson voice) What a great place to relax with beer and great food! Service? Even better!! My bartender Chelsey greeted me with a genuine welcome! Wow! (Owen Wilson voice) Short but stacked with service! She recommended some tasty options! Food came out quick and Liz checked in to make sure everything was served correctly! I WILL be back to this location!!!! Round of applause Twin Peaks Henderson!! Wow! (Owen Wilson voice)"}
{"text":"I came in late one night & sat at the bar. It took forever for the bartender to take my order, after 30 minuets I headed out the door, never got my food. really poor service this time.  (Next Visit) Way to pick up the ball & run with it Candice! Good job, fast service & really good food. Thanks again Andy for reaching out."}
{"text":"Went w friends for lunch. If you have concerns w noise or hearing problems. Don't go here. It was LOUD...Like night club loud at 2 pm. Now as for the food, it was ok. I'm hoping they served us lunch portions because for 14.00 I had one piece of fish & 3 shrimps, w a hand full of fries. I order fried pickles, they were on the salty side. So be careful. The service was good, I would say great but she checked on our table like 15 times. Needless to say I was annoyed. Over all a great lunch stop on the strip, not too busy."}
{"text":"Twin Peaks is a great bar with an excellent happy hour. It's convenient for most in the North Scottsdale area to have a bite and a few beers and just unwind. Lovely decor and cute bartenders. However, don't be fooled by it's name, Twin Peaks is a cult TV show and if you go in here looking for some Fandom and memorabilia, best turn around. All in all it's a comfy lodge bar with ice cold beer and good appetizers."}
{"text":"We did not go here for the peaks. We came for the wings. They are way pricey though and probably our last time unless someone is treating. I think $12-13 an order, and you will not be full. Beer selection is immense, though. Girls are all cute coeds in the famed mini clothing that keeps the bearded crowd happy while they spend too much on food. My friend got the pot roast and it was really good. Wings are good, just not for the cost. I think you are paying for the view at this place. Which may be enough for you."}
{"text":"Went here to try the wings, And beer of course. Let me set the scene..huge room decorated a la hunting lodge style. HUGE place. There are TVs on every wall AND in the booths! Yes, your own personal TV while you go out to socialize. (Kinda backwards). OK, well the menu is a bit limited. The wings were fair, some were still pink at the bone. But okay overall. The philly cheesesteak was good, poblano chicken sandwich okay. Problem is this, the bill was not good. $4.75 for 10 oz beers, another buck for the big one No pints available. Girlie or lumberjack sized only. The place is almost all guys, maybe two females in the whole place. It reminds me of how Hooters used to be before they announced it was a family restaurant. Girls have Daisy Dukes and sexy tied lumberjack shirts on stressing their mammary glands, They were cute and nice and talkative. Service was very good. Of course, a tip on a large bill like that would make me friendly, too. It was an experience. A very expensive one."}
{"text":"First time going here and was actually surprised the food was super good. Had some wings that were breaded garlic Parmesan and a Philly cheesesteak. Had one of their own beers on tap with an ice cold frozen mug that made the beer 1000 times more delicious. Our server misha was actually one of the best servers I ever had. Super personable and bubbly great attitude with great service,everything all together was awesome."}
{"text":"Great Burgers, Great drinks, and Great service! It's everything you want in a sports bar! They have lots of tvs and seating! Maybe I'll come hangout one day to watch my Panthers play!"}
{"text":"It's really just a wannabe Hooters or Tilted Kilt, but without any respectable food or service.  Service was slow the whole time.  The place was nearly empty and they had plenty of waitresses, but everything took forever anyways.  The menu is small and boring.  Burgers and sandwiches...and not even a lot of choices for burgers and sandwiches.  I had a bbq burger which was okay.  Overcooked a little bit.  The fries it came with were nice thick steak fries though.  I love steak fries.  The thing is....you can get a similar burger and fries down the road at red robin for cheaper and with better service.  Sure, Red Robin has screaming kids and less pretty waitresses, but it's still a better experience I think."}
{"text":"Yelp asks if this is a good family environment. To that I say yes! It is especially good for if you are celebrating your child's year end report card. If your he/she is used to seeing a few C's, B's, and mostly A's then Twin peaks is for your family.   In all seriousness, I was thoroughly unimpressed with this Rugged Cabin-turned-Sports bar restaurant. Yes, the servers are cute and friendly but when the food is lacking then it's just another Hooter's off brand.   The location has a huge bar smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and has at least 12 large flat screen tv's. In addition to that, every booth on the wall has a smaller tv you can control. All of the larger Tv's had a sports game playing and some had the same channel on side by side. Why would I want to watch a Teeny tv when i could turn my head and watch it playing over the bar? The answers is overkill. Too many tv's playing the same 4 channels.   We went during dinner time but the portions screamed lunch. We got a side of queso and chips plus boneless wings (I should say nuggets because these things were tiny. Like 2 bites tiny ) The queso was described on the menu as chipotle so I was expecting a kick but instead it was just very very watery cheese. Sorry- but queso is supposed to be thick and creamy! I don't think I ordered soup...  On the plus side, the philli cheese steak had good flavor and the bell peppers weren't too Wiltly. My blackened shrimp and chicken was okay but I would prefer my food not to be so salty. I'm sorry but i can't justify spending the money we did and not feeling fully satisfied.   Again, the service and view was not terrible however our appetizer \"wings\" did come out of the kitchen after our food. They were hot and fresh so I just assumed the kitchen was backed up.   At the request of my husband we will try this place again, maybe during lunch when the prices will hopefully mirror the portions. If it were up to me I would not be back."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and surely didn't get what I expected from Twin Peaks. Two employees basically started an argument with us and had security kick us out. No Manager was available,  it went straight from the employee to security. It left us a little baffled. As I was walking out, a hostess SLAPPED my hand!  I contacted the Manager & their corporate office and both did nothing! In fact, I found out three days after this incident,  the hostess that slapped me was promoted! I wrote an email to the corporate office and never heard back.  I know you're probably thinking about the other side of the story here, and there is another side, of course...my group did argue back after we were told to leave, mind you we were told to leave for no reason other than a bratty hostess. But, we were NOT the ones that escalated the situation,  or started the argument!  I've been to other Twin Peaks, and always told people about them, but having this done to me and seeing that girl prompted the SAME week, left a very sour taste in my mouth. We definitely won't be going back & I share my story often because this restaurant obviously promotes bad behavior!  Definitely won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"The wife and I walked from the Mirage to almost the end of the strip. We couldn't decide where to go eat, so we went to Hard Rock cafe. We were seated outside and waited to be greeted, which five minutes seemed like eternity. Lol! We were seated next to a table what looked like old wannabe rockers (not judging), but while we waited it was F.... this F.... that and talking about how great crack is. Trust me I curse like a sailor, but we up and bolted. So we ended up at Twin Peaks. The server was sweet and pleasant (Oh yea), my wife ordered the baked wings and I ordered the man blonde beer oh and a girl chicken buffalo salad. The food was ok but the beer and server were awesome. Lol!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Place with below freezing beer and scrumptious food. I've had the nachos and the hangover burger, both of which were 5 stars! Climb the steps and sit at the bar overlooking the Vegas Strip and enjoy...the waitresses are very hot!"}
{"text":"Drunken fun times is all I have to say!!   The restaurant itself has a woodsy cabin feel to it. Lots of TVs around the bar to watch whatever game is on. The servers have on sexy lumberjack looking outfits with their twin peaks, hence the name of the joint. It's pretty much standard bar food like wings and burgers. Their fried pickles were freaking delicious.   We came here with about 15 people. Our server was super sweet and easy going. She kept the drinks flowing and made sure we were taken care of. They do this little dance number and since I was pretty drunk, I decided to join them:) The bartender chick was another story, hence the one star taken off. We went up to the bar to get our drinks since our server was really busy with other tables. We order a shot of Tito's, a Divorce (one of their signature shots) and a vodka ginger ale. I was pretty drunk already but still managed to remember our drinks. The bartender asked me 3 times what it was that I ordered. And she was the sober one. Not so smart there, and it took her forever to make the Divorce because she had no idea what it was made with.   Anyway, I still had a good time. Fun place to hang out with your friends and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I really like coming to Twin Peaks before going to Studio Movie Grill.  Not only do I like \"great scenery,\"  but the beer is good too!  The outfits are cute and the girls are very friendly.   I decided to try this place before going to Studio Movie Grill and have been going ever since.  It's great for a quick beer and the food looks good too.  I tried their mozzarella sticks and they were delicious.    My only complaint would be that the service can be very slow and some of the girls don't know how to describe their beers. I usually know what I want to order anyways so it doesn't bother me, but waiting at a table for a waitress to come for a long time, does get annoying.    All in all, this place is great for some fun, good beer, food (mozzarella sticks),  and hot chicks.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for wings. The way they are smoked grilled, makes the chicken bursting with flavor without adding any sauce (although I do get some garlic parmesan sauce on the side). I have not tried any other food here, so I can't comment on the rest of their menu items. But they do serve a large variety of beer in big frosted mugs (the frosted mug is a nice touch, as it really makes a difference in taste and keeps that beer cold the entire time your drinking it). The atmosphere is what you would expect....pretty female waitresses/bartenders and lots of tv's tuned into the day's sports....overall, a very good bar."}
{"text":"Twin peaks went from a great date night, with amazing fire seasoned fries and nice big burgers to an absolute disappointment. The burgers are now very small and fries are now only seasoned with black pepper. I could have made this at home with ease. I miss all the flavor the food use to have!!! I guess I won't be coming back here anymore. Twin Peaks has become a generic burger spot. Sad because I truly use to love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a UFC fight night, the main event didn't happen, so the card wasn't particularly big.  Me and a friend get there, and we tell them two of our friends will be there in a few minutes, and they will pay their $10 cover.  The hostess warns me they could sell off my seats if they need to.  Understandable, but considering there was a bunch of empty seats, we tried our luck.  Five minutes later they sell off one of our seats.  My fault, they did warn me, but for some reason I figured they would have some customer service and at least warn me, to give me a chance to buy the other two seats.  That wasn't really the problem, it was really my fault.  What's pretty annoying, is my friends do end up coming...and half the damn restaurant was empty the WHOLE night!  So you sat a stranger with us, when there was four empty tables next to us!  It seems like they were purposefully trying to give us a hard time for not paying the whole cover up front.  They're just pretty rude when it comes to these kind of events, and I'm definitely not going back to this location for a fight night."}
{"text":"We went here right before our movie looking for something fun and simple. Very easy going with very chilled beer. We ordered the battered fish & chips and wings with classic sauce. Everything was good not amazing. We have no complaints about the food but it was alright."}
{"text":"This place is incredible...if you like great food, super-friendly eye candy...I mean service, and everyone there having a great time. The queso dip is to die for!! I had such a blast both times I went. I'm new to Scottsdale but by the end of the night I felt like I was out with a bunch of old friends. I'm even a fan of an L.A. team and I had people cheering with me for my team! Awesome place."}
{"text":"I came here this past weekend to watch a football game - Honestly I had never been to Twin Peaks until then so I had NO IDEA about their hootersesque vibe. Cute girls all dressed like mountain men, proudly displaying their uhhh well Twin Peaks! Perfect place for the boys to watch whatever sport they like and to ogle at the cute girls working there. Food wasn't bad - totally your typical bar food. I was obsessed with their spicy queso dip with the taco meat added, plus was they totally refilled our chips without even asking! I ordered their bloody mary which was legit, it even came with a slice of bacon. Loved when they asked my friend if he wanted a man sized or girl sized beer - perfection!"}
{"text":"Great food,  fun atmosphere,  and beautiful eye candy! What else can a man ask for!  Our server Erica was AWESOME! She went above and beyond to make my family feel right at home! Thanks ERICA! #FOODBEER&RACKS VR JT LA"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome! We got our food in a timely manner and it was great! No problems at all! Cant wait to come back again! Would def suggest for others to come here!   Princess and Pricilla are great!"}
{"text":"I love Twin Peaks, every time I come here I have a good time; good vibe and the coldest brews. Tina is awesome!"}
{"text":"Service from Hannah and Alissa (I'm probably spelling that wrong) at the bar was great. The made sure our special requests for food were met.  Food was served in a timely manner.  Burgers were nicely done and the seasoning on the fries was great. Beer selection is above average and the 29 degree beers on a hot day were a plus!  I would return."}
{"text":"Avoid. Horrible service. After being here for 15 minutes with no one even saying hi or stoping by or anything we left. No one cared we left. 1 star. Plenty of better places."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite.  Hostess attentive and courteous.  Sat for 10 minutes without any service.  Left and noticed 6 servers chatting it up at the front door.  Told hostess that I wasn't served and I was leaving and her response was \"no problem.\"  Clearly not a problem for me, but if TP continues, it will be for them.  Called to notify management and was told he was \"really busy.\"  I understand why.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday for an early lunch and my experience was just okay.   We literally got here at like 10:50 they open at 11. So we were greeted by the hostess that was running around almost in a panic to keep customers waiting out front until exactly 11am. Which in all fairness...keep your doors locked until 11 then. She could have been slightly more professional in her delivery of he \"we don't open until 11\" too .  Once 11am hit we were allowed in.  I enjoyed a burger and Bloody Mary and my friend had a beer and BLT both were delicious and our server was awesome, friendly and attentive.   I will for sure go back but will wait until after 11 lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw Twin Peaks on undercover boss many moons ago. After watching the show we wanted to try it. I'm glad we did!  Very cool place, almost like a hunters lodge. Two bars one inside one outside. We asked to sit outside, it wasn't fully outside, but we could feel the AC inside and the fans out in the patio made it feel good.   We found the menu very limited. Apps, burger, chicken sandwich, and lots of fried stuff. The drink menu was much larger then the food menu. We thought we would do apps and asked our server what she suggested. She told us the pulled pork nachos, or the app sampler.   We tried the app sampler, it has buffalo chicken tenders, fried pickles, and fried mozzarella bites. I also checked in on yelp and got a free chips and queso. My wife typically doesn't like fried mozzarella, and I don't like pickles so we were happy with options.   Well when the food shows up she is eating the mozzarella bites, and I'm eating the pickles. I have to say the mozzarella bites are by far the best I have ever had!  The pickles surprised me as they didn't have a strong pickle flavor. They had wings on the menu but they started at hot, and went up from their. The tenders were pretty warm, little to warm for me.   The queso, the free queso might I say, was so, so, so good!!!  It was a little spicy, but will get it next time we come. We saw several people get the pulled pork nachos and the looked amazing.   Honestly I was very worried when I saw the menu, but what we had was great and I would like to try several over things. Also I would love to come when it's cooler as they have fire pits outside!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their food, but there is no other place I have ever bin that serves the coldest iciest beers and you can't beat that with a million TVs everywhere"}
{"text":"We sat outside and had a bird's eye view IOC people on the strip. Made for good conversation. They also had the misting machines going. It was hot but not annoying. Our server was nice. Didn't hover at all. It's sorta like a hooters for lumberjacks. They sell the \"tops\" the servers wear. We came here for lunch in the day of a UFC fight.  The hostess told us if we states for the fight we'd have to pay a $15.00 cover ( soooo Vegas). We didn't stay nor did we plan to stay. I had the quesadillas and enjoyed then because they came with a blk bean pico de gallo and were seasoned well. It's an app not an entree but it was more than enough for me. My husband had the fish tacos which he liked. Not sure what kind of fish or was but he liked them. I felt like it took a whole for the food to come out but inguessvthat means they somewhat actually cooked it. The women's bathroom was clean and had 3 options for drying your hands. I thought that was interesting. Small menu."}
{"text":"I heard it was a nice place with awesome wings, so I decided to order some via phone. When I came to pick them up, they never received my order, therefore my wings wasn't ready. This will be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, COLD beer! Great combination.  Glad to see that there is finally a restaurant at this location that will last.  Would recommend ."}
{"text":"Music blowsssssssss. Change it up, it's putting everyone to sleep, maybe put on some modern music the girls can dance to? I'm a guy but I wouldn't mind listening to some pop music if it gets the girls movin. I've seen it where a good song will come on and they get excited. More please. More. Especially at happy hour, listening to Huey Lewis while I'm trying to get a buzz is a true buzz kill. Please fix"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at a Twin Peaks. The 1st was in Austin, TX. This one had the most unfriendly waitresses. Barely saw ours, even when needing our check. The other waitresses were clustered in the back or someplace where they couldn't be seen.  As for the food. I enjoyed a burger with fries. It was prepared the way it was described on the menu. But there is no reason for me to return to this location in Scottsdale. I can get a better burger elsewhere (Whataburger). I was hoping to see the waitresses. Not at this location, though."}
{"text":"We stopped by to check out the happy hour specials  They have a great draft selection on tap, and the beer was extremely cold.  I ended ip getting the Mom's Pot Roast, fantastic!!   We will be back"}
{"text":"Eh, it was alright.    Brother order the billionaire bacon burger and they should change the name (it's a really small burger).  I had the Sicilian and the bread was stale and the crust was really hard.... so hard that I couldn't even bite it.  Everyone at the table got fries and everyone's fries were stale.  It was really weird.    Beers were awesome, but you can't really mess that up.  I would go back for the \"views\" and beers, but probably wouldn't eat."}
{"text":"Adam and Drew kitchen and floor managers are awesome! Love the food and drinks here. Thanks Twin Peaks"}
{"text":"Good experience, I love the wings! Our server, Laken was very engaging, knowledgeable, nice, cute and fun."}
{"text":"My friends and I (male and female) decided to go to twin peaks for dinner on a Tuesday night. My male friends were on their way so it was just my girlfriend and I. We knew the atmosphere of the restaurant was skimpy girls and we didn't care we wanted to go for the experience and to try a new place. We walked in and the hostess seated 2 small groups of gentlemen right in front of us. We arrived at the hostess stand and the hostess told me it would be a 2 hour wait.. 2 HOUR.. as I looked around at the EMPTY waiting area I was confused and just assumed she had a brain fart. She took my number and I sat in the waiting area. Next a group of unattractive men walked in and as they approached the stand the hostess told them 30 minutes after she rolled her eyes as the group approached. Now I am not making assumptions but it looked like she was judging the group. The group of men left and as they left the hostesses giggled in each others ear as they headed out. 10 minutes into waiting a nice looking group of males walking in and were seated right away. At least point I didn't even want to spend my money on this pace. Attitude is everything in a business and the girls you hire with big pushups bras that are fresh out of high school clearly don't understand what customer service is. Will never return"}
{"text":"I recently went to twin peaks, and had a great experience. I had boneless wings and nachos! Our server Katelynn (from mesa) was very friendly and held conversation with us! Everyone seemed friendly but she defiantly stood out with her friendly demeanor! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Big televisions. Big beers. Big deebags.  Big boobs.  Food was adequate."}
{"text":"waited 45 minutes for nachos we never got. asked to close out and the manager informed us someone else probably ate them. he offered to get us something else but my time is more valuable. sucks because their food is actually pretty good but the complete lack of any experience and common sense is evident in the staff."}
{"text":"Located next to Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.   As an added bonus they have beer served at 29 degrees, that is quite chilly. I should also mention the scantily clad servers (That's for you who don't like much better food and 29 degree beer). Make sure to join the email club for great special offers, including a free meal during your birthday month! They often offer a discount if you have a tradeshow badge. Does it get better? Well worth a stop in. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}

{"text":"Do not recommend this place, unless it's happy hour. We went here to watch College football on opening night, thursday 9-3-15 and they had the audio for the whole place on the 49ers preseason game instead of major college football games like Utah-Michigan for Harbaughs debut. They refused to change it because of two sketchy regulars, despite the whole place being there to watch college football instead of meaningless preseason. They weren't phased by us leaving for another bar who would cater to the majority of their customers requests. Food is so-so and beer has chunks of ice in it. (I love a cold beer but who wants a frozen one that tasts flat?)"}
{"text":"It is such a busy place.  Parking was by luck.  When we got seated it was so hard to have good conversation, the place was so loud.  Ordered only an appretizer because it took too long to receive the nachos.  The pulled pork nachos were very GOOD, the portion was more than enough for five to share & the chips were crunchy NOT soggy.  We will return for the gin, tonic with lime & the nachos."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this bar while I was shopping at the Nordstrom Rack. First, I checked Yelp quickly to see what kind of food they served. Yelp indicated Twin Peaks is a sports bar. Little did I know that the waitresses here dress very sek-say. I was immediately uncomfortable once I walked in  Because I only saw a bunch of male customers. My shuttle driver should have mentioned this to me since he knew I was eating in the area. No worries though. The hostess and my waitress were both really nice. The girls were all wearing tiny flannel tops and extremely short jean shorts. Not one of them had an ounce of fat on their body so if you like that kind of thing,  you'll love this place.   The food here was absolutely awesome. I ordered the smoked chicken wings for 10.50. They were sooooo good. My waitress also allowed me to samples three of the sauces. The garlic parmesan sauce wasn't bad at all even though she said that it was really garlicky. The classic sauce was really spicy and I didn't try the jalapeno butter sauce  because it just didn't look appetizing.  This place has a great sports bar atmosphere with tons of TV's. Service was great. I don't remember the server's name but she had long pretty blonde hair."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato, no mustard or mayo. Burger gets to my table with everything on it. So i told the waitress, and she went and took it back, and told the kitchen crew. I get the burger back..... it has been scraped off. They used the same bun, so it still had plenty of mayo and mustard. So i went to a manager. Next thing I know, the waitress comes back with the burger with lettuce and tomato added. But the same bun! The only redeeming value at this point was that they comped it.   Fries, tea, and ranch were all really good. You could have kept a customer by just giving me what I ordered insted of being skimpy with the buns. But nope. I wont be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Twin Peaks and at first I was a little intimidated by the whole atmosphere. However I was pleasantly surprised! My server Julia was soooo friendly and easy going and I had a lot of fun talking to her! She was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food was great! Will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"We always have great service, the food is tasty and the beers are cold. It doesn't matter where we sit, there is always a view of the TV. We ALWAYS start with the Chipotle Queso and Chips with Venison Chili, it is so good. We have also tried every burger and I couldn't pick a favorite-they are all DELICIOUS. My husband loves the wings the most. This is our go to place for games and events and typically eat here once a week (we registered our emails and get dinner or drink coupons for a certain day just about every week)."}
{"text":"Wow! The food, customer service and gluten free options were outstanding. Nicoleyoley and Jazzy provided customer service with a smile and went out of their way to make sure we were always content."}
{"text":"Some people come here for the food. I come here for the scenery.   My co-worker picked this place to spend his last lunch with the office before moving back to Kansas. This was my first time here, so I had no clue what to expect. First off, the parking was a pain in the ass. We had to fight for a spot at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile parking lot, then walk 20 minutes (outside, then upstairs) to get to the restaurant. The restaurant had a lumberjack theme, with log furniture, moose heads plaques, fireplaces, and a massive 2-story rock climbing wall.   We were seated upstairs, overlooking the strip. I looked at the menu and decided to go with the philly cheese steak (rookie move). The servers are very prompt and the food came out fairly quickly. The cheesesteak that I ordered was massive, but it was mostly bread. The meat was seasoned with a pound of oregano, sauteed with mushrooms onions, and covered with more cheese than meat. Needless to say, this wasn't the best cheesesteak I've ever had... not even close. The fries on the other hand was delicious.Crispy, hot, and served with a special seasoning. I looked at my co-worker's foods and most of went with the burgers. They definitely looked amazing, which is probably my go-to next time.   Overall, it was a good experience. The servers are very friendly and attentive, the bathrooms are clean, the food was okay, and it was an unique atmosphere. There's a ton of TVs on the wall, so I'm pretty sure this is a great place for sporting events.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"Great service, food and cold beer.  Great staff and TV's everywhere."}
{"text":"We were a party of three. Food came to the table at different times, my order was delivered 5 minutes before the others. Food runner had no idea who got what and auctioned everything off at the table.  Our server appeared unpolished.  Also, does this place have something against blondes? I guess to sum it up... This place has an identity crisis. In an attempt to pull off fun and sexy with great food... It is transparently unmanaged.   Second star is for the TVs. Lots of them.  I edited this review and added a star as a result of he ownership's response. Im sure he heard the comments and will apply them constructively. I will pop in for lunch again and update."}
{"text":"I took my wife to eat at Twin Peaks after I had eaten in a South Carolina Twin Peaks. My wife and I were both happy with the service even though we arrived an hour before they closed. We were advised that we needed to order immediately if we wanted to eat because the kitchen was about to close. We ordered immediately and I ordered the wrong item. The waitress offered to give us the item at no charge and immediately resent our order without making us feel bad. The Beer was great and Ice cold. I cant say enough about the service out here. Thanks ladies for working so hard."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink, ended up eating, drinking and having a great time. The wings are HOT, meaty, and delicious. The sliders are bigger than expected and served on a fun little wooden plank.  The service was fast and all the ladies are beautiful. We had 3 smiling faces making sure we never ran out of drinks or food.  Save room for desert, their Rum sauce over ice cream can't be beat."}
{"text":"Well first I'll say we were greeted  as soon as we sat down. She took our orders in good timing.!  The food.....I thought Jesus himself fried the chicken strips and shrimp because for this to just be a restaurant  where tourist reside mostly and just a huge dive in bar..it was immaculate.   Our waitress AMBER!!! Was great she gave us our food right on time we didn't have a long wait at all. She had conversations with us instead of just asking if our food was ok and ran away. She gave us this form for us to sign up for their bday club and was able to get my friend her lunch entree for free since it was her bday even tho you had to wait at least a week for the bday club to activate.   That place is awesome ...I just wish we had on in SB!"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in for lunch and ordered the billionaire bacon burger. I have to say that was the best bacon I have ever had in my life. Absolutely delicious. My server's name was Sonia. She was very helpful, made me feel comfortable and took the time out to stop and hold a conversation with me. That is very rare at a lot of restaurants. The service was very attentive I never had to ask for a refill. My food was out quick. Plus every face in the building was friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I personally will be back to order this billionaire bacon burger again. Maybe I can just order a full plate of that amazing bacon. LOL."}
{"text":"If you want to go out to look a good looking girl that is all you will get. The order was not taken down correctly and we felt rushed when we were done with our meal. Food- if you want a decent meal skip it. We had the chicken fried steak that was flattened to the width of paper and lacked flavor. Our friend ordered the sliders and said they were not good as well."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the games, food is average to better than,  and the girls are hard working, and good looking.  Don't expect anything more an you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever paid for. The server was very nice and the manager was also nice and truthful, didn't try to act surprised about the food being terrible. On the bright side the drink was delicious."}
{"text":"Good to see that Ryan's was replaced by a pretty original place.  Geared more towards the guys, twin peaks has pretty much taken the best of other business models and taken it further with the feel of a Hooters, the novelty of the Tilted Kilt, but with a cozy - lumberjack, cabin in the woods vibe.  Twin peaks brings the \"man cave\" to you with a comfortable cabin setting and girls with some very flattering red flannel attire.  Located over by Concord Mills, I've only been for lunch - but it was a pretty solid lunch place.  Server was super nice and attentive.  I had a chicken sandwich and fries.  I was a bit excited to see that they have their own brand of ketchup (most likely Heinz that is relabeled) but fun anyway.  Had a conversation with our server about it.  TV's are everywhere, so I would imagine this place would get pretty packed for football or other sporting events."}
{"text":"I liked Twin Peaks.  The restaurant has a hunting lodge feel.  From any seat, you can see a TV screen to watch sports. The drinks are ice cold, the food is good.  I recommend the chips and chili dip for an appetizer.  Sooo good!  The wings were good, although I forget the sauce I got.  I also had a salad that was delicious and fresh.  Our server was a little bit slow and didn't come around as often as we needed her for drink refills.  The restaurant was full so I think she might have been busy?"}
{"text":"Not a bad bar to go to watch sports and enjoy some drinks. Although they have a lot of \"animal heads\" on the wall, Twin Peaks has a good atmosphere to enjoy watching sports. There are TVs all around the main bar and even mini TVs installed at individual booths.   Twin Peaks attracts a male crowd but my girlfriends and I don't mind going. The servers are all super friendly and the service isn't bad!   Food and drinks come out in a timely manner. I've had their appetizer platter, wings, and nachos. They have typical bar food... Good but nothing special.   I love the Bloody Marys here because it comes with a piece of peppered bacon. I could sit and order Bloody Marys all day for the bacon garnish! Their beer is a different story. I've gotten their Blonde ale but their beer is so cold that it has frozen chunks in it. Some people love it but I don't prefer beer ice cubes in my beer.   I've done the shot-ski here before twice with shots of fireball. Once the manager offered us a complimentary one and the other time we thought for some reason that it was an excellent idea. Quite entertaining!   I'll probably be back and will get the Bloody Mary. If you like bloodies (and bacon) I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to  this location five times. And it's fabulous every time.  Sabrina was our server last night.  Not only is SHE A 10.  But she is an excellent sever.  I love this place"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great service and cold beer! Unfortunately, it must have been summer vacation for the pre-schoolers...every infant and toddler in a 3 mile radius were out on the patio and in the bar.  Not a good atmosphere for a sports bar!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had lunch here last Friday. We thought that it was kind of a local brewery, but it's not really. The beer prices for regular beer were descent. The food prices were a little bit steep, but we got a TON of food. I ordered a basket of friend pickles and it was literally so full I couldn't eat even half of them. There had to be 50 to 60 friend pickle slices in my basket. The battering was really good on the pickles, lots of pepper. Very greasy though. My fiance got nachos and the pile was HUGE! They were good nachos with cilantro and higher grade food products as opposed to your typical chili, cheese sauce and jalapenos. The server was very friendly. She stopped by regularly to chat us up and talk about where we were from, how we were enjoying our food, and how the stay was."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went as a group lunch, unfortunately the service was horrible.  This is typically not the service we have received. We chose this restaurant for the atmosphere, but I believe our server was under the influence, and less than attentive to our all female table. When she approached nearby tables, all men of course her demeanor was a complete 360. Some of our meals and drinks were incorrect, and it was an inconvenience when we asked for the correction. When we asked for a manager we were dismissed. We finally had to go find a manager to get a meal replacement, but it was wrong the second time as well. The manager took care of our final bill, but one of my co workers did not get the opportunity to have lunch at all.   This will be the last time we visit this location."}
{"text":"I would like to say I have never been to twin peaks but am so glad I came here they have great food and our Bartender slash Waitress Selena was so nice and friendly not only is she Beautiful but she has a Great Personality also, I will for sure return again tomorrow to eat and to see Selena again!!!!"}
{"text":"We just got home from having dinner at Twin Peaks (TP) where we took our nephew who was in town from Ohio.  We were going to go to B.J.'s but he'd been there before so we thought we'd try TP.  My hubby & I had been there for drinks but not for food.  Hind sight is 20/20: should have gone to B.J.'s--been there many times and it is ALWAYS good.   Have done TP and won't do it again.  The service was less than average.  We had to wait a good half hour for our food.  The excuse:  there was a large party.  The \"large party\" that we saw was a group of about 10; the rest of the restaurant was not even  1/2 full and servers galore.  What was the problem here folks?  Plus when we ordered, hubby and I ordered a burger which came with fries.  When asked if we could substitute, the server showed us the list.  One of the selections was grilled asparagus; we specifically asked \"is that a true substitute\"; she said yes.  Yet when I was settling our tab, we were charged $1 each for the two selections.  THAT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE!  It wasn't the $2 extra charge; it's the principal.  The food was ho hum.  The asparagus was actually the best part of our meal!  How ironic.  The beers were pricey especially in comparison to the beers/prices next door!  Anyway, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.  Go to B.J.'s next door for truly awesome service, terrific beers, and great food!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but the food is not worthy of 3 stars. Don't eat here if you're hungry. This is the west coast Hooters."}
{"text":"I came down to this restaurant looking for Popeyes, but it's the same price, so we ended up here.  The price was average Vegas pricing but the quality and quantity was unexpected.   I got a house salad ($2.99) and cup of soup ($2.99) and it was larger than what I was expecting! Hard to beat a meal for $6.00 on the strip. Plenty of toppings on my salad. Soup was decent.  My friend got the fish tacos which she really liked ($14) and my other friend got the pulled pork nachos.   These nachos are under the \"bites\" section but it's actually a platter with enough food for four. Lots of toppings!"}
{"text":"My first and last time in a Twin Peaks. Couldn't get a drink, or order food. The bar\"tender\" disappeared and seemed non interested.

{"text":"Ok what can I saw about Twin Peaks? Umm there are young women barley wearing anything serving food and drinks. Think it would deserve 5 stars for a man right?? Well let's talk about this. For the overall concept of having attractive women wearing barely anything is great...just the quality of food and the prices is horrible!  First off, I've never been here before. It's hard for me to judge fairly based on a one time visit.   Anyways, on my fist visit I see that it's lingerie night because of Vday week.  So I was in for a shock when literally the servers all were wearing lingerie all over the restaurant.  I was with my wife, good friend and his gf and we were starving after hiking nearby Toms Thumb.  I think they all thought it was my idea to come here but I still swear that I needed to watch the UofA basketball game and Twin Peaks was one of the few bars with the Pac 12 network in the area. If you know anything about the Pac 12 network then you will believe me.lol..  Drinks were ok, service was great, but the selection of food was ridiculous. There are about 15 items for you to choose from. We had the chicken sandwich which was average. The big shocker was the price. Bill came out to around $50 for me and the wife having 2 drinks each and we split the sandwich. That was way more than I had expected. Our friends was like $65 because they had 2 sandwiches.  The drinks were very overpriced!  Bottom like, I don't think that Twin Peaks is worth the price you pay, yes even to have girls walking around in lingerie... I most likely will not be back. Needs to lower drink prices and open up some more menu items."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere ! There's a server named Brianda she's the sweetest ever !!! Def ask for her !"}
{"text":"In the grand cosmic narrative that is this life, I have to wonder why dogs got eight tits on average while humans only got two. It seems like we got shortchanged in this deal.    Now I'm not suggesting humans should have gotten eight boobs, not at all. Eight just seems a tad too many, but at least four would have been nice. Stay with me, my logic on this one is sound.  Let start with the first two.  These could be the working titties, the ones reserved for breast feeding and such. While the other two would be there purely for enjoyment. They'd be classed in the non working body parts group, kind of like a spleen or toenails or something.  That way, whenever a baby comes on the scene, there's no more argument over whose tits belong to whom. (A medium point sharpie could help eliminate any confusion)  Anyway, I don't know how I got off on the four-tit rant. Oh yeah, Twin Peaks.  I got a little drunk in here yesterday at their 2-7 happy hour.  The beers were cheap and the Daisy Duke costumes, even cheaper, with all that cleavage dangling about. Well after about three hours, I began seeing double, and that's when I took this whole existential pose on how humans may have gotten fucked in the grand scheme of things. At least as it relates to the tit department.   Come to Twin Peaks, get rip-roaring drunk and you'll probably reach the same conclusion I did. The chili con queso is delightful too.   Disclaimer: This only works if you have a propensity to see double when drunk."}
{"text":"Just three stars yes, but will I go here again, absolutely. NO doubt about it.  The staff is great and friendly the draft beer is COOOOOOOLD. This may be the coldest draft beer I have ever had in Arizona. The staff and the beer would merit at least three stars.  The food, well its ok. The wings are good with lots of meet on them, but the flavor is nothing to write home about. The real reason it only gets three stars is the prices for the food are higher than the quality merits.   But if you are looking for a place for a great cold beer and a \"talented\" wait staff, this is a place you will frequent often."}
{"text":"This is not about the food or drinks, because we didn't eat. Its about the theme, atmosphere, and employees.  We were hungry and looking for a place to eat in this area. I should have looked it up first, but I was enticed by the silly giant deer statue by the patio.   I was confused by the sign that offered a \"scenic view\" in the middle of a shopping center in Phoenix. As we parked, two large men, one looking like some sort of mafia bouncer, and another male employee were outside kind of yelling back and forth and swearing. My first thought was \"wow, it looks like going into a strip club\". And I was sort of right. Its like a lumberjack themed hooters.   The hostess was nice, lots of makeup, less of anything resembling clothing, because the women there are strippers with serving trays. (Except strippers make better money and don't get treated as shitty). We looked over the menu, and there was not an appealing option there. The food selection is limited, probably because most people go to drink and grope coeds.   Everyone male there looked crazy happy, and few women customers looked miserable. We waited a few minutes at our table and decided not to stay. It was too uncomfortable, we felt out of place, and the food options sucked. The managers or bouncers or whatever they were had this skeezy attitude when we walked by them. The waitresses and hostesses looked shocked that two women come in by themselves (since there weren't men there to convince us its \"because of the food\"). I felt a little bad leaving like that, I've worked at restaurants, I know what a pain it is when customers just up and leave, but if I want to pay for nearly naked women I'll go to a strip club."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice place and good food. Cool patio despite it being right next to some busy street action near the highway but we had a good time.  I had the hangover burger which had a fried egg, bacon, onions, cheese, lettuce, mayo and mustard and awesome fire fries. Would definitely come back for some of the other stuff they had - its definitely geared towards men - massive portions and not super healthy. We weren't in the mood for healthy so it didn't bother me much.  The servers are charming and certainly play their roll well with the men. As a woman, its hard not to stare at their boobs cause they really pop those girls up there in your face, but I guess that's the fun of it all!  This is totally personal but I am going to say it anyway - I wish the girls wouldn't wear so much makeup. I mean I know its that kind of environment and all, but if they went a bit more natural (since they are already scantily clad and for the most part good looking anyway) it would be so much more appealing. And yes, I know, I am not the target audience.  Anywho, liked it and my work buddies go all the time so I'm sure I'll go again."}

Even when it got crazy busy during the Seahawks and Cardinals game she made sure we were well taken care of. Thank you Karissa! We will definitely be back to see you."}
{"text":"I literally had the WORST restaurant experience in the past 10 years last night. If you like being called rude by the manager, having your appetizers show up 30 mins after you order them and your beer forgotten... you should go here. If you don't like that sort of thing, you should go somewhere else.   I also found it interesting that our first waitress' attitude changed as soon as she figured out we were a table of gays. Can't help but feel as though that had something to do with the crappy service we received from her.  Here are more details. Even after out waitress left our table mid drink order to get another table's drink when he asked her for it, we were never rude to her once nor called her out for that action. However, when I asked where my beer was 15 mins after ordering it (all others had been delivered) and when we told her we wanted to wait to order dinner until our last party member showed up, apparently that was rude. A new waitress showed up and said she didn't know why she was assigned to us. Right after her one of the managers showed up and asked if everything was okay and we told her that we were waiting for our appetizer and my beer. We asked where our other waitress went and the manager told us that she was taken off the table because she said we were being rude to her! What? Why would a manager tell you this even if it was true? Needless to say, we drank our beers, ate the appetizer and left. The experience as we were leaving with manager #2 is even more shocking but, since I didn't experience it first hand, I'll leave it to other members of our party to explain in a post of their own.  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are better quality establishments in the same area with better food and better service."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience! Nicole and Jazzy were wonderful! Nicole was our server and she was super attentive and friendly. The food was amazing! I'd recommend the new southern fried chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here several times.  The waitresses are always super friendly and on their toes.  The food is really good.  My favorites are the salads.  They are HUGE and I usually take 1/2 home with me.     Most importantly.... the on tap beers are super cold... almost slushy cold."}
{"text":"Was out in vegas this weekend and we came here to eat. We were a big party but got seated right away. To start we ordered drinks and some appetizers. We had mozzarella balls and fried pickles. They were very hot and good and you really can't go wrong. To order I had the hangover burger. A burger with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Can you really go wrong with that? Also had a side of fries. Service was fast and waitress was friendly and very helpful. The environment is also very chill and fun. You should give it a try when on the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Would be so much better if they turned down the lights a bit at night. Way too bright for a late night drinking spot!!"}
{"text":"On this visit I had the wings and a house salad.  They were skimpy on the dressing on the salad and asked for more.  The server said they normally charge but did not charge me for the dressing.   If they would put dressing on the salad like a normal place and not be skimpy so they can price gouge you, people would not ask for extra.  The wings were not bad, I had the chili parm sauce which was good but the wings themselves were just ok.  What I mean by that is the quality of the wings they use, there were several pieces that were fatty which tells me they don't go for high quality wings.    The salad itself was good even though I am 99% sure it was not organic.  This place gets a lot of business because of the staff they higher so the owner/manager is not really concerned about quality.  This place is more about the view anyway.  My friend loves this place so when we meet to talk about business this is where he likes to go.  It helps keep him focused most of the time."}
{"text":"Was here Saturday for the UFC fights, it was packed and the service was amazing.  Madison was our server and she was awesome...our drinks were never empty and she was by several times to check on us.  Tonight, Wednesday it was not crowded, we had Jackie as our server and I believe she did a good job but the kitchen and the manager dropped the ball.  We ordered food, I ordered something off the happy hour and then a burger.  My two friends ordered food as well.  Everything came out except my burger.  I asked her about the burger twice and was told it would be right out.  20 minutes passed and I finally told her to cancel my burger and take it off the bill.  She said she would and then she showed up at the table with the burger asking if I still wanted it saying the manager told her to ask.  I said no please take it off the bill.  Then the manager came out apologized and asked if I wanted something else on the house.  Being that we were done I said no thank you.  Then the bill came and guess what, the burger was still on the bill.  I told Jackie and she took the bill, then came back and asked if we wanted separate bills or just one.  We said one was fine.  10 minutes to get the bill and it still was wrong, that is just unacceptable.  At this point I don't know if it's Jackie or the management but they just don't have it together tonight.  Even my friend who comes her 3 or 4 times a week said it was the worst service he has ever seen here.  If I could give a zero I would."}
{"text":"If there was an option not to put stars, I wouldn't... My wife and I went here last night, we sat down and after 10 minutes we were never greeted, but you see all these waitresses gossiping and laughing between them, so we decide to get up & leave. I forgot my phone so we had to come back and the manager comes rushing down says, have you eaten already so we said no and then he says come on in, practically dragging us inside for what happend, we went ahead and ordered, we eat, got the bill and they charged us what we ordered. Believe me, is not about the money, we were under the impression that the manager was going to comp our check or a least gives us a discount for the inconvenience but we were wrong LOL. I end up paying the full amount. We defenatelly will never return to this twin peaks and any other twin peaks. Worst experience ever, I have been wanting to go to one of these places for the longest time and it really didn't meet our expectations at all, I don't have a doubt that this place won't last long."}
{"text":"This is a BREASTaurant    - Hooters with a mountain theme.  I already know this will be a sausage (venison?) fest with exclusively miserable husbands at the bar escaping with sports.  Ok this is where they started and went downhill from there.  1 - no gaming - good luck in Vegas franchise from Texas!  2 - young pups (hired for hair and implants and are exactly 21) who don't know how to pour a Manhattan or hold a crowd (lots if standing around and pouting).  3- supposed to be sexy but exactly one skinny body type - no bum no body diversity.  4.  Food sucked and was $$!   Beer slushies and wings on par with Denny's - yum yum.   This place has been 4 different concepts and this will die out soon too.  There is nothing at all interesting with food, beer, or girls.  The girls are sweet but this is a hot mess of trying to be sexy when we see more on billboards here!  Alienating 50 percent of the population with SIT2P bathrooms and terrible service to females as evidenced by many Yelp reviews in other cities -- not smart!   Ok I got accused of being jealous by a fellow Yelper.  Not true- there are lots of places with sexy gals that I love (PT's Gold, Treasures ;) but you also need to be a good bartender!  If you don't know where Firestone beer is from or where you get the venison in the chili from you are just eye candy.  There is nothing wrong with being sexy but if this is a dining spot and not a strip club then act like it!!  Food and service was worse than Hooters - I didn't know that was possible.  You don't really come to a place like this for anything but the girls. Unimpressed.  Grapes on a celery.  No curves :(  Arkansas Times agrees with me.  Epic bad.  They called it, \"The worst most apathetic swill I've ever eaten.\"  Ha ha ha yep!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Scottsdale location on two separate occasions within the past 2 months.  BOTH have been a total letdown.  While the facility was pretty well designed, and the food wasn't bad (pretty mediocre, but do you really expect it to be more) the service, from two different servers, was terrible.  It was ridiculously slow - it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to get a check so I could pay and leave, and the servers seemed to be completely uninterested in being there, much less in have me as a patron.  I don't think I will ever visit another Twin Peaks location."}
{"text":"Meh.. not impressed by this place at all. I met with a friend here for dinner since this Strip location was in the middle for both of us and they had a veggie burger on the menu. It's located in a strip mall type set up right next to Planet Hollywood. Once you walk in it's super gimmicky with all the girls dressed in basically a stripper meets a lumberjack type outfit. Can't forget the rock climbing wall either.   I first got a bad impression after we told the hostess we wanted to sit upstairs and she decided to sit us downstairs in a back corner. Why even ask if you don't take our request? My next bad impression came from the hot salsa that was served with our chips. I've never once in my life had hot salsa and I'm talking temperature hot, not spicy. We asked our waitress if we could get some chilled salsa or just room temp which she said wasn't possible. I'm pretty sure they had to heat it up in the first place so I don't understand why they couldn't cool it down.   The only thing semi decent about this place was the veggie burger, but other than that I would never come back here. Go someone else for the price that's worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their great happy hour menu and beer specials. My bartenders Nicoley and Selena were amazing and gorgeous. They kept the atmosphere fun the whole time we were there. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Isabella was great!!! I had the steak salad and it was awesome:) the manager checked on us and the entire staff was friendly! The place was packed and everyone was having a great time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times before I finally had to Yelp a warning. The food is over cooked yet cold every time, no matter what you order. How is this a thing?!    The service is the worst I've had in a neighborhood bar. Yes, the girls are hot, but could you also take my order and bring me a beer in between taking selfies and playing with  your hair extensions?    I'm hella easy going, but the food and service was so crappy I forced our group up to my watering hole, Born and Raised.  After that, Twin Peaks will not see any of them again. And definitely not me."}
{"text":"I am writing another review to say that we went back to try again after a bad experience a few months ago and this time it was flawless! Thanks to the best server in town.... Blessing! She was so on her game.... it made our experience so much better.  We really appreciated the manager this time too! We called him over to tell him how great our server, Blessing was.  The food was good too, it came out on time and hot.  Definitely regained our confidence in this establishment and now we can look forward to going back! Thanks Twin Peaks for caring about your reputation! Smart organization!"}
{"text":"Fun place to have a drink/burger. Had a great time here with the wife!  I also enjoyed the waitress watching, lol ."}
{"text":"Only been here a few times. I've tried their burgers & nachos, those were really bomb. what I like about this place is they have the coldest freakin beer on tap, so cold, ice starts to form on top. Major plus. Wings are expensive, haven't tried them yet, but they def look very good so will  try those next time I go."}
{"text":"This place just opened, so we wanted to check it out.  We've never been to any other Twin Peaks in the area, so it was a first for us.  The decor is pretty nice...very hunting lodgish...lots of wood and outdoorsy stuff around.  There are TV's everywhere, and I mean, EVERYWHERE!  We were sitting in a booth, and had our own private TV...pretty cool!  One thing, I am short, so I do not like hightop tables.  The problem is, they only have hightops, no regular tables.  They do have booths, but if they were full, I would leave.  Our server, Brittney, was very friendly.  I only have nice things to say about her, so any criticism I may say, was out of her hands.  I ordered a smoky BBQ burger, hubby ordered fish n'chips.  I requested that no chipotle mayo be on my burger...of course, it came with the mayo slathered on it.  Unfortunately, I had to send my burger back to get it corrected.  While I waited, my hubby ended up finishing his meal, which he ate slowly. (He did say that the fish portion was pretty small, but there were a lot of fries.)  He then decided to order a dessert, bread pudding.  After a few minutes, the bread pudding was brought out, he ate it (I had a bite and it was very, very good).  He was finished with the bread pudding, and the plate was already taken away, when my burger finally arrived.  It was fine, a little too salty, but I was hungry.  Was it the best burger I've ever had?  Nope, it wasn't.  Personally, it wasn't worth the waiting for it.  If I had known, I would have cancelled it and just shared the bread pudding with hubby.  But, I will say, the fries were really good!  All in all, it wasn't the best experience we've had.  I know they've only been open for a short time, so we'll probably wait awhile and try it again.  Hopefully, the kinks will be fixed and things will run smoother."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, it was pretty good. We ordered the queso(5stars), the chicken ranch sandwich(4 stars), and some wings(3stars). I used to love twin peaks but recently if feels a little run down. I think the server attire is a huge part. It used to be nice and classy but all of the servers looked pretty trashy when I went yesterday; it seemed they were working at a strip club in a bad part of town, not the least bit classy. It was a little disappointing since I usually enjoy going to TP but it was just raunchy this time and weird to look at. I think they should go back to their old uniforms ASAP!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Twin Peaks.  The pot roast is the dish to order and Hailey is the server to ask- great service with a smile."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying I had no clue about the, ummm, waitresses here. Not that I minded at all, but it was just a little funny (and uncomfortable) when I walked in here with my friend who was here from out of town & staying at a hotel close by. I suggested this place not knowing anything about it, and yes, I blushed when we walked in.   This place is pretty solid, though. Both the food and service were good. We came in right as HH was ending, so we didn't get to take advantage of that, but I know they have drink specials & I believe food specials as well.   I've always said that I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars/restaurants so I liked that whole \"lodge\" vibe at Twin Peaks.   As far as food goes I had the fish tacos and they were solid. They give you a ton of food here. I had three tacos that came w/chips & salsa. They tacos had a bit of kick to them, but were tasty. We also split an order of queso dip, which was yummy.  At the end of the day Twin Peaks is a pretty solid restaurant. It's different than most other places in this area and I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Pretty much come here now and then when there's a good sports game, specifically NFL.   Environment: most people here come to drink, socialize with friends and watch sport. It gets pretty loud, but if you want the whole fan cheering, it is a good place to go. Be careful though, if there's an opposing team, it can get rowdy. I actually came here to draft my NFL fantasy team 2 years in a row, it is actually a fun location to get this done and smack on friends. Also, they have cool stuffed animal decorations and have a cabin lodge feel.  Service: attractive girls wearing little clothes serving you food and drinks, anyone can enjoy that. Most of them are actually super friendly. They made sure to show my group of friends a good time, gave us our food quickly, and kept our beer belly replenished.  Food and drinks: The food is bar food... it is delicious but mostly fried. Lots of beer options and they have plenty of deals for cheap shots and mixed drinks.  Overall, always a good time here. The food and drinks are good, but the mood really gets people fun, relaxed and pumped for some sports action."}
{"text":"Came back to Twin peaks to watch football and have some food. The food is good and good size portions, we could not finish it all.   The missing 2 stars is for the waitress who seemed to be more bothered that she actually had to serve someone instead of talking with the male manage that night.    Grant it, I do not expect 5 star service, but you could pretend to do your job!  I travel to Vegas regularly for work and I like the Peaks because they have lots of room and TV's. Hopefully I get a better server next time?"}
{"text":"Was hoping to find a great place for friendly service good food and cold beer well 2 out of 3 ant bad, beer was very cold and my fries very good.                          But the service was terrible, it was like they didn't even want us there, no eye contact no can I get you anything else, sorry but when you make customers feel like there wasting your time well I'm wasting my time being there.                                                            Sorry twin peaks I was looking for a great place not here, will not return."}
{"text":"If you're gonna stop by Twin Peaks in Concord, NC (and I recommend that you do), make sure you stop by and ask for/see Meg... she F'N rocks BIG TIME! Meg's usually at one of Twin Peaks' bars (inside or on the patio) and is the one to go to! Meg's hardcore and does her job well! She almost sliced her own finger off last week and barely batted an eye (that's BADASS) in the process! Good job, Meg! =D         Meg doesn't play favorites either and treats ALL of her customers on a \"first come, first serve basis.\" Some bartenders in Concord treat their regular customers on a 'familiarity basis' and get to them whenever they feel like it. Meg doesn't do that: She can (and does) work a full bar like no one's business and makes sure everyone feels welcomed and appreciated. She'll also remember what your preferred drink is and *ask if you'd like another one instead of 'assuming' that that's what you want to have.           If I owned my own bar I'd definitely want someone of Meg's caliber working for me (she rocks!) and tending to my customers!         Stop by and ask for/see Meg! You won't regret it!  ~Allen"}
{"text":"Always come here to watch sports. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good prices. Good time to be had by all. The pulled pork nachos are great!"}
{"text":"Great place, nice people & good music... oh yeah, the food is really good...especially when it's served by the Shaqinator"}
{"text":"I don't come to Twin Peaks often, but when I do I usually enjoy it. The beer is always cold, which for the style of beer they typically serve is preferable. The food is always excellent too. My favorite is the pulled pork nachos. It is big enough for two people and one of the less expensive items on the menu. They frequently have \"themes\" where the staff dresses up in whatever the theme is, but that doesn't draw me in. What drew me in last visit was the advertisement of 2 oz of Samuel Adams Utopia plus the taster glass for $20. I called to verify it was at the location prior to going and once confirmed I immediately headed out. $10/oz for that is good, the food is excellent, and the staff friendly. How could I go wrong?"}
{"text":"I have a friend who lives in Scottsdale and when we meet up for drinks close to his apartment this is where we go. This is a good spot that is conveniently located right off 101 & Frank Lloyd Wright exit. Same type of theme as Hooters or Tilted Kilt, but I like it more. I have yet to have any food there that was not good. My typical order is the average joes - three small slider-type hot dogs.  If you want to go big order the BBQ pulled pork nachos - amazing! (and cheap). The chicken-fried chicken is what my friend usually orders. I have not had it myself, but it is huge and he always orders it.  The last time we went we had a friend from out of town that ordered fried pickles and the Hangover burger. He enjoyed both. The bread pudding is an excellent choice for dessert. They have a large selection of beer, but they also have their own; I prefer the Nutty Brunette. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I recently went to this twin peak location and I had two negative experiences.  My cold buffalo wings appetizer came after the main course meals.  Unfortunately the chicken fried steak meal was dry and tasteless.  I did not need to complain for them to acknowledge they messed up but to still decide to serve cold wings"}
{"text":"We went in quite late on a quite night, the server seemed distant to our table, my friends really enjoyed the steak, my chipotle chicken was tasty but dry. It took our server forever to bring our drinks, never bothered to come around ask for refills. I had to walk to the bar to order a second drink whilst our server was chatting to a table right next to us!! I will not visit this place again"}
{"text":"Meh, similar to Titlted Kilt and in some ways Hooters...Come here to see large breasted women in skimpy outfits (I saw an older advertisement that said all their servers would be dressed in black lingerie to celebrate black Friday last November) and tons of screens for watching sports.  This place has a rustic feel to it, with the structure of the building featuring lots of bare woods and logs, there's stuffed and mounted wildlife on the walls; and the tables, chairs and other furniture is made of tree branches and wood.   While the food I had here was good (I had the soft pretzel appetizer with cheese and mustard dipping sauces and a sandwich), I found the menu and beer selection to both be surprisingly limited.  Expand on the food choices especially, and I'd definitely increase a star."}
{"text":"Came here after eating brunch to watch the Notre Dame game in the upstairs bar. Since we had just eaten we had planned to drink only. They were kind enough to put the game on the tv in front of us, but other than that service left something to be desired. We must not have been spending enough money or drinking fast enough because the bartender seemed annoyed anytime we asked for another drink. For marketing as a \"sports bar\", I would think people coming in just to drink would be the norm but guess not! Left at half time and went to a different sports bar for the second half."}
{"text":"I work in the area, came by after work around 3 to come get a few beers at the bar. And the place was empty expt for the bar which only had a person in every other seat. And there was no room for me to sit at the bar and have a beer because everyone was taking a spot up everyother seat.. so I left... shitty customer service. Little issues matter. I do work in the area and will never return for lunch or a beer because your shitty service. I used to live across from the Tempe location great food and service sometimes busy. You guys suck"}
{"text":"The appeal here has to be the ta ta's cause it ain't the food, speaking of food took FOREVER for it to come out and the restaurant was barely full. I will give them credit because the manager did apologize for the service and discounted our meal. The view of the strip from the deck was awesome though!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas to celebrate a wedding and a birthday and were looking for a place to go that had good food and wasn't crazy expensive. We stumbled upon twin peaks as we were wandering and decided to check it out. The food was affordable and everyone found something they would order so we sat down.   We were sat on the balcony over looking the strip and ordered some beers. Our waitress julissa (spelling?) was awesome. She was very attentive, nice and didn't even give us a dirty look when we asked for separate checks. I ordered the steak and was pretty impressed with how good it was for how non expensive it was. All 6 of my friends made it a point to mention that they felt the same way. Would definitely eat here again and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good. They no longer have the double cheese that I got the last couple years, but the philly was good too. Prices aren't too bad on food. I'm not sure about beers. We could watch about 7 or 8 different tvs, but they were all playing the same football game."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went out for dinner here. The service was good, not excellent. Camille seemed to be rushed and some what flustered. The food was delicious but it did take a while to get it. Which was okay as the hubby and I were chatting.   I was disturbed by one thing during our visit. Watching the tables get bussed from one guest so the next could be served. The buser cleaned the table, however, he left the plates and silverware on the table that had not been used from previous guests. This is a health risk. Guests touch those plates and silverware moving them around etc. Clean sets should be placed on the table each time it is cleaned off no matter if they were used or not. We will be back but will be for sure to request fresh appetizer plates."}
{"text":"This place is really good hot girls, great food, cold drinks. And a very good atmosphere plenty of tv's, Even outdoor area with a fire pit. Definitely a good place to meet with friends for a game or drinks. Appetizers are great, waitresses very friendly."}
{"text":"This will be an easy review to write.   It's a large sports bar with a ton of TVs, large patio, and plenty of pretty girls.  The food is good, the beer is very cold, and the servers are attentive.   Speaking of the servers - I'm just gonna go ahead and say it - they all have huge and amazing racks.  It's probably the number 1 women-objectifying establishment currently going - at least as far as boobs go. But we all know another newer and better place will come along and Twin Peaks will go the way of Hooters and Tilted Kilt.   Honestly, I wish this place was was still Earl's.   I got all the big boobs I need waiting for me at home."}
{"text":"Service was cool. Didn't have to wait at all got a table. If you want to get in and out before the crowd I suggest come early. I had a burger and Moscow Mule they were not shy on the liquor in my drink. The waitress was nice and other waitresses would check in as they walked by unlike my location back home."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The FOOD is amazing. My wife and I go all over Phoenix and eat out! We are severe critics about what we eat and the places we eat.  No matter the atmosphere, twin peaks has, hands down the best food around. It's precise quality. When we eat out, we remember, we compare and just have to say the food we had was perfect.  Chips and queso are the best in the valley, the burgers are JUST RIGHT!, the fries, perfect. The mozzarella smackers, totally awesome, perfect proportion."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great food menu. I think it's an excellent place to catch the game and enjoy a nice menu."}
{"text":"I came early to beat the rush with a client.  We were greeted nicely and was fairly quickly.  Our server seemed off and after we had ordered she never came back to check on our food or refill our drinks until we were done eating.  My client told me he comes here a lot and has never had this issue, otherwise I would have given this a 2.  Maybe I will bring him back here for a second try."}
{"text":"Pros -   nice scenery (you know why you're here) decent customer service, if a little forced Honey Badger shot was super yummy ambience is better than average for a sports bar house beers are not bad   Cons -   very small and unhealthy menu, food was very so-so shots are $11 bill for 2 was 100 bucks which is kinda crazy for a sports bar  Overall, a bit mediocre and overpriced, but I would come here again.  It's a laid back place to start off your night."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends... Briefly !  Amazing waitresses!!!! (5 stars)  Time for food arrival - (40 minutes) two burgers(1 star)  Burger quality - (1 star)  Service (1 star)  Won't come again"}
{"text":"Thanks a lot for the horrible experience Twin Peaks Restaurant. Went last night to see the ufc fight,  have some drinks and food.     3 seats down from where me and my husband were,  your lousy rent a cops came over due to a fight. Instead of throwing the trouble makers out, your pathetic security were fist bumping them and saying to calm down.  Guess what....they didn't calm down.  FULL BLOWN BRAWL WITH POLICE, PATRONS RUNNING AND CHAOS .  We paid all nights for drinks, food and cover to not see the main ufc event that but worse havr our lives put in jeopardy.  lousy security and end of experience but I will say your food has always been great. Fried pickers, blackened ck quesadillas,  and  burgers are the best I've had on this side of town.  Service  you the girls is always great. it's sad your hired security don't do their jobs on these big. event nights and it reflects totally on YOU."}
{"text":"Great service and food at twin peaks. Haven't been to this location and came with friends for lunch. Shelby and Krystal provided great service! Very cool, attentive staff. Had a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Great location and setup. Drinks are solid, food is decent for bar food but could be better"}
{"text":"Being from Canada, I find it amazing to see chain restaurants delivering consistency when it comes to food and service. Twin Peaks is a chain I've wanted to check out for years and finally got a chance to go on my last Vegas visit.   My girlfriend and I went to the location on the Strip, adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile row of shops and restaurants - a top-tier area if you're on the hunt for a bite to eat. You're never out of reach of solid dining options when you hit the Strip; at the time, we were just craving a snack between drinks and I thoroughly believe we came to the right spot!  The service was friendly and hospitable the second we walked through the doors here! The good-looking servers donning a smile gave us tips on the food and drink menus and kept dropping by to see if we were satisfied with our orders. A big central oval bar here means you're never too far from a refreshing pint of cold beer! The girlfriend and I decided on a couple cold brews - the hefeweizen was quite welcome after dealing with the blistering heat outside - and two wing flavours - JalapeÃ±o Butter and Spicy Thai Chili. The JalapeÃ±o Butter wings were coated in a buttery sauce, not too spicy, but just right! The Spicy Thai Chili were our favourites and would be contenders in the top 10 wings I've ever eaten in my life; everyone needs to try this flavour here at least once!   Despite the restaurant being mostly empty when we went, the few other diners seemed to enjoy their cold brews, big pub-style burgers, and chatting up the servers, who were not only nice to chat with, but also quick and efficient. Of course there are better options nearby - it's Vegas - but give Twin Peaks a shot and I bet you'll leave with a good impression!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after passing it so many times while in Vegas. Well I should have kept walking lol this place is not all that great, well at least the food isn't. The plus is that they have a ton of tvs. The food detailed in the menu is nothing compared to what is served. I got the double stacked steak nachos and I could have counted with my hands the number of steak there was. It was all chips and some cheese with some old guacamole on top. The wings were alright. It wasn't even busy. Can't imagine going there when it's busy."}
{"text":"Most if the time when I come into these sports bars we get pops service. This time we got a waitress named Sarah that was on top of her game. Refills were consistent. The food was decent and plenty of tvs with the game on. I would definitely come watch football here again."}
{"text":"My pops, wife, and I came here for a lunch today and was impressed. The place is clean, staff was friendly, and the wait for the food wasn't long. The waiteress was friendly knowledgeable. The only downfall to thus place in my opinion was the volume level of the music. Even at tge table we had to talk loud to hear eachother. Cool for a weekend night, but lunch during the day on a week day....too loud.   The wife had the cheese burger and fries, cooked perfect and she loved it. Pops had the chicken fried steak, he loved it. I had the philly cheesesteak, and oh wow!!!! One of my favorite cheesesteak in town now. Bursting with flavors.   I recommend this place without a doubt."}
{"text":"This place is awesome mostly because of its location.  You can sit outdoors and watch the commotion of the strip below.  We had a great time watching drunken tourists stumble by.  The food itself is nothing memorable.    Ultimately, if you're looking for good food, move along.  If you want a place central on the strip that's easy to get to and has a good view for a semi normal price, this is a good stop."}
{"text":"Great selection of ice cold beer. Food menu is basic but this is not the kind of place we would go to expecting five star menu and food. Its all about the beer and the beautiful staff. Nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"BOOBIES, BEER, and a bunch of tv's. We came during happy hour and it was definitely good times. The cheese bites & chicken tenders are bomb. The beer is below 30 degrees. SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff decent food.  Ordered garlic wings and wow we're they loaded with garlic.  It was inedible to me and the people in my group.  The good news was they brought different wings without any hassle.  5 stars for great customer service.  Way to go Brittany I"}
{"text":"Twin peaks is an amazing place with an awesome atmosphere. The bartender Haley always takes great care of us!"}
{"text":"In the beginning, there was Hooters (were Hooters?). Though they were good, it was not, if you get my drift. If you don't, just carry on. Over time, Hooters grew, and this could also be seen as good. And this is going downhill fast. So we will move on.  Over time, others came onto the scene. In Charlotte, it meant Bikinis. Not impressive in their first incarnation, and better in their second. Then Tilted Kilt. Better still. Finally, Twin Peaks. Truly a destination that everyone can enjoy. For the most part.  Sure, this is not for every meal. You have televisions everywhere and they do not interfere with your conversation. There is a massive bar down the middle. It is a lodge atmosphere. There are women sporting cleavage. But their uniforms are mostly tasteful, and perhaps most important - they coordinate, both with each other and the surroundings. In a lodge? You need lumberjacks! Plaid tops and khaki bottoms. They accessorize with belts, boots and colorful socks. But the basic uniforms match, unlike other places (ahem - Bikinis).  Service was excellent all around, which I'm sure will draw comparisons to other not-so-savory locales, but hey, it is what it is. Food quality is good, but some items are better than others. Taco appetizers are not worth it, while the hangover burger is one of the better items I've had around town."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  The best part was it was a Friday Night in this part of Henderson at 645 and there is no wait for table that's a fricking bonus.  Ordered the Bacon burger, it was ok I guess not a whole lot of flavor, and not cooked to order which is a big turnoff.  Service was pretty slow for a place not too busy.  Not that I am a cheap ass but I asked for a side of bbq sauce for my fries and they charged 50 cents....and as Big Perm in the movie Friday said \"Its principalities Smokey!\".  but a big turn off from a chain eatery making money hand over fist.  They didn' t come correct with their food or their service, so LiLMark aint coming back!"}
{"text":"For drinks and snacks... This place is pretty good!  We came here a few times, and I didn't want to like the place, but they do a good job.  It's definitely bar food, but if your looking for an American kind of bar experience, you should do it.  Nina is awesome! She went out of her way to find the shot we mentioned and she made us feel like VIP! Also a shot out to Champoux!  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour Specials! Mandy was our waitress/server and she was awesome, by far the best service I have had in a very long time. Ask to be be seated in Mandy's section, I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Haleyy loan was awesome she was so real and I really appreciate that.  She upgraded us from women beers to man beers.  She is my hero and the reason I visit this location"}
{"text":"Went here one night with the guys. Had a couple of their own Dirty Blonde beers, which was very good, fried pickle basket (must have), and the pulled pork sliders. The sliders were good but I'll probably try something else next time.  Now let's talk about the obvious...the girls. Everyone was very friendly and didn't seem to be there just to get a tip or paycheck.  I'd go back again for sure. Maybe to watch some games on their many TVs."}
{"text":"Been here once just to check it out. I ordered  burger, fries and a beer. The food is ok, but was just a little too greasy and too pre-made for me. I get that it's bar food, but I've had some bar food that tasted pretty fresh and it doesn't have to be dripping in oil. The decor is rustic-hunting-cabin-like which I liked and the service was ok. The girls are friendly, but you do get the impression of that forced-nice so you would tip them more vibe. All in all, not a fan of the food, service is ok, decor is nice, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on vacation. This place is right next to our hotel and although the dress code doesn't attract me (short shorts and bra shirts), my husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the food, and Rylee, our server, was super attentive. Came back here on night 2 after a ballgame at Chase Field and once again were really happy with food, drinks, and service! Although tonight they were out of the mozzarella bites I've read about here, and that was disappointing. Another couple of nights in Phoenix, I suspect we'll be back."}
{"text":"The wings are great, beer is cold and Leeann was a kickass server. If you visit this establishment you should request her as your server.   Another great visit with LeeAnn as our server. Nothing beats cold beer and great service. Thanks LeeAnn!!!!"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by the service and the food. Usually, the eye candy substitutes good service and good food, but this place has both good food and better eye candy.  Don;t forget to check in and get yourself some free queso and chip dip. I had their grilled chicken and it was good. Buddy had the meatloaf and he said it was good too. Chicken quewsadilla.. also good.    Lots of TVs to keep the sports fan occupied or their eyes averted from the waitresses prancing around in really skin tight and skimpy tops... but hey.. i am not complaining.  Its a fun restaurant, good service and really really super duper cold beer..."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday. It's pretty good. Customer service was good. Wings are good but Hooters is still my favorite."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a few times and food good, good  service but today had to write???as we were pulling into the parking lot this lady was turning into the parking lot and was slamming her steering wheel upset that we weren't moving fast enough for her!  As we parked we looked over at where she parked I her car...in the motorcycle area and nor even in one parking space but 2 and was in a mood wouldn't even look over at us. I then found out when we were eating she is the Owner ...thinking here we're spending money pulling into her establishment and...rude! We will take our Busn elsewhere."}
{"text":"First visit was awesome. Angel are waitress was super cute and nice and gave wonderful service. We came back the next night and service not that great. Our waitress kept hanging out at a table with her friends and she didn't appear to be on break. One if my pet peeves  come to work and work. Food awesome. Great atmosphere and view of the strip from the upstairs level"}
{"text":"Great service! Renee was super nice and made sure we were very well taken care of. We'll definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"The service I got at this twin peaks location was awesome my server was Taylor from Oakland she was super funny and down to earth all around rock star thanks !"}
{"text":"We came for the green chili Parmesan wings (seriously twin peaks, you make one good thing and you take it off the menu? Terrible call, bring back the best wings ever), and we stayed for the service. Our server Kayla Krashir (sp?) was fun, cool, friendly, and had the best personality ever. Plus she can probably out-lift you so come watch her bring out some beers, you'll be impressed. I don't write too many (or any) reviews on good/great service but this was it. Yes it's a beers, wings, and a hot girls sports place. But it's the best beers, wings, and a hot girls place on the planet. Thanks Kayla! (TP bring back those wings)."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch after the good guys car show.  Had no problems getting seated and the waitress was really friendly.  She even got my 16 year old son to smile for a picture.(impossible to even get him to look at a camera)  Our drinks never were empty and the food was good.  I had the meatloaf and mac and cheese.  Best part of the lunch was watching the scottsdale snobs and their kids coming in and turning right around to leave when they realized they were in the wrong place.  It's really not that bad.  Looking forward to hopefully having one on the west side of town.(hint hint)"}
{"text":"My Husband is super picky on restaurants. He of course wanted to give this Twin Peaks location four stars for obvious reasons. He has been to the Twin Peaks location in Chicago before, so of course he had to take me to their Las Vegas location while we were in town. We went around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was busy, but not too busy. We were easily about to get seats at a table in the bar area.  Our server was good, but not very nice or friendly. She kept the drinks coming, but always had a scowl on her face and kept standing at the back of the restaurant with her arms crossed. Not very fun! Some of the other girls had the same attitude, but there were a few good ones.  They have a rock climbing wall inside which I thought was fun to watch. One of the customers and one of the servers decided to climb the wall as we were sitting there and it was fun cheering them on!  We didn't have anything to eat while we were there, but I had their Twin Peaks Dirty Blonde Beer in \"Girl Size\" and I actually thought it was pretty good. Nice and light and had a good flavor! My Husband on the other hand had a few \"Angry Balls\" shots which he really enjoyed.  They have a ton of TVs around the bar showing all different kinds of sports programs which I thought was a great idea because you could always be assured to be able to see the game you wanted to watch. I would come back here next time I'm in Las Vegas or at one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Being locals in Las Vegas, we are always trying to find new and fun places to eat. I searched restaurants on Yelp and this one showed up. Sounded like a fun place. It was! Our server was Lauren and she was very nice and made sure our glasses were kept full! We really enjoy places that have small menus, then you know your food is going to be done properly as they don't have hundreds of things to throw them off! The burgers sounded amazing, lots of flavor going on. But this time we got the queso and chips to start with, then we saw the nachos go by and thought WOW, we gotta try those next time. They were a mini mountain! The chips and queso were great, love the thin chips and the salsa mixed into the queso was a fantastic flavor! Hubby had chicken fried steak, I had the steak sliders, our friend had the philly cheesesteak. Everything was cooked perfectly and we cleaned our plates! In the end I would say this is a great place to stop in with friends and enjoy some good food and great ice cold beer it is 29 degrees! My hubby loved the cold cold beer! So try it out and be sure to ask for Lauren she was so fun and helpful!"}
{"text":"Man my boyfriend is a stud!!!  :) We came in for a quick snack and he did their rock climbing wall challenge ($10)  He made it all the way to the top on his second try and got a free t-shirt!! Woo-hoo!  Proud girlfriend moment!!  We shared a cheeseburger and fries.  It was just ok.  Pretty small burger...and only about 10 fries...definitely not worth the $11ish we paid for it.  Pretty disappointing.  :/   They did take our picture and give us a free copy.  They tried to get us to buy the larger print, but it wasn't very flattering...pass!  Haha!  :)  Overall...I don't think I'd go back, just due to their high prices...but the rock climbing was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Beer looked sooo good needed to order one on this 110Â° day.  Good atmosphere something on the TVs for everyone.  Queso was awesome, would definitely get that again."}
{"text":"Indya was the coolest hostess  and made my experience awesome. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good but when I searched Yelp it said the place had s pool table.    Was disappointed need to update yelp"}
{"text":"Pros: Big TVs!  Very comfy chairs (no stools) at the bar.  Nice Views :) (if you know what I mean lol) Ice cold beer (literally) it's quite tasty lol   Cons: It's a Sunday, its a local spot and they have NO DRINK SPECIALS for football. That was very disappointing.  Service- a wise man once said Pretty girls don't have to have great personalities. I learned this yesterday. The bartenders were either hit or miss when it came to good service.  Food- ordered the philly and it was very Very salty so switched out for the burger and I just wasn't impressed with the food. :/    Overall decent spot. I would have given 4 stars if service was better and food as well."}
{"text":"First time here and they treated me and my family like rockstars. Great customer service and food. We will be back!  Thank you Liz and Brandon for giving us a reason to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after we didn't receive any service at The Tilted Kilt up the street. We were seated right away and had our drinks ordered within a few minutes. The place was busy but we still received great service from Whitney. My husband ordered the blackened chicken tacos along with the fried pickle basket and I ordered the Ranch chicken and we loved it all! My husband even bought one of their signature \"I'd Tap That!\" t-shirts and absolutely loves it. We will def be back again, just maybe not on such a busy night! (Saturday night was UFC fight night and college football)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great lunch today, soup and salad and the fish tacos at a fair price. Great service from from beautiful women. Great combination - highly recommend."}
{"text":"Try the house brews and climb the rock wall. We were in Vegas, it was hot as could be one summer day in Vegas and walking by Planet Hollywood we decided enough was enough and we needed a beer.  Enter Twin Peaks. It's a fun place. It's got a ton of screens and if the bottom floor is full, fear not, they've got an upstairs area. The beer is kept below freezing (couldn't quite figure it out) but it was good. I didn't try any of the food, but we had a great time there watching some sports, watching customers scale the rock climbing wall, and just escaping the Vegas heat!"}
{"text":"Haley is the best!  Attentive and very personable, great coversation. I would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"It's typical young and dumb wait staff. Male manager didn't seem much better.  A lot of hustle and not much productivity.  Has potential.  Mediocre-at-best will return Maybe, the only reason I went there in the first place is because the NHL package. And ordered a medium-rare Burger it came out well."}
{"text":"I would go quite regularly, but now the service is really starting to fall off. I had to wait 15 minutes and no one to ask me if I wanted to drink or order anything. Competition is too strong to start having poor service!"}
{"text":"Boring, boring, boring. This bar is boring. I get it, the women are dressed skimpy and I know that's the selling point, but the problem here is that the hostesses who are dressed very skimpy cannot be over the age of 18 which makes me super uncomfortable, the waitresses have a tendency to all congregate around certain tables (maybe the owener's table I don't know) and just hang out there which leads to me not getting my beer or service for long periods at a time, there is nothing to do inside this place. No pool, darts, shuffleboard, just tvs and boobs. The decor inside is cool due to the cabin theme but besides that I don't see many redeeming qualities. Just not my cup of tea I guess."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I really enjoy the food and the service. The ladies are better than the gals at Hooters. I love the Avocado Smash Burger. Yummmmmm   Also, the chicken Philly cheesesteak is great."}
{"text":"For what it is, I enjoy this spot, Especially since it's close to home. Food could be a bit better but that's not the main reason for coming in while watching a game. Considering the hospitable atmosphere and great seating options for sporting events, it would be great for this place to have completely awesome food. Considering the food, I find myself hoping that I'm not that hungry because maybe I can get some tacos from Taco Y Taco or Vietnamese sandwich from Lee's or Pizza from Grimaldi's. It would be great to know that when you come in to watch your favorite game and talk to a few of the girls, you can look forward to your favorite wings, nachos, or burger here but just not the case. My favorite meal has been the pot roast which is pretty good but again, I try to hold off if I can."}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly good for this type of place, better than tilted kilt or hooters.  Service is always slow, sometimes maddeningly slow.  The ghost pepper wings were awesome, very hot.  Hate places that advertise hot but don't deliver. Had the salmon and it was good, had a nice flavor. I always get the pot roast but wanted something different this time.  Washed it all down with a peaks Bloody Mary and some margaritas and enjoyed the scenic views!"}
{"text":"Had to stop for lunch on way back to Atlanta to knock out a few things on the laptop and was happy to find the Peaks at this exit.  Very surprised how busy they were at 12:30 on a Thursday. A secondary surprise was that it was Halloween costume time.  Not that I mind the regular uniform, but it is not a bad thing to be served your meal from a SWAT \"officer\" complete with skirt and handcuffs, from time to time :)  Julee was very prompt with order and refills.  Beauiful smile and pleasant demeanor.   Lunch consisted of a Cheeseburger \"sans carmelized onions\" and milk (I know....it was lunchtime and I still had several hundred miles left to drive).  Burger wsd perfect.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh.  The milk was served in a large glass (most places downsize the glassware for milk because it costs the restaurants more than soda or draft beer)  Overall the service here was top notch and about a full star over some of the other Peak establishements that I have been to in my travels.  Will return here when my business takes me up 85 through Concord."}
{"text":"We have only been here 30 minutes into Sunday night football game and we have gone through THREE waitresses.  The Manager Jeffrey was very arrogant said that it was normal because they were slow.Boy Bye ,  I have never experienced such horrible customer service and I eat out at least once a week"}
{"text":"Price was reasonable and the view was amazing. My server acted as if I were disturbing her. Not a single smile or friendly word. Ordered wings which seemed to take forever. I guess that's because they had to overcook them. Dry but lots of sauce which didn't really help."}
{"text":"I went to my first Twin Peaks restaurant. I was really impressed . The food was really good and they had good selection . I went on a Sunday and they also asked which game I would like to watch . So they then placed next to a tv that was showing that game. That was great. They had lots of tvs so also plenty of games to watch if you got bored watching the game you came to watch. I actually  went on November 10th just now getting to review. Also one other thing I found out that on Veterans Day you get free food . This was not limited either , was anything on menu Including the steak . Of course you had to buy your drinks but a definite great deal on Veterans Day . So veterans should definitely go there on Veterans Day."}
{"text":"I tried!  I tried talking my friends out of coming here.  I tried telling them there were countless other places we could go.  I tried saying how we could save our money and go drink crappy overpriced beers and eat crappy overpriced food elsewhere! But noooo.  They insisted on coming here.  I guess I was just the most-sober of the group, and we all paid for it dearly in the end.  6pm, Saturday Evening, Las Vegas strip.  We wanted to watch some football, so we came on in at the insistence of, well, the drunkards.  Cue the confused girl asking how many, then us saying \"4, but another is on his way\" and then her having zero clue what 4+1 is and trying to seat us at a small table.  Next up was a waitress with possibly the worst attitude I have ever encountered.  No smile, no hello, no attempt whatsoever at being a mediocre waitress from the get-go.  Just a silent stare at all of us from start to finish.  Cue beers that took 15 minutes to arrive, appetizers that appeared at the end of the meal, and the staff simply setting plates down in the middle of the table and walking away. We had asked the hostess, the waitress, then a manager to turn one of the 10 TVs to a different game, all of which said \"okay\", then walked away.  Tried again, \"okay\", then walked away.  A half hour later we asked again, they said they couldn't change the TVs: no reasoning, no angle as to why, just \"no\".  Food was nasty.  Cold burger I barely even tried to eat, wings that tasted like they had been reheated 3 times before ever getting to us, and a queso dip with, well... 1% cheese and chips that were soggy.  Why the heck didn't anyone listen to me?  This was 3 days ago, and we are all still running to the bathroom several times a day to avoid the embarrassment of soiling ourselves.  I'd say this place needs a makeover, but as long as they can hide crappy food, service, and overall lack of anything to do with the service industry behind fake breasts and short shorts, they probably don't care.  Can I leave negative stars?"}
{"text":"I love going to Twin Peaks, I would highly recommend our server DREAMA by name she will go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. Great personality, smile and attitude, she is well worth the wait. Awesome beer selection and huge tvs. You will not be disappointed had a fun time."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would, went there for their opening weekend by far the worst experience I have ever had. Food and service were horrible, the orders for our table varied between being served the incorrect, at the right temp (cold when supposed to be hot) and salty. No attempt to apologize once. The waitress  (I think her name is Emily, based on the receipt) was a complete shidiot, doesn't know anything about their food, brews or customer service for that matter; she gave attitude and it literally took 4 waitresses to figure out what beers were ordered for our table. The bill wasn't right and even after corrected, we had to find a pen to sign and get the help out of there. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in only because it was the only thing open late. The waitresses we saw were hanging on guys and sitting on their lap, i would have thought maybe we were at a strip bar? Hmm. Anything for a good tip though, props. Our waitress was really nice, she knew what she was doing you could tell. The burgers were good and tasty, i really wasnt expecting it to be that good. Prices were decent not bad for what we got. I wouldnt be back only because its not my type of place to hang out in or go on a regular or even rare bases. Worth a try though!"}
{"text":"I was in on Sunday at this location, I sat at the bar and ordered a double Lunazul tequila on the rocks, the bar tender who pleasantly greeted me, she had long blonde hair and tattoos her name tag said Katelynn (girl of the month August 2017) offered me a Ice ball instead of my usual on the rocks, i absolutely loved it ! I sat at the bar for about 45 minutes looking at the scenery, and talking to the bar tender! She was very friendly ! Made sure I was happy I ordered a to-go steak salad from her as well! It came out promptly and it came out correct ! I will defiantly be back to order more Lunazul on a ice ball from this bar tender! Very beautiful and a lot of fun to have behind the bar at this place ! I highly recommend this place looking for great scenery and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Billionaire burger is actually really good. Fried pickles are good, little salty so have a beer ready. They have a couple decent beers available. Waitresses were pleasant but if you want real twin peaks you'll have to go to the one on the strip"}
{"text":"Beautiful girls wearing nothing but panties and bras. Not bad beer selection, could be better but good to see some local brews on tap. Problem was, horrible and I mean horrible service. I said no Onions on my chicken sandwich and it was loaded with salsa that had onions. I told my server and she said scrape them off.  Took forever to get a beer. I almost poured my own.  Food was ok, nothing special but that is what you get in a chain restaurant, non fresh assembly line type food.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Nicoleyoley and Sara were fantastic! Highly recommend this place for good food, cold beer, and great service. #blessed"}
{"text":"Alcohol and screens like a sportsbook. What's better? Oh and the staff is friendly and fun. First time here a would definitely return when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great place to entertain out of town guests. ICE cold beers and a menu with lots of options. They have a fire pit outside close to the outdoor bar which is a great place to spend the evening. I believe Twin Peaks is a euphemism for boobs at this restaurant because the servers are like Hooters servers but with a cabin look to them. Also the chairs are really comfortable! That's a big one for me! I don't like all the stuffed animal heads everywhere but that's just me. It's a \"cabin in the woods\" kind of place so it makes sense"}
{"text":"Came in waited 15 minutes they sat me outside without giving me a choice also sat me in a smoking area right by a ton of cigar smokers. Really horrible service after asking for another seat it took 45 mins so I asked to close out. Not going back."}
{"text":"Honestly.... Not that great.  If I wanted skanky dressed women that give me terrible service BUT want good food,  I'll go to the tilted kilt"}
{"text":"Great sports bar to stop by and have a drink and grab some food. Food was good and they are known for the \"dirty blonde\" beer which is super cold. I would definitely come back here again whenever I'm around the strip."}
{"text":"Just had nachos and beer, but the nachos were better than average and the beer was cold. Waitstaff is real nice too."}
{"text":"Who knew!?   I didn't really understand the concept of \"Twin Peaks\" until I came back from Vegas.  Hey we have one here too in Scottsdale.  My first thought when I walked in here -- \"Wow the girls here are pretty hot\"!  Compared to the usual UFC fight nights at Hooters this place definitely \"out-hots\" Hooters by miles.    Food wise I think its okay at best.  I huge portions and Men/Girl size options.  Guess they're trying to be cute just like one of their dessert option (Scenic View - NC) is actually the waitresses NO COST.  Fair enough since they are smokin.  Needless to say, the food is bar food.  The burger I ordered had way more bun then beef.  I did enjoy the fingerling potato fries and the Nacho is a massive mound! --- Get it!? Anyways, carry on.....  The place itself is like walking into an REI store except you can't buy anything and hot chicks.  Overall, a cover charge of $5 for a UFC is cool.  I probably wouldn't come here for the food.  The \"Scenic View\" is a plus, but I'm not one for cheap thrills. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a beer, and even though I wasn't ordering much Angela was still super friendly and very attentive, so I ended up ordering food. I never leave reviews, but she deserved a shoutout!"}
{"text":"Slower than dirt. Waitress are friendly and pretty but kitchen is a disaster. Food took 45 mind on Sunday lunch when only 10 other tables. Will give another shot but only 1 more. Every restaurant in this location has failed. Hope they aren't the 3rd."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience. Wait wasn't long, food came on time and our waitress was the sweetest thing ever. Ask for kaylee!"}
{"text":"Beer can be a little pricey but it's Vegas.  Avoid the souvenir mug....  $24 Beer turns to slush even at 115 degrees outside.  Good food though."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a nudy bar and you couldn't get a lap-dance because the coke dealer was at the bar and all the girls were flocking to him and his weasel friend? It happened to a friend of mine once and he described the scenario. This is the feeling I had on Sunday night when my friend and I were seeking a simple hamburger at Twin Peaks. Every girl seemed to be gathering around the same table where two gentlemen were seated. It was unusual because I usually receive excellent service. (from the lunch crew)    I peered further at the table where the five girls had gathered intently. There were two big boy mugs of beer on the table and nothing special. I was expecting a Caesar salad to arrive at the table and Italian style service to occur with one girl grating the parmesan, one girl rubbing the pepper mill, one girl bringing the food, and one girl smiling. Twin Peaks doesn't have a Caesar salad. The food runner girl arrived at their table with what I expected to be my imaginary Caesar, but she had no food and she joined the collaboration of the minds at the table.  I considered opening a couple of sugar packets and emptying them on the table to see if we could get some attention. I wound up not having to go there and a waitress arrived to take our order. The food did eventually arrive and was excellent as usual.    Twin Peaks succeeds where Hooters and Tilted Kilt fail serving quality food. I actually like the Cobb salad and the honey mustard is excellent. Try the mac-n-cheese as a side. And of course, football season is coming!    I will forgive and return for I usually visit for lunch and they seemed to be geared towards that shift. Also disturbing was that my friend and I were the two best looking guys in the restaurant. It seems like we would get a little bit of attention."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  Everybody is friendly and the food is good but the beer, the Beer is big and 29 degrees!!!  Great when it's 120 outside"}
{"text":"The service is awesome. But I'm a beer person and s good New castle is missing. Hopefully it gets better. I like the environment and I will try again."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Beer- cold as usual. Food- OK as usual. Nothing wrong with the food but it's just average bar food. Came here for the cold beer, outside seating and basketball. I got just what I wanted."}
{"text":"This sports bar is absolutely amazing! The environment is so chill and fun the food is great! Our server Vanessa was absolutely amazing! She had the best personality and gave great advice on drink options! This is a must stop if you come to Scottsdale! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, after about 8 visits, I am moving on to the next bar. Why is it so hard to find a bar where you can get great service, great food, and fast drinks? I own a restauarant in North Scottsdale, and work ALOT. So at the most 2 or 3 time a week a beer or three is needed after work. I always go alone, and have met some great friends at Twin Peaks. The beer is cold. That being said, the girls that work there have the business all wrong. I had the same problem at kilt. I don't care if you wear a sweater I just want good service! I usually have to clean the bar where I sit, ask for a menu if I dare eat, and am always getting treated like a loser. They give you nasty looks, have no personality, and seem like its the worst place to work ever. Manager comes out every hour to play on the computer and talk to noone. Why not ask the customer how their experience is? From what I can see here, you will still get the dirtbags that like to throw coasters at the girls and get the dirty looks, but us industry people know better. We want good service and we will continue to hop until we find it. One things for sure over my last 8 visits, it isn't here, it isn't a bad night, and I won't be wasting the little time I get to be treated like this, ever again. Best of luck to you, I hope you can find better service staff because if you don't your destined to be stocking up on Budweiser."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Our Server was Kaitlin and she never let our drinks get below half!  Food was delicious and reasonably priced for the quality.  Only gave 4 stars because hubby asked for rare burger and got well."}
{"text":"Love this place, Stephanie and Hanna always take great care of me! Love you girls! Well they all do, l'll keep coming  back!"}
{"text":"Leeann from Texas provided excellent service and was super friendly. She made eating much enjoyable. I will definitely come back and ask for her again :)"}
{"text":"Very displeased with my recent visit , I came in Saturday evening which I normally don't do since I am working ,but hey I got off early let me get my 29 degree beer ;). I asked the waitress if there was happy hour going on right now and she said \"yeah sure whatever\" , so me and my friends drank a few more beer extra . When we got our bill we noticed that the bill was full price , we asked the waitress if it was happy hour and she said \"Ohhh today is Saturday , I totally forgot ! \" she said it in a way like she didn't care and shrugged it off and giggled and walked away cards didn't even talked to the manager to say how to make it better . Like really I am server as well and i have been in that postion when you own up to your actions and say \"hey boss I messed up can you help me out please \" , it's been weeks since I came back !"}
{"text":"If you want a place that serves mediocre food, has terrible service,  but really attractive waitresses, than this is the place for you!   We had a party of 7 so slow service is normally expected,  but we had the worst service I have ever encountered. The waitress was lazy and wouldn't even walk around the table to give us our drinks. Instead she just dropped them all off at the end of the table and walked away. When our food was brought to us it was one plate short and by another server who we politely asked to bring us some silverware, she was never seen again. After 5 minutes I got tired of waiting and got up to take some from another table. Now that I had my silverware I was able to eat my slightly decent,  exceptionally small chicken. Once our waitress finally decided to return and check on us I asked for a refill of my water. At the same time,  my buddy asked where his food was because he was the only one who still had not received his.  She returned with a pitcher of water in one hand and holding out the other like Oliver Twist wanting soup but not saying anything. When we all stopped in the middle of our conversation and saw her awkwardly standing there, we preceded to pass down our glasses because 3 extra feet was apparently too far of a walk for her. Once we reminded her of my buddies food, she left and finally returned plate in hand.   The only quick thing about our service was the checks and our departure from this restaurant, never to return.   P.S. Yes,  she was hot!!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Twin Peaks brand. It's a lot like Hooters with a lumberjack/lodge kind of feel, but the food is waaaay better. From jalapeno gravy, to a Texas version of a Philly, they took standard bar food and kicked it up a notch.  I have been to the original Twin Peaks, and I've got to say this one has potential. The food was on point, the waitresses seemed involved, and my beer was never empty. The manager ecen came by to see how I was doing. That's always a big plus. I did notice the occasional employee \"lost in the sauce\", but with a new place, it's to be expected. My only confusion was that the entrance was towards the back of the building instead of the front, where most of the shoppers in the shopping area would be. Be prepared for an Americanized beer service, meaning- the colder and sloppier the better. It's just part of how they do things. I spent six years in Europe, and while, no, it's not proper, it doesn't bother me in the least."}
{"text":"So I've heard about this place from some of the locals here in Vegas and was told to check it out because the food was good and the servers would get my attention. I didn't understand what that meant but, I guess I would find out once there.   It wasn't on my priority list to go but I found my self in a work related function and some one suggested we stop and eat there. When we arrived at the restaurant the building looked big, and had a very  cool look to it.   When we went inside we were greeted by a gal, and that's when I remembered what they told me regarding the uniforms. Yup the uniforms were all matching! Lol, and ok they were half naked but I mean you see worse at Wal-Mart right? ...no? Ok, in all seriousness I wouldn't take my little kids to eat there as this for sure is an older crowd kind of place.  Ok, now the good part....the food! It was Good!   I was really surprised, I mean it was really good! I had the wings in mild sauce and I have to say that they were some of the best wings I've had in Vegas. Perfectly cooked, and great taste.   I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have good food, and some drinks as there bar is fully stocked. The service was good, and the waiting time was reasonable.   I'll be back, and I'll take the wife just so she can taste the food."}
{"text":"Fun place for all ages of young and not so young. Very cold beer and good friendly service. The chili is excellent as it is flavorful with plenty of meat and no beans. Wings could use a little help but decent. The red hot flavor was medium in my opinion. Cheerful vibe with good prices. I'll be back next trip through town."}
{"text":"Arrived around dinner time and it was very busy but we were seated promptly. Waitress Kat was very attentive and took our drink orders. We ordered the fried pickle appetizer which was perfect and one if not the best we had ever eaten. Kat returned with our drinks, took our meal order and we requested that the blaring music be turned down. Amazingly, they did and we were able to converse without shouting. Our food as ordered arrived in less than 15 minutes. The chicken fried steak, though thin was cooked perfectly. The shrimp and chicken,  prepared in a light batter, was great. Our only complaint, which management addressed, was the unnecessarily loud music."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought some out of town family in for some lunch, we had been once before and really enjoyed the food and service.   Well yesterday was a completely different experience. We were promptly seated because restaurant was empty besides some folks seated at the bar. We waited and waited as we watched 4 servers congregate at the hostess stand chatting and looking at their phones. One server walked past our table to giggle with some girls playing corn hole on the outside patio - without even acknowledging us. After 15 minutes of watching this we got up and left. We went right next door to BJs where we received the service you should when dining out! Never coming back."}
{"text":"I had no idea what this place was about until I walked in the door in the middle of the day the week they opened. I was greeted by a duo of incredibly pretty and young (college aged) women.   Similar to Tilted Kilt, Blondie's, and Hooters - this is a place where you have your food served by beautiful young women dressed in... not much. It's an experience to be had for sure. The girls here are all pretty amazing looking - they clearly have high standards in that department.   The food was decent - it was basically bar food. The sliders weren't mind blowing and neither was the Philly Cheesesteak. I did really enjoy the chips and cheese sauce though. Their fries are thick cut and heavily seasoned, but they weren't very crispy. I definitely want to try other items on the menu.  The place is huge and the decor is modern representation of rustic snow lodge cabin. It's new, so everything is nice and clean. There are small flatscreen televisions on the tables in the booths and large flatscreens all around the restaurant, so I imagine this would be a fun place to go out with the guys to watch the game and get away from the wives. The service was quick and the girls were all very nice and friendly. It's just that sort of place.  Nobody is going to dance on your table or lap if you hand them money... it's NOT that sort of place. However, if you just like to have this sort of view while you eat, you can't really go wrong. At least you will go home covered in grease and smelling like 1000 island dressing rather than covered in glitter and smelling like 1000 different perfumes.   I'd rather have better food if it means more clothes on the waitresses, but that's me. I'm going to have to go back and try something else once they work the kinks out (if there are any to get worked out), but I wasn't displeased with Twin Peaks at all. My score is between a 3 and a 4... it's solid if this is your sort of thing."}
{"text":"Wow. Food really sucked. And I mean SUCKED.  Poblano chicken sandwich tasted like bland rubbery chicken. The cheese was like Elmer's glue and the lettuce was soggy and brown. Worst chicken sandwich I've ever had. Fortunately, the wait staff were THE hottest I've very seen anywhere. All beautiful, sweet girls - not strippers with fake tans. But they better improve food quality. Ask for Vanessa. She's a 10."}
{"text":"Da kann man mal einen Abend verbringen! Oder zwei oder drei... Unser liebster Hangout in Sin City! Ein Plus fÃ¼r die MÃ¤nner sind eindeutig die leichtbekleideten MÃ¤dels, die dort Kellnern. ZugegebenermaÃen machen nicht alle den hellsten Eindruck, aber das machen sie durch ihre liebenswÃ¼rdige Art wieder wett. Dos Equis um den GefrierPunkt genieÃt man auf der AuÃenterrasse und bei leckeren Snacks und umwerfenden Quesadillas und Pork Sliders. Der Burger, den ich aÃ, war nicht der allerbeste, den ich in Amerika gegessen habe, aber trotzdem eine Gaumenfreude, wenn man auf Fastfood steht. Leider ist die AuÃenterrasse nicht immer geÃ¶ffnet, da hier auch private Events stattfinden. Drinnen sitzt es sich nur halb so gut, da fehlt einfach der atemberaubende Ausblick auf den sÃ¼dlichen Strip. Aber darum sitzen wir auch immer drauÃen... Jetzt Buffalo Chicken Wings... Das wÃ¤r's!"}
{"text":"What a great place to have an ice cold beer, eat some great food and catch a game. The staff is awesome. Bartenders Stephanie and Chance are always very accommodating and friendly. The management team is always accessible. GM Steve runs a great operation. I recommend the Fish and Chips or Pot Roast. I was amazed with the food. Scratch kitchen!! I went for my birthday and had a great experience. Will definitely be back and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came here with 5 other guys for a bachelor party.  I ordered the combo basket with fried chicken tenders and grilled shrimp.  Also got a bloody mary.  Bloody mary was bloody good.  Comes with a strip of bacon which is a nice touch.   The chicken and shrimp were good too.  The chicken was very tender.  I'm bummed that i filled up on fried pickles and mozzarella.  I couldn't even finish my food which is rare for me.  The bachelor in our group tried to climb the wall.  It's just 10 bucks for 3 attempts.  The wall is harder to climb than it looks."}
{"text":"Food is subpar, beers are too expensive.  As great as the \"atmospheric envmtertainment\" is, this place just doesn't it the mustard.  I've been here a few times, each time worse then the next.  Today I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak which had more bread then meat.  It was complimented with a small handful of fries.  My friend ordered the Mom's Meatloaf.  He said it was decent, about a 7/10.  We also both ordered 2 beers each.  I want to like this place, but it just doesn't do it for me.  Unless Allison or Ashley are serving, I won't walk in."}
{"text":"Today I went to grab a beer at Twin Peaks with a buddy, great clean store, and great layout but I was really put off. After we were served and given our bill, I gave my server a $20 bill. My bill was $8, but given back $6 as change. But that's not the math. When I let my server know she took the folder and walked over to the cash register and \"fiddled\" around with the change and didn't apologize or speak to me about the mixup, and only spoke to me as I was leaving. I can't help but feel like she was trying to steal from me. It has nothing to do with the amount of money, but the principle of it.  I hope you guys rethink who you have working for you, if your server continues to do that, which I am sure has happened before me, you will lose much more than business."}
{"text":"A friend recently brought us here when we were visiting Las Vegas and it has a western Hooters vibe. We came during happy hour so the prices for food and beer was great. I have to be completely honest though, the bartender that night made the best Moscow Mule I've ever had and that's what I primarily drink when I go out. It was perfect. I will definitely be coming back just for that lol."}
{"text":"Went for HH that was organized by people at work. The food was sub par. Ordered the sampler and enjoyed the mozzarella bites it also has buffalo fingers and fried pickles and got boneless wings to go. I ordered a $12!!! Filthy martini which was on the drink menu. I'm excited for any place that actually puts that on a drink menu but then they brought it out and I was instantly disappointed. I thought it must be a joke. They must have run out of clean martini glasses because they brought it to me in a wine/water/tumbler glass making it look like someone already drank half and Who does that? Was it because it's a male targeted establishment that you don't want to serve a martini in a martini glass or was this a bar tender unable to find a clean martini glass? So strange to me and no way worth $12! Couldn't help but feel ripped off. Had to YELP this and took the pic to show this oddity. Gave two stars instead of one because I found the atmosphere nice. They allowed dogs on the patio. The girls in daisy dukes isn't original btw but I get it...."}
{"text":"First time here. The food and server's are great. Our waitress was Chloe and she was really nice & attentive. She recommended the dirty blonde & it was good. Atmosphere is chill & fun. Kids enjoyed the food too."}
{"text":"Actual experience of the place was decent I guess for being close by after shopping. It was happy hour, I split the cost of nachos which were eh with a small amount of toppings, got a beer and 2 shots. I remember signing off on a bill for 24 dollars and change. Come to look at my credit card statement, and it says I paid 42. So apparently the punk waitresses think it's cool to tip themselves 20 bucks. Never again and if you do bother coming here, make sure you take a picture of your sign off. The most dishonest and rude thing I've ever had done to me in any restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in concord. Not only do you get an amazing view, but the food is awesome and the beer is litterally ice cold. We all had burgers and they were perfectly executed. Service was awesome, staff was super attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in this joint. First time I went, I wasn't expecting much from them, but ended up getting wings and i loved them. I was looking forward to my trip to vegas to get some more wings during lunch. They were okay, but not what I was expecting. We ended up getting the BBQ sauce and the spicy thai sauce. I guess my expectations were very high. Their beers continues to be nice and cold which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious food in great open bar setting. Great service! Try the nachos! Burgers are spectacular, especially with grilled asparagus side. Oh yeah, beautiful staff!!!"}
{"text":"Very Good ice cold beer  But if your a young guy the bar tenders take while to come up to you and pay less attention . They tend to pay more attention to the older males. I got a beer and a menu, it's been at least 30 minutes and have not been asked if I want to order food.  The older men are being looked after as if kings."}
{"text":"Typical corporate hooters wannabe knockoff. While the food is marginally better than Hooters the problem here is the beer. They seem to be stuck in the 70's with their idea that to be good beer must be served below freezing temperature. They are actually proud that they serve their beer at 28 degrees.  Wake up management and yes serve your Bud and Coors at those temperatures but welcome to the modern era, craft beer should be served in the low 40's to be able to taste the flavor and get the right aroma out of the beer. Average service from scantilly clad girls who are looking for MRS degrees from hipster wannabes."}
{"text":"Imagine a Hooters where the girls cut their outfits in half. That is about the only reason to go to this place. It's a decent sports bar for guys to hang out in but not for familys or with your wife. Lots of beers on tap, unfortunately they serve them at ice cold 29 degrees temperature which is ok for your bud light, coors light drinker but for craft beer it should be served at around 40 degrees. Hello McFly!!!  Food was typical bar food for the most part with a few modern choices. The meatloaf is more like just a hamburger patty than real meatloaf IMHO. The place specializes in breasts, and not chicken breasts."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports!!  Fantasy football fans unite... All in!  I can't wait for football season.    The girls were great.  Staff was very nice and went out of their way to make you comfortable.  They did try to make me dance but they weren't too pushy... Thank you girls!  Pretzel is yummy.  Food is fine for a sports bar.    I haven't been to the other locations, but would be interested in seeing the indoor rock wall.    No major complaints... food is a little generic but service was great!"}
{"text":"Always a great time at Twin peaks. They have the coolest ski lodge dÃ©cor , lots of TV's to watch your favorite sports games, and the greatest tasting frosty beer that you will ever have! If you love soup, order the green chile chicken tortilla soup. It is absolutely delicious and it comes with their homemade tortilla chips, so good! Sign up for their rewards club and you will be sent a free appetizer and a free birthday dinner on your birthday."}
{"text":"Hailey was great great customer service food was great it was my first time really recommend"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with business associates of mine and was waited on by Chandra.  She is an excellent server, very friendly, and has a great \"happy go lucky\" demeanor.  This is the type of girl that Twin Peaks needs to upgrade too."}
{"text":"Slowest shit ever. Got here with like nobody here, 30 min later, it's 10:30 pm on a Wednesday, yet no service. I hate this."}
{"text":"I LOVE how m any TV's they have here, especially the small TV at each booth. I have onlyhad drinks and an app here, but I bet it would be a good place to watch a game(s). They have a pretty good selection of beer. The only food I have tried were the fried pickles, but they were really good. Twin Peaks also has a lot of room inside and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I've been to the Twin Peaks on the strip on a busy night and the food and service was amazing. I came to this location and we waited 15 mins before our waitress even came to ask what drinks we wanted.  I was disappointed already. After we ordered our food, we waited 45 mins before the food even came. I won't lie though.... the Parmesan Wings were off the hook! I got some Ghost Pepper Wings as well and man.... it was TOO hot for me! I had 1 bite and I couldn't take it. If you love spicy food, you'll love this one, I'm weak lol  It still doesn't make up for the bad service. I see the good reviews on here so maybe tonight was an off night for my visit. I'll probably come back cuz I like their wings. Hopefully the service will be better. Giving 2 stars for the Wings!"}
{"text":"You know what? Food isnt all that good at all....this is the spot to drink though.i see why ppl come....the girls look great and have a good attitude depending who you get.some of them act really concited and snoby low key.im just saying its only a spot to drink not eat ppl....i rather pick mcds but but they dont serve alcohol"}
{"text":"I called in at 10:30 PM and was told the kitchen is open until 11 PM. I showed up five minutes later at 10:35 PM and the girl behind the counter said the kitchen was already closed. I told her that I had just called in and they said it was open until 11 so she said \"let me go check\". She came back to tell me \"yeah sorry the kitchen is closed.\" That's an unacceptable way to run a business."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great atmosphere and honestly even better customer service! This place has TVs everywhere and the vibe is just fun and chill. I would def come back and recommend everyone here! Plus the girls are hot!"}
{"text":"The food was good both times I came here, which is more than I can say for Hooters. I went back the second time because I was craving the billionaire's bacon. Sadly, it was completely different from the first time. It wasn't even a good kind of different."}
{"text":"A must while in Vegas! Great staff and amazing prices for being right in middle of the strip :) And it's a go to spot for locals to kick back and enjoy one of their signature beers!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool especially since it was Arizona bike week. I just did not care for the way the waitresses are trained. I ordered a Chardonnay from one waitress and they automatically gave me the most expensive Chardonnay on the menu.  I didn't specify the cheaper wine but every other place we go gives you well by default and twin peaks is the lower level of the places I go. I then noticed they had $5 margaritas.  I ordered a margarita from our new waitress since they switched. I ended up getting the signature margarita.  I only said margarita but automatically got upsold.  When you go here you have to specify which level of drink you want or you will automatically get the most expensive on the menu. I didnt know till bill came but waitress was only doing what she was trained to do."}
{"text":"How do I describe this place? Somewhat like a hooters location but 100x better!  I've been here before but never got the chance to write a review, so here I go:  For starters, this place is located inside of a \"Mall\" area if I may say?. Sports bar with lots of TV's. Loads of beautiful women. Their beer is advertised to be served at 29 degrees if I'm not mistaken, which is the best! Their beer is served in mugs and they come real cold and icy. They have this temperature-board that let's you know how cold they're serving their beer at. Oh! Can't forget the rock-climbing wall they have indoor as well. They also have an additional upper floor you're more than welcome to hang out at.   I haven't tried their food, so my review is based off of the beer selections. Will have to update once I try their food.  If you're a fan of icy cold beer, then this is your spot! If I had a man cave, this place would be it!"}
{"text":"This twin peaks is literally my sanctuary away from the wife and kids. It's up the road and has plenty of parking and beer. I watched my favorite team the Lebron Cavaliers win the championship and it will go down in my memories as one of my best life moments along with the birth of my first child. It's the outstanding service from the time I walk in and I'm greeted and welcomed to the moment I'm walked out to my uber. You got a great team there and I'll be back to watch the Dallas Cowboys bring back yet another Lombardi trophy."}
{"text":"People probably come here for the atmosphere, but as for the food its mediocre. I got the chicken fried steak, the portion was huge! Largest piece of chicken fried steak I've ever seen, however they ran out of gravy and barely had any gravy on my plate, that really lost my there on how they could run out of gravy. The waitress was nice, but not the most attentive server though."}
{"text":"If you like brain-dead stuck up babes this place is for you . At least the beer is good ."}
{"text":"I forgave them for the skunky beer I had there yesterday because they said the beer lines were cleaned that day...so I went back today and the beer was horrible and I was given the same excuse as yesterday...the manager said he didn't know what budlight was supposed to taste like...after checking with more customers they said it didn't taste right as well...Wow will not be returning to this place.."}
{"text":"My husband had been talking about this for awhile.  He told me that he thinks I would really like some of the dishes they have.  So we go, and Shelby was our bartender, she was full of energy and really nice.  There was another bartender there as well, she was a sweet heart, she looked like our daughter. There was a couple of snobby waitresses, you know the kind that only smile when there in the presents of someone that's going to give them $$.  But no concern of mine.  So we ordered a beer, I forgot which one.  But I like the fact they have cold glasses, and the beer has ice particals on the top of it.   So we ordered, Nachos!  I love nachos.  So when the nachos came they were huge! There is now way I could eat this buy myself.  3 people can eat off of this plate, and we will all be full!  These nachos were great!   The salsa I was really shocked at how good that was.  I can't remember the guy that was talking to us.  He might have been a Manager, he was also very nice. Brought us more salsa, held a nice conversation.   For the most part I really like the vibe in this place.     I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful staff! Defenetly perfect for the men who love sports and love to look at girls behinds lol if you go for the food it's highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Never miss it when I'm in Vegas! Shout out to Nicoley and Selena!! If you want good food and great staff don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Waitress was timely and explained the food and beer menu. Beer was cold as advertised; the food was OK and filling.  The waitress was nice and friendly. This is a great place if you want to catch a game."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was great and hot when it arrived. When you arrive expect nothing but the best customer service and cold beer. If you need a good place to come and eat while in Vegas then make sure to stop in here and get that food. Also make sure to request Haley! She's the bestest"}
{"text":"Love Twin Peaks.  The service is always right-on and the servers are always friendly.  We stop in not only for a meal but a quick drink and the appetizers.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Twin Peaks. Rachel waited on us at the bar Saturday and we had Yancy as a waitress  yesterday. Great service from both. Yancy was very genuine and attentive. Food was great. Wings and nachos hit the spot. My brother loved the pot roast. Just like Moms! Probably make it three days in a row today. It was that good."}
{"text":"Line was too long. The long wait irritated my soul. This place isn't somewhere you would want to do a family night at if you are impatient and can't wait to be seated. Definitely not a place to grab fast food at since the service isn't fast and the wait takes life."}
{"text":"Where does a single man go with his spare change? Fashion Square, Gucci, Diesel, True Religion, Twin Peaks? I say all the above.  The Scene.  The ladies are a bit young here but for the young men, it's all good. I was lucky to have two ladies serve me. And believe me they both were exceptional women.  The Brew.  The beer garden is a a little lacking. As a worldly man I might ask for a \"Pliny the Elder\" or \"Pliny went to Rome.\" But  I'm easy and asked for a Dirty Blonde Ale. A draft pored into a clean thick cold glass.  A bright, pale, hazy, yellow-gold color.   I thought I was in beer  trouble when an orange slice was on my glass lip. The mouth feel was good and enjoyed the brew. I decided to scope out the blondes working the crowd. Over all the gals were the spice and really Candice was the winning Blonde. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q?userid=iXGoQVfBXU0CrwrRBWXozA .............................  Hi Meggie M.  I do enjoy many beers from San Tan and I applaud you for serving up local. I actually enjoyed the Dirty Blonde and can only say the orange slice threw me off.   Talking to the gals I noticed they don't need to be repeating whats on tap so maybe lets get a list going that will sit at a table.   Craft is king and would love the house to add some taps. Southern California has many microbrews and since many of these cannot be got, you will have to do homework to see what you can get.  San Diego Tap House has a rotation list that is awesome. http://sdtaproom.com/beer.html Pick anyone of these beers you can get your hands on and I will be your friend."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Twin Peaks. What a yummy dinner! Today we ordered the smoked wings as an app, and entrees were the salmon and the ribeye steak. We both got the sweet potato succotash! OMG! Im soooo glad our waitress suggested it. It tastes amazing!  Sauteed sweet potatoes, corn, asparagus and tomatoes with some sort of herb seasoning. Truly worth a trip there on its own! The steak was good and so was the salmon. We really liked the smoked wings also.  Everything was well seasoned and cooked well. The seasonal pumpkin beer was great bit tasted a bit more like a cider to us [which to me is not a bad thing]. The service was outstanding, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to have dinner here last night. We love Twon peaks, never had any issues with the two in Colorado or the other location in Arizona. That being said, our visit last night was the most HORRIBLE experience at ant Twin peaks from the hostesses all the way to the management on duty. All the girls had horrible attitudes including the manager when she came to help bring our food to our table! The hostess had a bad attitude from the moment the door opened, the waitress Madison wasn't very pleasant either and the ONLY time she checked on us is when I had to flag her down to get her attention. She didn't clear empty plates until we stacked them and placed them on the edge of the table. I always tip good waitresses 20% but she was so horrible I gave her a 10% tip and left her a little note. There was also 3 separate times that waitresses came to our table with someone else's food and alcohol, to me that seems very unprofessional they should know what table the food is going to!! I will never come here again and I will let everyone I know not to come to this location either!"}
{"text":"Well this was the first time going to Twin Peaks. My review is not as good as my husbands would be! He totally loved the scenery! So my review will only be on the atmosphere and the food.  We got some appetizers to share. Mini tacos and chicken fingers basket.  The food was okay. Nothing to rave about. Just ok. The atmosphere is a little noisy but I did like that there is a tv at every booth and you can change the channel."}
{"text":"I came here once for a friend's birthday party, and I won't be coming back. The food was medicore, the service was lousy and it took forever to receive our food and check.  On top of that, we were a big party (meaning we would leave a huge tip regardless). Despite that, we were hardly attended. They were more occupied chatting with guys at surrounding tables. And yes, we were a huge group of mostly girls, however we should have been attended more frequently. I was really hoping it didn't have that \"Hooters male service first only\" stigma but it did. The only other place I haven't experienced that is at the Tilted Kilt downtown (props to that place).  Anyways, I would not recommend this place. Go to Tilted Kilt instead."}
{"text":"I tried Twin Peaks out for the Game today.I sat on the Patio where they have six Big Screens,with great sound.The Food was great, as well as the Service The Staff is VERY easy on the Eye. I will return."}
{"text":"Saltiest food. Like, ridiculously salty. Waitress was decent. Took a long time to initially come to the table, but friendly.  I haven't been there in a long time but I remember the food tasting better.  You can't mask lack of flavor with salt.  The fried mozz appetizer is solid."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, lots of men here at dinner time but I ask for a tucked away booth and the accommodated me. I liked watching my private television in my booth."}
{"text":"The Ghost Pepper wings are great but be careful.  My favorite entrees are the Green Chile Meatloaf and the Grilled Fish Tacos.  The beer is ice cold and the waitresses ......no explanation necessary."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Waited to be seen by a waitress for a while , finally was able to order a drink.... it never came then a different waitress came to take our food order. Half of our food came and drinks NEVER CAME. Never saw a waitress again after that and had to take our dirty plates to the bar. Meanwhile, the restaurant is not busy at all and we could see our waitresss just hanging out at the hostess stand. Terrible experience ."}
{"text":"Really good food! Girls were friendly. Sweet tea was Awesome! Enjoyed the TP TV clips. Sat in a booth was very comfy. Decor is what you would find in a ski lodge. Really cool! Looking forward to returning with friends to enjoy a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Good beer, ice cold but I\"d feel more comfortable at a strip club where there is no gray area. Someone's dad at the end of the bar making inappropriate comments to the girls was just awkward. Hard to blame the bar for this but it is a factor in the overall experience."}
{"text":"Came in tonight, I was seated, and waited for 10 minutes while no one bothered to come by my table, not even to take a drink order. Manager walked by, asked the table next to me how everything was, kept going without speaking to me at all. Horrible, nonexistent service. Not even terribly busy, on the way out the manager did ask if anyone had been by, I told her no. She did offer to seat me again, but since this is the third time it's happened in recent history, I'm just done."}
{"text":"As a resident of Ballantyne, we took a trip to Concord, Nc to experience the great Bread Pudding at Twin Peaks. Being that we've came before we are familiar with the service and the good food. But today things were completely different. The restaurant was Not packed at all so we sat at the outside bar. The first order of Bread pudding was great just as we expected so we decide to place a second order with the Bartender. After about 15 minutes I checked the status with our waitress, Francis, she informed me that they were out of bread Pudding. I couldn't understand why the young lady behind the bar, Christy, did not tell me they were out before I had to ask about it. Then we ordered the Fudge brownie with ice cream to replace it, that was definitely below our expectations. The Brownie was cold with an overload of fudge and unfortunately had to return it. After speaking with the manager, Tom, about our experience it was as if he did not care. Being that this is the only Twin Peaks in the Charlotte area  I can't say that I will not visit again but I must say that we were completely blown away from the terrible service we received from the manager Tom and the Bartender Christy. BUT, Francis our Waitress was Amazing!!! She really helped turn our visit around!! Thanks for being soooGreat Francis!!!"}
{"text":"The general manager of this restaurant, Tony Diez, harasses the workers severely. The management is absolutely horrible and the food is terrible. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and everyone was friendly and very helpful with telling me about the specials and happy hour. Sat at the bar with Lauren and Shareen and both had beautiful smiles and were very kind. I will definitely be back again. All the staff are great and honestly they may be eye candy but they are very professional. Manager doesn't check on customers, Caucasian make with buzz cut hair. I waited for my drink to long and didn't ask. But waitresses and bartenders are great"}
{"text":"I normally visit the location in my hometown. This location is lacking big time. Slow service, and the food quality is less than I expected, having frequented the Dallas locations. I was really looking forward to a familiar taste but this location was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"BEST \"Pot Roast\" EVER!!! Make sure to order the Mama's Pot Roast whenever you're in town. You will NOT be disappointed. Too bad they don't have a location in OC area. GREAT place to watch all types of sports too."}
{"text":"So I went to this place for the first time with a friend of mine. It was ok. The service was pretty good and our server was really nice. The food was good, but nothing special. I did order the Margarita special and I'll say that it wasn't very good. I didn't even finish it, but I guess you get what you pay for. Overall this place would be ok to watch games and stuff, but I just don't think it was for me."}
{"text":"First time here. Our server, Amanda, has been wonderful. Drinks and food have been great! Beaitfuk girls and great atmosphere! Wish there was a Twin Peaks closer to home! We were on this side of town for a movie and decided to stop in on our way home and we are pleased :)"}
{"text":"This bar is great for men, as a woman however, it was a waste of time with the worst food. We ordered deep fried pickles, chicken strips, club sandwich, tacos and every bit of it was freaking disgusting. It was overly salty with no flavor. I realized then that all the crowded tables of men weren't there to eat, but to drink and for the waitresses. So for me, I give it a 1 star for the poor experience and horrible food, service was less than par. Luckily they had Four Peaks around the corner which we were able to enjoy some decent food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and another couple. It was okay. The decor is nice, kind of like a ski/hunting lodge with animals everywhere. The waitresses' uniforms are plaid crop tops with their boobs busting out and their butts hanging out of khaki shorts, but they seemed nice enough. We all ordered the \"Philly\" cheesesteaks, which were WAY over-seasoned and they only have about 10 entrees to choose from. My group commented on how they enjoyed how cold the beer was, (I was DD so I wouldn't know). Overall, not bad, but not great and wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I had a little concern after reading some of the reviews about what the service would be like. Well after experiencing excellent service, and observing how on point all of the staff was, I can conclude the bad reviews were likely made by whiny miserable people!  The beer was priced right, ice cold, and tasted great. The giant pretzel was awesome. And the Chicken fried chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"Coldest beer in town ! Food is  good , but the beer is the best ! Will go back to watch the games ."}
{"text":"The service here had gone down hill. We were there last night to watch football. They are known for not playing commercial sound, which is fine but they are never on top of the program. We ordered beers and a shot. They took about 5-10 minutes to arrive. For that reason, I immediately ordered a steak salad subbing it with chicken with dressing on the side. That took a long time because the table next to us ordered after us and got the burger before us. We complained to our waitress and was told the chicken takes longer to cook than the pattie. Then in one minute she delivered my salad with no dressing. She came back and asked if I need anything else. I asked for dressing and got mustard base dressing instead of the cilantro vinaigrette. At that point, I was frustrated. We drank, ate and left."}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know (before you go here with your wife or daughter like I did) is that this is  a Tilted Kilt/Hooters kind of place. The girls wear skimpy uniforms and spend time flirting with customers. That is not something that would, by itself, draw me here.  But decent food, good beer selection and a sports bar atmosphere with plenty of TV's  is something I am definitely a sucker for.  Service was good. Audrey was our server. She was very friendly and we got our food lightning fast... so fast I barely had had time to take about four sips of my ice-cold HopShock IPA.  My burger was cooked to medium doneness as I ordered it. The fries were, no doubt, pulled from a bag in the freezer, so no points for fresh hand-cut fries here. They were cooked well but were slightly under-salted.  My daughter said her garlic parmesan wings were good but she's had better ones.  A manager did come over and said, \" I heard it was your first time here\" and gave us $5 coupons off our next visit. We don't live nearby, but if I'm  ever in the area again, I may return to take advantage of that discount."}
{"text":"Kat is where it's at. This place has the coldest beer in LV and great service.  Climb the wall today. I dare you. But ask for Kat first."}
{"text":"Love the ice cold beers. A layer of frost forms on the top. Food is good to, but they don't have vegetarian options but did have a really good quesadilla here."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was great. It greatly surpassed my expectations. My fiancÃ© was just after some place with cold beer. Wow did he get exactly what he asked for. The beer is 29 degrees and has a giant icicle in the middle. When he saw it he smiled from ear to ear. I'm not huge on beer, but I even thought it was great. For those of us not crazy about beer they have lots of great cocktails. We ordered queso dip with venison chili. It was great. The waitress was awesome. We changed our order a couple times and she was more than happy to oblige. She was very bubbly and started great conversation with us. What a rockstar. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nicoley was wonderful! Loved the food, drinks and service  right on the strip with pretty quick service"}
{"text":"Meet & Greet was a little slow.  As my guest says \"no glass should be left empty unless it wants to be\".   The food came out timely and was good.  Venison chili , battered chicken fingers (tender and not over battered) and the fire fries (yum).  Would come again as there are many options as to whom to watch for NFL with the many TVs present."}
{"text":"lets just say! CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!! Been waiting for a menu update for a while and they nailed it! the service is never bad here, even when packed and slow to get refils the service is good! the Managers stay visible and active on the floor! The Beer is cold and the food is real good !"}
{"text":"I dunno what happened to this place, but if you're going here for some brews?, yes!!! Chow? I dunno. The boneless wings just the presentation Blows,  I thought I was eating at the hospital ( photo below) the fries are so skimp! McDonald's gives more fries. I had to order  another side of fries and I don't mind. The waitress... she is whispering I can't hear what she is saying plus no enthusiasm when greeting, how is she selling? Oh mannnn food just alright. Ambiance good. But pretty empty for lunch . But full bar! Happy joy joy!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place so I was unaware of the way the ladies dressed here. My 8yr. old daughter was a little taken back. I just explained to her that it was a uniform basically and that seemed to ease her mind a bit. Lol   We had a really nice server. She was sweet. Food was ok, ya know bar food. Decent enough. :)"}
{"text":"Good fried pickles, ice cold beer but otherwise blah. No vegetarian options and salads were not good."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time at this place and lets just say it's getting worse. Food is ok nothing special. The twin cheeseburger I had recently was better than last time. The last couple times the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, and pour a beer! Mixed Drinks tasted like crap. Idk how you can mess up a jack and coke.lol. If you want a good drink, ask for mary the bartender. Shes the only one that can bartend. The one thing Ill will give them is all there staff is great looking!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you mix a ton of big screen tv's with sports, beautiful women, great and ice cold beer? Twin Peaks- honestly i've been to so many sports bars and beer bars and for me what sets the place apart is great service, great spirit and great food and if that isn't enough the beer is always ice ice cold 29 degrees to be exact"}
{"text":"Passable food served by attractive waitresses who seem distracted. I think they're over-staffed to the point that none of the girls (yes, \"girls\" is appropriate in this case: Seeing young females in ridiculous outfits is the only excuse to come here) makes any real money. Lights are too bright, energy is too low.   If the attractiveness of the waitstaff is your major concern, try one of the Sam Fox joints, or Del Frisco's. Better food with your scenery in those places."}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out. Sorry.  I should preface by saying I would not come here just to look at the \"peaks\"  Come in the fryers are down, no fries. Dang near everything comes with fries so they offer an alternative sautÃ©ed green beans.   Buddy tries to order something that apparently is still on the menu but no longer available. They are apparently ordering new menus.   Food was alright.... But there were some random stranger hard chunks in my chicken sandwich. SautÃ©ed green beans is really about 50% green beans, 50% corn, onion, and bacon not what I expected.   Get the bill and they uncharged us for green beans although we could not get fries which is what we wanted and we were not told about the uncharged in advanced.   Will not return."}
{"text":"Nice bar, average food. Reminiscent of coyote ugly, with a texas ranch feel and gorgeous women (I am not exaggerating the women are hot).  My friend has a serious crazing for mozzarella sticks so we figured they would have them here. These were hands down the best mozzarella bites I have EVER had. Lightly deep fried, and bursting with cheese.  Dip that in the side marinera sauce and it's a party in your mouth. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy my meal as much as the appetizer. I can't remember the name but it was chicken breast topped with black bean and corn, mashed potatoes and side veggies. The chicken was decent nothing I would order again but the mashed potatoes needed some milk and butter they were bland and the side veggies were zucchini which is probably one of the only vegetables I don't like. My friends ordered a steak sandwich and a burger. I wish I went the sandwich route as well. Because they looked good."}
{"text":"I love Twin Peaks!! Despite the skimpy uniforms the owner has his waitresses in, the customer service I've received each time I've come there to eat has been superlative!!! I would definitely recommend anyone to go there! 5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"went here for the first time. beer was really cold so i loved that. food was what i expected and the ambiance was nice..... juuusssss sayin. pretty good for a sports bar but I really wish they had more beers on tap. it should be against the law to have Guinnes out of a bottle. Anyways, up the beer selections on tap and it would get a 5star BUT i didnt try the food except some fried cheese balls so really dont have a say on the food. So all in all it's a nice place to kick it with the guys and watch a game. Will go again for sure"}
{"text":"Well what what can I say? New age version of Hooters, as the beauty trend has changed from bosom to buns so has the focus for restaurants that want to target men.   Surprisingly I did not feel uncomfortable being one of the few female patrons there. Expect to see a lot of guys when you go there. I would not like to work there.   Okay let the review begin, my friend ordered the pulled pork sliders which I tried, pulled pork is supposed to be tender and juicy but the pork in the sliders tasted rubbery. My other friend ordered a quesadilla but there is no way you can mess up a quesadilla. Fries were decent and the draught beer list was alright as well.   This place is good to watch sports as they have big screen television surrounding the entire bar. The dining room was designed to give a cabin-like feel."}
{"text":"So, for starters, this place has little or nothing to do with the David Lynch show/film of the same name. Though the logo is in green and vaguely resembles the show. Instead, this is basically a Hooters-type establishment with a pacific northwest/log-cabin theme. I went here during the ncaa tournament and found that the wings were great (though perhaps not as spicy as some people wanted). They also have great shot specials and reasonable drinks. Highly recommend this as a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports.  PS- Another bizarre feature is that they have a climbing wall (its 3 floors) which the waitresses occasionally climb up. I only saw it happen once."}
{"text":"Maybe they should  start concentrating  on food quality instead of hiring young girls in bikinis that don t know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a Twin Peaks. We usually go to North Scottsdale and never have a problem so maybe the Camelback location is just poor.  Food was fine. Service was horrendous.  Ordered some spicy wings then waited more than 40 minutes for a drink refill (despite 2 separate servers asking if we were \"okay\" and asking both, politely, for a drink refill). Server was nowhere in sight. Where did she go? She had a group of tables and none of them were getting any attention. The table behind us was sitting there with their menus for around 15 minutes without even getting drinks. And our server was in the back somewhere.   When she finally brought us our drink refill, she was completely unapologetic.   I wouldn't even have written this review if she had just cared A LITTLE about our experience. She didn't. If I was management, I would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Twin Peaks after golf for wings and beer.  The food was very good but the service was unbelievable.  Our server Tavish, was attentive, helpful and a lot of fun.  Her presence and upbeat attitude changed our whole dining experience.  We didn't even mind the Quesada was really not that good.  But the beer is ice cold and Tavish was the best server any of us have ever seen in a sports bar"}
{"text":"Alright, fine, I know, wtf, I didn't think so either, but yeah, I am doing a review of Twin Peaks. Now, I will confess I am a regular in this place when football season is in full swing, but I can say, without a doubt I come for the games, cold ass beer and great tv coverage. Yes, they do have some lightly clothed waitresses, but that is just a small part of what this place offers. I have never had a beer as cold as Twin Peaks. They serve these things (usually below 30 degrees temp) in a big f*ing glass with a nice slush floating on top. The beer alone is worth the trip! The one thing that knocks this place down a notch is the food. Had a couple things now, but I would only vouch for the queso. Always a great game and good prices at Twin Peaks. Oh yeah, chicks in little lumber gear too. Let's go Broncos!!"}
{"text":"We went for the $5.00 Tuesday night Cheeseburgers. Burgers were great, one of the best burgers I've had in quite some time. My husband liked the individual tv screens at the tables as he is hot of hearing having that TV screen at the table really enabled him to be able to see the game that he wanted to watch"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Twin Peaks and we'll definitely be back. The food was delicious. I had the fish and chips, which was delicious. The batter on the fish was crispy and the fish was moist. Fries were great. My husband had a burger and fries which he said were very good. We had the queso and chips app. The queso was great. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Tons of TVs. It's very loud, so if you're looking for a quiet spot, this isn't it. But it's a sports bar basically, so if you expected quiet you were going to the wrong place anyway. The menu had a great selection. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great beers and Kayla and Cindy rocked the bar tonight! Awesome service! Enjoyed my first time here!!"}
{"text":"I would like to say that the atmosphere here is 4 stars. But everything else is 1 star quality at best. First, no clear front entrance. You enter through a patio entrance and are left to meander through the restaurant with no signage guiding you to the hostess. However, there is signage warning that self seating is disallowed. After a bunch of weird looks from waitresses, i found the hostess. Not one waitress greeted me or directed on my journey. When we were seated our waitress kept walking past us with our food and drink. She said she forgot what we looked like. Lastly, the waitress had long hair that was hanging into our food, shouldnt it be tied up or something?"}
{"text":"Good food, and that's where the positives end.   I know why people go to Twin Peaks, and I'm sure the servers know why people (mainly men) go to Twin Peaks.   So can they at least fake the experience? It drives me nuts as someone who works in a tip based business to watch a server focus her attention on one party while ignoring everyone else.   Because I went alone, does my business count less? How does she know I won't tip better than a party of 3 combined?  Can't see myself ever going back, which is too bad because I had looked forward to trying this place out."}
{"text":"Come to the Henderson location often. Food is great, beer is fantastic. More times than not, service at the tables sucks. But today Indiana was our server. She was great! Very attentive and great sense of urgency. If you come here make sure to ask for her!"}
{"text":"JC (Jenni) and Andrea were great!!!  These two lady made the visit. The kitchen/bar had some issues, but they were amazing, prevented any lag/down time.  Loved their Mrs Claus outfits. Will come back because of them!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Hoping they open a few here in California soon. My friend and I visited here whie in Las Vegas and we had a great time. All the girls are super friendly and fun (we had Nicoley-olie and Ashley as our bartenders) and may I mention very beautiful and not stuck up at all. Drank the Dirty Blonde and (lots) of fireball and ate the chips with some sort of queso sauce and it was AMAZING. I heard the rest of the food is great as well, but only had the appetizer. Loved the rock climbing wall.. provides lots of entertainment. Will definitely be back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Way classier than Hooters but the same low key vibe. Friendly staff and cold beers. Nice variety of burgers and you can get any of them lettuce-wrapped if you are watching your carbs. Nice chicken Cobb salad and a nice selection of appetizers. Fish tacos not too bad either."}
{"text":"Affordable, Nice & no condescending people....I love it! I go here with bf or friends for beer and sports!!! Great atmosphere. Definitely recommend, also its close to where I live so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Obviously you go for the view which is always good and even better on bikini week. They have good happy hour prices from 4 to 6. Also the kids menu is reasonable around $5. My son had the chicken strips and he actually ate all of them which he never does so they must be good. I had the hangover burger and fries. It was good. My brother had the chicken and shrimp he said he liked them. Our waitress was Briana very friendly and attentive. Good time I will definitely return. Thanks."}
{"text":"I love this place. Especially when you're watch a game or something. The food is extremely tasty and the drafts are ice cold at all times. My co workers and I come here all the time after work. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Not just your regular brewery. Manly atmosphere and cute servers that don't show too much. Not like Tilted Kilt.   My girlfriends and I were the 2% of the women at lunch. Nicole took her time with us and was very friendly and helpful.   Very woodsy motif."}
{"text":"Awesome beers bowls and booties! Lena has excellent customer service! Coco really brought the feeling of appreciation!!! Thanks for a great time"}
{"text":"Overall a great location with good food and friendly servers! After hours of walking along the Strip through the morning and early afternoon, my mom and I were exploring happy hour specials for food and drink. We chose Twin Peaks for its view of the buildings along the Strip and its appetizer and drink specials.  The hostess quickly seated us on the balcony as requested, and our server patiently answered any questions we had about the happy hour special. We ordered two appetizers (each 50% off; some appetizers on the menu are excluded from the special): chicken quesadillas and 6-piece buffalo wings. We each ordered a \"girl\" sized beer, also 50% off (~$3 or so). Whether the food was fresh or not, I don't know... but we thought everything was delicious! The beers also came in frozen beer mugs, which kept the beer cool on a hot day.   If you want to take a break from the Strip and grab a beer and some appetizers, Twin Peaks is a relatively cheap option in the mid- to late-afternoon with a decent view and good food."}
{"text":"Perfect place to unwind Especially when you have been up in the mountains digging for gold in the hot AZ sun"}
{"text":"First visit: 09/2015 Last visit: 02/2016  The food is chain food so it's mediocre. The new bacon is great, but everything else is basic. The service is appalling. For an establishment that strives on sex appeal; the servers/waitresses need to go through better training because they are not good saleswomen at all. And the atmosphere is...ordinary. Nothing special at all like it could/should be."}
{"text":"I've been to Twin Peaks several times and consistently there is a waitress here who has impressed me. Her name is Taylor. She consistently is attentive to all customers equally, she is approachable, always gives a pleasant smile, and engages in good conversation. Even when she's not your waitress, she is consistently pleasant to all around her, even when she serving a beer that's not her table."}
{"text":"Sometimes hard to get seating, but when you do, this is a great spot to watch the big games.  Food is pretty good for bar food."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about this place but then again I am warm blooded American male with a healthy libido. For the record I know females who enjoy this place as well so it's not all a guy thing. Having said that, there's nothing on this menu that I have not liked. Try the Hangover Burger, in my opinion one of the best burgers I've had hands down. Though make sure you're hungry when you order it.   Getting to the location is a bit of a challenge, you can drop your car off at the valet on Harmon or park at Planet Hollywood. If you valet on Harmon be sure to pick it up before they close that side at around 10 or 11. Otherwise you'll have to walk to the west PH valet to get it.   The atmosphere is simply awesome. If you've had a bad day this place will certain help to forget it. They have a decent variety on tap and two house beers. The Dirty Blonde and the Naughty Brunette. The Dirty Blonde is like a summer wheat type beer like Blue Moon. The Notty Brunette is as it implies, nutty and dark like an IPA. They also have what they call a Shotsky which is an actual snow ski rigged with about 5 shots of whatever you order and what they do is line up 5 of you across the ski then they tip the ski and all 5 of you take a shot simultaneously!   The place has three levels and if you go the third level...the view. What can I say about the view from the third level. BTW, the third level is where it's at!. You can sit on the balcony and soak in wonderful LV BLVD and city center. They have a rock climbing wall that to the inexperienced eye seems easy to negotiate but these TP girls can give you a run for your money. Its certainly entertaining to watch people race up the wall. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is due to the parking situation. Though if you're a glass-half-full kind of a guy like me, you can certainly say that the walk from the parking lot to TP offers a great deal of quality 'people watching'. Let me know how it goes...Happy Drinking!"}
{"text":"I love that the beers are always cold! If you're there watching a sporting event you can slowly drink your beer without any worries of it getting warm. The food is pretty good as well. I usually always get their chicken tender appetizer. It's cheap and filling. The nachos and mozzarella sticks are pretty good as well! The mozzarella sticks are square cubes that they batter daily. Even if that's a lie it taste great and not like the frozen traditional sticks you get at bars."}
{"text":"The menu apparently shrunk. My chicken fried chicken was not as good as I remembered it to be during prior visits in Tulsa, OK. ...Frosty mugs were great. Service was good."}
{"text":"Best part about this restaurant isn't the food (close second though) it's the staff. Truly genuinely sweet people work here and happen to be good at their job. A prime example is Hanah. Impossible to not to feel completely at ease with her and very polite but not that fake polite that turns off as soon as she walks away. Seriously wish I could give this restaurant and Hanah much more than just five stars.    - Tommaso"}
{"text":"Recently my cousin just got a job as a hostess and recommended me to come eat and visit her on her shift. This was my first time at this location and can say it was pretty nice set up. The staff was really friendly and I got seated right away!  I had a gorgeous girl take my order and was very friendly. I also received my food really quick! I had the buffalo wings and a side salad and it was really delicious and refreshing. I also notice a guy right next to me who ordered a burger with egg! Oh man it looked so good! Hahaha. My cousin also mention that twin peaks had really good brunch on the weekends and must come back for that and that burger! This place is would be great for casual dating or to come watch some football games on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time coming here! My friends and I like the drink specials and great food. Shawna was so nice and super friendly!!! Birthday nachos were amazing...."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with family from Michigan for 13 people. We had two servers who's taking care of us for each side of the table. First of, Our food was not served together. The other side of the table (half of the party) already got their food while the other side just staring at them eating. We got our food when the half of the party was almost finish - we came here as a family to eat together but they didn't realize that i guess. Most of our food came cold. Soup and appetizer was served last - entree was served first! Our bills was all messed up too. Some guy came up to us maybe the manager and offered us free desserts. Other than that, food was great but the service is not that great."}
{"text":"Nice place good food and cold beer Nice server Samantha did an awesome job Cold beer good music"}
{"text":"When visiting the area.... this is the place we go for a good time and good food. They have tons of televisions and very friendly crowd. I've had the wings, burgers, nachos and all done well. Until next time :-)"}
{"text":"Great place. I got the pork sliders, and they were very good except for that the sauce was a bit too sugary.  My grandparents got the fish tacos, and they were pretty good.  I give 2 less points because of the horribly loud music. I couldn't even hold a conversation in this place. It's a whole lot of screaming and only hearing half of what the person is saying.  The girls are almost too cheerful, but are very sweet. Their tops are too revealing, but clearly it's what the \"boys\" that come here want to see. It's sad.... There are also too many tv's. It's just about all a person can do in this place is watch it, because you won't hear anyone speaking at your table.  I would come back here. The other food looks like it has potential. I wish I could give 3.5 stars :)"}
{"text":"I have been looking for an awesome place to watch sports and this place beats the others I have been to since moving here in 2014. The wait staff is awesome at customer service and very attentive to making sure we were taken care of. THERE'S SO MANY TV'S SCREENS! I have never been to a sports bar that had wall-to-wall giant screen televisions for viewing. You could literally watch any sport or game with how many they have! And I liked the fact that they weren't on full blast for volume so we could still enjoy our conversation.  Our food was extremely tasty and the portions were large. I had the Sampler with Fried Chicken, Jumbo Shrimp, and Fried Fish with a nicely salted bed of fries. So good! My wife had the Bacon Jam Sliders which needs to be on every menu in town. Those were very filling for just being sliders! Our good friend had the Chicken Fried Chicken which is a humongous chicken breast made like your regular chicken fried steak. Breading was nicely crispy and it was smothered in this JalapeÃ±o gravy that I should've ordered a side of so I could dip my fries into it. I better stop because I'm getting hungry again!"}
{"text":"Rolled into Twin Peaks to grab food and drinks and watch Sunday football today at 2:20p. The hostesses informed us that they were no longer seating tables. What?  The manager told her that because they just got a large group in the dining room that they could no longer seat anyone else. Not \"Can you have a drink at the bar and give us 10-15 minutes\", just not seating anyone with no idea when they might seat people. I have NEVER in all my days seen this. We took an Uber to get her so we could get our drink on!  WTH?!?  I will NEVER go back there. The food isn't even that great and the scenic views included a flabby butt check hanging out of the shorts of the hostess. So. Dumb."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and had a delicious Moscow mule with gin instead of vodka. It was pretty slow but the food was good. The service was okay, however. They didn't come back to re-fill our water or ask if we wanted drinks and we only received a re-fill on our water/were able to order drinks after we received our food. We had wings and the chicken quesadillas which were both delicious! The Jalapeno butter wings were a little weird but, still delicious. I'd recommend it, there are a ton of restaurants nearby where you can walk off the alcohol or food."}
{"text":"My Filet Mignon came out tiny and cold. I got ripped off. The Lobster inside the bisque was crap. I don't like the Cesar Salad. Why would I want to cut my own salad and croutons?"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend to watch the NBA Finals Game 1 and we ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos. They were below average and not what we expected. The many tvs made it easy to watch the game however."}
{"text":"Great burger and nachos! Kaely was our waitress and she was delightful. Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ambiance ... the bartenders are fun and personable.  Great place to unwind after a work week.  Definitely try the wings!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Amber at bar was amazing.  She recommended the turkey smash and she was spot on. Amazing looking but even a nicer person. Glad I stopped in. Thanks Amber!"}
{"text":"food was good.  .  the only thing I did not like was that the music was so loud that you couldn't even watch a game on one of the dozens of tv's they had on. plus yes the girls looked cute but they looked like they were all under 18.  looked too young to dress so skimpy.  maybe hire girls in the 20's and then it would fit it nicely. the decor was nice although I think a bit too much.  I lived in the North for many years and simplicity is better when doing a North type of woodsy look.  don't know if I'd come back cause of the noise level."}
{"text":"Drea helped us out today She was awesome . She was attentive and kept our beer full and smiles on our faces!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is huge but there were only about 20 patronizing. Cool decor. So service was slow but friendly. I noticed the waitresses tend to spend more time with the single men or tables of men. Oh well, I just wanted my birthday meal. I got the Chicken Sliders with billionaire bacon, cheese, jalapeÃ±o gravy on salt and pepper buiscuits. They were tasty but very dry, definitely needed more gravy. Hubby got hot wings and we shared fries. Wings were just ok, same with fries...ordinary. Their Naughty Brunette beer was pretty good for dark beer (I usually don't do dark beer). Seems like a fun place for a guy. I'd visit again but I won't be rushing to get back."}
{"text":"Great Peaks Signature Knotty Brunette Beer! Had the smoked grilled wings and the meat and cheese board while we drank a couple beers. The bartender Nicole kept our beers full and was super welcoming and friendly. Recommend this place if you want a change up from the casino bars."}
{"text":"This  place so completely failed to make an impression on me that I almost forgot we were here. We stopped in for something to drink on a HOT Las Vegas afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered two Absolute and Cranberries. Our Bill was $30.00! That's high even for Vegas. In my younger days, the very attractive staff might have been enough to draw me back here, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with great happy hour prices.  We really enjoyed the whole experience.   We will be going back!"}
{"text":"So the Hooters fan was in the area and had to see what this \"breastaurant\" was about.  After all there's not one in Raleigh (yet).  If you allowed Bass Pro Shops to decorate a Hooters, you would have an idea of the decor.  This is a huge space.  I did ask my server if they ever filled up the place, and she said when special events are in the area they do.  The Twin Peaks server outfit is skimpier than those of a Hooters Girl.  Little plaid top, shorts, and boots.  The nametag on my server read \"Bambi\"    I ordered the Hangover Burger, which comes with a fried egg and bacon on it. Thanks to the Yelp app I also got a free chips and queso dip.  Both were very good.  Only problem I had was finding the restroom, even when I was directed in the general direction.  Male employee, whom I guessing has had to help others find it too, pointed it out to me.  I appreciate the humor of the sign from the bar area that had in twig lettering \"2P\" on it, but when I need to go I don't need to figure out where you hid the men's room!"}
{"text":"Beer is Ice Cold, food is ok...but the bartenders and waitresses....OMG!!! Beautiful!! Can't wait to get back to phoenix for work again...made it much better :)"}
{"text":"Have been to this place about 3 different times, it's definitely a cool sports bar atmosphere. Similar to a \"hooters\" but in my opinion better. Burgers and beer is usually the go too, but I've had fish from here too that was great as well. Staff was friendly and knew the menu. Great place for sports or to grab some food!"}
{"text":"For it being in such a great location on the strip this place has a lot of issues. No way it would survive if not for the thousands of tourists walking by every day. Food is okay, beer is cold, but the service is down right mediocre at best. Add on top of that minimum purchase amounts for each diner during football season because they think they're that popular."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place at all.....ordered a b.e.l.t. (bacon egg lettuce and tomato) server came to and apologized said that it is no longer available - they only had BLTs but asked if wanted to add an egg to it...ummmm isn't that what I ordered the first time? Not a great beer selection either"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of food and the friendly waitresses. Unknown to me before arriving is that Twin Peaks is like a Hooters and Tilted Kilt - but better food. The pulled pork nachos was a tasty mountain of food, and the fish tacos were nicely spiced. Most importantly our waitresses were fun and didn't make an old guy married for 30 years feel uncomfortable.  Good clean fun, cold beer and good food - very hard to argue with.  On the second visit - not so good. The waitress was not nearly as fun, and the food was so-so. Would have rated the 2nd visit a '2'. Hope that's not a general trend or else this place won't last."}
{"text":"One of the first times we have ever been here and it was actually a pretty good place I don't drink but it seems like the drink menu was larger than the food menu but when we did actually get our food it was not too bad I had the chicken poblano sandwich"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. At first my boyfriend and I were very hesitant to try a new restaurant, but when we got here we loved it. The staff is so friendly and wonderful! Big thanks to the manager, GM, and even more so Shelby our waitress. She took such good care of us with amazing customer service ! 20/10 would recommend to anyone ! The food was great and so were the people and the prices !! Thank you guys so much !!"}
{"text":"I've randomly stopped into Twin Peaks a couple times. A few pluses are as follows:  First and foremost they have a dog friendly patio. They also have 32 degree beer. I believe it's 32. As far as food my review is a bit lacking due to the fact I don't really eat anything on the menu. I'm not a meat or dairy eater. Lucky for me they have a burger called the Imposter. It's a plant based burger made by Beyond Beef. As far as plant based burgers go it is delicious. It Is served with fries and your standard lettuce,tomato etc. toppings. I'm pleased to see that they include this option on the menu. If not for the Imposter burger I would still go for the beer and dog friendly patio.   The atmosphere is like your of grid in a log cabin in the woods or something. Tons of tvs and always playing all the big games and fights. The servers all wear short shorts and pretty tight revealing tops. So it's kind of more of a guys spot although not exclusively their has always been several women customers when I've been there."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was excellent. Carley was our server and she was wonderful. Would definitely recommend and come back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"This will be my second time coming to Twin Peaks and the service is great. The waitresses (Ky'Yonna) was really nice and attentive. This place were very busy and she worked the tables very well. I will always ask to be seated in her area and if she not there I'll ask for the other nice waitress (Leonah). #BeautifulAndSweetYoungLadies. The food was really good on each time I came here and the prices were AWESOME because they have military discount...YAAAAYYYYYY!!!.  I had the Blacken chicken and Shrimp...\"It's the best ever\" But everything is good here and I know because I sampled all of my families food....lol. This is now one of my favorite spots!!!"}
{"text":"You can find almost anything on Eastern Avenue including a couple of breastaraunts. Twin Peaks is one that is doing pretty well in a building that historically has not done well. The outstanding views, cold beers, and crystal clear televisions keep me coming back. Make sure you have full motion in your neck when you come in, because most likely your head will be on a swivel. It's starts when you come through the doors and you're greeted by what seems like an army of hostesses and continues throughout your meal as the servers stroll on by.  I mostly come for lunch and occasionally on Monday nights. The log cabin themed restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. Don't expect to be blown away by the food, it's standard bar fare. I've actually had almost all of the menu. I think the post roast is good and the soft pretzel is good to snack on and there's enough to share. This last visit, I had the BELT which I enjoyed because of the fried egg and the toasted sourdough bread. Props to our server Amanda, who saw that my sandwich was ready way before my buddies chicken tacos and burger were ready, so she had the kitchen remake my sandwich so that it would be ready at the same time as everyone else's food.  The servers have always been friendly to us and we've never had problems getting in and out during our lunch hour. The beer selection is average but the beers are cold and always served in frozen mugs. If you're drinking slow, you're sure to drench your table top as the ice on the mugs melts. If your eyes make it up to the television screens, you'll see many large, clear HD screens set to your favorite sporting event.  Twin Peaks is a nice change of pace in our rotation of bars. Certain dishes on the menu are better than others. But I'll keep coming back for the cold beers and the views."}
{"text":"Great selection of really really cold beer. Good service and ambience. Come here to drink some beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Always have great service here .. But tonight I have to say the waitress is not so nice .. No personality  .. Where the hell is Lauren ?"}
{"text":"Great lunch. Thanks Angie for your great service. Good food and tons of TV's to watch the game. Look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"The waitress told me the bison chili would be a good pick. Ummmm no it was flavorless and the meat was gritty. My husbands meat in his salad was waaaayyyy over cooked."}
{"text":"Realizing that this was near kitchen closing, on July 4th, but...   Service: terrible. Bartenders didn't realize i had sat down the bar for 3 minutes, although i had been seated by the host. Understandable, they were in conversation. Get delivered my beer, then ignored for 10 minutes while they continue their conversation. Receiving my food was the last interaction i had with both of them, aside from needing to flag them down so i could pay my bill. Conversation from when i walked in continued the entirety of my meal  Food: Lazy. Ordered a med rare burger, received a well done burger that had sat on the edge of the grill for (roughly) 15 minutes (side note: i was a cook for 8 uears, and ran a burger grill for about a year. I know how they operate, which is why i asked for med rare, so it would be freshly cooked)   i realize that it sucks working service industry, especially when its a holiday and you're stuck at work, but that's no excuse for bad service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the area and decided to check this place out.  The women are really pretty, even I can't deny that.  What I liked is they gave me an equal amount of attention and kindness as they do to the men.  My order was messed up,  but I was a waitress for 6 years and totally understand mistakes happen. Our server noticed quickly of the mistake and gave me a box to pack the wrong salad home for free and gave me the right order.  On top of that the manager came by and apologized and gave us a coupon to come back.   We weren't even upset so It was a nice plus.   We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Super fun and easy going environment. Excellent service, food and drinks! Chloe was an awesome server. Super friendly and helpful, answered all of our questions and the order came out perfectly despite all of our modifications. Moderately priced. This is a great place to watch a game or fight with drink specials!"}
{"text":"Probably the rudest server I have ever had in my life! Very unorganized staff. Definitely will NOT be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Been here more and more. Champoux is a great bartender and she works great with Cindy. Come see them......"}
{"text":"NOT happy with the \"new\" BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos. We come here religiously for this menu item and the changes made are not for the better. Fine that you put it on a baking tin because \"no one could carry it\" on the platter, as your waitress told us. Changing the chips to cheaper greasy ones wasn't a brilliant idea either. Why take away the chipotle sour cream and have just plain?? Now the only thing that differentiates it from any other nacho plate is just the barbecue sauce, and you'll probably change that too. You had an awesome brag worthy dish, now it's just greasy nachos with BBQ sauce......extremely disappointing"}
{"text":"So I took my boys here and we sat at a table. Adrian was extremely helpful when we were there. She has an outgoing personality and amazing hospitality. She did everything she could in order for us to have a good time there. Food was good drinks were good but her hospitality and service was phenominal. Good hustle Adrian! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Holy Hot girls!   Good always fresh...you'd think the food and service would suck cause it's all booze, sports and hot girls but it's impeccable service!  And HOLY VIEW!  request the 3rd floor...TRUST ME!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! Great food, cold beer, drink specials, and good service make it a great place to come hang out. 3 story(40ft) rock climbing wall and 72 flat screen T.V.s with all kinds of sports playing make it a great venue to come and chill with friends and watch your favorite game & team play. I'd recommend Twin Peaks to all."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The apps were ok. The steak meal was not cooked correctly at all. We will not be back."}
{"text":"A new place to check out mid-strip?  Sure.  Why not?    I was a little surprised at the limited choices on the menu, but there were still a few items that sounded good.  I wound up eating the fish tacos, and my wife had the chipotle chicken.   Holy shit was the food good.  WAY better than I expected from a restaurant whose main attraction is T&A.  I guess you could say this place is more Tilted Kilt than Hooters.   I don't remember how much the beer cost, but it was advertised as coming out of the tap at 29 degrees.  I didn't bother to check that number, but I do know it was damn cold and tasted great on a 100-degree day."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time with a friend this week. I was curious to see what it was all about after seeing it on Undercover Boss. The owner is a former CEO (or some kind of top office guy) of Hooters, so that explains the theme a lot.   When we went, a reality show was being recorded. That made things interesting. The waitresses here are super hot, so that helps with the ambiance. :)  Our server, and sorry I didn't catch her name, was super cool and attentive. She really knows how to make you feel welcome with being super nice and professionally flirty. You can tell it was part of her job, and I am in no position to complain. She knows why guys come here and does her job well in order to make a good tip. She had the perfect balance of the attention she gave. Nothing too extreme and nothing too light.  The food was ok. The garlic parmesan chicken wings were the best. The chicken tenders were bland, and that's coming from a guy who just recently returned to eating meat after being vegetarian for ten years. But like Hooters, you aren't really coming here for the food, now are you? ;)  At the end of the day, the atmosphere, huge TVs everywhere and one at your table, and the hot ladies make it an ideal destination for the bros to come and hang out, participate in a little friendly flirtation, enjoy decent food and catch a sports game. I will be a repeat offender, but just know that these ladies are here to do a specific job. Get you to spend money and tip big, in which I did. Don't get chocolate wasted and think you have a shot with any of them. Treat them like the professionals they are. Enjoy the time and what this place has to offer. I can only imagine what this place is like during big sporting events. Probably packed! Keep doing what you're doing, Twin Peaks. I'm not mad. lol! :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on St. Pats Day.  I was pleasantly  surprised!        First off the wait staff is GORGEOUS!  The women are stunners!  And they are friendly, gracious and attentive hosts.        Second, there are big screen Televisions every where you look, so essentially...  There is not a bad seat in the place.      Third, there are outdoor fire pits, where you can get your drink and eats on in cozy little nooks and dens.        If I should need more...  The beer is ice cold, and it is delicious.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap (where it is served chillingly delicious).  The food is alright as well, and reasonably priced.          The wait time was longer than we would have liked, but we got a complimentary order of chips and queso for checking in on Yelp.        I really liked the place.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd say this about a breastaurant, but this place sucks. My buddy and I went in there tonight to have a few drinks and watch the Suns game, but almost immediately regretted stepping inside. We decided to sit at the bar and proceeded to order some drinks. The bartenders could not be less attentive - I think the stool I was sitting on had more personality than they did. My buddy ordered us a couple waters and only got one - it's understandable that perhaps she didn't hear the request for TWO waters, but as a bartender or waiter, why would you bring one customer a water and not the rest of the party, that's just bad customer service.  I proceeded to order a Bloody Mary and when it was brought to me she basically threw it toward me - ok, not really but she may as well have. She slammed it down in front of me as she walked by and went ahead with whatever else she was doing - this was the same routine all night.  My buddy and I couldn't believe the lack of interest these girls had toward catering to customers, it seemed like none of them wanted to be there.  Needless to say, we won't be going back and won't be recommending it anymore. It's too bad because I remember the girls being friendly and attentive once upon a time."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Hot chicks serving you, enough said. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"The girls are great but their food leaves a lot to be desired. None of my friends eat the wings, they are by far the worst wings we have ever had. Last time I ordered the shrimp basket and the fries had enough seasoning salt for three orders of fries. However, I will say, the shrimp were big and delicious. So I go for the girls and the t.v.s so I can watch all of the games. The food, not so much."}
{"text":"They have the coldest beer that I've ever tasted. It's absolutely delicious and great on a hot day. Haven't had a real great experience with the food or service on that couple times I've been there."}
{"text":"Shak is amazing!! She always have such an up neat vibe and positive personality. As well as phenomenal service! Come check her out at twin peaks Henderson where the beer is the coldest in the city."}
{"text":"Great football screens .. Mediocre food and 'good thing they're pretty' servers .. Having been in the service industry myself .. The young girls serving in this place are very attractive but terrible servers .. I am an excellent tipper but like going here but the service is slow and inattentive unless you're a guy ?  Great Tvs for sports   .. Drinks are weak and food just okay .."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a football game. Born and raised 22 years in Charlotte. Karen the manager turned down my ID because of a little wear and tear. It doesn't expire until 2017!!"}
{"text":"DON\"T WAST YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!  I went there with a group of 9 guys for a bachelor weekend in Vegas. we all pretty much had burgers or one of their fish baskets and 2 beers each in a 2 1/2 hour period of time.  Our waitress was cute and friendly but not a great waitress. My $12 burger was horrible I would have rather hat a $1.50 burger from a fast food joint. when we got our bill it was $845.00!!!!!!!! She failed to tell us we were buying souvenir cups. and out first beer was $20 something dollar and the second one in the girl shaped glass was $37.00.  so I got a horrible burger and 2 beers for $120.00 (my share)!!!! biggest Rip off of my life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my Dad.  As I expected, the girls are very cute and friendly and the beer is ICE COLD.  What I didn't expect was how good the food and service was. These ladies are actually really good servers, not just friendly eye candy. And i just anticipating regular tasting bar food and it was a lot better than I expected. The steak sliders and the philly cheese steak are both great choices."}
{"text":"Ella is my favorite, make sure you ask for her. Great service, beer, and food! Try the turkey avocado smash. #shotski #shotski. This is the best twin peaks."}
{"text":"Great food and the beer is ice cold.  Always have had great service.  Terrific atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"update 5/2/14. Came in for lunch today with my brother in law.  one thing we didnt realize was the size (or lack thereof) of the menu.  if you are looking for more food other than burgers, pot roast, and appetizers, you will be pretty disappointed.  The menu is single page, with the entire back side dedicated to boozin' it up.   I didnt want the same thing as last time, but I definitely wanted more options than whats there.  I know, I know.... eye candy restaurant... but as lovely as the waitresses are, a restaurant should have more on the menu than that. On to the food.  This time I had a ranch chicken sandwich with spicy fries.  The sandwich was tasty, but the pico de gallo on the sandwich was more onion than tomato, so I was a little over aromatic.   Fries were good...decently crisp and hot. Our waitress wasnt as friendly this time, as far as any servers go.  When asking if we wanted refills, she didnt make eye contact.  No personalization to the meal, just \"how was it?\", \"would u like your check?\", etc...  Very cut and dry as if she was having a bad day. Sad to say, had to downgrade my rating this time.  Im not expecting a gourmet meal, but I do expect service to not seem like a burden, especially that early into the day.  Will re-evaluate again later."}
{"text":"We went here to visit family who happened to be in vegas too. The place was big but very confusing. The first thing that it realized was all of the beautiful girls serving the tables. When we sat down and got situated, we were approached by a sweet looking server. I think her name was Brenda?However as soon as she opened her mouth and started talking to us, it was very apparent that she may have been on some sort of narcotics. So she takes our order and comes back about 5-7 minutes later, she had come back to our table and all of our drinks were empty, so she offered to bring us more. She brought us the second round of drinks and apologized for her own lack of good service . Her apologies how raver seemed more like complaints about the party on the balcony being drunk. About 5 min later she came out with the order and complained about the drunk guys on the balcony a little more and brought us out tab. We quickly paid and left. I was not too impressed. I can understand a bad day at work, but wow! Not the experience we were expecting!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, beautiful women and great atmosphere! My favorite spot!!!!!!!!!!! Will always return"}
{"text":"Went to twin peaks today; and my experience was great Shak and Jess was at the bar and are awesome bartenders, gave great service and the management is really cool and personable! Enjoyed my experience ! Happy hump day!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer with the wife and grab a bite.  If your wife is sensitive or doesn't trust you, don't bring her.      Seriously the food is actually really good and the service is as Well.  I like that the stay open late so I can get a late meal after a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"I had the steak salad, but had blackened chicken instead with house dressing. It was a very good choice. I took half home for dinner and it held up well. Everyone else at the table had chicken fingers and they were quite delicious. The server was friendly. She was a little off with her abilities, but I guess it's all about the \"twin peaks\". I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Hit or miss is the best way to describe Twin Peaks. It's your typical bar and grill type establishment with a twist on the waitress attire. The girls are dressed in shorts, fuzzy boots and lumber jack half shirts. It's a great concept restaurant that prides itself on the coldest beer in town and I can attest that it's cold! Every time I order a beer it's got frost on the mug and some slush in the glass. I do love ice cold beer.   The service is a miss though. We've been several times and have had great service (mostly by a waitress named \"O\") but I don't think she works there anymore. But most of the time, the waitresses spend more time at the hostess desk standing around touching up makeup and chatting than checking their tables.   The food is nothing to write home about. They definitely need to do some work with the kitchen staff because we've never gotten our order right. Even if not modifying an item. It's almost like the kitchen doesn't know their own menu. I will say the portions are generous but so are the prices that go along with it.   If you want your food to come out right, keep it simple when ordering. Overall it's a 3.5 if I could rate it that way. They need to improve a bit."}
{"text":"I give my server Sara 5 stars. Not only was she gorgeous but she was friendly and helpful as this was my first time.  I give the food 2 stars.  I had the chicken fried steak with potatoes and veggies.  The steak was huge, bigger than the plate but unfortunately was barely adequate. I have had better at less expensive diners.  I could only finish about 1/4 of it and took the rest home.  I would prefer smaller portions and better quality. The potatoes were buried under the steak and were on the dry side but with decent flavor.  The beer, served girly size or man size, was just ok.  I do like the TV's at the booths and for a place that is designed to attract customers for the waitresses rather than the food, my expectations were low to begin with.    I watched other customers do shots off a board that looked like fun.  If you want to come here for the girls, or if you have a big group or to watch sports, this is a good location to try.  Just don't come here expecting a culinary masterpiece."}
{"text":"Come on now. It's not just a guys bar. But the views are spectacular. I brought my mom and girlfriend in on this occasion. It was late night and there wasn't many choices out here so I had an excuse. (Smiley face) We were seated promptly with a smile. The server was quick to help us and she made sure we had what we wanted and needed. Something was missed on our order so she had it right out moments later and also removed it from our bill. If you're thirsty you can always get an ice cold beer here. But they also have a few non spirits if you're a good DD. The food is respectably good for bar food. I do believe that a pretty face is no excuse for terrible service but I have never had a bad experience here yet. Even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"First time here, service was amazing. The girls are so sweet especially Jessalyn, who continuously checked up on me and  made sure my food and drinks were just right. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Food and portion was great and hearty!  And Vanessa (our server) definitely did a great job checking up on us and making sure our meal experience was pleasant    Had the Peak Sampler, 10oz Steak and some Nachos - all recommended!"}
{"text":"Men love this place! I visited this restaurant at lunch for the first time. There were more men at this restaurant than I have seen in all the restaurants in AZ. Good location, good food and variety, multiple TVs to follow sports, attractive young women in revealing uniforms to serve you; makes for a good place for men to hang out."}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me as a female, because right away the \"uniforms\" aka booty pants and tied up shirt just automatically make me judge the establishment. However, all the girls working were very nice, and a weird part of me wanted to let them know they didn't have to deal with these outfits...but I guess they chose that right...  Anyways, like I said staff was always nice and helpful. We got a table on the outside patio that was great scenery to eat and hang out. I had the Greek salad which I LOVED! I highly suggest it. My husband had wings which he described as standard, ok, bar wings. We had a coupon for this restaurant which really influenced our decision on going, but I'd recommend it to others. I didn't realize it's a chain so I'm not sure if our experience was standard or not."}
{"text":"The menu is limited but everything on it is good! The girls are very nice and friendly (this coming from a female) and the beer is cold, cold, cold!"}
{"text":"Before I stepped in to Twin Peaks, I already had this preconceived notion that I'll get regular bar food. To my surprise they had plenty of great choices. I had the Classic cheese burger with their billionaire bacon. I would even go back for just the bacon. They serve their beer woman size and man size. I find that hilarious. My husband had to man up and order the man size, otherwise I'd give him crap the rest of the day. Great service and would go back again."}
{"text":"We went there for thr Cotto VS Canelo fight, the venue was packed. And even though there was a full house the waiters were attentive and friendly. The enviroment was great for the fight. We ordered wings, fries, and pulled pork nachos.. everything was good! We had some beers of course and they were ICE cold! I will be returning, possibly for another event. It was a fun experience. The prices sealed the deal for me, I was shocked and happy to see the damage wasnt too bad.  Oh yea, the signage for the bathrooms are hilarious, I got a kick out of those also. Lol."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great cold brews. Philly Cheese Steak sandwich was really good.  I sat in the way back, but was able to peep on Hank.  He was with a group of people, not friends, because everyone hates him. But I saw his friends telling him he should ask the waitress out, because she liked him.  Of course she didn't, but he asked anyway.  She turned him down and he put his head on the table and cried like a baby.  I recommend 4 Peaks.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Went there and scenery may be nice to look at but service was so bad we left and saw about 8 others leave before we did.  Ashley was bar tending and if you weren't her friend you weren't getting any type of service. I'm in Vegas often for work and entertaining but would never bring a customer here that I want to take care of."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love the atmosphere and the chicken fried steak. The meatloaf is also excellent. And the pot roast is the bomb!"}
{"text":"We waited quite a while to be seated, although it was a busier night. The service was great, our waitress was very friendly. Food was just alright, and the beer was decent and cold, but overpriced.  Overall, I'm glad I went once to try it, but I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! BEST AND COLDEST BEERS in Vegas! It is my (and my husband's) new favorite place to watch sports! And who doesn't love an AWESOME cold beer while watching your favorite sports team?! Their hot wings are great, hamburgers are super yummy, flavorful, and juicy. We've been here at least 3 times in the last week...especially since it's hockey playoff season! ;)"}
{"text":"We received good service here when we came, despite them switching waitresses halfway through because our original waitress \"wasn't feeling well.\"  The parking was good, the food was good and if you are seated near the bar by the back, you have an amazing view of a WALL OF TVs.  I want to come back here during the NFL season and watch all the games here.  They also have those giant beers that are super cold."}
{"text":"I love that this one has a climbing wall.  Next time I will try it.  They also have a really cool patio, which happened to be closed when we were there.  Other than that, I think it's a pretty standard Peaks.  Giant cold beers, pretty girls, lots of TVs on the walls."}
{"text":"Seems like a pretty cool place.  The one time I went here the service was pretty decent.  They have a huge facility with lots of tables and quite a few TVs as well. My friend ordered the nachos and I wasn't a fan of the sauce they had on them, but it was a huge pile of food.  I think it's funny how they ask you if you want a man size beer or girly sized beer.  I was only here a short time, but I think I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"Coldest beer possible, beautiful bartenders & delicious food! It's a must when in Vegas"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! The BBQ nachos seemed to have diarrhea on them. They were inedible. We took the rest of our untouched food and gave it to a homeless person who is probably very mad at us now. Might have been the worst food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The bartenders are awesome! Everyone I've had the pleasure of meeting has been great. The food is delish and they have a good selection of beer. Also plenty of tvs for any sport. Definitely recommended for a good spot to have a drink and watch the games."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed opening night tonight! Our server was Julie and she was awesome! She made sure we felt welcome and drinks were always fresh! Make sure you ask her when you stop over!  If your having a party the shot ski is where it begins here!"}
{"text":"Sadly, both exactly what I expected and also not as good as I hoped.  Twin Peaks, the name alone would suggest exactly what I found. There happened to be a staff meeting so I would guess most of the employees were present. Immediately you notice that there are many many female staff and they could all fit the same sized clothes...in other words it appears they are hired specifically for their body shapes= great for the male customers.   The servers were nice and friendly, a little over the top friendly but the actual service received was very slow and inconsistent. The food was alright, but mainly typical bar foods, hamburgers, nachos and sandwiches and wings. Nothing to brag about. It isn't too pricey and they do try to please the customer. There must be 20 TVs in there, half are on the same channel.   I was hopeful it would be a new favorite close to home but the service and food can already be beat by the restaurants I currently frequent."}
{"text":"Well... where shall we start. We came here for a quick lunch bite before hitting the mall after Thanksgiving (on a Sunday... so the craziness has died down a little). I have never been to this Twin Peaks (or the other... you know, the REAL Twin Peaks), thus I didn't know what I was walking into. The hostesses and the waitresses all look to be barely 18, and barely dressed. I felt like I may end up in jail if I look at anyone of them for too long.  For a slow afternoon, the service was even slower. I understand it was in between shift, but if we were the only table, I should not have to wait extensively for drink refills. Especially when at times a group of the barely dressed and barely legal waitresses were all just sitting around at a table doing nothing. I do have to say that the food was good. I had the BLT served with a side of tomato soup. For $11 it is not cheap but it can be worse.  I know this is a spot for the boys to hang out and watch games, and I think they have done a good job catering to that clientele. Personally I think their TV setups are not the best (at least from where I sat, my neck hurt trying to watch the few games that were on). And by gosh do the girls have to look like they're still in middle school and stole their mama's makeups?"}
{"text":"Visited with a group of five. Not particularly busy on a late Saturday afternoon.  Waitress was pleasant, attentive, but not knowledgeable of beer or draft selection.   Fried pickles came out with meal, so really didn't enjoy them, as they tasted as though they were prepared way before meal....cold, yuk! I personally ordered the Ol' Fashion BLT, requesting NO TOAST and the special \"ranch type mayo\" the waitress talked of to be on the side.  I got a sandwich with extremely hard toasted bread, and regular mayo in a cup.  Plenty of bacon, but couldn't get past that bread!  Mom's pot roast and fish n chips were satisfactory, or so said my guests.  $2.79 for dead cola was not well received.  Not sure I will be fighting the traffic to frequent Twin Peaks next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are only because the food and the atmosphere are good but unfortunately it doesn't matter how good everything else is if the service is horrible. We are in love with the menu but never get greeted in a timely manner, our food and drinks take entirely too long, and no one ever comes to check up. We have come here over a dozen times trying to give it a chance because of the food, our friends and its hot spot reputation but have been dissapointed every time. The hosts and kitchen do a fine job but the servers are extremely bad. This place may have the best looking staff in town but they have no service skills to offer."}
{"text":"I went here last night and had a great time as usual. I can only give 4 stars for my experience last night because of their hostess. The young lady appeared to be unhappy/stressed out or even disinterested. I won't speculate why this happened, but I'd only want to encourage her to be the best actress she can be in her situation. That said, typically, my experiences here are 5 star. I moved here to Arizona in December and my apartment manager told me about Twin Peaks. I've been a regular ever since.   Last night was super slow at work, so while in the area I stopped in for a bite. I was elated to find out Sydnie was there. She was the first TP girl I had met and often request her on my repeat trips in. As usual, she was effervescent, kind and attentive. She was busy so she didn't get to sit with me, yet still made the effort to visit. She is an absolute doll. I really believe she is a genuine five star girl. Fantastic!  I ordered their chicken fried steak this time. Phenomenal dish. I was raised on low country/soul food and this was an amazing interpretation of that. The plating was top notch. I've been in the business for many years, so eye appeal is a large part of the experience. The flavor of the CFS alone was amazing, cooked perfectly, not greasy. It has a light seasoning on it, the steak was tender and easy to cut, and I especially loved the crunchy bits that make up the breading. Good stuff. The potatoes were amazing. I love the creamy garlic goodness. The gravy that complemented both the CFS and Potatoes was really tasty. Creamy, rich flavor of a true country gravy with the subtleness of jalapeno.  I've never had a creamy jalapeno gravy but this was great. Now what I affectionately call Rabbit Food. I am not a big proponent of vegetables; however, TP really knows how to serve them up. The green beans and onions were cooked up perfectly. To add flair and color the diced tomatoes and corn made them pop, but the real excitement added to these veggies was the addition of real pieces of bacon.   I really enjoy my time here and will continue to come in as my budget allows. I also want to compliment the manager on duty. Nearly every time I come in, Justin is there. What a great guy. Attentive to his guests, and respectful to the girls. He's awesome, and clearly the girls enjoy working with him. I can't wait to go back. I've had nearly everything on the menu. So, I cannot recommend one thing. At Twin Peaks Camelback, It's all good."}
{"text":"This is a big place woth outdoor seating. The waitresses are wearing revealing clothes, but are really friendly. They have 3 drinks that are $6 everyday. I got the mimosa and it was a great size. I only ordered the BBQ pulled pork nachos. They were really good. Fun place to drink."}
{"text":"This was my second time there. Giving them a second chance from the first bad experience . From the first time: *The servers acted like they never served before .  *you could tell the fries were frozen and the Burger wasn't anything special. It was actually disgusting  *They don't know how to check up on tables *Customer service is terrible. *They take your check and card before you even look at the check total. *And they clean the table and our server checked in front of me on what I tipped!  So now is the second time i went I brought my fiancÃ© .  the menu is very limited but we saw something that said \"chicken fried steak or chicken\"  I assumed... Due to the conjunction.. It was just a regular chicken breast.. So when it was brought out/ it was fried as well.  I told the server I thought it wasn't fried. Because of the wording on the menu And her friend came over with a menu and showed me to my face how it's fried  Then both the girls went to my fiancÃ© trying to talk him into just eating it when really I'm the one who had the problem   Bottom line.. You don't go there for the food. Or the service ."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and we had a great time.   I would absolutely give 5 stars for service. Every girl we talked to, and there were a few between the hostess (who later became our waitress) our first waitress, another girl who brought drinks and another one who just walked by, were really really nice! I was actually blown away by that because I have had a run of crappy servers lately, and all these girls were just great at chatting you up and being super friendly. I get that it is obviously the thing they have to do given that I am sure they are aiming for the biggest tips possible considering they are practically naked, but I really appreciated the very nice, but not in a fake way, service.   We were there for the late night happy hour (M-F starts at 9pm) and the prices were great! Shots (good ones!) were $3 and appetizers were half off. We ate and drank (a lot!) and the bill was under $50. I was also impressed with how many TV's they had, even a small personal one in each booth. I can imagine this will be a fun place to watch games.   The only reason I felt like I could only, give 3 stars is the food selection was pretty minimal and of the three appetizers we got (pretzels, queso and chips, and pulled pork nachos) the pulled pork nachos weren't that great. I think if they had maybe some regular or irish nachos, regular sliders (they just had pulled pork) and maybe quesadillas, it would be perfect, but that might just be my preference.   Even with the minimal menu, we will definitely be back. The girls and prices were great!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't been to Vegas in over 4 years, and based on our last experience we knew we had to come visit Twin Peaks. Our server was Nicole and was AMAZING! She was so attentive and made sure our plates and glasses were never empty. Thank you for taking such great care of us Nicole! #marchmadnessattwinpeaks"}
{"text":"My friends had a Monday night football party at twin peaks and the food was awesome and the waitresses were beautiful and friendly. They will be there every week for Monday night football - do yourself a favor and enjoy the party and amazing atmosphere here - you will not be disappointed. Paul"}
{"text":"One nice thing about this place is the ice cold beer, but they need more selections on their draft beers. The food is alright and the servers/bartenders are great. They need to improve their food menu other than that is a okay place to have beer."}
{"text":"Great place. Traditionally a guy hangout, very \"mountain man\" \" hunter\" with servers, women showing their \"twin peaks\" aka low cut blouses,  they are very friendly to women as well. Had a great server very sweet.  Thought her name was Ellen but different name on name tag. Sweet, fast service. Attentive and friendly.  Beer and food very good."}
{"text":"I would say more like 3.5 stars, so I'll be nice and round up.  I was excited to see that Twin Peaks opened in the area and was disappointed to hear about and see a lot of bad reviews.  I needed a quick bite to eat before my bowling league on Sunday and would normally go to BJ's next door.  I decided to try something different and stopped in Twin Peaks.  Upon entering, I was immediately hit with the smell of fresh wood.  The entire place looks like a lodge in the mountains somewhere.  There were at least 7 hostesses/servers gathered at the host stand, chatting.  They immediately greeted me and offered a seat.  I just decided to sit at the bar, as I usually do when I am by myself.  This is a pretty large place with TONS of seating.  There are booths, tables and high tops, as well as a patio with tables.  There are also a lot of TV's.  Depending on what specials they offer (if any), this could be a great place to watch football.  It didn't take very long for the bartender (Rachael) to approach me.  I decided to try one of their signature beers - the Knotty (Naughty) Brunette.  They also offer a Dirty Blonde.  It was served in a large glass mug and was SUPER cold.  Cold beer is good beer.  It was reasonably priced at $7.  I also noticed that they had Sculpin and another BP beer on tap, which is awesome.  That alone is worth another visit (I didn't see if the Sculpin is also $7 - if so, I might become a regular. LOL).  The bartender asked if I wanted to start a tab or pay cash as I go.  I understand why they do this, but I had already told her that I was also ordering food, so it was silly for me to pay for my beer and then my food seperately.  The strange thing is, once I ordered food, she just placed the receipt in the glass in front of me and never asked for payment. Fine by me, but why bring it up if you're not going to follow through?  Anyhow, I ordered the steak salad ($12.95).  It was pretty good.  The steak was slightly over done - I ordered it medium rare and there wasn't much pink, if any at all.  Not horrible though.  The salad itself was good.  It was romaine lettuce with pico de gallo, pepper jack, roasted corn, tortilla strips and black beans with a cilantro lime vinaigrette.  The dressing was light and really good.  I am not sure I'd order this again, but it was good for a late lunch.  Overall, this place was solid.  The service was fast and friendly at the bar and the beer was very cold.  I would definitely like to go back and sit at a table to see what all the complaints are about.  But I will say this:  it's obvious that (most of) these girls were not hired based off skill.  Give them a break!  I think people are being far too hard on them.  1st of all, it's a newly opened restaurant and there will be kinks to work out.  2nd of all - I bet the guys aren't complaining!"}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person, but this place was TERRIBLE. I went there for Monday night football and I get it when the house is packed and service might be a little slow. It's one thing to mess up on orders one or two times, but to NEVER get your order right every time the server came back was awful. I didn't order beer and asked for water, she came back 4 times and forgot my water but remembered my friends beer orders, somewhat. She brought a different beer for my boyfriend but he drank it anyways knowing she wasn't coming back for a while. Our food was okay besides for the chicken nachos, which our server forgot to put in an order for and came out at the very end. I don't know how you mess up nachos but the chicken tasted terrible and covered in gross fake cheese. She forgot our plates well after our appetizers came out so we just started eating off the appetizer plate. OH AND FOR DESSERT I was craving the HOT brownie Sunday that they advertise as a HOT brownie with ice cream on top. Simple, right? The server came out with it and said she made sure it was extra good, meaning she probably made it worse or probably even spit it in. The Sunday was served on a skillet meaning that it should be hot and not to touch, but the brownie was colder than the ice cream on top. I was furious after this first time here. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. And will tell all my friends my experience. I've never had such a terrible experience going out for drinks and a few bites to eat."}
{"text":"I had always gone to Twin Peaks because they were always accommodating when I wanted to watch my team play and is in our neighborhood. However, there have been a few times now where the service has been sub par, just like the food. One time, the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes not once checking on us. I had to flag her down to get our bill. Which, is not something I like to do as I find it extremely rude. It seems disappearing waitresses are a part of the service there. However, the last straw for me was last night. My son and I went so we could catch the Cardinals v Ravens game. The only seating available was outside, so we took it. However, they sat us close enough to the smoking section that some patrons took upon themselves to start smoking in our vicinity. Literally, the next table over. I made a complaint to the waitress. To her credit, she asked those smoking to move to the smoking section or put out the cigarette. But, that didn't stop other patrons from smoking in non designated spots and when I complained once more, a female patron (sitting at the table I complained about earlier) took it upon herself to insult my child's manners. (He is extremely well behaved, but may have been mistaken for not having any since we were rooting for the Ravens and he was also complaining about the cigarette smoke.) I think it's time to find another place close to home that will play the games. I had always suggested this place because they used to have good service and appreciated the fact that they were accommodating. Well...that's no more. I'm done. If you can't provide good service and can't keep the patrons in line...then nope. This is a restaurant, not a bar. I don't expect that people would talk smack to me when I'm with my child, at least not at a place like that. It was overpriced anyway. Good riddance Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"My friend and I met for lunch. She wanted to try it because of Undercover Boss. She tried to order the pork sliders and was told they weren't on the menu that we were ordering from anymore! I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and she ordered a burger. The food was just average. My turkey avocado had only a tiny bit of avocado and lots of kale (which I had to take off). The bread was super hard and didn't have any condiments on it. The only thing that was good was the sweet potato fries. My friend said her burger wasn't that good and could only eat a couple bites. Her friends were heavily salted with a Cajun powder. I couldn't even eat a whole fry. The bar was loud with a whole bunch of sports games going on and unenjoyable. We both said we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"I came to this location to enjoy a cold beer and some food. We got seated and sat there with no one telling us they would be right with us for over 10 min. Then I got up to ask for a manager no one came I waved a waitress down she looked right through me like she didn't work there. I already knew what I wanted to order. When I got up to look for a manager all there waitress where taking pictures in the middle of busy hrs. The waitress only helped the people that where hugging them or had there hand on there asses. I have come to this place many times and never been treated like this, yes maybe my order was a little wrong in the pasted, but 5 different waitress walked by and never even said a word to us. I went down the Street to PT's and got way better service and food. I don't recommend this place feel like they are running a prostitution ring then a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really hope, for the restaurants sake, that the Hispanic gentleman yelling slurs in Spanish as well as \"The bathroom is flooded\" across the restaurant wasn't the manager. He seemed like he was, but wow he is extremely unprofessional and I would immediately get rid of him. He kind of walked around like a swagger as if he was the best thing next to slice bread, made me and my wife feel I uncomfortable. Instead of doing work he remained leaning up against the wall talking to all his waitresses and it seemed like he was just hitting on all them. What a great environment for families, couples and all the restaurant patrons.   On a good note our waitress was awesome! Definitely not a direct reflection of her manager.   To top it off this gentleman had an \"LA\" hat, way to represent JK! Smh"}
{"text":"First time here, ice cold beer, great food, TVs everywhere, even in your own booth and beautiful servers everywhere.  Would have given a 5 star but our server was a little slow, I think she was relatively new, but was very friendly and tried her best in the mayhem of a Sunday football crowd."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and it was a bad experience. Food and service sucked. The waitress was not friendly or what you would expect here. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Shak is killing it! Great attitude, great service.  Fun environment. Easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"My first and only visit to Twin Peaks did not go well.  A friend and I met for a drink.  First, my preference is always wine.  I was informed they were \"out of Cabernet.\"  Not only that, they were out of all red wine and could only offer white zinfandel as a substitution.  Second, I ordered six wings.  They were not well cooked and lacked the spicy Thai chili that I was expecting.  Needless to say, I was doubly disappointed.  To top that off, service was not up to par, especially since the restaurant was pretty empty before the after work crowd arrived.  I will say, however, the men in the bar seemed content with their beer, food, and service.  Their satisfaction was likely pre-empted by the Hooters-like, scantily-clad wait staff.  I will say the numerous televisions were helpful; keeping me occupied with Big 3 Basketball while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Never again. First off if you are there just for the girls and don't care about the food, then don't bother reading further. I ordered the Hangover Burger and after waiting 30 minutes for it, I was shocked at what they brought to my table. The patty (if you can call it that) was as thin as the coasters, as a matter of fact I think that the McDonald's crap patties were thicker. To top it off, the patty wasn't complete it literally seemed as if someone took a bite out of it. How could the cook even put that out to a paying customer? The egg it comes with was bad. The lettuce was wilted and the size of a silver dollar. Really? The worst part was when we asked our very nice waitress Brenda called over a manager and when I explained to him the situation he stupidly responded, \"so you don't want the burger because it's missing a piece?\" Wow. Me and the wife just paid for our one beer, one margarita, and one chx tenders appetizer (total $37) and left.  Never again."}
{"text":"My fav spot to watch sports hands down. Mixed crowd and the beer is icey cold. Waitress staff is always great. Nina-Renee is awsome!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with management. Asked for a piece of foil for my leftovers, can't use a box with my saddlebag on a motorcycle. Manager refused to give me one small piece. My food was cold. Don't go to this restaurant if you want your food fast."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here I'm not going to get PPV fights at home when I can go here! Big ups to Calandra and Jackie did a great job!!!!! I loved the Chicken and Shrimp basket it was very filling. If you are a beer drinker please order the man beer it will hit the spot.!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place the customer service is really good I plan on making this a regular spot"}
{"text":"Met some colleagues here.  I've actually never been to a Hooters, but my colleagues tell me the food here is better.  My priority was to get good beer, and this place delivered.  Their two house brews are both good.  They have a hefe (Dirty Blond) which was decent, but my favorite was the Naughty Brunette.  It's an amber and has some nice toasty notes.  The beers come in either a truly massive mug, or a very large, tall stein.  The smaller of the two must still be at least 20oz.  They also have a seasonal Sam Adams and Newcastle on tap, along with the usual crap beers (Bud/Miller type stuff).  Be aware that if you're a beer snob and don't like your beer cold to the point where the head is slushy, this is probably not a good place for you.  The food is typical for this type of place.  I got a grilled chipotle chicken dish that was good, if a little heavily seasoned.  Kind of a small piece of chicken, but the price was reasonable.  My companions reported that the Hangover burger was very good.  The salsa that came with the chips was also really good, with a smoky flavor.  The girls are everywhere at this place, and go out of their way to be friendly, to the point I found them slightly annoying.  We kept having our conversation interrupted by one scantily-clad server or another, trying to initiate idle chit chat.  Some guys may appreciate the attention, but as a married man, I could've done without.  The climbing wall is kind of a cool gimmick, and it's only $10 to try it.  They have 4 routes, but two are super short and should only be done by kids.  The other 2 have an overhanging section and it's fun to watch the drunken attempt to negotiate them.  The gimmick includes a \"race\" with your server, where you climb the wall and then your server climbs it and tries to beat your time.  Actually, they pretty much WILL beat your time, since it's clear they've climbed these routes many, many times.  My colleague, a very fit (and very inebriated) guy climbed the easier overhanging route in 2:34.  His server did it in 1:11, so be prepared to lose the wager your waitress will inevitably make with you.  Parking for locals is kind of a challenge.  There may be a better way to do it, but I parked in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile garage, then walked all the way through the Planet Hollywood to get to the restaurant.  All in all, this would be a fun place for a group of guys to go hang out and have good beer and good food.  The waitresses will definitely make sure you have a good time, and it's all good clean fun.  You can definitely do worse on the Strip, and this is a particularly good option if none of the bars/lounges in the Cosmopolitan are doing it for you (which they likely are not if you're reading reviews on Twin Peaks)."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had the hangover burgers, best hamburger I have ever had. The atmosphere is great and the staff is amazing and beautiful!"}
{"text":"We had seen the not so nice reviews but wanted to give this place a shot.  We are sure glad we did.  We went on Sunday the 23rd around lunch time.  The only problem was we asked if they had any booths and were told no with no explanation as to why there were at least 6 available.   Our server was happy to find the Angel's baseball game for us on one of the many big screens.  I believe her name is Lauren.  The Asst Mgr and the Mgr also made a point to come introduce themselves while we were there.  Lauren was very attentive to our needs.  My husband had the BEELT with the fire fries...DELISH..I had the a cup of the venison chili so good to go with the cheese and sausage dip with the chips to go with our beer and cocktail.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed   Deb & Tim"}

{"text":"Yes!  The Lumberjack Hooters.  We had not ever been here before, it was exactly what I expected.  Hooters, but with plaid shirts and suspenders and daisy dukes.  All the girls were very nice and helpful when we needed food and drink.    We got the Billionaire Bacon (?)  it's definitely something you should not eat often, unless you wanna die.  But it was gooooood.  Bacon, with something sweet, and smoked, and peppercorns or something.  Wow.  Artery clogger though.  I got the Shaved Turkey Sandwich, likely one of the healthier menu items.  Barely could get though half.  HUGE.  Boyfriend got one of the burgers, seemed to love it.  Everything was tasty.  Lots of TV's and a good sports bar vibe.    Special shout out to the adorable blond hostess who seated us, and had just had knee surgery, she was super friendly and told us her fave menu items when I asked, made sure we got seated where we could watch the Jets game, which made the whole experience great from the very start.    We will return when in Vegas, its a good spot for Football on Sunday's, for sure.  I bet it's good in there for Monday Night Football too."}
{"text":"Location - great. Atmosphere - great. Cold beer variety - great. Food - awful! This place has so much going for it but desperately needs a revamped menu particularly for entrees. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was worse than I can truly describe here. It was paper thin, overly fried and was one big crisp. No meat at all, nothing more than a batter and fried greasy plank. The two vegetables (no options there, which is weird too) were just as bad."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Almost received no fish in my \"fish tacos\"!? I asked for it to be fixed which she did with a nice attitude. SMH!     Also for some reason it's ok to use faul language!? A few guys kept using the word \"PUSSY\"? If it were me id be called CREEPY and escorted out the restaurant. They also felt it was ok to talk about black people in light of all the negative things happening now. I'LL never attended this racist establishment ever again. I was a regular from Vegas to Phoenix. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm updating this because we had a large party (40+) here and shockingly and against all the previous reviews....the service was fantastic. Originally they had us on the patio but it was like 90 degrees out there so they adjusted and put us inside very quickly. Lots of beers and drinks flowing, and they came out and presented our group with some sliders, appetizer combo, and chips and queso. I was actually impressed with the service, and the food. Well done Twin Peaks!"}
{"text":"Hosted was nice. I can't believe she remembered me. I haven't been here for more then a year maybe two years... Crazy.. My waitress Jackie was really nice food was good. She was very attentive and present. The price point was good too. Good energy. Best Twin Peaks location in Vegas btw"}
{"text":"My friends wanted to see some \"peaks\" and I was NOT about to go to hooters. Twin peaks is more classy and the atmosphere is comfortable. Waitresses aren't too in your face \"look at me\" approach but just working like any other place. Felt comfortable. All the games playing and not too loud.  Food was actually surprisingly good. I suggest the nachos. Pretty good."}
{"text":"While the food is way better than Hooters, this is a borderline strip bar that blurs the line between strippers and a restaurant. \"Breastaurant\" really does best describe it. I would NEVER take my kids to this self proclaimed \"Family Restaurant\" as the owner likes to call it. I've given this place four different shots over the past 8 months to get their service right and the last visit took over an hour to get a basic hamburger and fries.  I finally walked out before ever seeing the food.  Thank God Carolina Ale House opened up just a block away. The food is great but the service is spectacular there."}
{"text":"A decent place to watch the game and other sports. The service is not the best there but you are not going there for the best service. This is what I call a breastrant. The food is pretty good nice portions for the price. The staff is friendly n gorgeous as they should be."}
{"text":"Twin peaks Henderson is great!!!! Indiana is the greatest at the bar. Always a fun time!"}
{"text":"This may be a chain, but it is without a doubt the BEST chain, the beer is ICE cold, the food is made here, and excellent! The bread pudding is better than my mom's (sorry momma) it's made in house and is to die for. Sara is our \"go to\" girl, she's coincidentally been our waitress 3 out of the 4 times we've visited.  Rob, the general mgr visited us  just to ask how about our experience, not kidding, the staff is the best."}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good, service sucked. I don't I'll be coming back. I've had better sports bar food."}
{"text":"Kind of like a Hooters except much, much better! They even have an indoor rock climbing wall that's somewhere around 40ft tall! I think they are going for a high end pub type of feel with their food.. The chicken sliders come with a maple glazed slice of bacon on a dense biscuit style bun and a cute little micro green for good measure.. Super good. But the obvious theme of young large breasted bartenders and waitresses doesn't exactly match up. Don't get me wrong we enjoyed both the large breasted bartenders as well as the food but it all felt disconnected. At least they have beers on tap and a long list of fruity drinks if you want that too. When you're drinking in Vegas who really cares about the cohesiveness of the theme right!? I wouldn't mind going back again."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but you don't come here for food. Several beer selections. Service is ok. They don't have the pretzel any more. So that sucks."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It is like Hooters but much better. Great food, Great Price, Great beer. Lots of TVs, Rock Climbing wall and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Well, not my kind of place. I followed coworkers on this trip. Can't say the eye candy wasn't bad but I just want a nice cold beer and some OK bar grub and I got it. That's basically all you're gonna get here plus an eye strain. LOL. The girls were actually very nice.  Loaded with TVs everywhere and tiny skirts so if you're into that kind of stuff, end up here."}
{"text":"Just had the worst cooked to order burger I have ever had.  My medium rare grilled to order burger was cooked until it was dead and beaten.  It was awful. And the women smoking at the table next to us.... outside of the designated smoking area provided an unwelcome smokey flavor to our meal. But the cold fries were a perfect compliment to the awful burger."}
{"text":"Thought I would be stating the obvious but male Elite Yelpers were too generous with there reviews of this spot. Yes, the eye candy here is what makes the place but there should be some regard to service as well. Yes we went during a Cardinals MNF game but got there before it started. Our server had no clue how to describe even the two house beers or anything about it. She just knows the canned response about would you like to try brunette or blonde and would you like to start off with an appetizer. If those are the things you are promoting be able to describe it! Right?  She didn't know what wines were available didn't know which ones on her cheat sheet were red or white.I get it, most fellas don't come here for wine but if you are a server expect people to order wine. After the drink order is placed a girl brings the wine and truly ten minutes later when I ask about my beer she tells me bar is backed up and thats why I havent got my beer? So did the wine not come from the bar? When the third girl comes with the beer she guesses two random tables before getting to me. While on the patio that happened to two other tables different girls for different order items could never get it right. Both times third try was the charm..   We ordered the chicken tender basket(reasonably priced ) realy liked the honey mustard. No ketchup at the table and no plates. I ask for plates ketchup and Tabasco from the girl who brought out food(not our server) . We never see her again.  When our server comes back I ask for all three she later comes back with 2 of 3. My patience is being tested but I tell myself I don't need Tabasco because by the time she brings it my fries will be done.   I see a guy nearby who also was waiting on a beer for sometime when a manager comes by and does his table check he apologizes brings him the beer and comps it.    This was yesterday when it was really muggy after our record rainfall but they didnt think to turn on the awesome mister thing they have until almost halftime. Life would have been so much more pleasant if those were on earlier. Also, they kept trying to time the commercials to play music but started off with some horrible 80's music during commercials but they were constantly off on when they cut the music and came back to game sound. Whats the big deal with letting the commercials play through?  In a nutshell if you are coming here just to watch sports and admire the female shape you are in a good place.   If you want decent service and the female shape on display  try Tilted Kilt or Hooters. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I came into twin peaks scottsdale a few times and have met Jordann G she's the best as well as the cold beer and that venison chili burger!!!! Great hangout spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Lively place love the big screen tv's and plenty of elbow room.. Host and nice with great attitude."}
{"text":"Love this place! I found the environment to be lively and full of great energy. As I walked into the restaurant, I could see that people were engrossed in conversations, laughter, and accompanied by good food.   The waitresses are really good with their service. The friends that I arrived with have a particular \"set of demands\" and every request that we threw at our waitress (Genies), she did her very best to accommodate us. Also, I need to mention, I drink a ton of water, so I really appreciated that our server never let my drink cup reach below the halfway mark before bringing me another refill. This was very attentive on her part. As an appetizer, my friends and I shared the Fried Pickles and I ordered the Sourdough BLT with a side of fire fries (don't worry they are not spicy- the name comes from their seasoning). I can only speak for myself, but I found the food to be rather enjoyable and, judging from the expressions of my friend's, I am sure they did too.    You can expect to see a large ratio of men at the restaurant. But what do you expect when you have young beautiful women roaming around and serving you food!? They have television sets that surround the entire restaurant streaming a variety of sporting events. The place was nicely decorated and has a cabin-like feel with taxidermy work surrounding the perimeter of the main room.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come here again. Next time, I'll be sure to try more of what's on their menu :-P"}
{"text":"I love the food and cold beer at Twin Peaks but this location is a tourist trap.  My husband bought me an ugly plastic mug from this location because the waitress said it would get discounted beer at every Twin Peaks location. She said it can only be purchased at this location.  Tonight he took the mug to the Henderson location and they said they've never heard of this mug. The mug is ugly and giant so we wouldn't have purchased it unless it got discounted beer.   Below is a picture of the mug. Our friend tried to use his at a Florida location and was told they had never heard of this deal. So yeah.... totally ripped off by our waitress.   Tomorrow we're calling the Twin Peaks on the strip to complain but I also wanted to post and warn people so no one else gets scammed."}
{"text":"Love coming to twin peaks Henderson when Shak is behind the bar! Such great service with good vibes;her and jess killed it today when and friend and I came in for a bite to eat. The food is great and the beer is cold; best place to be on a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Really loud.  This is like booming night club loud. I guess that grabs the street traffic but you can not talk to your party Food and girls are great like Twin Peaks anywhere, just really fucking loud.  And they have a rock climbing wall."}
{"text":"The owner/manager messaged me directly. Wanted to know exactly what happened. I emailed her everything that had happened in detail and then she disappeared. Been over a week now. Typical."}
{"text":"A friend and I took a shot in the dark and tried Twin Peaks for an afternoon discussion. Laken was a bullseye. She lined us up in the crosshairs, pulled the trigger, and delivered a shot that we won't forget. If I had the opportunity to host a party on the lake, she would be the hostess and planner. Her energy and resilience is admirable. Best of luck to her and the establishment."}
{"text":"Concept is nothing new but food is decent, beer is cold, run good promos & the views pretty good  ps time before last I think a female manager worked bar & customer service very good..."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere. And I don't mean the girls. They are very unattractive and are fresh out of Highschool! I took my brother here for his birthday and he definitely left disappointed. The service was not good. Our waitress checked up on us one time. And the food was extremely salty. And I like my salt! There is not much of a selection on the menu either. I will not be returning! And neither will my brother!"}
{"text":"I've never felt so insecure in my life. If I ever got to Vegas with a boyfriend, I wouldn't take him here.  All the waitresses have bangin' bodies & are suuuuuper friendly.  Being a CRM myself, I know that implementing processes & having your employees convict to making sure that it gets done is a hard thing but Twin Peaks has done just that. You can tell that their employees enjoy working there & take pride in the service they provide. Quite refreshing if you ask me. OKay .. enough about processes & what-not.  Again, I gave up meat for Lent so I ordered the Chipotle Queso & Chips. It was yummy. We were checked on by several different waitresses to make sure everything was fine. We sat outside on the deck because we wanted to enjoy the view.   All in all I recommend!"}
{"text":"What is this travesty?! There is only one Twin Peeks in Charlotte and it doesn't serve food if ya catch my drift....Well I guess in this context I guess there would be two peaks per girl.....  muahahaha   ^ ^ o o    ,}  O  Same owner? I hope so otherwise there might be some cause for widespread panic and confusion."}
{"text":"Service was great wish I could say the same about my food. Super undercooked wings! Bleh  Won't be back this is my second bad experience at a twin peaks it was a different location but I decided to give it another try. Glad I checked my wings but my partner didn't now her stomach feels bubbly and not the good kind.  EEKKK it's been hard eating in Vegas. * A manager came and apologized and removed the wings off our bill."}
{"text":"Went into this eyes wide open, regarding expectations that is, for how service might be considering the priority on the scenery.  My Stone Go-To IPA was served in a frozen stein with ice chips in it, and was excluded from the happy hour discount.  Fried cheese appetizer was generous in portion, which was a plus.  Service was average.  The main negative was the exclusion of craft beers in the happy hour.  Major no no.  Won't be back.  Sorry, not interested in a PBR happy hour.  Update/Edit: received friendly email from staff.  Beer is served at 29 degrees and they are proud of their ice chips.  I'll have to keep that in mind if I'm going to order an IPA.  Also, fried cheese appetizer is homemade and some of the craft beers are included.  Thanks for the info!"}
{"text":"My meal was awesome and service was 5 star.  Michelle the server took care of me and over tipped her."}
{"text":"The staff is rude. It took 30 minutes to get a water. No one refilled it. The food took over an hour and a half to come out. The burger I ordered was dry and the bacon was cold. Oh, and my cheese burger didn't have cheese.. I would have sent it back but I didn't want to wait another 4 hours for my food.  Would not come back.   **edit I felt the management was awesome when I brought it to their attention and I appreciate how it was handled over all."}
{"text":"Grate place.   Shak is RAD.  She is so friendly with the wonderful smile.  #friendzone."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got  so many 1 or 2 star ratings.  It obviously isn't the Ritz, but we know that going in.  It's a chain with standard bar food & skimpy dressed girls.  We went in today for our free memorial day meal.  The main webpage said we could have anything on the menu under $14.95 for free  so I looked at the menu online and had my taste buds set on the pot roast dinner which was $14.75.  But when we got there we were shown a small list  food  menu with cheaper $7-$9 items we had to pick from.  No pot roast for us!  I wasn't too happy but  okay it's free so why bitch.  The chicken tenders were good enough. They do have the coldest beer in town, and that makes it worth one star.    Service was above average.  The girls here are a bit better looking than Hooters tramps, and a bit smarter.  The place is clean and bathrooms too.  The  beers are not cheap running $6-$7 but they are huge.  You can get a half size but only save a buck. They are open late, which is good.   Overall a good place for happy hour where you save money.  I would go back if I needed a late night snack I guess. Perhaps next year they will give us the free pot roast. If I win the lotto I will certainly go back and get  one of those hot chicks to move in with me.  Or perhaps two!"}
{"text":"Honored they have a military discount but the chicken tenders were flavorless. Server shay was nice which brought the score up."}
{"text":"Great location, good Sangria and Long Island Iced tea! Excellent hostesss..the Nachos we ordered were just okay...we just went there to kill some time and have some good cocktails and mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"Frosty beer and cute girls but service is horrible! Sat for 15 minutes or so before getting any kind of service. Once I got service it took an additional 10 minutes or so before I got my beer. Food is decent but took forever."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  They always have specials and themed days.  One of the best BLT's in town.  Better ambiance than the other themed \"breastraunts\".  Never a long wait and easy to get to."}
{"text":"I was out shopping one evening and since my hotel was within walking distance, I decided to stop by Twin Peaks. First off, they are a true sport bar with TVs throughout the restaurant. I was quickly greated by the Twin Peaks bartender (her name escapes me) who was very friendly, asked my name and what I would like to drink. I selected Stella Artois which was served cold and in a frosty mug.  Overall, I had a great time and the next time I'm in town, I will be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"this was the only place by our hotel that was open.  I knew it was a place where the waitstaff wears next to nothing so I wasn't really excited to go, but there weren't other options.  Walking in was confusing - we came in from the patio, which is apparently the back of the restaurant.  so we had to walk through the entire thing to find the hostess station.  Once we did, it was empty.  a few moments later a woman came up and took us to a table.  It was really disconcerting trying to not stare at the amount of cleavage and thigh on display from everyone waltzing around the place -- or the # of dudes that were staring also.  was a little uncomfortable.  but the waitress we had was really nice.  Took drink orders...then we had our real waitress come up and ask for our drink orders..guess there was a mixup on who was supposed to take our table.  but we got drinks fairly quickly and placed our food order.  We had a buffalo chicken salad and a cheese burger and split them.  Food came out reasonably quickly and it was all really tasty and fresh.  I was concerned about ordering a salad at a place like this, but it was quiet good.    so 4 stars for food, 3 stars for having to be around 1/2 naked women which isn't my idea of a great restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time visit was for weekday lunch. I chose the pot roast w/ mashed, partly due to the chilling temp outside! It's a really big portion, and the accompanying green beans are covered in bacon. Awesome! The roast was very good, yet I did kinda miss carrots, and the gravy could've been more flavorful. Nothing wrong with the potatoes either.  My beverage of choice for this chilly day was coffee. This was the surprise of the meal, as it was really great coffee! And at $2.59, that's crazy! Considering many places charge $4 for bottom of the pot crap.   I sat at the bar, and it's a typical sporty atmosphere. The bar chairs are not stools, they are comfortable chairs with padded seats! Luxury. I noticed the temp sign showing the beer temp was around 29 degrees.  Sounds great for a few months away! I would return here for some of that chilly beer if they had gaming. This shopping area is usually on my no fly list because it's a cluster you know what. The coldest beer in town gets my attention tho!"}
{"text":"Pretty girls and the good was good - the only problem was that the girl serving me wasn't very personable - she talked all normal and crazy to her friend next to me and to her coworkers and barely payed any attention to if I needed a refill, napkin, etc - it's not cool if they are being themselves to someone they know right next to you and then bluntly ignore you as if you can't see them conversating right next to me / service bottom line sucks - I expected more from this place and it has a lot of potential but staffing and how they care for customers needs to be addressed"}
{"text":"Great service by Chel -C and great environment. Great way to spend a man date or time after work and have sports everywhere as well as really tasty food."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing food, amazing service. Never a bad time! The girls are always friendly, and the food is always fresh & hot!  I will for-sure be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I do. The decor and patio are cool, the beer is definitely cold, and the waitresses attractive. But for lunch, the menu is just too heavy and too pricey to make it a regular stop during the work week."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. took over 10 minutes to have our drafts brought to the table. Then waited more than 10 minutes, ready to pay, before finally giving our checks to another waitress, who couldn't find our waitress... One star only because the beer we eventually got was nice and cold. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Tired to come here and try out the food but the hostess didnt know how long the wait was going to be.  Instead of checking to see if anyone was almost done or if anyone's tab was paid.  She just gave me a lazy uh it could be an hour or more,  cause their is a game on and its only half time.  WOW!!! I just walked out.... Cant believe the stupidness here....."}
{"text":"It's a \"breastaurant\" with a log cabin theme!  The inside is big, plenty of bar and table seating. There is also a really big patio space for seating. I have been here a few times after work for drinks and snacks.  Each time I have been there is always a good crowd of people.  There are LOTS of tv's, and they are very good about having all sports and events on.    Each time I have been here, the service has always been great! The girls are always friendly!  The beer is very very very cold! Which is awesome! I am a huge fan of the naughty brunette!  I love the hand twisted pretzel and the dipping sauce is super good! The buffalo wings are also great!   Fun place to relax, watch sports, enjoy some food, and have a beer!"}
{"text":"Luke warm wings.  Wait staff just sitting around in a booth looking incredibly bored."}
{"text":"The only thing that I would suggest here is getting their ice cold beer. One of the girls suggested a flavored beer which was pretty good. It was like a tea mix or something. Other than that, the food was nothing to die for. The sliders buns were pretty hard and we didn't even eat them. The one decent thing was the buffalo wings. From what I recall they don't call it buffalo, but it was pretty much buffalo sauce. The girl was nice but wait times were heavy. It's nice inside but just another normal place. Not too crazy about it, probably wouldn't go unless it was somewhere someone really wanted to go.  These girls gotta learn how to smile and look friendly, not snotty and stuck up. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"29 degree Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on tap. Delicious burgers. Great service always. Nice patio. Okay amount of tvs for sports. A little pricey outside of happy hour but worth it thanks to the scenery."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door & seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things.  The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it.  In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.   One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water.  As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size.  Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time."}
{"text":"A man size dirty blonde and fried pickles!  Served by models that are waitressing.  Hands down a much better pick than hooters... And now I know why they call it Twin Peaks!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the games or UFC pay per views. Also good happy hour. Ice cold beer, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Very limited menu. Kind of ridiculous, like Hooters. If you want every girl to act like they're in love with you and your very own personal stripper, you might like it. They know what they're doing and how to get big tips from those guys though! It's 3 stories tall which is pretty cool, the view from the top floor overlooking the strip is pretty awesome actually. They also have a random rock climbing wall in the center of the place. Beer is priced sky-high for the \"man-sized\" mug (that's how they get these fools to pay more, because they wouldnt want to order the smaller, less expensive size if it's called \"girl-sized). They also serve the beer on top at 29 degrees or something which is pretty awesome, You get a hint of a beer slushy at the beginning.  This would be a great place to have a drink, watch the game, and hang out with friends... If not for the over the top (not in a good way) service."}
{"text":"Let's just get straight to the point, this is your new school Hooters, okay, minus the Hootness and 50 classic wings that you can never finish.  The skimpy plaid shirts and khakis are the trick of the trade here.  It works.  You are transported to somewhere up in the pines.  Wooden decor galore like you are in some cabin.    Throw in some flat screens and bar food and you are good to go.  Even the booths are equipped with screens.  This is probably one of the most ideal places to watch a game.  I feel like you can't miss the action.    Food here is pretty decent, I can't complain much except to say, it is...what it is...don't expect a fancy experience.  For the most part its your typical American fare at a pocket friendly cost.  Its definitely good for what it is and you're not breaking the bank.  The girls here are super friendly and full of energy.  I'm sure they don't mind the occasional gawking, in fact, its probably an insult if you don't."}
{"text":"There's no bull to ride but a wall to climb. If you can't do it, the girls will show you up so don't mess with them. I love nachos, so I came to try. It was pretty good, the sauce gave it a sweet tangy flavor which made this one pretty unique. The bar was lively. Great views from outside too!"}
{"text":"Love it!  I'd been to the Twin Peaks on The Strip once around the end of last year.  Had a great time there but, it being in the middle of all the touristy stuff and me being a local of 9 years, I could just never motivate myself to make the trip back.  The new location in Henderson is a lot more convenient for me to get to and easily accessible.  Gone here 4 times now since it opened and the staff has always been friendly and the service right on.  I could care less about all the sports they've got showing on their many screens but the atmosphere, servers and fire fries keep me coming back!  :D"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out on a Sunday afternoon!! The food was good, what you'd expect at a bar... wings, burgers, sandwiches.. The waitress was nice but never even asked if everything was ok or if we wanted dessert. The decor was cabin-like with lots of TVs and music playing at a perfect volume. It was nothing great but nothing really wrong either so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waitress had a bad attitude, spoke under her breath a lot with bad comments. We're locals we know Vegas a is service focused place and this was really bad for a place on the strip. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a great experience there. I asked the hostess if she could accommodate me upstairs and she said it was no problem at all even though I was by myself. I recommend their chicken Cobb salad. The portion is huge but not exaggerated ( I didn't need a doggie bag lol) and the prices are reasonable for a restaurant on the Strip. It looks like they have a big selection of beers too! The service was fast and the waitresses are all young wearing cute little outfits. An eye candy for guys. I will definitely come back again. And try something else too."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get a quick bite before going to see Zombie Burlesque (see review) and thought this convenient spot was perfect for obvious reasons. Having been here once before, I knew the food wasn't bad, either. /rimshot  I went up to the bar and ordered the chicken tender and fries \"appetizer\" which turned out to be more than enough food. Besides admiring the friendly tag team of bartenders and their beautiful...smiles...I also enjoyed watching a myriad of games on the bank of TVs set up at the bar.   Even if I had the time to race one of the staff up the famous indoor rock climbing structure, I need to spend some more time in the gym to get ready for that! LOL  For Vegas purposes, Twin Peaks is a good place to pre-game before a \"naughty\" night out."}
{"text":"The name says it all.  A refreshing alternative to Hooters. The staff is friendly and enthusiastic.  Food not too bad. Plus the Dubs eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs on my inaugural trip to the Peaks..."}
{"text":"Had both the Chicken Fried Steak and the Steak Nachos this week, both were excellent! The girls are friendly, the service is top notch; having a TV at each booth allows you to see the game of your choice, tough to find a better location for food and sports! Special shout out to Gina, service and smile cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"I had a blast at the Twin Peaks strip location for my birthday last year, so I was so excited to have a new location opening up closer to my house. Well, they have a lot of work to do if they want my business back. So disappointing.  Decided to plan a going away function from my job the week they opened. A friend and coworker (yes we are in the industry) called in advance and spoke to the manager who told her that there was nothing we could do, it was first come first serve. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if a large party of industry professionals want to go there, spend a lot of money, and have a good time, you should probably make an accommodation.   When we arrived they ended us giving us the whole patio area which was a nice gesture. It was a chilly evening but there is a fireplace so we took that so we could all be together. We had a great night up until the end when we were settling the bills. Obviously this was a complicated process because there were so many of us, but in the beginning of the night, they assured us that everything was fine and we would just take care of it at the end. There was about $60 that was not accounted for. My boyfriend (a restaurant manager) spoke to their manager who basically said: \"somebody's gotta pay for it!\". Not the correct solution sir. Especially because I'm almost positive that the check in question was paid for at the bar. Apologize, take your $60 loss and make us happy so you don't receive reviews like this.   My boyfriend emailed their customer service department the next day and has still not received a response. Not good for building a loyal customer base. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times since they've opened. Overall, the experience is pretty decent. I was wavering between a 3 and 4 star review, but went with 4 because I want to give the restaurant as a whole the benefit of the doubt.  The food I've had is usually pretty good; large portions, decent price. Drinks are a good deal as well. Beers are super cold, and as a personal favorite the Tuaca mixed drinks for only $4 is a deal.  The service is the service is the spotty part. Yes, naturally the scenery is great and the server girls are cheery, but being hot doesn't exempt you from being an inattentive or poor server. I've had great servers, and I've had servers who seem to have forgotten that me and my table existed. I guess it just depends on the girl and the day."}

{"text":"Yesterday July, 30, 2016 at 6pm. My wife and I took two friends from California to this Sports bar for dinner and drinks. When we entered the Hostess asked if we were there for the UFC fight and we said no were there for dinner and drinks. We were told that in order to be set at the higher tables we would have to pay the $10.00 apiece as they were reserved for fight customers only. We were given at small 4 person table. After approximately 1.5  hour while we were still enjoying our dinner our waitress came to the table and told us that we would have to leave as the main event would be coming on and that they were told by management we would have to leave as we had not paid the fee.  We asked why a paying customer would have to leave even though we had stated we were not there to watch the fight and had no desire to add $40 for our table to the bill. We were told that it was the management's policy during the pay for view  fight . We have had this happen twice before at this same restaurant/bar. As we were leaving my wife spoke with one  shift manager and then spoke with the  general manager. That person apologized and told us that it was not the policy and offered to reseat us and to buy us a beer. By this time our friends from California who were very upset had left the restaurant and did not wish to return.   The food and service are good here but this was the third time this had happened to us at the  place on a fight night. While we were there, there were plenty of vacant tables. You would think that cooperate would want them filled with paying customers."}
{"text":"I hate this place! If you are into objectification of trashy club girls then this is the restaurant for you. Restaurant was filled with ugly, loser, ogling men. Food was gross, menu was lacking and service was crap. Our \"waitress\" sat down with us and acted flirty, then spilled my salad dressing all over the table and never came back and cleaned it up. Boobs don't make a meal good unfortunately. Will NEVER go back here again and recommend you don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Me and my ex came here to try it out. We were seated in the far deserts of the restaurant. After waiting for 15 minutes with zero interaction with anyone. We were too stressed from our workday to wait any longer. I'm sure we probably got them on an off day. I will come back and try it again  I should have took this as a sign about the ex."}
{"text":"I am a regular at the north scottsdale location dining for lunch every day for the last two years. Tonight after a late day I went to visit this location on camelback. Natalie was our server, and I will never go back. Starting with our order, she left in on the pass for ten minutes, only two other customers she had, who sat after us, both were served first. She brought our cold burger and nachos with coagulated cheese and ice cold meat, never saw her for another ten minutes to even tell her what was wrong. Two of us sat, and she brought one place setting. After I asked for the bill again waiting forever, she asked if I could use anything, I asked for a napkin, she brought me a paper square bar napkin and laughed. And this comedy of errors was only half of what I will discuss."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Twin Peaks to watch a basketball playoff game. Good enough selection of TV's and the happy hr drinks were awesome. $2.75 for a well drink is a pretty good deal, especially when served by one of the many very pretty servers who seem like they actually enjoy their job. Whether they do or not, I'm not sure, but if they don't, at least it didn't show. Chips and queso were really good, and quesadilla was too. So far, this chain has not disappointed and we will likely be back."}
