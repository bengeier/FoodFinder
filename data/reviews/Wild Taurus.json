{"text":"I dined here last night on a very comfortable leather seat and a fantastic wooden table. I was quite pleased with the comfort and ambiance. Finally, I ordered their eggplant roll appetizer as well as their Greek Salad as I was wanting to eat a clean and light meal. The eggplant roll was exceptional - luckily I ordered 2 of those. I will surely try it again one day. My Greek Salad was larger than I expected and with a nice and fluffy feta. A repeat order as well. My water was cold an with a slice on lemon.  For those of you interested in a billiards style game, there is something called Russian Pyramid in the basement that you may take a liking to. Warning: read up on the game and rules and strategy first, or you may be flustered as I was."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise! We were walking and on impulse decided to go in. Very nice decor cozy warm relaxing. Nice service, the two waiters bend over backwards to ease us. BUT, the food ,Spanish avocado, squid with onion,montebello mushroom,  could have licked our plates. Limited wine list but OK, best tiramisu we ever had, really. This will not be our last visit."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place opened up. Great addition to the neighbourhood  Very nice staff Reasonable prices Very good food We have a great evening"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this new restaurant. I felt a Spanish restaurant in our area was a great idea.   I was in Barcelona in 2014 and ate wonderful tapas and paella. When I called, they did warn me that the size of the dishes weren't like in Spain in regards to the paella but I was not expecting what I did end up with.   First the good news, they seem like nice people, when i asked questions and the order was taken.  I had a coupon that said a free dish up to $8.20 for orders $25 or more and they did allow us to get 2 free $8.20 max dishes since we spent at least $50 and tax.  The prawns in garlic butter came with 6 prawns and they tasted good.  I enjoyed the caprese stuffed portobellos but others in my family found them just alright.  That is the end of the good news.  We had mushroom tartlets and chicken croquettes and they were edible but nothing special.  The risotto with chicken was nothing great.    Now the reason for this review.  I had asked what seafood is in the Wild Taurus Paella.  They said shrimps. mussels, calamari, octopus, squid and cuttlefish.  I said I don't like some of those and asked if I can have more shrimps to make up for not taking octopus, squid and cuttlefish.  They said yes.  I was shocked to end up with a total of ONE shrimp.  I saw something really tiny in the paella that I wasn't sure what it was but when I spoke to Karina (the owner?) she said their shrimps are tiny.  So that means I had 1 shrimp instead of shrimps and octopus, squid and cuttlefish.  I called up and they refused to do anything.  They said I got all the shrimps I was supposed to.  IF 1 shrimp is what I was supposed to, it means they misled me about being able to switch octopus, squid and cuttlefish for shrimps.  For what happened, they just offered me more shrimps on my next offer.  As I explained, there won't be a future order. Karina refused to give me anything to make up for me getting cheated.  I felt I should warn others so that is why I am writing this review. I gave 2 stars due to the things I enjoyed.  UPDATE:  I just looked at the pics of the food that is SUPPOSED to be from this restaurant.  The Wild Taurus Paella didn't have any shrimps like in that pic.  The one shrimp we got was tiny."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, especially the live musician. Food was very good.   Avocado on sweet potato. 5/5 Garlic shrimp. 5/5 Mussels marinara.  4/5. Needed more bread for soaking up the sauce and bit more spice.  Lamb chops. 5/5. Very tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes and grilled veggies were good too. Paella. 3/5. Not spicy enough for me. Too conservative on the saffron.   Staff courteous an mostly on top of things.   I would go back again. And would recommend it friends and family.   Make reservation. Spacing is limited especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Their friendly waitress told us that this place has been open for about a year. We came here for a weekday patio dinner on a hot summer day. Note: they didn't have A/C inside.  Overall, it's a nice place to hang out at.  I would come back to try their lunch specials ($11.99 pasta + soup/salad) or check out their live music on the weekends.    Their food was decent and they had comfy chairs.  Seafood paella was colourful and the taste was good. Also tried their Russian dish - Beef Stroganoff, it was alright. You can choose a side of rice/pasta/mashed or roasted potatoes. I opted for the roasted potatoes and they went well with the beef sauce.   Service 4/5 -- Ambiance 3.5/5 -- Food 3/5  Friday - Jazz live music    Saturday - Latin live music     Sunday - Karaoke   Parking is available at the back or you could park at the nearby plaza behind Scotiabank."}
{"text":"We shared the Wild Taurus Paella, Prawns in Garlic, and Stuffed Shells. I also ordered a glass of sangria. Presentation-wise, the food looks good. The d√©cor of the place was cute. However, the food at this place was just really lacklustre and tasted as if it was all reheated food, some of it like it came out of the microwave. For example, the garlic bread that came with the prawns was squishy/chewy and not crispy like you would expect if it was toasted/oven-toasted. The texture of the shrimp was over-cooked. The texture of the clams in the Stuffed Shells was tough and chewy. Having recently come back from Barcelona and cooking alongside a homecook with her family's paella recipe, Taurus' paella is not good. The paella was lacking of flavour, and the rice was too soft. The server was pleasant but the quality of the food was just really sub-par. The prices are quite high for poorly created dishes. Really not impressed and will not be going back. We went there on a Sunday evening and we were the only customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  Very tasty and made with wholesome ingredients.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  We were a group of 16.  We asked them to turn the music down so we could talk.  The owner came out to meet us.  We will definitely go back. Make reservations."}
{"text":"The food was not good for me. But it's a lounge bar so maybe customers only focus on karaoke but not the food."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience. We arrive and most tables had a reserved sign on them so they offered on a tiny 2seater or on the patio ( no heaters on the patio). Okay, we still ere optimistic. It took 15 minutes to get our wine order and no water (even though we asked). Fine. The. A couple Couple came in. They wanted a seat at the 4 seater on the other side - they were declined and offered the 4 seater next to us that was \"reserved\""}
{"text":"My wife and i were pleased to see that a new place opened up at this location. The fact that it serves tapas, as well as the name ('Taurus' relating to the bull)  would suggest that this is a Spanish themed restaurant.  The menu, although, is far from being Spanish based.  Yes they have a decent selection of tapas, but they serve Greek salad, risotto, grilled salmon (not a typical fish eaten in Spain), and other non- Spanish type foods.  They also  have a couple of pool tables in the lower level to play 'Russian' style billiards(?)......So a bit of an identify crisis  in my opinion - not necessarily a bad thing (for those looking for something less one-dimensional),just a bit  difficult to put my finger on how one would describe this to others.  The Food: As i mentioned, a good assortment of tapas.  The marinated olives were a bit like an olive antipasto.  I would have rather seen a selection of olives without the tomato sauce.  As another reviewer mentioned, the eggplant rolls were a hit (will get these again for sure).  The chicken croquette was by far my wife's favourite thing we had there.  You get 2 HUGE croquettes that are moist, fluffy, and very flavourful.  We had a couple of entrees including the paella.  Although very tasty, those looking for authentic paella be warned - this is more Asian rice bowl with veggies and chicken than paella (man, it hard to find authentic paella in this town...).   Wines are very reasonably priced. They did a great job with the decor.  Comfortable seating;  great ambiance, although the music was a tad too loud for intimate table conversation.   Based on our entrees i would have rated this 3*.  However, as a trendy place to hang out with friends, grab a bottle of wine, and  share a bunch of tapas, all at very affordable pricing, this rates a strong 4*.  With some tweaking to the menu - 5* is within grasp."}
