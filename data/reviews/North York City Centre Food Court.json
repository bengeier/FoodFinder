{"text":"Pretty crappy food court.  California Thai despite what the name might imply is actually standard for court Chinese food (right down to the pricing and combos).  In fact it may be more msg heavy than typical food court Chinese. No legitimately healthy options unless you're consistently in the mood for Subway, which is redundant considering there were two already within 5-10 minutes walk of the building. Haven't tried Opa! Of Greece but their menu looks severely handicapped in comparison to the omnipresent Mr Greek or Jimmy the Greek.  It seems like they wanted a diversity of cuisines but ended up with the weakest option in each category. Sbarro for Italian is inexcusable. Pizza pizza is more legitimate. Unfortunately given the lack of food options in the area I think these places will get more business than they deserve and are unlikely to go under any time soon (except Opa, I never see a line there).

It does earn a bonus star for being nice and shiny with ample seating. And Wi-Fi from second cup. And the fact that its existence is better than nothing."}
{"text":"My buddy and I came here to hang out around 8pm, when most everything was closed. We sat down and basically enjoyed how modern and clean it was. It was a great place to hang out for free and catch up."}
{"text":"This food court opened for business on January 7th, 2012.  A few restaurants within the food court have continued to open in later weeks of January.

As a new food court, this place is extremely busy.  I'm not sure where all of these people are coming from or where they were eating before.  None of the existing places nearby have had long lines,  but the lines at every restaurant in this food court are extremely long.  To avoid these lines, you'll need to come before 12 or after 1.

Cleanliness and Appearance
- This is a new food court, and as such is very clean.  There appears to be people roaming around and quickly bussing tables.  It's also bright and modern.  It's not like some of those depressing underground food courts.

Seating:
- There is ample seating.  Despite the large number of people buying food here, I didn't really notice lots of people wandering around trying to find seats.  This is helped by the fact that most people here are bringing their food back to the office.

Variety - As of the time of this review, the following restaurants are located in this food court:
- Manchu Work - chinese fast food
- California Thai - unfortunately, this isn't really Thai.  Most of the food is greasy battered chicken.  The menu is very similar to Manchu's Wok's.  It's redundant, in my opinion.  
- Subway
- Sbarro - Pasta and Pizza
- Wasabi - A noodle place
- Opa! Of Greece
- La Prep - this isn't in the food court, but is directly across the hallway.  They sell, wraps, sandwiches, salads, and things like that.

- There is also a Starbucks location and another place called Cafe Palma in the same building.  There is a Druxy's down the escalator.

Overall, the variety is just ok.  I'd prefer a true Thai place vs. California Thai, which is just a slightly better variation of Manchu Wok.  I'd also like to see more healthy options.

This food court is connected to the North York Centre subway station."}
{"text":"The only people that eat here are the people who work in the offices in the area and bring food back to their desks.  North York City Centre relies strongly on this demographic of business focused individuals to eat at all of their sub-par food eateries including Cafe Palma and La Prep.  With K-town just a walk away, there really is no excuse to eat here unless you work in the offices and have less than 20 minutes for lunch.

Give us something better!!!"}
{"text":"Food options at this court have been pretty bad with a couple of exceptions such as the Subway franchise and Opa.

-I wouldn't eat at a Japanese place called Wasabi again. Terrible food.
-Manchu Wok is supposed to be a franchise but the food at this location is particularly bad.
-California Thai is the better one of the two Chinese options but don't expect above average food. 
-SBarro pizza is gross. The worst pizza I've had anywhere. The staff are friendly, though.
-Opa has a pretty decent falafel wrap.
-Second Cup sells burnt coffee."}
{"text":"This is a review for Sbarro, the pizza place ay North York city centre food court. The staff here don't know the importance of wearing gloves while handling food!
I was almost shocked when the salad touched the Indian guy's hand and he simply shrugged his shoulder and added it back to my plate! I simply told him that I changed my mind and don't want the salad. Maybe I should have toughened up and told him the real reason I didn't want to eat it. Their pizza is super greasy."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. I guess it might have been ok if the girl was able to understand toppings and know how to make a fresh pizza. We ordered a x-large pizza with Chicken / Mushrooms / and Bacon on half, with an order of Garlic Bread. After paying and waiting 30 minutes the young Persian girl gave us a half raw soggy pizza with Chicken Sausage / Pork Sausage / and Mushrooms on a the whole thing. She then told me that they don't have garlic bread and to pick a drink instead. After telling her she gave me the wrong pizza because I do not eat sausage she said it was what I ordered. She said the chicken is chicken sausage and the bacon, which was only supposed to be on half, but was on the whole thing, was bacon pork sausage. I didn't want to argue with this girl and ended up throwing the shitty pizza away after trying it. My wife and I hate sausage and ended up paying for it because we both felt sick the next day. We went there 7PM on Thursday August 4, 2016. The girl who was working definitely needs to get training on how to cook a pizza for long enough to not be raw, and English classes to understand what toppings are. We will definitely not be returning to this spot but would like people to know how bad the food and service was. Also don't buy Groupon. Waist of $$$"}
