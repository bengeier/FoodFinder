{"text":"Food is good but service is lacking.  Not expecting amazing service but at least shorter wait times and when I ask for extra, extra garlic, and I pay extra, please don't make me come back and ask for more."}
{"text":"I just went to this place !!! Omgggg horrible , horrible food , horrible place !!!! I got chicken shawarma- was cold , no taste. And the worse part nobody was wearing freaking gloves !!!!! I swear I saw a young guy ( who was making my shawarma )  \"massaging\"my sandwich , no gloves , with his fingers inside my sandwich !!!  Disgusting! Don't go there !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken on the Rocks!! I've had their shawarma before too and it's delicious :) pretty small place too so it can get a little tight and slightly uncomfortable when it's crowded."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! I prefer chicken on rocks or Osmow's special chicken shawarma (meet marinated with pineapples and onions). Food can be customized and they have a very wide range of spiciness, so you can choose the most comfortable for you. Beware of a subchage for card transactions but it is not unexpected for small businesses. They work fast and meet is always fresh. But it is very crowded during HS lunch break.   Never been to other locations so can't compare"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm,  Shawarma done right. Very much worth trying if you are in Streetsville. They are located a block south on Queen Street and across the street from Starbucks.    There's nothing fancy at this little storefront operation where they serve a consistently superior product. My favorite, the plump regular 8\" grilled medium spied chicken \"with everything\" makes a great lunch and at $4.65 shouts value.    Most of their business is grab-and-go, but there is seating. They are busy at meal times so if you're in a hurry call ahead at 905-826-6021 and skip the wait."}
{"text":"20 mins and counting for chicken on stix.  Really??? NO SHAWARMA joint is worth 20 mins!!!!  Never come here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best shwarma place I have been to. I definitely would recommend it to anyone. Chicken on the rocks taste delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was tasty and large, considering it was only \"regular\" size. The Greek salad was also tasty and well-proportioned. Prices were reasonable and I will likely return."}
{"text":"A year ago I would've given this place one star. They seemed to have fallen in quality and flavour but it seems that has changed for the better. I went in to order the typical chicken shawarma wrap and was surprised with the quality and overall flavour! I think the owner must have re-trained the staff on how to make a proper shawarma wrap. Either way good job! I have been here 3 times this week and it seems to be consistently good :)"}
{"text":"Suicide shawarmas definetly not worth it its legit suicide parkings a pain esp in winter but shawarmas great and worth the price"}
{"text":"I have been eatinf from osmos for a while now and usually there food is average, today i bought a chicken on the sticks and it was the most disgusting thing i have had, the sauce flavor masks there terrible chicken which was half uncooked and pink for some reason, the fries were very starcy and I immediatly felt sick after eating it. Terrible quality of food wouldn.t reccomend again."}
{"text":"WHAT: Ordered the super sized chicken shawarma. Super size = 12 inch shawarma. In reality was about 10 inches.  WHEN: At lunch  HOW MUCH: About $9.00 including tax  VERDICT: Pretty average for shawarma. Had better, had worse.   SPECIAL NOTE: Waited 10 minutes for my order to be at a state of readiness. Which is okay if you'd like to make the assumption that they need to time to cook everything fresh. Not as okay if you're in a hurry and used to getting your shawarma in 3 minutes flat."}
{"text":"Found this gem near my workplace. Ordered a large chicken on Stix (chicken on fries with their signature white sauce) with medium hot sauce. It does have a kick to it, had I not been at work I'd put more!  The portions are HUGE.. was struggling to finish even half of it. If it wasn't for the sauce the chicken is pretty much tasteless. Staff was friendly and place was clean, had around 9-10 tables there to eat in."}
{"text":"I was taken aback by the appearance of the establishment however, I had no choice because all of my first options were closed. First of all the employees were sitting outside chillin then came in to make food without washing their hands. I would've left but business was super slow so I felt caught. The food itself was subpar but was super affordable. I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Shawarma ranks up there as the best food to have after a night of drinking, right up there with a solid burrito.  Some buddies and I found ourselves on Queen Street in Streetsville the other night and though the streets were empty, Osmow's was open.   Anytime white guys ask for something spicy, as my buddy Mark and I did, we always get the double ask.   \"When you say spicy, you mean medium?\" \"No. I mean spicy.\" \"So...medium to spicy.\" \"No....spicy!\"  and it was soooo good.  just the right amount of heat, and such deliciousness. And the large shawarma was 8 bucks, which is a ton of food it turns out.  If you find yourself nearby, definitely pay a visit. The people are friendly and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Osmow's shawarma is disgusting. First of all it's not even real shawarma. - no hummus - no tahini - no garlic sauce !!!!!!!!! - no tabouleh - no pickled turnips  The chicken smells old. I have never seen them cut the chicken off the rotisserie which is how the shawarma meat should be cooked. Instead they just grill it. Also it smells as if the chicken had been half-cooked a day before and they just regrill it but I was able to smell and taste the day old chicken easily. This is not just a one time visit. I've been there 4 times and it was the same every time  Also their \"garlic\" sauce has NOTHING to do with the real shawarma Garlic sauce. It's a more nasty runny sweet sauce that resembles tzatziki but tastes nothing like it. Yuck! I have so many friends that love Osmow's but it's the most disgusting \"shawarma\" I have ever tasted.   Good shawarma place in Mississauga is Pita & Grill. These people will fill up your plate with fresh food and properly cooked chicken breast. And their hummus and garlic sauce is aaaaaah-mazing!"}
{"text":"Got the shawarma and shawarma plate. Both excellent. The restaurant itself does need a little make over. The washroom were not the cleanest and were missing toilet seats. The place does need a scrub down as mentioned by other yelpers as well.  Looks like they have multiple locations and one close to home as well. Will definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Decent shawarmas at a decent price, but not as good as I used to remember them being. The chicken on the rocks is a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the quality of service this place has now. Picked up 2 chicken on the rocks, asked for the garlic sauce on the side for 1 and only mild hot sauce for both. Get home and they both had garlic sauce on them and both were smothered with hot sauce to the point I couldn't even eat mine.  It was some young kid that prepared our food. Clearly he doesn't even know what he's doing and barely looks old enough to work.   Find some decent staff that knows how to read an order properly. Needless to say it will be the last time my husband and I go there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and they know you by name if you are a regular customer. I almost have my daily dose of shawrma from this location since I work nearby and never been disappointed. People complain about slow service, try to avoid going in between 12-13 since the lineup will be all the way to the enterance."}
{"text":"I was coming here quite often before. The food was good, however one time I found a metal wire in my sandwich, I think it's from the BBQ brush.  After that I stopped going. So watch out!"}
{"text":"Osmow's has one of the best Shawarmas in town. The restaurant may not be a fancy place or in a fancy location, but the food is definitely fantastic. There food is consistently good. One of my favourite things to eat here is the chicken on the rocks. I think their sauces are excellent, and as always you can tailor the spiciness to your comfort! All in all, although the place may not look fancy, the food is excellent. It's always busy, and you're bound to wait in line for your turn (especially @ lunch time!) ...but definitely worth the wait :)  my only other complaint are the creepy people working there"}
{"text":"The Chicken on the Rocks and on the Stix I've had before were a lot saucier. Normally my chicken and rice would be drenched in that saucy goodness but it was quite dry. They might of been having a bad day or a lack of sauce but Chicken on the Rocks is Chicken on the ROCKS!!! And when you order it you expect it to be ROCKING!!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the other locations. Lacks consistency with the other locations. For example : No red powder on the top"}
{"text":"had high expectations due to the reviews that recommended the chicken on rocks. went in and bought one and it tasted ok but the portion sizes were inconsistent between the orders which was a big disappointment as my girlfriends order was much bigger than mine. decided to give these guys a second chance and ordered a shawarma but was told I had to pay for tzatziki sauce and hummus. that's ridiculous! you have to pay for tzatziki and humus, that's like saying you have to pay for ketchup and mustard for hot dogs. did I also mention you have to pay 0.35 cents for card transactions? big disappointment. will probably never come back"}
{"text":"The rating strictly reflects the service of today. The food is always great. I have been coming here almost every couple of  weeks,  and today was the first time I actually looked at the receipt, and I'm glad I did.  They were sneaky to charge me 9.65 for a beef combo,  while it was clearly labelled on the display that it was on special for 7.97.  Also for the garlic on fries,  this is the first time I've been charged. As a note it's not on their menu.  When we asked the cashier about it,  one of the other gentlemen stated that the price on their digital screen was old and just shrugged.  I have been in the service industry for about 10 years and my family has owned our own restaurant.  When you advertise a price,  you honor it.  If you can't,  at least have the respect to say sorry. Me and my wife left there feeling disrespected."}
{"text":"Shawarmas are something you need to put effort into making. The sandwich I ordered wasn't as great as I had it years ago. It was a good price though only being $5 but the chicken wasnt as seasoned or tasteful as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Holy sauce! I don't even know if the food is good. The amount of sauce on everything made it disgusting. Everything tasted the same, like their sauces.   We ordered one chicken sandwich, their shawarma poutine and a side of rice. We got take out, we only walked about 2 mins to get home and we weren't swinging the bag around and by the time we opened the bag sauce was leaking out of everything. I opened the container with the rice in it and it looked like a container of sauce. I scooped the top layer of sauce off which included a bit of the rice and I nearly filled up a coffee mug of sauce. Even after taking that much sauce off our rice was still floating in sauce.....WHY? We then opened the shawarma poutine and that too had so much sauce we couldn't taste the food. I started to scoop the sauce into the mug again and this time I filled it and had to pour in down the drain in order to start scooping more sauce off. The chicken shawarma sandwich had too much sauce as well but nowhere near as much as the other two dishes, it was just regularly over sauced.   WHY? Why do they put so much sauce in their food? My only suspicion is that maybe the food really isn't that good, which makes me hesitant to return and order with sauce on the side.   I'm so grossed out I'm not sure I will ever return.   Also, service is extremely slow. I'm not sure I've ever waited so long for shawarma. I guess all that saucing takes some time."}
{"text":"it's gotten a lot worse. i use to visit this place before it was popular, sam use to take his time and make it well. now it's just business, and it tastes bad. he's pushing his long term clients away to other places that are opening up, and doing a better job for the customer."}

{"text":"This is for sure one of the better shawarma places in Mississauga. That says a lot, given the multitude of shawarma places in this city.   I have only tried the chicken shawarma and the chicken salad. The chicken shawarma is a must try! Unfortunately, the chicken salad is not as good as I expected it to be, I've had better at other places.   Other than that, definitely give it a shot! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to other Osmow locations for years and I love their shawarmas and food, however this location serves terrible food and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go there. The food was nasty and my shawarma was falling apart."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Super friendly staff, and the food is great. their daily specials are great as you can try something new every day. Small place but it gets busy pretty fast so i would recommend to be patient. The chicken on the rocks and the shawarma are the best !"}
{"text":"Food is good, but they're very slow! Also people who ordered after us received their meals before we did! I'm not coming back here...."}
{"text":"I don't care if it's a true shawarma place or not close enough and I only care about how good the actual food is. With that said, this has become a bit overrated. The shawarma wraps are great (make sure you get mild though unless you can handle it because I found the medium to be over the top spicy) but I don't like certain things like them always putting olives in it. The $5 price of the shawarma is also reasonable and on par with the other ones but this is probably the least healthiest shawarma I've had lol (so no suprise that it's so delicious).  The platters are enough for two but overpriced and the rice is sometimes avg. I don't recommend getting some of the kabob's from here judging by the oil they're left in, maybe okay to eat once in a while but not too healthy.  One of the problems here is that the restaurant is always super crowded at lunch or dinner or weekend afternoons/evenings. They need to get a bigger place because it's hard to move around and usually all the tables are taken so I have to get it to go. It's also taken 15-20 mins at certain times just to get a shawarma or one platter so not exactly fast food and I've stopped going here for lunch cos it takes too long to order at times.  Overall, the shawrma is good and it's a good place to eat at but only once in a while and preferably only for take-out but I'd recommend trying out one of the other 5 shawarma places on Queen Street. When I go to this area for a shawarma then I usually end up going to Pita Nutso or Taj Wrap or Isis cos there's a place to sit plus less crowded and the shawarma at Pita Nutso I like a bit more."}
{"text":"Idiots! If you want to close 10:30 why dont you just say and mean 10:30 the idiots staff just want to leave early and not work, what else would you expect from a middle easter owner. Fix your problems its canada not egypt 11pm means 11 pm ."}
{"text":"It's going to be hard for them to survive if they don't  give much attention to the kitchen. Please do not use the same towel to dry the kitchen and your hands."}
{"text":"Right from the start my visit to this Osmow's was horrible, well I waited to order I was ignored and when they finally  acknowledged that I was standing there. I was asked to wait and they will be with me in a minute.   After placing my order and getting my simply; shawarma on rice dish. I noticed with the first bit that the rice was well undercooked and the chicken was dry. After eating a small portion of the meal I wasn't upset when noticing that the amount of food served was insultingly small.  Overall I'm was vary unhappy with my meal at this location and I would have been happier not eating anything and just having a large juice next store."}
{"text":"the half/half chicken was incredible...best i ever had, word to drake...or the fat guy with a beard who served me. staff was highly trained, the fat guy with a beard made my food, super friendly and great service! could not ask for much more!!  food was so good i was screaming...still can't stop screaming!!!  if you're ever in the area you're doing your stomach a dis-service by not going here!!"}
{"text":"Can't stop myself having a shawarma in a rainy day. Ordered a regular sized Osmows special Shawarma with all the toppings and two lines of hot sauce  -- Yummmm ! Perfectly done with white chicken breast meat and those oozing sauces till the last bite was a delight to my craving. If you have been eating regular shawarma then its time to upgrade. Just over a dollar extra you get white meat and extra toppings ( olives and cabbage) and extra sauces.  Service improved a lot since my last review and guess what - \"everyone had a SMILE\" and were very welcoming. I will go again and again and hope they serve the same way to get 5/5."}
{"text":"Terrible!   I would not recommend this place. I been to other osmow's in the past and this location is such a disappointment.  I was getting take out for my family, and decided to get the large chicken dish for $23.  The cashier showed me this large takeout box and told me that the large chicken dish would be in that box. Considering the box was pretty big, and it was $23, I thought it was enough for my husband I.   When we got our order, it was less than a quarter full. I could see the bottom of the box. When I complained it so little, they said it was because chicken shrinks when it's cooked.   Overall, this place was clearly trying to rip people off. The Osmow's head office and other franchise owners would be worried. This store is clearly tarnishing the brand. If they was my first Osmow's experience, I would never visit another Osmow's again."}
{"text":"Man this place was tasty. Tried the Shwarma. Great ingredients and sauce on a fresh  pita. The interior is a bit cramped,  so it could be difficult to find a spot to sit during a busy lunch hour, but I will be back for the food the next time I am in streetsville."}
{"text":"Love this place - always my go-to. I agree with a lot of reviewers that the chicken to rice ratio isn't the best, but still delicious! No spice for me... That stuff is HOT!"}
{"text":"This place was awful. We went to try this place after work. Seeing them pop up everywhere we thought man they must be doing something right. We were mistaken. The beef shawarma was ok at best. I truly think that you could get a better shawarma anywhere in the city. We also had the chicken and this part was the worst, as soon as I took a bite I had pulled back to see my shawarma to see a huge piece of under cooked chicken skin. It was like what you would find on a chicken leg but just uncooked and freaking disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite shawarma place. I've been coming here for years and I've honestly been comparing every other shawarma I've ever eaten to their shawarmas--they are literally my benchmark for all shawarmas.   I usually get the super chicken shawarma, unless I just want a small shawarma fix. Only thing I noticed is that their portions have noticeably decreased over the years, but luckily the taste is still superb. Parking is sometimes annoying (but the shawarma makes up for it). This location is easily always packed and sometimes this results in a not-so-fully toasted or heated shawarma. Other than that, I've always been a fan."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i both got the chicken sharwma special... The chicken is mushy, not fresh and has a filler added to it i believe. Further more, the sandwich was pretty cold... Salad was the only good thing. Also the staff that makes the samdwich should be wearing gloves... Overall not a good experience and i wont be back"}
{"text":"Ever since I've started my journey too Intermittent Fastining with a combination of One Meal A Day (OMAD) I found Osmos and it's been the best experience for food in a very long time. The staff is great especially Elias & Abdulla. These two Guys, always greet me with a smile and prepare a very good meal.  I personally think that they responsible for this location's success. . All I can say now, is that,  I'm addicted to their Chicken On The Sticks and the Super Chicken Shawarma. I recommend this place to everyone I know. One of the BEST places in Brampton.    Thanks Guys. Please don't close"}
{"text":"Hands down amazing Shawarma.  Chicken on the rocks is probably their best dish.  There's not real point to call ahead, they don't start cooking it until you get there anyways."}
{"text":"I have frequented the location in the west end so I was pretty excited to see that Osmow's had branched out to the eat end where I live.  It might be the same name but is definitely not even close to the same food.    I ordered a large Chicken on the Rocks to go and although the bag felt a little lighter than usual,  I didn't think much of it- until I returned home and went to eat it. I was so disappointed when I opened it up at home.  The quality and quantity is significantly different from the original location.  The chicken was dry and stringy and some part even mushy.  Weird texture.  The hot sauce (I ordered hot) was gritty?   There are so many better places to get a shawarma plate or wrap than this place.  Scarborough has an abundance of authentic Middle Eastern take out joints so I am confused as to why Osmow's in Scarborough would not at least be on par with the other places.  Perhaps it was an off day so I will try it once more just to be sure before I write it completely off.  If not,  I can always go to Lawrence Ave East to find plentiful good shawarma places for less $$ and way better quality.  Tip for Osmow's-  get rid of the debit/credit surcharge for bills over $5.00.  It makes customers annoyed and is petty."}
{"text":"I always go to Pita Land and was near by Osmos so thought I try it out. Boy, was that a big mistake!!!  Chicken was so blank and had no taste, plus they loaded it up with sauce where everything was swimming in the blank sauce. Chicken had lots of fat in it.  Hot sauce is too spicy where you can't even taste anything else. The dude making my food was so hairy that I didn't appreciate him not wearing gloves plus he was sweating. Who knows if he had cleaned his hands or not. At Pita Land they always wear gloves.  Service was another bad experience. No smiles at all and had to wait 20+ min for a wrap which I didn't even finish anyways and threw it out. Had to run to Pita Land again to get my proper shawarma! Never going here again."}
{"text":"This place has no connection to middle eastern food. Honestly, do they real think they have good shawarma?? They trick you with good tasting sauce on top of bad tasting meat, that's all. the staff has no idea what middle eastern food is. shawarma does not come from a frying pan. it comes from a large sizzling meat skewer that the meat gets shaved off it."}
{"text":"Osmow's is located in Streetsville, ontario, upon arrival you will notice its just a little whole in the wall, with a line exceeding down the street, i thought wow the food must be great for people willing to wait 30-40 minutes on a busy night to get served. but overall its worth it! try it love it...."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, and filling.   For students: $6 combo gets you a large chicken shawarma, soft drink, and fries.  I always have one thing when I'm at Osmow's, their 'Chicken on the Rocks'. There are always left overs, and you can easily share it with two people. Also, if you don't feel like eating the over priced frozen food at Scotiabank theatre, you can always sneak in some Osmow's :P"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.  Had a chicken shawarma.  Fresh and tasty ingredients at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma the first time I visited, and the second time I got the Chicken on the rocks. A very delicious and clean restaurant. I'm thinking of bringing my whole family and giving this place a go. I'm sure it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Osmow's is hands down one of the best schwarma houses in the GTA. The chicken schwarma is worth travelling across the country for, and the chicken salad is delicious. The location is always packed so expect a bit of a wait and seating is limited. I'm deducting a star because the quality can be hit or miss depending on the shift working."}
{"text":"If this place kills me ill die a happy man. This is the best chicken shawarma/wrap I've ever had and I've lived downtown and been to Greece.   The staff are the least pleasant people you'll ever meet, but who cares when the food is this good? The cashier girl knows me by know and exactly what I'm going to get cuz I've been there so often."}
{"text":"Super dirty restaurant upon entry, even the walls had grime all over them. It's a narrow and tight space, so it's quite uncomfortable waiting in the heat a while for your order. I didn't mind the wait as I expected great food based on what I've heard from other people. The chicken shawarma sandwich didn't even taste like shawarma. I don't know what it was but it was a lame attempt at shawarma. I really don't know what all the fuss about this place is! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Simply the best shawarma I've had in Mississauga. When they say hot they mean it, their hot sauce packs a serious punch. My usual order is a regular chicken shawarma and fattouch salad and I've yet to be disappointed in around a dozen trips here since moving to the area."}
{"text":"Had the chicken on rocks. Extra garlic, medium spicy. Maybe I was spoiled after having had lazeez first.. I found Osmows version ok. The rice was on point, the chicken was tender but not bursting with flavour, the spicy sauce was hella spicy but there was something lacking about their garlic sauce. Right texture but the taste was just not there with the umpth factor. Lazeez def has the better version. I won't eat here again unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Jane review. The girl who takes order is SUPER RUDE. They have NO clue what they are doing. Sometimes Garlic sauce is missing or other ingredients are missing and when you ask them to add them..you get weird rude look and faces and then you get asked pay for that. I get asked to pay for table salt sprinkle  on fried..can you beat that...It shows their greedy mentality and really bad customer service. I go there because its close to my office otherwise i wouldn't think once to pick another option. I will definitely avoid them as much as i could. They don't deserve clients for their business with such rude and obnoxious attitude."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Just wish they would put more garlic sauce on the food like the Mississauga location."}
{"text":"Was OK. Restaurant was pretty busy, and they were very fast at putting out the orders. Had a super sized spicy chicken shawarma, was huge and very generous on portions from the dinner plates that everyone else around me was ordering.  Hummus was excellent as well.  I love spicy food but it overpowered the chicken. Every bite was banana peppers, sauce and pickles and I couldn't taste any chicken.  Was pretty noisy place and kind of expected that with all the people coming and going.  However had 20 minutes of the cook loudly hacking at shawarma meat on the flat top with a metal spatula nonstop the whole time we were there.  Left a little early to escape the noise."}
{"text":"I have been to their other locations (Courtney Park as well as one in Brampton) but this was by far the worst experience. Makes me think if this is genuinely owned by the same people. Another reviewer (Jamal J.) mentioned these pain points but I believe it's worth mentioning again:  - Surcharge for using a credit card. I can see a Mom and Pop store doing this but just feels odd for a chain restaurant to be doing this.  - I ordered Chicken on the Rocks (large) and was was completely disappointed by the quantity I received. It wasn't even enough for one person where as the quantities, for the same dish, at the other locations, for a small, can easily feed two people.   - Definitely skimped out on both the white sauce as well the hot sauce.  If you have tried other locations of Osmow's then this location will surely disappoint you and if you haven't ever been to Osmow's then please don't let this be your first experience. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Ordered a large special, the chicken came out of the fridge, and they heated it on the grill. The chicken portion was small and the wrap was mostly veggies and bread. Also ordered a beef...it was the worst I have ever tasted.   Save your money and go to the location east of port credit or streetsville.   I am rating it a 1. But I am not the only one disappointed. The average is a 3."}
{"text":"It's a big hit or miss. The quality has gone down hill over the last few years and sometimes there is bones in the chicken( there was a few times it didn't even taste like chicken :s) . But of course I continue to go back .... those sauces are so addicting ! When it's done right it's amazing and other times it can taste totally different or be wayyy to spicy depending who's working, don't be surprised if your fries are cold. The customer service is terrible and very unprofessional and if any of the staff's friends are there to purchase or visit .... expect a long wait ...but if you go around 4pm it's usually not busy so that's the time to go !"}
{"text":"The upselling here is ridiculous... I had to say \"no\" to buying a drink 3 times before I could pay.   I ordered a Chicken on the Rocks (large) and I was really underwhelmed with the quantity... I'd expect this little food from a food truck, not a place like Osmow's.   I won't be returning to this location - shame, because it's so close to my workplace."}
{"text":"The service, quality, and quantity of food here has really gone down. Was a mistake coming here over Lazeez - not making that mistake again.   Ordered chicken on the rocks and got fries instead. When I told them my order, they said no, they're too busy, and the fries are worth more than the rice. While that may be true , I don't eat fries.   Had to go next door to get food because I didn't want I eat fries. My brother however devoured it without a second thought.   For some reason, there's such a drastic jump between \"mild\" and \"medium\" and I don't know why. Is it so difficult to request just 2 lines of hot sauce?"}
{"text":"Compared to the other locations. This place doesn't live to the expectations. Not enough sauce. Chicken overcooked. Burnt chicken actually."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION. This is probably the worst osmows location I've been to... idk where to start some pieces i bit into tasted like blocks of salt. I had huge blocks of rice that were dry (scrapped off the bottom of the pot) it was 37 degrees when I went here and they had no ac working pretty sad place to be.   I got a large chicken on the rocks btw.  Freaking garbage place and garbage food. The employees were nice though I feel bad they were complaining about the heat just working there my sympathy goes out to the employees."}
{"text":"Honestly love this place! its so good. Food is always fresh and service is always on point. They will go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied. I would recommend this place if you want good eats and are on a budget!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal as it newly owned up near my house.... We all otlrderd our own sandwiches.... Staff is fairly new at this time so serve was a little slow.... My brother ordered his sandwich with fries inside of it.. He reminded them not one but twice when we finished ordering food...  he paid extra and when the sandwich arrived with no fries inside.... When he went up to them they said oh we must have forgotten and gave him fries on the side.... I thought this was really poor customer service...."}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place. Yes I agree that it is not an authentic tasting shawarma and not the best tasting either, but it doesn't taste bad. Ingredients are always fresh because of their extreme sales and I've never ever been not satisfied about the meat quantity in any of their items. Plus they have had the same prices for the past 6 years."}
{"text":"I had a basic chicken shwarma wrap. Food was decent but sevice was very indifferent   No smiles. No thank you's. I asked a question and the cashier (the person that took the order) looked at me like 'why don't you understand'. I've heard great things about this place and decided to check it out. The food is probably worth more than 3 stars out of 5 but the service brought down the rating. Service matters."}
{"text":"It used to be my fav shawarma place but recently the service has not been so good. The other night we ordered take out and still had to wait for 40 mins. Apparently they forgot to make our order entirely even after we had paid for it. They were less than apologetic about it. It was 11.30 pm!!"}
{"text":"this place is disaster !!! small,dirty,awful, was waiting half an hour to get my sandwich  !!!! food is pretty good..."}
{"text":"I would give it four stars, but I know that the quality can vary sometimes.  I used to be a regular when I lived nearby and my go-to dish would be the off-menu \"half and half\": a hybrid of the chicken on the rocks (rice) and the chicken on sticks (french fries). I'm a fan of spicy food and I like that they offer a broad spectrum of levels of spiciness.  I like the \"extra spicy\" option, and find that it doesn't entirely overthrow the taste of the food. I have had the \"suicide spicy\" option before, but found that it would go overboard and that I wouldn't be able to taste anything apart from the spice.  For people that like at least one of shawarma and spicy food, this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location at all. They advertise students discount and then once go inside they will tell you that it's only for age 22 or less. How is that makes difference, a student is a student. And it not written anywhere that they have this policy on the poster, they just made up to avoid people. Rude cashier. They charge 35¢ for all debit and credit transactions. That's absurd. Who charges for debit payments!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday at 12:15. Place was empty. Ordered chicken on rocks and chicken shawarma plate, was of average quality. I asked for less sauce and they gave me less sauce. I'm not sure if the worker that served us was new, but he dumped WAY too much herb onto the garden salad; to the point where you couldn't see the colour of the lettuce anymore... we tossed it out.  Average price ($20 for two people) for shawarma in Mississauga. Unfortunately there was a long hair in our chicken shawarma plate (disgusting). Not sure why this place used to be hyped but I'll never go back. *note: 2/5 average rating does not take into account the hair in the food. Otherwise I'd give it a 0."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant one star because the service was absolutely horendous. The girl at the counter proceeded to make a fool out of me for ordering the wrap. Normally i appreciate menu suggestions, but i didn't ask for her opinion. I observed that most people in the establishment were eating wraps and i thought it was a good choice. How dare she have the audacity to butt in to my business! In the end, the wrap was quite tasty. Do us a favor counter girl and keep your nasty opinions to yourself. I hope the owner sees this review because i wont be comming back."}
{"text":"I came to Osmow's tonight and I was quite impressed by how friendly the staff were around 9:30 pm. we tried the beef shawarma plate and the chicken shawarma sandwich . The beef shawarma plate came with the bed of rice layered with shaved beef topped with the Osmow's sauce (its mayo based ) and a lot of that sauce . The rice was good , the beef chunks were  on the chewy side and the sauce was indeed tasty but since they put a lot the sauce ,the dish was soggy by the time I was half way through my meal.  The chicken shawarma sandwich came with all the ingredients they have and it was quite tasty ! The sauce in the sandwich wasn't the Osmow's sauce ! It was Tahini, humus based .  I should mention the portions are big and the prices are very reasonable.  As we were having our meals , one of the staff started cleaning and mopping the floor. The strong smell of the cleaning products really suppressed our appetite.  Overall it's a good place to indulge yourself for middle eastern food and of course for cheap."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but that fat chick taking the order is a bitch. If the food wasn't good, I'd never come here again. She's like the soup Nazi, but she doesn't make the food. She's just a cashier."}
{"text":"Over all it's pretty standard to all the other locations. The food taste the same... Amazing...service is fast and staff is friendly...  One thing though if you get the chicken or beef platters to go... And you like salad... Don't expect the salad to be the same quantity as other locations...very stingy on the amount of salad when you pay for a higher price you expect the salad to be packed... Hopefully that changes cuz I like my salad portion to be decent."}
{"text":"I came here on a very busy Monday night. I had a shawarma with everything on it minus hot sauce. It had a slight beer after taste and it seemed like the ingredients were not fresh. I prefer the shawarma at Pita Nutso a few doors down."}
{"text":"The guy there was handling cash and food simultaneously without washing his hands. I don't think i'm coming back."}
{"text":"Overrated place for sure.  I absolutely do kit think their Shawarma is even close to being authentic.  For a causal wrap yes,  but a Shawarma no and never."}
{"text":"I love Chicken on the Rocks!  Not the best venue to eat at but man is their food delicious! I'd like to own an Osmow's franchise because I think this can really be successful if handled well."}
{"text":"Service is the WORST at this place. You can spend $20 or $40 and they want to charge you for more sauce. Ordered kafta plate and falafel waited 45 mins! Never going back here ever again. Unless you want to wait forever to get your food...DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Agree with James F. (reviewer) earlier, as I similarly got victimized with a meat-deficient \"large chicken shawarma,\" that turned out to be riddled with lettuce, tomato, veggies and all kinds of stuffings NOT chicken shawarma. I honestly had a hard time finding the meat portions in my wrap.  Just don't have respect for franchisees (?) who cut corners and essentially cheat customers of value--selling \"bigger\" for more when they're actually less than regular size portions.   I happen to be an aficionado of pioneer Osmow's locations that attracted me to the brand in the first place, and would drive to original Mississauga Streetsville and Oakville locations just a year ago. They were exemplary and still should be.  If both are too far, the Steeles / east of Keele location still has respectable portions on REGULAR chicken shawarma, although watch out for that rude waitress who's on shift from time to time.  I do hope this location's owner realizes the error of its ways. Might return in a couple of months to give them another chance. If you visit and still find them cutting corners, move on to the next Osmow's who deserves more business as they appear to be sprouting everywhere anyway."}
{"text":"Walked in around 1pm on a weekday and ordered the falafel plate to go. It was delicious - the falafels were nice and crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The salad was fresh with pita chips and a tasty red seasoning sprinkled on top. It came with a large serving of humus and two full pitas! The portion was very generous, I couldn't even finish the meal. The restaurant itself was clean, colorful and bright with beautiful middle eastern decorations. The staff was courteous and my order was ready within a couple minutes. I'll definitely be back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My best friend and I spent most of our osap eating here. Lol  like its THAT GOOD. The sauce is so good. And the best thing I like here is the half half chicken with rice and rices together its even better then the chicken dinner"}
{"text":"Osmow's Lakeshore: has the worst service, rude staff and food is not consistent as the quality of food you get at the Streetsville location. I ordered a shawarma and asked for medium spice. There was chunks of red sauce inside and had I not driven back home and ate it there I would have gone and returned it. First and last time I'm ever going there"}
{"text":"Osmow's Streetsville: cashiers are nice. I've never had a bad experience with them and I've been going here for 5 years now. Sometimes the chicken has a ton of fat on it which makes for some disgusting bites otherwise the quality of food is great. Only downside is it can get really busy and the lineups go to the back of the store which isn't that big to begin with so if you're seated and it's busy, it's likely that people will be bumping into you as you eat."}
{"text":"When in Rome.....Just had to find a joint that was close to my hotel that specialized in Shawarma. Brampton is full of  Mediterranean places.  Ended up at Osmow's and went with the Chicken shawarma with Med heat (the lady at the front counter talked me out of hot).   Must say I'm glad I went super!! It was big and very tasty.  Right amount of heat and good meat to fixings ratio.    Was disappointed they did not have any Tabouli.  I would defiantly eat here again when i am back in the area."}
{"text":"Always a favourite. Shawarma is high quality for good price.  Franchise locations make this place easy to find.  Good hot sauce."}
{"text":"well i when to get a chicken on the rocks and shawarma with fries i was so pissed the forgot my hot sause and the fries was crappy when i used to work by there it was good the drop down on the taste of it fries are crap the food is crap sorry the lakeshore one is better im done with the streetville one"}
{"text":"If there was a way to put negative stars, I would. Let me start with the pros.. the sauce. That sauce is amazing! However, the staff do not wear gloves, the workers nail polish was chipping into the food, the wait for a chicken shawarma on the rocks was 20 minutes and there were 3 ingredients. Health and safety would shut this place down, trust me. There was rice all over the counter which went back into the food.   The customer service was awful unless you were one of the people (staff) chatting around the grill instead of cooking and plating the food.   There were about 25 angry people waiting for food while the staff were chatting and honestly, if it wasn't for the sauce, I don't think any of us would have been there."}
{"text":"My family used to go to this place for at least last 10years pretty frequently.  When the owner \"mr.Sam\" use to cook there it was a bit easier to complain right away. For the last couple of years he stopped working there and the place slowly become a nightmare... Service is awful, place is mess, if you try to call to place order for pickup sometimes no one picks orders and you have to go and wait 30 min for food to be prepared. The Dude who makes Shawarmas has a little DVD player on front of him and keeps his eyes on a screen watching movies instead of paying attention to cooking!!  The food was the only thing kept us coming back with closed eyes on service in messy restaurant but last time we picked sandwiches and started eating them happened something I never experienced before. After couple of bites into my falafel shawarma I felt so painful and heard crackie sound of teeth in my mouth so did hear my hubby... I spitted everything out of the mouth and found a STONE size of little lentil!!!! My teeth were sore for a few hours, luckily no big damage. I was shocked!!! I will never return to Osmow's. BE CAREFUL EATING at THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Visited this location and was satisfied by the food. I had a chicken shawarma and a chicken on the stix. Both tasted fine, but I would like a bit more chicken in both these orders. I would like to add that the white is great. Having eaten shawarma in different places around the world I think they were missing on the pickles. Overall , it was a good experience and staff was friendly ."}
{"text":"I wrote to the head office about our bad experience and they didn't even bother to reply. This is what I wrote them:  Order @ Clarkson  Hello,   My family regularly frequents the Osmow's locations in Brampton, Streetsville and Milton. For the first time, we ordered from the Clarkson location and were sorely disappointed.   We ordered three large chicken on the rocks, one large beef on the rocks and one medium chicken on stix and a fattoush salad for the 7 of us, thinking it should be enough based on the portion sizes we are used to.   A few points:  1) the large containers were nowhere near full, and much less than we are used to from other locations.   2) we paid for garlic on the fattoush, none was provided.   3) we did not receive the chicken on stix, even though we had paid for it. When we realized on our way home, we turned around and had to go back to get it.   4) once we were home, we realized all the issues and called the Clarkson location. We spoke to Monty, who was disinterested and whose best solution was to bring everything back for a full refund, which wasn't really feasible at this point.   Maybe it was because of our poor experience but the quality didn't seem what we were used to either."}
{"text":"i frequent osmos. i think the price is perfect for the size of the shwarma. i'm always thinking i can eat more than the regular, but i'm full soon after.  yes, it is crowded and yes, it takes a while for you to receive your food. but honest to goodness, look at the size of their kitchen and the number of customers that place an order. can you honestly expect them to crank out shwarmas in 5-10 minutes for almost half of streetsville's population??  for the reviewers who have an issue with the authenticity of the dish, let me make it clear that for MOST of the fast food joints out there, they are not 100% authentic either.   all things aside from authenticity, does the restaurant meet taste, atmosphere and service? that's what this should be based on."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, food was actually tasty but the customer service was truly NOT professional.  Tables were dirty. They take your order like they wish they were at home already. Sad they have a good location and coming out of the adjacent movie theatre which serves crap food your choices are somewhat limited....staff not suggestive or communicative, too busy with their heads on the grill and the line ups instead of being appreciative of the patronage they were getting.  You could see on their faces."}
{"text":"If you want to eat on a dime, get the special (I get Chicken on the Rocks). Giant take-out box of fries topped with chicken and their special sauce - but beware, it's spicy!   RECOMMEND: Chicken on the Rocks - mild or medium (for your first time try Mild)  It's cheap and delicious - straight up college food. Take-out is best as it's very small in there."}
{"text":"BEST Shawarma  I usually choose chicken or beef shawarma on the rocks (rice) or on the sticks (fries) Garlic sauce is great hot sauce is SUPER HOT. try mild/medium before thinking you can take the Hot.  I would always suggest take out, eating in is terrible, they are loud banging on the grill and the temperature is usually uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Awesome middle eastern take out! Their hot sauce is incredible. Love their sandwiches and their \"on the rocks\" dishes!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people still go to him. The Shawarma has no taste besides the garlic sauce. The meat is not marinated and you can tell.   The presentation is great but customer service is much to be desired."}
{"text":"Used to visit this location frequently. It was the best shawarma in town. Let me tell you about what made Osmows so famous - their meat is usually marinated with a special sauce that makes the entire platter aromatic and causes you to drool instantly. They (specifically this Courtney Park location) were also very generous with the amount of chicken, lamb or beef that one ordered. They'd usually pile the meat onto any platter or wrap.  My colleague and I got a slightly different perspective this late Friday afternoon when we visited Osmows. He ordered the chicken on the rocks and I, the chicken shawarma wrap and the daily special platter (chicken, rice and salad) to go. After he cracked opened his chicken on the rocks platter (usually packed to the brim and overflowing with shredded chicken in a styrofoam box) there was a very thin layer of chicken (the first thing he said was \"wow they've gotten stingy!\") and a thick bed of rice underneath. When I cracked my chicken shawarma sandwich open and took the first bite - I immediately tasted something off- the usual Osmows taste was missing - no aroma, no intense flavour - just a bland ho humm, dry, run of the mill sandwich with yellowed, stale pieces of lettuce. By the time I got to the third bite my sandwich tasted dry and simply boring, while my colleague reluctantly finished his 'rice on the rocks.'  After getting home and cracking open the daily special, I encountered the same issue, a thin layer of chicken and a thick bed of rice. We deduced that this Osmows location might have changed management and were cutting costs (not sure why considering the business owner seems to be opening locations all over Toronto with a new one now opening in Guelph) by skimping on the essential part of a shawarma platter...the meat! - we didn't recognize the team that usually works there (usually a couple of burly guys) - they were replaced with new workers (seemed like a family).   We won't be returning to this franchise - this specific location was the place to go, their other locations (and they have many...) specifically the Dixie location was mediocre, and cheap on the servings and never hit the mark, so the Courtney Park location was always our go-to for the perfect shawarma. But now, we'll be moving onto greener pastures. So long Osmows..."}
{"text":"Shit Shit and more shit. If you ever order a sandwich from this place, make sure that you previous experience chewing on leather because that is the only way you will be able to consume their food. I ordered the Philly chickensteak sandwich and the bread tasted like it was freezer burned three years ago. The service is less than mediocre and the food is average. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Honestly one of the cleanest osmows I've been too and the shawarma was great as well !!! Loved it :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the Downtown Toronto location. I don't see it on Yelp...  I followed people's recommendations and order the Chicken on the Rocks, thinking it is like the Halal Guys' chicken rice... NOPE. Big nope. So disappointed. The rice is normal I guess, but if you've had the Halal Guys' chicken rice, you would know it's different. The chicken was meh, almost bland, not that I would know since they put so much sauce on top...   Anyways, chicken rice craving NOT satisfied. Please message me if you know places in GTA that can rival Halal Guys."}
{"text":"Very patient and friendly staff who explain what all the yummies are to people who aren't familiar with everything. I haven't had anything I haven't loved!!  I'm glad they finally took the spinach pie off the menu because they never had it."}
{"text":"Used to prefer Pita Nutsy, but Osmow's surpassed them years ago and hasn't looked back since.  You can see the success with the openings everywhere, and its because they've kept with what has worked -- good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"First the good part, food, which is amazing, made and served hot..now, the other story, one..wait time may kill you so be warned. There's no place to stand so especially in winter you may want to order ahead.   Second, thought they have a food order system they are not very organized and you may find your order got 'lost' or re-prioritized. Will wait for them to improve here and upgrade their points."}
{"text":"The first time I tried osmows was chicken on the sticks (chicken on fries with garlic sauce). I hated it but went back to try chicken on the rocks (on rice) absolutely in love. Definitely give this place a try!  Not much seatings but always good for takeout as the food already comes in a take out box."}
{"text":"This is not \"one\" of the best Shawarma houses in the GTA, it \"is\" the best, so let's not get people on yelp confused.  I've been to the Brampton and Lakeshore road locations and they're not up to par with Queen Street. These guys aren't stingy with the portion sizes of each of their menu items, which makes it well worth the money.   Only thing negative about this location is the lack of seating available and overcrowding at times, but c'mon! They're constantly busy for a reason, so let's sweep that under the rug.  They treat all of their customers like family, hence why they don't consider us \"customers.\" They label everyone who walks through their doors as \"Guests.\" Why? Because we're in their house and standing under their roof. Day or night, rain or snow.   So go and get your belly filled, at Osmows Grill."}
{"text":"5 years ago I would have said this was the best Shawarma place in the GTA. Now I would rank it nowhere near the top. The quality of the food has diminished substantially as has the quality. The restaurant never had a great atmosphere, long lines, small area, very little sitting area, unfriendly staff and a lack of cleanliness. All these aspects were made up for in the past by their great shawarma but now that their two most popular dishes; the shawarma and chicken on the rocks have lost their quality and great taste, you will be much better off picking another restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9pm on a Wednesday night and thought the location closed at 10pm. Apparently the hours from Mon-Wed are only til 9pm. There were a few customers inside getting food but as soon as we approached the guys behind the counter just shook their heads and said no.   To be completely honest if people are still walking out with food then I think good customer service would have been to serve us as well and then turn their sign to close. Clearly this location needs to work on that. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Ok so i just sighned up on yelp and figured i have to post this as one of my first reviews.    As far as shawarma's go i find Osmos Grill to be one of the best, most flavorful middle eastern restaurants out there.  From there Rice to the garlic sauce and even going with the chicken on the rocks meal you get a healthy slew of both. All lathered all over the rice and chicken.   The beef kofta wrap is also a huge fav of mine be sure to give'er a try."}
{"text":"Writing a review would be doing these guys a big favour - stay away no matter what. It's a dirty, smelly, disgusting place with a non existent service. At least the food is shit."}
{"text":"Have a look at the photos. There's a reason they drench their meals in sauce.   I ordered a chicken shawarma plate, which is made up of uncle ben's rice, what used to be chicken, and a salad that was so heavily seasoned with dry spices that it felt like I was eating sand.   Shawarma is defined as: roasted meat, especially when cooked on a revolving spit and shaved. This is NOT what I was presented with. Instead, my meat was cooked/fried on a flattop until it no longer tasted like meat. Had it not been for the gallon of thick and overpowering sauces that it was drenched in, I don't think it ever would have made it down my throat.     Extremely disappointed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you fiend for Osmow's, have those cravings randomly in the day for that mouth watering garlic sauce drenched shawarma chicken, and are in the downtown core - DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.  This place does not use the same ingredients as the original Mississauga location! Their garlic sauce is horrendous, its like a fusion of Hellman's Mayonnaise, saliva, and garlic paste.   Their \"hot sauce\" - no lies - is like from those Wing's Food ltd. hot sauce packets you get from token Asian fast food places, that dark mahogany-red colored one - What the hell! Where did they even get that from?!  Such a disappointment, I actually grabbed it for 5 of my co-workers for lunch who have probably, permanently, lost faith in my judgement of \"amazing food,\" after I pumped it up so much on SnapChat - but that was the SAUGA LOCATION'S FOOD.... Ughhh  And to top it off the assortment of inexperienced migrant workers serving food there, what can I say... From having to play Jeapordy with the cashier to guess what the he was saying, to the lady handing me my 2 feet of stacked containers expecting me to walk out the door just like that without needing bags - this All-Star ensemble is something else."}
{"text":"If the service was average this would be my go to shawarma spot...but place too crowded and staff takes too long to make a reg size shawarma...plus they forget orders sometimes. Food is good, don't get me wrong..but service is below average."}
{"text":"They have no concept of making an authentic shawarma. Horrible unfriendly service and the nerve to charge $1 to pay by card."}
{"text":"Best and cleanest osmows location I've been to. Not too authentic but DELICIOUS! Super nice and friendly staff. Great food and atmosphere so I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Last time I really come here, they are too rude with no manners, slowly loosing customers, been coming here since they opened because I workout near by and booster juice is my go too I will pass this location straight"}
{"text":"They snaked us on meat portion and sauce. It caused the food to be really dry and plain. Sauce it up and you'll meet the other locations standards. #toolittlesauce"}
{"text":"Their chicken on the rocks as well as other meals are delicious and hefty. Flavours are great and their food is consistently good.   Their pitas can use some work, opting to overload it with garlic sauce rather then overloading it with chicken is never a good choice.   My main complaint, is their service, they are very rude most of the time and it seems like every single member on staff has a short temper. Their establishment is always packed so I'm assuming they figure people will come to get their food weather they are assholes or not.   I get food from them often, because it is convenient and tastes good, but if their employees put on a smile every once and a while, I'd be there much more often."}
{"text":"Orders under $10 they will charge an illegal 35 cent fee for using visa or debit. They also won't tell u about it until u ask them why the price all of a sudden changed on the register. If you go an hour near closing, you will see all the left over chicken sitting on the flat top, sitting there for god knows how long.  Good luck eating that dryness.  It's a shame how Sam let these franchisee's ruin his good name."}
{"text":"Ok if u don't know shawarma and I guess for Scarborough. But this is a franchise and doesn't even come close to their original sauga location. I was so excited when they opened expecting the same thing, but was fully disappointed. But if u never tasted the original Osmows, this can do. Unfortunately not for me. Still on the hunt for a solid shawarma in Scarborough..."}
{"text":"First  time  there  loved the  chicken  shawarma.  Ask for it  spicey.  The regular  shawarma  is ideal  if you are looking for something light"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place 4 times and 2/4 times, the shawarma had very minimal chicken in it and the didn't full the sandwich with enough toppings. The entire sandwich was 75% bread with barely any meat.  The first time I went, they really packed in the meat and toppings and it tasted great and then the last few times their service and quality went down the drain.   My ultimate pet peeve at restaurants is when the food quality is not consistent; some days the sandwich looks well worth eating and other days it's just a roll of bread with barely any toppings.  Shawarmas are supposed to be packed with meat and toppings. This place decided to cheap out.   After 4 experiences, I'm not going to give this place anymore business. The food should look the same and taste the same every time but unfortunately most of the time they cheap out on the filling."}
{"text":"I usually order the Chicken on the rock and Chicken Showarma. I like here's taste and good quick pick up. There are 2 problems. 1, food is very cold sometimes. 2, They forget to put the sauce when I ordered chicken on the rock sometimes. I have never ordered the chicken on nothing"}
{"text":"Never disappoints me !   Get their student special (even if you aren't a student) you get your choice of shawarma, fries and pop for a really Good price. Best shawarma hands down. Reason for 4 instead of 5 Is solely on the fact they don't have a lot of option for toppings. Anddd the store can get crowded and uncomfortable.  Other than that, try out the shawarma, you won't be disappointed!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Droped by last night with couple of my friends since i was craving some chicken and rice. I read reviews and decided to give it a try. Once we walked in, there was a customer screaming at the cashier about how theres a sign for $6 deal and he was charged $7. He wanted his money back immediately. The cashier seemed shocked and immediately gave him the difference.   There were a couple people in front of us and it didn't take long for it to be ours. The system they have for your order is when you place the order with the cashier. He screams to the cooks. It was a very confusing process since theres so many different toppings and spice levels. Luckily we all got the chicken over rocks. We got two hot and one mild. A small was $7.75 and a large was $9.75.   It was super fast to get our food and because of their system. One of the workers asked what spice level we wanted. I guess its not a big deal but what if we all got wraps with different toppings.. it would be so confusing!!   Anyways, we got the food and went home to eat it. The food was good! Reminds me of NYC carts!   Would probably come back if i ever crave chicken and rice. Give it a try!  Happy belly!  Ps. Hot is really hot."}
{"text":"Not the same as it used to be. Line up takes too long and the staff can be rude as well. Basically when you ask after 45 mins on your order you would think they would feel a little disappointed with their own service. But it's the exact opposite, they feel as if you deserve to wait an hour for a shawarma. Boycotting this place for good. I wish I could give this place half a star. Also the food isn't good as it used to, as it comes back cold."}
{"text":"Glad I walked in here after a doctor's appointment. Ordered their Large chicken on the rocks as recommended by one of their friendly staff.  I was very happy with it. Fast, delicious, sauce. I'm also loving the heat level of their hot sauce! Be warned if you're a lightweight when it comes to spice. Went with the \"hot\" level and it was spot on with what I expected it to be. Good stuff, will be back!"}
{"text":"Glad this location opened close to ours. We got takeout for two. The portions are huge and we weren't able to finish it.   The food was good as predicted. Meat and rice tasted fresh. Fries were still crispy. I would recommend.   The one thing I do wish they change is I can taste a lot of fat in the meat. I wish they would trim that a bit more or cook it longer so it's not slimy."}
{"text":"They've lost their touch. The food has been lacking  significantly. It just keeps getting worse and worse.   Their shawarmas are dry and flavourless. Their fries are most of the time cold (even though there's a large volume of clients).   Wait times can go up to 30 minutes for a shawarma, which is ridiculous --- especially since you're standing the entire time."}
{"text":"Fairly consistent quality food and service. Place is always busy when I go. Their hot sauce portions are probably the only thing that is not consistent so how spicy your food ends up is always a surprise."}
{"text":"This food was unbelievable!  Ordered takeout  2 Osmows specials of the grilled chicken (couple of osmows specials on different sections of the menu) 2 Caesar salad 1 fries $28 which I found very good for the portion sizes! For the specials you could have fed 4 instead of 2! Instead, I have nice leftovers for tomorrow ..   Have absolutely no complaints, food was cooked to perfection, tasty, flavourful, no hidden spices (always my daily struggle), and for a decent price! Will definitely be returning..  apologies if you're looking for opinions on dishes with spices, I have a bland palette, I love my flavour but can't tolerate spices unfortunately. Trust me though this dish was yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Osmow's this past weekend for a quick bite.  I ordered their falafel sandwich with the standard toppings.  Service was quick but unfortunately my sandwich was meh.  It was sub-par to other falafel sandwiches I have had in Toronto.  Osmow's is a great location in the Queen West/John Street area.  But maybe their meat sandwiches might be above the usual shawarma standard."}
{"text":"When people rave about a Shawarma place, I always am sceptical because for one, I grew up in the Middle East, the land of the shawarma and Mozys Shawarma in Waterloo is hard to trump. Regardless, I had a to give Osmows a try.   It's located right in the middle of Streetsville, so parking can be a challenge to find at times. As soon as you walk in, you know the place isn't designed for you to sit down and eat. The largest table is for 4 and there's very limited space. So sitting there and eating is usually not an option. There is a line up almost at all times so you'll have to be a little patient.  I ended up getting the chicken shawarma plate on rice with a fatoush salad. Since eating at the place wasn't an option, I decided to take it to my car. The fatoush salad was great and it was really flavourful. If you're going for lunch and have work after, beware because there are a lot of onions in the salad. The salad comes in separate box so it's filling. As soon as you open the box for the meat and rice, you will see a carpet of sauce on top. I understand that sauce makes things taste flavourful but this is just bit too much (as seen in picture). It's almost like they are using the sauce to mask the flavour of the rice and chicken. Definitely not on the healthier side either. I've had shawarma plate growing up and it's uncommon to cover your rice and chicken in so much sauce that it's almost soupy.   The service was great and I was able to place my order with nor problems at all. The staff were nice and quick with everything. It's definitely a place I'd only try out once in a blue moon just because of the amount of sauce they have on their meals."}
{"text":"I dropped into lunch here on the recommendation of a colleague so can't fault the Yelp reviews here. I tried the regular sized chicken Sharma and was glad that I did not upsize as it was more than adequate for the average person. It was kinda average at the very best. I can only attribute this to the sauces. I did not notice until after the fact but any of the things that I would normally assume we're included like tzatziki were an upcharge. I might try again with my new found knowledge..."}
{"text":"Before heading to Osmow's, I heard so many amazing reviews about this place. When I say \"so many\", I mean like everyday, I'd see a snap story of someone having Osmow's or raving about it. Me being the foodie I am, I just couldn't wait to try it for myself! Long story short, I was left feeling a little disappointed.   I ordered the chicken on the rocks in medium and the portions were humongous! The dish itself is really nothing special. It's literally plain rice, some chicken and \"special sauce\". The sauce tastes pretty creamy, and reminds me of the white greek sauce. You can also customize the spice level! I got mild but it was still pretty spicy for me.   Overall, the portions are really big! You could share a medium with a friend. The meal itself is nothing special and I would really prefer greek food over this. Also, my friend and I felt a little sick afterwards."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a couple of colleagues today. We got here a few minutes before 12 and it's a good thing we did because the line started growing steadily after 12. We were lucky that we didn't have to wait in line and our food was ready quite quickly.  I tried the chicken shawarma pita with medium hot sauce. At first I thought the sauce was pretty mild, but the heat slowly grew. This is definitely a building heat. I would recommend trying out a medium unless you're a hardcore spicehead. The pita was well put together and all the ingredients worked well together.   The staff was very efficient and the restaurant was clean. It got a bit loud once the line started snaking past our table (and we were seated toward the mid-back of the restaurant), but by that time we were ready to leave anyway.  It was a very enjoyable lunch. I'll definitely come here again and I'll certainly know to avoid the lunch rush again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken on the rocks since everyone kept insisting me on trying it, and it was amazing. Not the best customer service, and I wish it was a little more spicy although I did request for hot. Nonetheless, definitely get chicken on the rocks when you're there."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I had skipped breakfast so I went in to grab an early lunch. I ordered what I normally order at the Courtney Park Osmow's (chicken shawarma pita with no olives or hot peppers) and today I opted for a \"little - one line\" of hot sauce since I wanted to take it easy on my empty stomach. But my hot sauce preference varies from medium to little depending on how I feel on the day.  I don't know why I bothered asking for my toppings. It's like they took one look at me and thought, \"Yeah, we're giving her the white person special\". The toppings on my wrap were tomatoes, onions, lettuce, very light garlic sauce and no hot sauce - none. WTF! I could have gotten this chicken wrap from any place. This was not a Lebanese wrap. Where are my pickled turnips (which frankly is the best topping!), where's my garlicky garlic sauce, where's my damn hot sauce!  Don't give me what you think I can handle. Give me what I goddamned ordered. And I was the only one in the restaurant at the time so they didn't confuse my order with some Becky's order. I was truly annoyed. It was so bland. So bland. I guess just as they assume we white people like. Well, Osmow dudes, I'm white and I didn't like your bland \"white person special.\"  Needless to say, I'm not coming back to this location. I'll stick with Courtney Park where the pickled turnips and hot sauce are plentiful."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location! The chicken was uncooked, can taste the dry skin, awful! The fries were very SOGGY! Was very dissapointed and will never purchase Osmows from this location again."}
{"text":"These guys used to be good back in their earlier days. Having past experience in the food industry I can see this place had the potential, but it all slowly went to the gutter.  Customer service is always number one. No questions asked. And the amount of times I tried to give this place a second chance I'd always be remembered by the extremely poor way they deal with their customers. The atmosphere is just absolutely depressing... noone smiles and you can tell nobody wants to be there. There's no pride..   If I had to give food it's own rating, it would have to be a 4 on a good day. Ive also had my shawarma messed up with toppings NUMEROUS times..   I really don't know what happened to this place... The owner must be lazy and not want to deal with customers concerns or complaints because there's absolutely nowhere that I can leave my feedback (thank god for yelp and Google lol). There's much better shawarma shops in mississauga like express shawarma on queensway and kipling, or even nicks shawarma down the street."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that refuses to give paying patrons a cup of water is a zero star in my opinion. Unfortunately, Yelp does not let me go that low.   In all honesty, we ordered the falafel plate with baba ghanoush and hummus. In terms of quality and taste, the food at Osmow's was not good.   The pita was stale. The falafel were like hockey pucks (our joke was that they tasted like broken teeth). The baba ghanoush was like cement. And the hummus tasted only like lemon.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"It always seemed strange to me when Osmow's first opened in Lakeview (right by the corner of Lakeshore and Cawthra). Although I knew there were locations in Streetsville, Britannia and Toronto, it was odd to see a shawarma joint plopped into the middle of a neighborhood that never really gravitated towards such restaurants.  Yet, they had the best shawarma I had ever tried up to that point. I came here soon after they had just opened and had a Super Shawarma with all the fixings and a huge salad, and it was to die for. Rich in flavor, bursting at the seams with ingredients, it was and still is a landmark experience for my taste buds. I keep searching for something that will rival that first plate I tried, and nothing's come close since.  So what happened?  I came into this place with a group of friends last week, and was a bit surprised and disheartened to see that standards have fallen far, far short. Nobody seems to clean the garbage cans outside (caked in flies), the cashier looks bored and disinterested and the wait to get the food was almost interminable.  Not to mention that the shawarma I had, while serviceable, just turned into mush due to way too much sauce being lathered on. The salad wasn't any better and just tasted \"meh\", a far cry from what it used to be. It feels like the needs of the community have dragged this place into the gutter, because the other locations (especially Courtney Park) are much better in terms of service and quality. The whole place gave off this really scummy vibe to it, and I don't think I'll be coming back.  If I had written this review four years ago, this Osmow's would have received five stars easy. It just hasn't aged well, and there are a lot of deficiencies that need to be addressed."}
{"text":"Extremely, slow service. The food is below average. I'm not sure how they are still in business."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. Order is always wrong every time I go there. The bald guy who seems to be the owner and his wife who is the cashier are very rude. They got my order wrong and didn't give me my receipt, so when I asked politely they refused and started arguing and yelling at me. The kid who seems tp be there son is helpful.The store is always clean however terrible service and quality. Would recommend another owsmos or a lazeez."}
{"text":"The food when done right is great, but then there are those days where the food isnt up to par. Been there about 5 times and had a bad experience twice. Went on a lunch hour once with 4 coworkers and we ended up waiting for about 30-40mins for our food to be prepared.  The food was good, but the service that day was extremely slow. The second time with a not so good experience was on a weekend. The food (rice to be specific) was warm going towards the cool side, I ate instore that day too.   I would still return though as it's a short walk from my neighbourhood and I feel like it's"}
{"text":"busy hole in the wall, has good philly vegesteak. the hotsause is actually good stuff not watered down vinegar filled stuff.  pretty busy lines out the door"}
{"text":"I just spent my last dollar at Osmows in Streetsville.  Absolutely fed up of the inconsiderate and outright rude service.   I've been a customer for 8 years and the service keeps getting worse each time.  The food is still of a decent quality but not worth the treatment they dish out to customers.  I've had a few bad experiences recently but the final straw was a gentlemen refusing to cut a shawarma in half because \"it creates a huge mess.\" I proceeded to cut it in half using a flimsy plastic knife without any mess at all. Me and my friends have all decided to never spend another dollar here."}
{"text":"Had the wrap for the first time was good. Usually get the dinner. Decent. Not my favourite shawarma as I'm not a big fan of the actual meat but not bad."}
{"text":"Honestly it's decent and I frequent often but it's still not the best shawarma place. Most people enjoy it because of the sauce that they dump in an insane amount all over the chicken but the actual quality of meat isn't the greatest. That said I do enjoy their falafel and salads."}
{"text":"I had a regular falafel wrap from here which was very reasonably priced at just over $5 and was a decent size; my colleague got the same. The service was a little slow around 1:45pm but it didn't really bother me. We found out after ordering that the falafel does not include hummus as a \"topping\" which I have never heard of before; it's a staple ingredient in a falafel but apparently here it's an additional charge! We both paid debit and were charged a $0.35 surcharge (which seems unnecessary for a chain restaurant) so we couldn't just pay to add it on after. It's something that at least should be offered when ordering because it's an expectation. The worst part though was the spiciness. I can handle the heat - I put sriracha on everything and generally love spicy foods so I asked for my falafel wrap with medium spice and I was almost dying as I ate it - I went through 3 bottles of water and could barely breathe, had the sniffly nose, watering eyes, etc. It was only because I was STARVING that I didn't toss it because I could hardly taste the other ingredients as the hot sauce was so overpowering. My colleague got the 'little spice' option and her mouth was on fire as well. It's hard to mess up a falafel this badly, but luckily the price lessened my sense of regret."}
{"text":"Had chicken on the rocks there...i order large portion and got a large but with a small portion and the food was cold... would prefer to go to the streetsville osmow's it's better in quality and serving size!"}
{"text":"They are very generous in s Portion size and meat. This is not a place that you'd have to worry if you'll be full because 100% you will be full and satisfied. Perfect shawarma even if without spice. But I highly recommend you add even just mild."}
{"text":"Won't be returning here.. I've heard of this brand probably due to marketing.  Happened to be nearby this location and looking for a good new Shawarma place since moving recently to Markham.  Had the chicken shawarma dinner.  The salad was over dressed and actually pretty spicy (how do you mess up salad?). The rice was either undercooked or old or both.  The chicken was ok but dry.  Overall not very flavourful.  The salad had more than the main!  Despite the fact they smothered it with Special Sauce.  Only giving an extra star because my toddler liked the plain rice but such is his palette."}
{"text":"The food here is soooo good. I always get chicken on the rocks which is chicken with yellow rice. They put a garlic sauce on top and how much hot sauce you require. The prices arnt too bad either. Around 20 dollars for two people without drinks. The only thing is not much room to sit inside."}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit overrated. I got the chicken on the rocks which was good-ish, but the actual garlic sauce was bland and not very garlicky. It was more of a watered down ranch sauce in my opinion. The quality of the chicken as well was questionable. I have to say, the portions were decent and the rice was yummy but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Sorry, not for me."}
{"text":"The place runs because of the food. Don't go in to sit and have lunch its like a cabin, the place is very small and not much area to sit and move. But the FOOD is to die for, the put fries in the shawarma and they can also do an all meat shawarma plus there phily steak is just amazing.   Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I'm trying not to be too critical because they just opened.  First off,  food is good.  Pretty tasty.  Aside from that....  Service was slow,  took about 30-40 minutes for a beef kofta and chicken Shawarma wrap.  Granted,  it was busy.   They forgot to give us our salad, no big deal normally but it sucks because I saw them mess up 3 orders in a row right before me.  Yes,  I should have checked but I was with my 10 month old and shouldn't have to do quality control for an establishment.    Speaking of 10 month old,  they have no high chairs.  So if you are thinking of coming with a little one.    Again.  The food is good,  so maybe I'd give it another shot one day when it is not busy or when they have been around for longer and get better at doing this."}
{"text":"The best schwarma ever  Must try the chicken on the rocks  Reasonable prices  Very friendly staff The best option for students at York University looking for a good meal"}
{"text":"Decent shawarma in a pinch. The food is better at other locations of this chain, downtown seems the best to me. Perhaps with time they will find their groove. Clean place, service was fast."}
{"text":"SO. MUCH. FOOD. $15 for a footlong philly cheesesteak with what was probably medium fries and a large Greek salad. I would highly recommend sharing if you're not too hungry (as I was!)   Tasted really good and I had to pack the rest away but fries were fresh and crisp. Will come again"}
{"text":"Do I even need to start raving about the deliciousness that is Osmows?! Chances are if you live in the GTA, you know Osmows or you know someone that knows Osmows. And what makes this place great is that they are simple and delicious. Chicken on the rocks, it's literally just succulent, flavourful, delicious chicken shawarma on rice with garlic sauce and hot sauce (depending on your spice level) slathered on top. Does that sound amazing or what?! I've also gotten their falafel and it's made at the time of order, so it's fresh and just as much flavourful as its chicken counterpart. I've been to many locations across GTA, and this one didn't disappoint either. Great location, off the 401. It's a busy place during lunch/dinner but has a lot of seating compared to other locations. And they are adequently staffed so the line moves fast.   All in all, if you are starving and need hot, delicious Mediterranean food that will fill you up, look no further!!   Disclaimers: Huge portion sizes. I order a medium chicken on the rocks and that's enough for 2 meals. Also, the hot sauce is spicy, so think twice before saying 4+ lines."}
{"text":"This place is just way to much of a hit and miss. Sometimes the service is good but others it's just horrible. The food always changes size and price and for the reason I won't go back anymore"}
{"text":"Their food is really mediocre. Nothing special. We ordered chicken on the rocks and trust me it was simply loaded with their white sauce with no flavor."}
{"text":"I don't come in here all the time,  sometimes it gets busy and a bit crowded around dinner. But it's because it's popular. I think it's worth it. Their chicken on the rocks is my favourite menu item. The falafel outstanding."}
{"text":"okay so I cannot rant enough about HOW happy I am that this opened down the street from my house, there are no amount of words!  The Osmow's I'm used to is the one north Brampton on Chrysler and although many locations have opened, there is no quality and taste like that one.  This new location definitely compares, 100%. I went to my \"go-to\" which is chicken on the rocks (aka chicken on rice). it's my comfort food! I went to the location LATE Sunday night, thinking it would be slow, but it was definitely the opposite of that. it was clean, and the service was great!   I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Updating the review. This place is gross. It really is a by or miss. There garbage laying around close to the food, and last time I got the chicken on the rocks the chicken tasted 2 weeks old because I'm pretty sure they mix the old Chicken with the newer chicken on the flat top. It has declined majorly in the past 2-3 years. I rather go to other newer locations."}
{"text":"I love Osmows. It tastes really good actually. The problem is the service... I asked for extra garlic sauce for chicken on the rocks and they gave me extra spicy sauce instead... I say check your food inside before you leave if you are getting take out because i don't know if they're trying to trick you or if it was a mistake. But this is the second time it has happened so... Fooled me once, shame on them; fooled me twice, shame on me. So that's why I gave 2 star :/ Just my opinion, others may have better experiences."}
{"text":"So Dirty. Kitchen is gross. Went for the Lentil soup, they didn't have it. Falafel? Nope. Should not have wasted my time. Ingredient are basically bulk food service. Not very good at all."}
{"text":"Saw this place newly opened last time with lots of people. We got there close to 9pm and there are still many people so thinking this place should be good. Ordered a chicken shawarma with rice and Philly cheese steak. First the food takes really long and the person at the register placing the order not very good at explaining. It's more like he has a script that he just read it from there. Anyways, it took more than 30mins for the food and by the time when I start eating at home, then I just realized they forgot about the sauce on my chicken shawarma. So now I got chicken and rice that are dry and no taste and I ended up putting chilli sauce instead. The Philly cheese steak is tasty just like the other Philly cheese steak sandwich, but the pita bread isn't soft and the steak is tough. Had some hard time biting it. Overall, not recommend this place but maybe they can do better after not be so busy."}
{"text":"Good food and really fair prices. We went Saturday at 6 and it was very busy. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak platter, osmow's special (wrap), 'nuff said! One of the best sandwich joints I've been to in a long long time. Lovin it. Choose hot sauce at ur own tolerance level"}
{"text":"So I ordered my food at 8:38 said I'll be there in 15-20 and they said alright. I showed up less than 10 minuets after 10 all staff is still inside and they refuse to give me my food, didn't even open the door to explain, what's the point? It's already cooked AND staff is all there. Could have just said on the phone be here before 10 or else you've waisted your trip. Ridiculous service, not my first bad experience either. Disgusting manners."}
{"text":"Not impressive. I've definitely had better shawarmas elsewhere. I ordered the chicken on the rocks as well as a chicken shawarma wrap. Both were 'meh'. Can get better quality and cheaper shawarmas at other places. Don't think I'll be returning.."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places in streetsville, and it's the cheapest one out of all the ones I've been to. No complaints about service. Expect a long line going out through the back door!"}
{"text":"I'm middle eastern and this place is hands down my favorite place to grab Shawarma in the 6ix. I've lived here for 20 years and I have yet to try better shawarma in any place I've lived (Canada or America). I always grab a beef shawarma over the chicken but that's just personal preference."}

{"text":"I was in town for some training seminars and needed a place for lunch. I didn't know where to go, but I aimed for a plaza that looked like it had a lot of dining options. Surely there would be something I could find, right? Luckily, I found Osmow's, and, judging from the massive lines, I could tell I'd found a local hotspot. The food was generous and good and served fast (despite the long lines). Finding a table to sit was a challenge, but not impossible. I'd 100% definitely return here, and bring along anyone in the mood for schwarma and a filling meal."}
{"text":"One of my favourite comfort foods! Some of the staff seem like rookies. But overall customer service is good & the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"Good for quick snacks, chicken on the rocks is pretty good. They smothered the chicken with garlic sauce, deliciouso. The portions are also generous though I can't really tell the difference between the large and the medium."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Osmow's. I had the beef kofta wrap and it was pretty good! Everything looked happening and fresh at the counter and they were doing a brisk business with many takeout orders leaving as we came in. The staff was helpful and explained the menu to us. After sitting down at the bar along the wall opposite the grill, the guy even went so far as to bring our orders right to us, plopping our matching paper bags down in front of us with synchronized grilled fast food panache - now that's REALLY good service! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow have these guys really expanded. I remember when there was only 1-2 locations in the entire GTA area, they in the last 3 years they seem to have gone into franchise hyper mode and their locations are as widespread as Macs Milk and McDonalds - ok maybe not THAT much, but there's never an Osmow's far from where-ever you are (over 40 according to their website). Honeslty when in the hell did this happen.  I've actually never dined/eaten at Osmow's before, despite their popularity and their famed \"chicken on the rocks\" dish (open faced shawarma on fries with sauce), so when this was the closest option for food today I figured - Meh, what the hell.  For those not aware, Osmow's is like the Pizza Pizza of middle eastern food - except you know, palatable and actually tasty. The Finch location was a little bare bones but the menu board and front were all digital on flat screens.  I ordered a beef shawarma and a chicken shawarma with everything but hot peppers and medium spice level of sauce. Pro-tip, they've actually created a visual for spice level by the number of lines of sauce they draw on your shawarma before the wrap it up. Medium = 4 lines and it's got a bite for it. I highly recommend you check out their idiot proof guidelines to spice, it's genius.  It's easily one of the best prepared shawamas I've had in the GTA as they've mastered the actual toasting of the sandwich so that the bread is crispy. The meat and toppings are plentiful and so is the sauce - maybe a little too much as several bites were overly sauced to the point where my shwarmas exploded out the bottom from being saturated in sauce.  It's no frills, it's reasonably priced and when you look at calorie counts not that bad for you tbh. For me it's a strong 3.5 star....not quite a 4 but I'll round up.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Good fresh food, good price and good quantity. The location is pretty central and easily accessible. The food prep time is fast as well"}
{"text":"One of the better Sharwma places in the area. I have tried the chicken on the rocks (roast chicken on rice with seasoning sauces) On my previous visit, and have had their wraps and dinners.  Overall, the food is quite good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Good food, when it's right. Went here today with my girlfriend, they served people that came in after us and we weren't the only ones experiencing this. One woman was complaining that her food had been made and cold since it had been sitting on the counter. Once we grabbed our food and went outside to eat we found they had messed up both of our orders. Went back in to fix it hers and both the cook and cashier straight up ignored me. Went back in with mine and hers and was livid, and a young man was very helpful and apologetic and fixed everything. Probably close to an hour all said and done. The food was good but the people were very ignorant. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Chicken. On. The. Rocks.  Wouldn't dine in, atmosphere is horrible, and there is always oil smell in the air as the cooking area is in the open, but get the food, go to a park, and DIG in!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Chicken in the rocks is my favourite item on their menu. Rice topped with chicken dressed with three different sauces. I need a weekly fix of this! It is a takeout place that lacks seating but the quality of the food makes up for that. The workers are great and have great customer service skills. Best to pay cash as there is a surcharge for debit and visa. Regardless, great prices for great portions. I've also tried the chicken on sticks and the chicken shawarma which are also amazing. Overall recommend this place to everyone!  Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"the chicken is dry. The grill is nasty looking..all that oil piled up. at first I thought the food is good..by the 3rd time..it had same weird taste.  Don't bother going here"}
{"text":"Quick review:   this is place is okay, it gets really busy with kids, who I think love their $5 Shawarma but for me I have tried so many different places for shawarma, there was a time when i only used to hunt Shawarma joints...best by far has to be Empire Shawarma in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Simply Best!! Great Taste!! Fresh!!  If you are hungry and you are checking out where to go on Yelp. GOO HERE!!! JUST TRY THIS! I generally dont enjoy Mediterranean food but this place has changed my taste buds. The food is the best. The food is fresh, tasty, spicy. The owners very friendly and welcoming and they have really redefined the term \"customer care\". They quantity is always more than normal. I end up saving some food for later.  I live 15kms away from this location. But For the Quality food and service they provide I would drive all the way to this place."}
{"text":"Stepping into this place, it felt warm and cozy, with Egyptian themed art on the walls. At first I was confused, as the Egyptian theme does not resonate with me when I think of shwarma. Apparently, (if you were in the dark like I was) Google says that Shwarma originated from the Levant countries, which includes Egypt. Huh. Who knew. Learning moment of the day.  Anyway, I digress. Back to it...  The service was friendly and staff were accommodating, despite it being quite busy. However, I was charged a $1 surcharge for Amex use.   I ordered the chicken shwarma plate with Greek salad to-go. I was disappointed that they did not have tabbouleh salad as a salad option. When I opened the bag, I was a bit surprised to note that there were two boxes inside, one was filled with chicken/rice and the other was the salad.   The chicken was served over a huge bed of rice, poor rice to meat ratio. Furthermore, the meat was rather dry in some parts, and I found a few pieces of cartilage and one shard of bone. Eat with care. The white (garlic?) sauce struck me as odd too because it was slightly sweet where I expected it to be savory. The spicy sauce is quite hot, but a bit bland. Arguably, the Greek salad was the better part of the meal, but be aware that it is mostly comprised of lettuce.  It would have been better value for money if there was less rice, and perhaps some hummus and pita bread, or potato or some other side dish to balance it out.  Overall, I'd eat this for sustenance, but definitely a case of quantity over quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, quick service and cheap. We often go there for shawarma and falafel's... never disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're desperate for food and it's your only option.... I had wanted to try this place since it opened as one of my colleagues recommended it! I'm guessing it was solely based on size. I got the chicken shawarma. It was huge!  At my first bite, I thought to myself this taste like a hamburger, with mustard. Weird! I looked at the \"chicken\" it was a bit darker that the average chicken I usually consume. I was hungry so I continued to eat it.   It was very saucy, which is usually great, but the sauces were kind of thick and not as flavourful as any other shawarma I've ever eaten. To be honest I was grossing myself out, by eating it! I had to get rid of it! And run to catch the bus. A few minutes later my stomach felt a little uneasy.   If you have an iron stomach and want a big bland meal, go to it!!! I would recommend, trying something else!  Gets 2 star for location, quantity of good and the server was nice! And she did wash her hands right before she made my sandwich, which I really liked!!  Cleanliness, yay!!! Hope I'm not sick later!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve a one star!!! I tried beef plate and i was disgusted! First i asked if i can taste the beef and he said no because beef is very very expensive!!!! I thought I would give it a try anyways even though my husband told me he hated this place!!! Old shitty food for $15 i could eat at a fine restaurant! I wanna throw up when I think about it! This business with that food and management is gonna go down soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food can be good but I've only had the food I want ONCE out of the 6 times I've gone.  They have messed up my order almost every single time. I went there today hoping they would give me the order I want but unfortunately again they gave me chicken without sauce.  I ordered Chicken on the Rocks (Without rice, but with the sauces) and they again for the fifth time have given me chicken without any sauce at all. I am yet again stuck with plain chicken breast from this place. I'm never returning here again."}
{"text":"Let me just say.. we have trying to keep ourselves from going here everyday. This place is so damn good and so darn addictive.   Also, when they say it's HOT sauce .. it's really hot. I recommend going with medium."}
{"text":"Had the falafel. Other shwarma places around town are better. It's ok hangover food, but the taste isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Decent Shawarma which is all I ever get there.  It will settle your cravings but leaves a bit to be desired compared to some other places.  Usually I find that you end up eating way too much pita especially if it's a large where they end up wrapping two small pitas together.   This leaves you with the overlapping middle that is two layers thick of bread.  Way too much.  Also they debit machines are absolutely disgusting which is not something you want to see or handle right before you eat.  They need to clean those things."}
{"text":"Always my go to place to eat. Between the chicken on the rocks, the phillychicken steak or the shawarmas, it's always great. The only downside to me is that I feel like this location doesn't put as much meat into as other locations in the Mississauga."}
{"text":"I bought a chicken on the rocks, when I got home I started to eat and found a long blond hair, so I decided to take it back. I kindly told the lady preparing the food, she just looked at me like I put it! I said it's your hair! she still didn't say a single word. all she did was remake the food. she didn't offer to give me a refund or anything, as I was leaving she said only two words \"I'm sorry\" that's all she said."}
{"text":"Wanted this place to be my go-to for a quick, take-out lunch, as it's super close to work and I've already had a few good experiences with their wraps and plates, and the staff is friendly. Unfortunately, today's wrap contained a hard, sharp piece of metal, which I discovered with a terrible crunch on my teeth and cut in the mouth. Looks to be a small rolled up piece of metal with a sharp end. Happy I didn't swallow it. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.  Hope staff sees this comment and reviews their equipment and product, so someone else doesn't end up with metal in their mouth :("}
{"text":"This review is for the Lakeshore branch. We drove all the way from Michigan yesterday, and my dad was raving about how awesome their shawarmas are because he tried them last year. After finally getting there, we started our order, and the cashier was extremely rude. He would snap at us whenever we asked a question about the menu, and had a very negative attitude. He clearly saw we were a big family (there were 6 of us), and each time we ordered something, he seemed in a hurry to complete/end the order. We ordered tabbouleh and hummus, and they said they did not have any. I recalculated the order because he was very distracted while taking our order. Our bill came out $74, even though the food we received was for $67. When I confronted him about it, after standing in line for 20 minutes, he realized he charged us for an extra rice and extra fries. I asked for the money back, and he gave me $5 plus some change, although he was supposed to give me $9 back. After I realized this and turned around to point this out, the line to the register was all the way to the door. So, this review my way of getting back at them.   Also, I don't understand the hype. The food was mediocre. I've had better shawarmas in Dearborn, MI. Heck, I've had better shawarmas in Midland, MI (which is in the middle of nowhere). I had high expectations for this restaurant, and I was extremely disappointed. Never going back again, not to Lakeshore or any of their other branches."}

{"text":"If I wasn't starving to death I would have probably thrown out the rest of my meal. The chicken wasn't even sitting on the grill. It came out from a container and barely heated.. So really it could be yesterday's chicken cuz it sure hell tasted like it. Dry burnt pieces. Save your time and money. Osmows isn't what it used to be. Toronto shawarma places really need to learn the basics again. Service was nice the guys behind the counter were kind and helpful added a star for that."}
{"text":"Tasteless dry chicken. The quality of meat is definitely subpar. Sauce has no garlic flavor. I have had better"}
{"text":"I ordered the large because I was very hungry and what I got was a pita filled with a tiny amount of chicken and very minimal toppings. The bread wrapped around 3 times over. All I tasted was bread and nothing else. It was very dry and the chicken was already on the griddle for who mows how long before I got there.   One thing I can't stand is places that cheap out on meat or toppings.  The owner should visit: Shawerma Empire Shawermaland Pita Golden Pocket They know how to make a proper Shawerma that is not made for supermodels.   If they continue to give these portions, I would be shocked if they last a year in business."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this location... I saw no documentation of this location serving halal meat on the walls/menu, the cashier verbally confirmed.  I decided to order anyways, every question I asked she had to leave the cashier to ask her manager which happened approx. 3 times. After I ordered I noticed the PRICE WAS $3.00 HIGHER THAN THE MENU...I asked her why...she had to ask her manager why... he said \"the menu displayed has the old prices\"...  Why would a new location with a new menu board that's all digital be showing inaccurate prices? Why isn't it updated and it's not like prices went up by $0.25 everything is up by $3.00. I'm sure most people don't even notice!!! What a rip off!   When I asked about the price difference she should have honored the advertised amount instead of trying to squeeze $3.00 out of me.   I do not recommend this location at all, go to Bamiyan next door for something healthy, tasty and HALAL"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. They can add digital number sign so that guest sitting far can see their turn. Instead of cardboard numbers, have some plastic printed numbers. Over all it's a great place for nice food. Will go again with family and friends to get them taste is Chicken on Rocks (rice).   Buy full meal If you are really hungry. Won't be able to stand if you finish it."}
{"text":"Authentic middle Eastern Mediterranean cuisine.  Big portions for the price.  Many places to sit and lots of parking.  It's a franchise that is growing quickly so they are doing something right. Salads are made to order on site with plenty of toppings."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is decent. Most people know this. The customer service as most of those people will tell you leaves a lot to be desired. I mean patience is a virtue , that is unless your starving and you stand there watching other people behind you get food and all the employees lolly gagging around.. it's pretty frustrating.  What I saw last night in streetsville was just halarious. So I order a chicken shawarma. Then as I'm waiting and i kidd you not, I counted 7 customers standing there watching 7 employees who were all watching tv. I'm serious this is a true story. It left me scratching my head. Like where the heck was I.... all the customers were literally standing there while the 7 employees stood there laughing watching a music video.  Anywayz this location is whack.  These people don't care about the customers or pumping out food. Heck i remember 1 time when the guy didn't want to make me a salad for take out because he says they were closing in a half hour... Wattttttttttttttt i was so confused... look if you want a good shawarma osmows can hook it up... just be ready to put up with all the nonsense that comes with it. Or go somewhere else where they value your business. After all there are a ton of other options I'm ready to explore."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a suggestion from some coworkers and have to admit the food was very tasty.  I opted for the Chicken special which contained a very nice saffron rice, green salad with a nice seasoned dressing and a very moist and tasty chicken. I'm not a fan of sauces so I opted for a plain meal and was surprised on how moist the chicken was. For the price it was well worth it (2 days worth of food).   My friend ordered the Chicken on the Rocks as suggested by our coworkers and lets just say there wasn't a crumb left. Thumbs up and a big smile were the response of \"How did it taste?\".   I didn't see any health violations during my visit (thank goodness). I'm hoping that the the owners took the previous posting to heart and cleaned up there act. I for one would leave if I saw sick people working on my food. Fortunately that didn't happen for me.   Whether it be this or another location, stop by for some reasonably priced, wonderfully cooked food. Look to do take away, as their seating is limited."}
{"text":"I had the chicken on the rocks here, pretty good but as mentioned the chicken was in the heating plate... Would have been nice if it was on the spit. The sauces do make the chicken much tastier and the rice is nice and buttery. Overall, this place is alright if you're in the area and looking for shawarma, and seems like they have lots of locations, but I thought it was pretty average."}
{"text":"After my chicken and rice spot was ruined by new owners in Pickering, I needed a fix somewhere else. They opened this chain near my house and I was stoked to check it out. It's about 10 bucks for the chicken on the rocks which includes taxes. They offer different levels of hot sauce. I went with medium which was definitely a good kick and not too hot. They're really nice about adding extra garlic sauce on top. I once tried my friend's and they had the seasoning put on it. It was a potent taste that I didn't care for. It was almost like Cayenne pepper. Just tell them you don't want it. The only thing that kills it for me is the rice is so bland so it ruins the flavor of the chicken and sauces. Otherwise it's a pretty decent place for my fix. It's small so not really much place to sit and eat. Friendly people. i had to change it to a 3 because the last time i went the chicken was dry and cold. hope it was just a one time thing"}
{"text":"This place has great tasting food from their chicken on the rocks plate to chicken shawarma wrap. Lately I haven't been a fan of restaurants charging extra for hummus and tahini sauce but I guess it's the norm now. One of the best tasting shawarma places in Brampton! I prefer the shawarma wrap rather than the plate. Majority of the time I go with the super chicken shawarma. As well be on the lookout for various In-house specials. Overall great tasting food and price seems reasonable."}
{"text":"Got the house special which is essentially chicken shawarma, rice, and salad. I chose medium+ for spice and it was hotter than I expected. Definitely not comparable to medium at other places. The chicken and rice tasted good, reasonable quantity, definitely not as much meat as you would think."}
{"text":"Was craving something similar to Halal Guys so we decided to try Osmow's chicken on the rocks through uber eats. Not comparable to Halal Guys but still sooooooooo good!!!!! I got the sauce in Hot and it was definitely spicy!! Not sure why this place is rated 2.5, we were really impressed with this dish. Would definitely order again, want to try the chicken on sticks next time."}
{"text":"I've tried the Osmow's in Richmond Hill and it horrible. I've heard from people that this one in Mississauga is much better so I thought I'd give it a try. First impression when walking in is that the place is filthy! Kitchen isn't well kept and the seating area was a disaster. The staff looked like they were on break when I walked in and no one really greeted me. I still decided to give it a try so I ordered the large chicken Shawerma wrap. The sandwich was ok but like the one in Richmond Hill it's all bread. Hot sauce was hot and tasty but hats just about it. I'd give this place a 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Osmow's so I was quite excited when a new one opened up close to work. I gotta say it was very disappointing. First off they charge you $8.00 before tax for what they call a 'super' sandwich and there was nothing super about it. They double wrap the sandwich (two pita's) so you'll fill up on bread. The chicken  was not cut fresh and was reheated and the bread was old and falling apart, So much so that I couldn't properly enjoy my 'super' sandwich. My total for a shawerma and a bottled drink was almost $12. Definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"The best! The chicken on the rocks, chicken on the sticks are the best! Insider tip: ask for half and half! Great falafel and wraps too!   I gave them 4/5 because we always call ahead for our order (always a little bit of wait here as food is made fresh). When I call them they tell me a certain time and I when I get there to pay I see them just STARTING our order! Really?? I've even offered to pay them over the phone and they said they can't do that. What is exactly is the point of phone orders if I still have to wait??   Also, don't know why they aren't on UberEATS?"}
{"text":"Called in to place an order for pickup, and was immediately asked to hold the line. The person who took my order Said it would be ready in 15 minutes only to get there and wait another 10 minutes. Got my order wrong. Service here is absolutely terrible and imo service is what makes dining out a make or break experience.  The food itself is good but still can't get the taste of that bad service out of my mouth. For those of you who value a positive service experience I suggest Pita Nutso a couple stores over."}
{"text":"Shawarmas are great here if they ever get made right. I've been here about 8-10 times and the last 4 times they have messed up my order. I always get a chicken shawarma and ask for fries, onions and tomatoes in the wrap. Sometimes they miss the onions or they add lettuce in it and I won't complain; HOWEVER, this time I order a chicken shawarma and there was no CHICKEN in it!!!!! How do forget the chicken in a chicken shawarma?! I know I'm the idiot who comes back here but there is no other good shawarma spot in Brampton. The were kind in making a new one but seriously come on. Nice staff that make great shawarmas, but they need to listen to their customer's.  Go to the Osmows in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"I know lots of people rave about Osmows but I've had way better ones like Villa Madina and Mr. Zagros. I'm generally not a picky person but I definitely look for flavor and overall worth of food to price.   I've had their wraps, Chicken on the rocks and Chicken on the sticks. Basically trying their meat, rice, and veggies. Their chicken is very bland to me, very plain and no flavor whatsoever. And when they cook it on the grill, they add water! Why water, when you can use a sauce or infused flavored oil to add much more flavor! It definitely makes the chicken flavorless and soggy with the water in my opinion. Their rice is also very bland and just salty. That's all I taste, no spices or herbs or anything. Besides that, the veggies seem to be fresh. Only thing is, the wraps are poorly wrapped so sauce and veggies always start to leak and leak through the wrapper which isn't fun. The fries seem too dry and crunchy in my opinion, similar to McDonald's fries, but drier and don't really have that potato taste :/   Overall I rate this place 2/5 if you're desperate for Mediterranean food and don't have places like Villa Madina, Flame, or Mr. Zagros, etc. It's alright, but I wouldn't recommend if you want flavor, which is what I think Mediterranean food should be about!"}
{"text":"One of their classic menu items is chicken on the rocks. GET IT! Reminded me of halal guys, if you've ever had their food off of the street carts in NYC. Similar to that, You can select your spicy level and it comes with a delicious garlic sauce (trust me, you want that garlic sauce). Unlike halal guys, there is no side pita. It would have also been refreshing to have had a simple size salad. Although, Their chicken was deliciously cooked and I'd come back to try another item off their menu."}
{"text":"REALLY really bad quality food. Ordered a chicken shawarma and before I could turn around my sandwich was made. All the toppings I had asked for were not on it and it was not grilled. Couldn't even finish it. Terrible really that this location has opened up - gives the streetsville location a bad rep as it's the same chain. I wouldn't recommend eating here. Right around the corner is me va me and they're a little pricey but much much more worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a shish taouk sandwich, chicken shawarma and chicken on stix. The shawarma looked okay. I didn't eat that. My shish taouk sandwich was swimming with sauce. It fell apart. It felt like there was half a cup of sauce on it. So gross. Never ordering from there again!!"}
{"text":"While Osmow's is known for its heaping chicken plates, I preferred the shawarma from my visit. The shawarma is good, better than the average you'll find in Toronto, and is honestly probably some of the best you'll find in the nearby area. I was surprised when I tried it, since my previous visits made me expect something else entirely. Up until then I'd only tried their chicken plates, and that is where I will direct most of my criticism. The chicken on the rocks is fairly good value for the price, and I'm sure if you were drunk and needed something to eat that it would be fine, but I can't really recommend a menu item that is garlic sauce with a side of chicken. I can't evaluate how good the rest of it is because the entire thing is covered in a pool of garlic sauce that makes everything taste one-note. If they covered beef with the sauce it would probably taste the exact same. It's fine as a post-drinking meal, but sober? It makes me feel bad about myself when I think about how many calories were spent to cover up the main dish."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is amazing.  The sauce is to die for.  The kids like the chicken with rice or fries.  I find it a bit heavy and prefer the daily special that includes salad.  The salad cuts the grease and is the perfect balance.  We also like the chicken shawarma wrap which is lighter and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this location of chain at the suggestion of a friend. She could not have been more right! The shawarma was delicious and far larger than I needed, all for around $7. The flavour combination was well balanced and the pita did not get soggy at all, even while taking about 20 minutes to eat.  The staff were very friendly and courteous. The only slight drawback, the speed in which they move. This is no complaint as the food was worth the wait.  I will be going back to this location next time I'm in area  Thank you!"}
{"text":"While the flavours were good as per usual, the portions were much smaller than normal. My advice is don't use Uber eats to get your food from them if you can go there instead. The shawarma was a lot less packed than normal, so much so that the pita was loose. The fries were half empty. The only thing that came filled up was my girlfriends order of half and half Chicken.   Won't be returning to/ ordering from this location. Lesson learned"}
{"text":"Quality of meat is not that great and all you taste is onions. The staff is nice and friendly"}
{"text":"The bombdiggy chicken schwarma in Mississauga! The best place in the 905! It gets pretty packed. Get there at an odd time, you'll get no line, and a seat to sit down. The venue is pretty small. Ask for the Chicken Schwarma SUPER sized. Their hot sauce is pretty hot!"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving them two stars it is because of the girl who takes the order she is very rude and not at all helpful sorry i did not get her name. The food is ok i have been there a few times because it is not far from my house. Not sure if I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout 40 min in advance, arrived and the order wasn't started, had to wait another 20 min for 2 chicken shawarma wraps and a beef plate while other customers putting in orders after me were served within 5 min.  Food is swimming in sauce. Customer service is non existent...  Used to come here often, I guess Paramount it is from now on :-("}
{"text":"Best Shawarma place in mississauga!! Its always open, and its always amazing. Theres long lines for a reason !!"}
{"text":"I generally love Osmows! Ordered over the phone from this location so I could pick up and it would be ready. When I got there they hadn't even started on the food yet. Overall the food tasted amazing but I noticed the server talked a lot and listened little. Photographed is the chicken on the rocks !!"}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEEEE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!  The chicken on rocks obviously is the best!!!! BUTTT if you  want to be a bit healthy get the half and half ;)  I lived in the west and recently moved to Scarborough and am SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS SHOP!!!!!!!!!  I don't understand why people are crying about 35 cent surcharge, seriously? You are crying about 35 cents WOW... This is the norm everywhere! anything you buy below a certain point always has surcharge."}
{"text":"First time trying Osmows and it was quite a pleasant experience. All my friends mentioned GREAT things about it and though it was very good mediterranean food, it did make my friend and I quite nauseous. We ordered the speciality dishes in Medium and only finished half! I would recommend sharing the dish with someone if you aren't a big eater.  Workers there were very nice and helpful and though we went during a busy time, we only waited a few minutes for our food"}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant should look into expanding their seat-down space. They usually have a line up which goes all the way to the back door. This makes it difficult to hear your name being called (to go get your food) or find any sort of space to stand. There have been several times that I went to this location and choose to go next door (due to being over crowded). The quality of their food has also been going down due to high customer demand and lack of serving staff. My biggest turn off for this location is how long you have to wait for your food."}
{"text":"I came back today for the second time. Much better service, no wait and chicken on the rocks with salad was awesome. I was hoping the first visit was just them working out the kinks and it was!"}
{"text":"Y'know I kinda expected more from this place but hey, it's fast food. I love eating Mediterranean food, but only when it's good.  The place has terrible design--orange walls that are bare with the exception of some Egyptian-esque decor. Very tacky. I'd rather go somewhere else to eat the food rather than dine in.  What threw me off when I ordered food was that they don't include tzatziki sauce in the price. It's an add-on...Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it was always included in the price as all other Mediterranean places did that. I really did not want to add a dollar to it, so I stuck with a tzatziki-less shish tawouk wrap and a side of falafel. Oh yeah, they're quite stingy in the ingredients too.  The wrap itself was unexpectedly good despite the lack of tzatziki. But that was only because it came with a hot sauce (weird that they have that included but not tzatziki). The falafel, on the other hand, left much to be desired. They were tiny (think of chicken nuggets) AND dry. They try to fill the box up with lettuce to make it look 'full'. I basically had to down it with water to eat it.   Overall, I've been to much better Mediterranean places. Yes fast food included. Maybe it's just this location but I'd say try to avoid it."}
{"text":"Really solid fast food if you're in search of some fresh and quality Mediterranean food! Whether you have it with fries or with rice, both bases are Good! The rice was soft and flavourful on its own, and the fries were fried just right. The chicken shawarma is cooked fresh per order and they're constantly preparing it so there's no long wait. My only critique is that the platters come heavily dressed; a lot of garlic and spicy sauce that partially overwhelms the flavours of everything else. Otherwise, really great choice in the east end of Markham."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! As a regular customer to the location in Mississauga, I was so happy to see this chain open in Richmond Hill BUT after several lack lustre visits we finally had the meal that broke the camel's back. My husband picked up takeout and brought it home for dinner. We found not one but THREE hairs in our meals! Disgusting! We threw away our dinners. Then turned to our baklava hoping to have at least a decent dessert - WRONG! It tasted and smelled like a pickled salad. Another trip to the garbage bin. We called the store and was promised the manager would call back, never an apology on that call. No call back from the store and its been a month. You have lost 2 customers !"}
{"text":"The food is soooo good!    Large portions and I got the chicken shawarma plate...with hot sauce, they ain't playing with their hot sauce levels lol.  I got hot and it's pretty spicy and I have a high tolerance for spicy food.  It was Monday night and this place was busy!  The wait time wasn't too bad either especially with the number of people in line.  If you want good shawarma, this is the hot spot to go.  I like the Brampton location the most so far."}
{"text":"Worst osmows I've been to. Very dry. And hot sauce tastes very weird. The wrap was very loose. Terrible. I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is extremely tasty and the chicken is tender. I've been there several times and only tried the chicken lunch special which comes with shawarma chicken, rice and salad. We always go there on Friday's for lunch with co-workers, and let me tell you, if you hit the lunch rush, you will be waiting a LONG WHILE! I'm talking 30-45 minutes to get your order. But it's worth waiting for because the food is delicious. Try to go after 1pm to avoid the issue. Some hints, hot means HOTTT with these guys. I'm used to eating suicide-level sauces and spices, and the \"hot\" here is hotter than that.   Also, they have glass bottled Coke!"}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks, shawarma on the rocks, chicken on the sticks, slap that special sauce on anything and you've got yourself another loyal customer. Medium is not hot, if you like spice order hot trust me you wont regret it. Ridiculously crowded on the weekend but, If I can get my \"Halal Guy\" closer to home, you best bet the wait is worth it. This place ain't pretty in fact it looks pretty damn filthy, but who gives - the food is finger kissing deliciousnessesssess. The end."}
{"text":"Chicken on the rox!! This is the only thing you need to get here. Shawarma on a bed of rice smothered in garlic and hot sauces. One of the best things I have ever eaten. They also have a version of this over fries...I've never had it but it sounds equally delicious.   If you haven't been here, do yourself a favour and get this dish."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss most of the time. I think their food is nothing special but what makes it addicting for me (and for other people from what I've seen) is the garlic sauce.  Their garlic sauce is so scrumptious. I've had Mediterranean food and none of the garlic food I've had then compares to their garlic sauce. I never order anything there without a side of extra garlic sauce on top of what they already give you. Their hit is chicken on the rocks or their shawarma which are both good. The food is pretty cheap for the amount they give you. I've had times where they gave me rice that was too hard (the ones you get from the very bottom of the pot which shouldn't be served in my opinion) ), times where they gave me chicken with bones still in it, times where they effed up my order and put hot sauce on my food when I specifically told them not to, and times where they put hot peppers on my boyfriend's shawarma and he's like deathly allergic to it. So in the end, it's really their customer service I have a problem with. People there just really don't listen enough. They mess up a lot of the orders. Also they charge you for literally everything there. Extra garlic sauce,  hot sauce on the side, bag that you didn't ask for. Like seriously how hard it is for them to ask if I wanted a bag or not rather than hiding the extra fee? The line up in that place is ridiculous too. The wait can take as long as an hour. And they can't handle very busy days. They get embarrassingly disorganized."}
{"text":"Foood is amazing!!   My go to see their chicken shawarmas. It's filled with flavour and it's super filling. It costs around $8 but it's super worth it.  Service is amazing, all the staff are friendly and welcoming. You could modify your food to your taste preference, don't be shy! It'll taste better that way."}
{"text":"Don't go. Save your time and money and your appetite. The place looks unkept. The chicken was dry and not edible. My kids called it cardboard. The rice was dry and clumpy. I can't erase the memories it was that bad. I purchased take out and ended up throwing out the food. Totally lost our appetite. Why do they serve patrons the dried up chicken in a heating plate that's probably been sitting out all day? They don't shave the meat off a fresh shawarma rotating skewer like other places do. They have one on display but I suspect it's fake and for show. Please don't go. While I don't like giving such poor reviews in this case it's completely warranted.  With so many other delicious shawarma places like MA VA ME and Sofra and hannas this place is a disgrace. It's a shame because we need a decent shawarma place further east."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I really like the cooks and people who prepare the food at Osmows. When I say this, I am referring to the men who slave away over the hot food, praparing and packaging it all for the long lines. They are always pleasant and friendly, even though it is 100 degrees back there and the work is never ending!  I cannot, however, say anything good at all about the female staff that work at the cash! Are they being held their against their will? Without pay? Is standing at a till taking orders the ABSOLUTE MOST DIFFICULT job they have ever done? If their eyes rolled back any further in their heads, they'd roll out.   I honestly despise coming to this place for that reason alone. I can't stand the sour attitudes of these women, should try and experience what the men have to do so that they will appreciate their one simple job a little more. Smiles are not necessary, just look at people when they speak to you and try not to let your exasperation be so outward.   Once again, hats off to the cooks, you guys rock! Just get rid of the winers on the cash and I'll visit more often."}
{"text":"this location never fails, meat and chicken always taste good and not too dried out (a problem I've noticed at other locations) AND they don't go cheap on the meat either. They're always pretty fast at giving you your food so you never wait too long, which is a super bonus."}
{"text":"The chicken is fresh and service is amazing. I consider myself a MiddleEastern food taster, and this is not an authentic Shawarma taste. It's not marinated the way we taste it in Lebanon, Turkey, Syria or Egypt. Places like Shawarma Max @ 4969 Yonge St, or Shawarma Empire & Ghadir @ Lawrence Ave East, for me are the authentic places for Shawarma..."}
{"text":"Maybe a 3.5  I love shawarma, and surprisingly had never been been to this chain. The 'on the rocks' is the most renown dish here, so I had to try it.  I wasn't too floored by it, but it was still pretty enjoyable. I can see the appeal of the creamy sauce, but I almost feel as though they put too much on. The hot sauce is legitimately HAWT, so I like that. It could improve by having the chicken be a bit crispier, and I prefer when the rice has lentils and fried onions in it.  Not bad for what you pay for, but I don't know if Osmow's sets the standard fro shawarma either."}
{"text":"I ordered salad and chicken shawarma. It was very good, a very big portion. The downside for me was that the hummus and pita are not included. I don't believe there were any turnips or pickles in the salad either. It was very overpriced for Shawarma. If you can't beat my favourite place Shawarma Empire, I probably wont't return!"}
{"text":"Osmow's is a Mediterranean fast food franchise that delivers par dishes. I came to this location with work colleagues for Friday lunch and it was extremely busy. Osmow's offers some Mediterranean food items, like Greek salad, to middle eastern delicacies, like chicken shawarma. When you place your order, you will be asked what spice level you want with your dish. I'm a person who likes suicide chicken wings and I found there extra hot sauce wasn't even equivalent to hot sauce for true buffalo wings. Their Greek salad was very bland as well as their rice and chicken. I would suggest coming to this place if you are looking for a quick chicken shawarma but you shouldn't bother coming for their chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Got the beef on the rocks with medium hot sauce. Delicious meat with garlic sauce and the rice was cooked perfectly. Didn't have to wait long at all, just 10 minutes or so. Even when there were many people ahead of me. I love how big the portions are. Had it for both lunch and dinner and was definitely satisfied. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Shawarma that is not authentic  Creepy male staff Filthy establishment Nowhere to dig in Never felt quite right after eating there"}
{"text":"Quick shawarma joint for dine in or take out. The twist is with their chicken and beef shawarma on the rocks, my favorite, which are meat on rice and/fries with house special white sauce. I add a little tahini and hot sauce too. The shawarma sandwich/roll are good and very filling too. Decent ambience for a quick bite. Their meat are flavorful and well cooked. I like their quick service and quality food at affordable prices. Recommended."}
{"text":"I am one of the few people who has tried Halal Guys first and not Osmow's.  WOW  What can I say, ordered the chicken on the rocks, and I must admit in this case the student has surpassed the teacher. I can see why so many locations of this brand is popping up left right and center.  That garlic sauce and hot sauce are marriage made in heaven!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the location off of Victoria Park.  My family and I are not picky eaters but we know good food when we have it.  They might of had an off day or got the recipe wrong, but the garlic sauce was disgusting.  I love garlic and I couldn't tolerate the taste nor the smell.  Had an upset stomach all night.  And the funny part is that the staff didn't seem to care that were were unhappy with our meal and still charged me when I ordered another dish in place of this one.  Will not return again!"}
{"text":"Great place to have shawarma. Much better than most of your typical shawarma places. Fast service. Staff is nice."}
{"text":"A colleague of mine suggested this place and just found out that there's one near our work. We car pooled it over there for lunch and I had high hopes since he hyped it up so much. Had the regular shawarma sandwich with a side of fries. He was right. It did not disappoint. It also comes in super size which is double the size of the regular. I have to admit that I was hanging on giving this place 3 stars but after some thought, 4 stars seems more appropriate. I will definitely come here again and try out the other dishes."}
{"text":"This places hands down the best Mediterranean I have had.... Chicken on the rocks is outstanding just caution on the hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"I love Osmows but this location has to be one of the WORST - HORRIBLE!!! I had two orders placed and instead received two surprise orders since they weren't made with the toppings i ordered.  When i ordered i told them two toppings I didn't want - and clearly, and when i received my shawarma those were the ONLY two toppings it had - mind blown! And that's just the beginning. The chicken tasted dry and did not seem fresh or to a certain quality that I'm used to in comparison to the many experiences I've had at other locations.  There were also three sharp pieces of crushed bone inside, and a piece of cartilage. I ordered hummus and tzatziki as well and there wasn't much of any, especially the tzatziki. The hot sauce seemed watered down and runnier than i recall, and it didn't have the same hot spicy flavour that it usually does - are they trying to stretch out the product by watering it down or something??  The wrap itself was over toasted and was cracking as you tried to eat it... And then there's just the way it was made; what a COMPLETE MESS!!! The toppings weren't even spread out evenly throughout the wrap - every 2-3 bites it was like eating a different wrap.. just horrible.  A regular and super were ordered and both seemed on the smaller side - i guess it's a good thing since it wasn't good anyway, less to eat. The second wrap had the same cracking issues, was missing two toppings, toppings again weren't spread out evenly (one bite was just lettuce!), and it had little to no hummus and tzatziki.  Both wraps clearly made like crap because there's no care, or just inexperience from poor training, management, etc.  The bathroom was also filthy and had a handful of fruit flies buzzing around, go figure!  This is based on several visits to multiple locations and again this probably has to be one of the worst, next to Mississauga (Dixie) location. My first visit and will be the only since they're completely incompetent at making quality shawarma's that are up to par with other locations (2 in Brampton & Steeles location)."}
{"text":"Been to many shawarma places, this place offers excellent prices, great quality food/ingredients, and simply the Best shawarma in the city of Brampton!"}
{"text":"Their slogan is \"we're making what you're cravin\"and apparently we're craving the sound of the guy banging on his plancha grill with his spatula all freaking night.  We're also craving a meal that doesn't look anything like the menu description.  Ordered Osmow's special and the veggie appetizer platter although the guy wasn't sure it was available until he checked with the other guy and in hindsight I can see why he didn't think it was available as I was probably the only person to ever order it.  Service is slow and that's ok if they're cooking food to order.  The veggie platter was a sad plate of food with a wilted \"fattoush salad\" with no tomatoes, one or two cubes of cucumber, and  lettuce.  It did come with baba ganoush and humus that was mediocre at best.  The tomato feta eggplant seemed to be eggplant and onion not a spec of tomato or feta in sight.  Osmows special chicken was especially dry and not memorable.  Best part was the salad.  I was happy to see that we finally have \"Mediterranean\" in the hood but will have to continue to head downtown to satisfy what I'm \"cravin\" next time.  There was a holiday tree in the corner so that tells me this place has been here for at least 8 months..."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews about this place and decided to check it out. First off they don't make their shawarama of the spit. They put their shawarma on the flat grill , so the result is a very pushy sometimes undercooked  meat. And all their dishes are swimming in sauce. They are better places my current fav is the one on derry and tenth line. Yum toasted pita off the spit!"}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence with this chain leaning towards NAY rather than YAY.  This is my second go around with Osmow's in as many months with my first visit being at the Hurontario and Courtney Park location where I had the special of the day that go around which was the shawarma dinner for a little over 9.50 after tax.  This time at the Lakeshore and Cawthra location I decided to go a little different.  My wife had the special which was a chicken shawarma pita with rice on the side and I had ordered the chicken on the rocks.  Chicken on the rocks is just rice with chicken on top and sauced and spiced to order, no veggies.  I had asked for medium and it was well hot enough quite like my last meal at the other location.  The service size container seemed sort of small.  I mean the amount of food inside was ok but I thought I was getting a square container not a half sized rectangular container.    This was the second time around at this chain I'm expecting more food than I actually received which for most Mediterranean places a LOT of food for serving sizes is the norm.  It's the norm for the place I frequent the most in Burlington (Zesty Pita) and it's also the same for the place on the Queensway near the Cineplex beside Burrito Boys which name eludes me right now as well as Villa Madina.    I get it that Osmow's is considered more affordable than some of these places but both times I've been the quantity and quality to me simply isn't as good as other Mediterranean places that are say just a few dollars more for both quantity and quality.    Osmow's seems to be really picking up, expanding and becoming popular.  I can't really say I'm happy with them overall though so I probably don't see myself going back any time soon.  As far as I'm concerned there are way better places to eat for just a little more $.  To me this is a take out place first and a sit down place third.  There is no second...  EDIT:  My friend who likes this chain showed me photos of HIS chicken on the rocks.  He received his in the SQUARE container while I received mine in a rectangular container.  The square container looks to be about double the size and if it's not double, visually it's much larger.  In other words I was for lack of a better term RIPPED OFF!  Anyway if this is how this CHAIN (yes, there are quite a few Osmow's out there) handle their consistency among stores well it's not consistent at all."}
{"text":"We just ordered from this place via UberEats and had the worst experience. Our pita was very old, their baba ghanoush is disgusting, they forgot to send our sauces. We paid an extra $5 for side sauces and they forgot all of them. Also the felafel was very cold and old."}
{"text":"Really good chicken shawarma. Chicken is tender and no over-burnt pieces. The sauce makes it moist, sweet, creamy and spicy. Small place and gets packed at lunch as lots of students from a local school come here. Come before noon or do take-out. Free parking available at the back of the store and you can enter through the back."}
{"text":"Really starting to question the hype over Osmow's... Went here on a weeknight. It was surprisingly busy and in comparison to other ones I've been to, much cleaner and modern looking. We got the Chicken on the Rocks and before ordering, the cashier asked if we would be willing to write them a review in exchange for a free drink. He said he'll give us a minute to do that as he prepared our meal. We ended up not doing this because it would defeat the integrity of a review...and I'm happy I didn't. On another note, they didn't specify whether it was supposed to be a good or bad review but without any experience, what would the review entail? It didn't take too long for our plate to finish but now that I think about it, for the reason that most of their items are drenched in sauce, it's difficult to tell whether the meat itself is up to standard. For all I know, they could be using the driest and oldest cuts.  I also ordered 4 falafels for less than $5 (if I recall correctly). All I remember was that it was a god deal. However, the falafels themselves were probably the worst ones I've ever had. It just didn't taste like a falafel. They were warm but tasted frozen because the consistency was very fine and gritty - it's difficult for me to describe but I do not recommend them. Moreover, they asked if I wanted sauce and I said sure. What I didn't know was the sauce did not pair with the falafel. I really think they gave me ranch sauce....who gives ranch sauce for falafels? It had a sour taste to it.  I do appreciate the service and willingness of the staff to up-sell and improve the reputation of the business. I don't appreciate the low means they (the business overall) use to achieve it...so it's a Os-No's for me."}
{"text":"I'm still \"on the rocks\" after trying the Chicken on the Rocks ($10). I have been dying to try this place for ages. Prior to coming here, I was familiar with its chicken on the rocks through my colleagues. Went to this place after a workout (counter productive but everyday is cheat day) around 8pm on a Sunday. The door was a bit problematic when we went in and when we were leaving but this could also be due to the cold, strong winds that day. However, this could be unsafe for younger children or individuals who cannot walk as fast, as the door will slam quickly behind you.  I ordered a large chicken on the rocks to try with my friend. The cashier asked if we wanted garlic and tzatziki sauce (I believe this is the sauce they drench the dish in). It was empty when we went in but shortly after placing our order, about 10 people entered. Guess we were lucky. For some reason, the place seemed \"unclean.\" This may be because of the decor. But personally, I try to not focus on the decor when trying new restaurants...you never know if you'll be surprised!  The meal came about 5-10 minutes later. There were 2 employees working through our dish and the 10 person line.  Visually, the dish looked appealing though it was just served in a styrofoam container. I have to say, it WAS delicious but, something more could have been done. This is a great option when you don't want the salad and sides...or if you just want to go full carnivore that day. The meat tasted a bit dry however, the sauce was able to mask this feature. The rice also seemed a bit cold/not as hot as it could be. Putting all of these parts together, it was still a wonderful meal. I would come back to try other dishes as the service was not terrible either."}
{"text":"Chicken on the sticks will forever be my guiltiest pleasure. Love the service and the food. Pro tip: you can get half sticks and half rocks. It'll blow your mind."}
{"text":"Delicious choices. Great for an inexpensive yummy meal. I go for low carb so the salad bottom is great. Very good portion for about $10"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place is so hyped. Although they are quite generous, its the most unauthentic shawarma there is. The sauces they include (with excess) are what give it the flavour people like. Customer service is also pure crap."}
{"text":"Osmow's is located in the middle row of businesses right outside the Hurontario/Courtney Park Cineplex (formally AMC).  This is a small place that seats around maybe 30 or so but the line for ordering can be sort of long and kind of disorganized depending on how many are in line the line really has no true form.  Orders are all in to-go styrofoam containers whether eat in or not it seems.  The menu is pretty simple it's Lebanese style shawarma with or without salad and/or fries with rice for plates.  You can have pitas and they also seem to have a version of Philly cheesesteaks available as well.  Today I went with two specials of the day which were chicken shawarma on rice with a side of salad.  The containers were about 50/50 salad and chicken on rice.  Here you have to order how spicy you want it.  I went with one mild for my wife and one medium for myself.  I wont' lie the medium was pretty spicy but I could handle the heat.  My wife wouldn't be able to eat medium but she was quite pleased with the mild.  Both specials came out to just over 19 bucks after tax.  Not a bad deal.  Portion wise considering it was a special it was decent.  I could have had more and I did because I ate what my wife didn't finish so I could try the mild as well as my medium.  There's definitely difference in spice level that makes me wonder if I could go higher than medium.  If you don't normally like spicy to the point of hot I'd recommend you stay away from medium and get mild or NONE for hot spice.  Perhaps next visit I'll go with the chicken on the rocks which is basically what I had minus the salad (chicken on rice, garlic sauce and choose your level of hot).  The food is good, decent for the price, portions but I've had plates that were more filling at Villa Madina or the local place near my work.  The next time I have a special I won't get the chicken shawarma if it's going to be that size because a container of being half salad while good isn't what I was expecting to get."}
{"text":"I went to this place since it was recommended   by a friend I ordered the Osmow's Special and the wait at this place is long and the shawarma ain't that great all I can say is that I had better."}
{"text":"This is food for when you are hungover and anything will do. For the price it was a large portion however it was overly rich. I was told there would be salad with ours - there wasn't. They ran out of all meats except chicken that night so the options were very limited to say the least.   I honestly didn't care for this place - I've had better rice and chicken meat while at paramount near erin mills or pita grill on dundas.   I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying Osmows. My friends always rave about it. So I decided for dinner I would grab a bite from there.   I ordered the famous chicken on the rocks. Which is basically Rice and chicken with tahini sauce and your spice level. I got mild with tzatziki sauce.   Once I placed the order, I sat down until my number was called. In about 5-8 mins, my order was ready. As I had my first bite, I noticed that there was more rice than chicken. The chicken wasn't cooked properly as well. Comparing this to my to go shawarma place, it wasn't the best.   I have had better shawarma than this, I mean the food wasn't bad but I personally refer more Chicken.   Overall, my experience wasn't all that bad."}
{"text":"So i went after seeing those other reviews.. but what an experience.  (1) the food is not tasty at all. I got chicken kabob and chicken daily special aka tv special but dude it's nothing. You can get much tasty food any plsce else.   So may be i got the wrong item but what I got was not good. (2) got yogurt / laban drink which was nothing but water..lol..i mean for $2.50 the el cheapo won't buy a better yogurt. (3) last but not least if you are a pakistani/Indian or bengali anybody who is brown .. from south asia please do NOT go here.  This establishment is run by some RACIST folks who are rude to certain ethnicities and nice to others. Or may be they just talk like that but my experience of asking for an extra sauce ended up in the bald middle eastern stalky short height guy yelling at me that we already gave you 4 sauces where I only had 2 and I had ordered two platters.  So he was wrong there but if you know about middle eastern folks they could never be wrong lol.. now I sound like I'm stereotyping but hey he started it... Guys just be aware... don't believe the folks coming in and going out... May be spend a couple more bucks some place where you can dine without a racist and discriminatory experience."}
{"text":"I remember when it first opened up at this location...As my high school was nearby I would go quite often. Over the years I noticed they starting to get stingy with the quality and meat..."}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks is what you want to order here. Flavorful shawarma without the sauce, and even better with the sauce. This dish is basically chicken shawarma with just rice and sauce. No salads. So it's quite heavy.  Like most other middle eastern places, they offer falafels and wrap versions of their plates. I haven't tried anything else since their chicken on the rocks is so good."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch and ordered a philly cheese steak pita. Felt overall the place was a bit underwhelming considering how much my friends hyped it up. The service and interior were fine everything was clean and professional.  In addition to the philly cheese I also got fries with garlic on them. The meat tasted fine and they're hot sauce is definitely hot no question my only issue was that the wrap fell apart halfway as there were tears in the pita, and that it came with barely any fries. Considering I paid 14$ for the combo o did not find the meal (as people would say) worth..."}
{"text":"I ordered a Beef Shawarma to share and asked for it to be cut in half.  I asked for all the toppings except for turnips to be added in and just a little hot sauce (toppings included lettuce, tomatoes, onion, hot peppers, parsley, pickles, and green olives).  The Beef Shawarma was plentiful and tasted great.  The hummus made it juicy with all the vegetables in it too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I was at Osmow's (on college) earlier today, and right now, my stomach is killing me.   I've been to other Osmow's locations in the past and I like the food. It's great! But there is no excuse for neglecting food safety practices.   There were two staff members, one was heading out for break. So there was only one person who took the orders at the register, and prepped the food. I paid with cash, he gave me back the change, and proceeded to make the shawarmas without any gloves. I did not see him washing his hands. While waiting for the swarmas on the grill,  he wiped the counter with a tea towel, and wiped his hands with it and put it aside. Then proceeded to pack up the shawarmas.  Entire process, no gloves. It doesn't matter how good the food is...I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is a local staple - I must devour one a month - but the place is getting way too busy these days - don't come on Fridays from 6-8pm! it will take about 20 or so minutes if you do great chicken shwarmas, one of the best even chicken on the rocks (over rice with their special seasoning and sauce) always rock!"}
{"text":"Osmow's is a chain and I've been to two others one on Courtney Park and Hurontario and the other on Lakeshore near Cawthra both in Mississauga.    It's a stand in line, order, give your name and get up and grab your food place.  At other Osmow's I've been to all food is served in take out containers whether eat in or take out.  This location actually gives you real plates which is good because they're not wasting styrofoam.  They only have plastic utensils instead of normal flatware.    I've had the chicken shawarma and chicken on the rocks and both time I found the sauce to be too rich.  You are also asked the level of \"hot\".  I've asked for medium and while I can take my fair share of hot their medium would be hot on other's scales of hotness.    This time around I thought I would change it up and go with the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  I asked for a Philly cheese steak but I ended up asking what cheese they use.  The person taking my order wasn't sure and had to ask his boss.  He came back and said it was mozzarella.  Once I heard that I decided not to get it.  If it was American, cheez whiz, provolone I would have been fine but for me a Philly is never made with mozzarella.  It's like making a pizza with cheddar cheese, it's just not the same.  I ended up just getting the chicken on the rocks again.  The sauce is almost like Miracle Whip as opposed to any other shawarma place I've been.  I'm not that keen on it but it does balance out the drizzled hot sauce.  I found this location to not be as hot as the Mississauga locations.   The bottom line is a plate of chicken and rice is 10 dollars after tax which isn't too expensive but really Osmow's food I find to be not as good as just about any fresh shawarma place out there.  This chain has grown pretty quick as they have many locations now but it doesn't change the fact that their food is subpar compared to the just even the last two places I had shawarma (Zesty Pita in Burlington and Zagro's Pita in Vaughan)."}
{"text":"Came here to try out something new. Good call! The food looks and smells amazing! The place is clean and the servers are very friendly. The type of restaurant is you go up to the counter and order for at and the put it together for you there. Perfect for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Not usually in this area but my wife wanted something familiar. Popped in for the Chicken on the Rocks & Beef Shawarma (never had here before). The former was close enough to what we have at other locations, however, the Shawarma was a huge disappointment. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Never coming here again. Found hair in my shawarma wrap twice. Also, saw the man who was assembling my shawarma also touching the cash register and handling money. He didn't even wash his hands.  Don't know how they passed their food and safety inspection."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for delicious tasting mediterrean food. I ordered the chicken schwarma sandwich and was totally impressed by the portion, flavour and best of all the value. It was $5.09 plus tax for a regular chicken schwarma and you can choose your spice level. The sauce was amazing! I ordered 5 chicken schwarmas and it was also pretty busy for a Sunday night but they were able to process all orders efficiently.  Definitely coming back here to try their other menu items if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible ! I've been cominghere past 3 weeks 4 times. SOO GOOD. Great. Money for your buck too! Food super fresh and delicious... they have goood deals. Don't get me started on how good there fries are! Coming from someone who hates fries ! Love it here so filling"}
{"text":"Shawarma is mediocre compared to many places I've had before, not too much to say here besides that. The hot sauce they use is also very poor and has little flavour besides the heat it brings, which is the bane of any hot sauce foodie. Save yourself the 10 dollars and go to one of the many other shawarma joints around the area."}
{"text":"I really do not see the hype about Osmos. I ordered a chicken something sub and it was soggy and mushy. The shawarma chicken was very well done but the preparation of the sub was gross; badly assembled and badly wrapped. It was not only my order, the same goes for my friend's order as well. That is about it for this review. Nothing good to say."}
{"text":"Usually, I am not a pita or shawarma kind of person at all - until I tried one here at Osmow's. Their meat is seasoned perfectly and the garlic sauce is what ties it all together. If you've never tried a shawarma, you need to pay Osmow's a visit! Their chicken on the rocks is also pretty damn awesome too."}
{"text":"I really like osmows but I gave it a 2* because they recently changed their takeout containers to a substantially smaller container than it used to be. So, if you get a chicken on the rocks (chicken, rice, the \"secret\" sauce & Tabasco) you get half the portion for the same price. To top it off, the guy preparing it was measuring it and gone are the days where they piled it up so you had so much for lunch and dinner! Disappointing osmows!! Your customers enjoyed the food and the portion size was the added bonus! A lot of my coworkers visited this location but will no longer because now it is overpriced for what it is; chicken and rice. Ps the new container is cardboard and it was soggy once we got to our office and the food tasted like cardboard too  /:( osmows is known for their cheesy decor, fast service, their secret sauce smothered in Tabasco sauce. Booo you"}
{"text":"The food is OK and the service is OK. The taste of the chicken is never consistent and for the odd time you may get a bone in your food. The portions are definitely worth it for the price you pay."}
{"text":"The food is both cheap and excellent, but the customer service is what really drove me to give such a poor review. Never have I met such rude lady working a customer service position (Lakeshore Location).  I understand if someone is having a bad day, but I went on three different occasions, and I have nothing good to say about her. She is as dull as it gets, and I don't know if she knows what a joke (or smile) is. When I eat out, I go for the experience as much as the food, and she honestly puts me in the worst moods.   On the bright side, you don't need to bring extra money for tips when you visit the Lakeshore location of Osmow's."}
{"text":"Kinda slow on service but food is delicious. Even if you order before pick up they don't prepare the food until you arrive. Do get the chicken shwarma dinner! You can get a dinner size and they give you lots of salad which is delicious. It is amazing! They pack the salad full of feta and olives too! Very delicious quality! Always busy, don't go if you are in a rush! Also, the \"special sauce\" is mayo in a bottle, well at least I saw the worker filling the bottle from a larger mayo container. Use lightly!"}
{"text":"Food average. Much better shwarma elsewhere. Incompetent staff working the orders. Can't handle more than 4 orders in a row.  Not 4 customers...just 4 shwarma. That's what gives this place a 1 star.  Need the service with the food.  Staff needs some basic training and order management lessons."}
{"text":"I've been eating Osmows for 5 years and this location is by far the worst I've ever eaten. The staff are so slow as ever and they completely got my whole order wrong while lying to my face that it was right. No brain at all when it comes to placing food in a bag... (Obviously shawarma does not go at the bottom) and terrible wrapped shawarmas that broke on both ends so it was just a disgusting mess! Would not recommend this franchise to anymore!"}
{"text":"WORST SHAWARMA I HAVE EVER EATEN! Tried out this place on Rutherford today with my buddy for lunch. I'm always eager to try out new shawarma as it's a great lunchtime meal. Upon entering, the store was clean and the service was good. I ordered the beef shawarma pita. The beef was tasteless, the toppings didn't seem fresh at all, and their hot sauce just their beef had zero flavour! The best part of my meal was the pita, which was toasted nicely. Only time I'll be coming back here is if it a weekday so I can give their toppings another chance as I came on a Sunday and see if their chicken shawarma has more life to it."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a Shawarma in Brampton East.  Portion size is fair and staff are friendly as well.  Must say though that it seems as though staff turnover was high when it first opened a few years ago so the consistency was missing.  Not a huge issue today, but depending on the \"Shawarma Artist\", your quality can still vary by a bit.    Still though, worth a try for you if you haven't been here to be your own judge."}
{"text":"The service is awesome for a newly opened store. The portions are also great for the price and employees are extremely friendly. The owners and their team are doing an amazing job! Recommend it 10/10"}
{"text":"Oh yes! OMG yes Yes YES!   That's it yes that's it. Right there !  Great! Now that we have parked the car we got to try our first lunch meal at Osmow's.  I must say today, the rice was perfectly cooked and the chicken was juicy and moist.  The spicy chili sauce was so bountiful that when asked for very spicy. She gave me a look that said \" You serious girl? You're going for extra spicy? ... Oh Kayyyy.. Just sayin that's all. \". Then she slathered on the chili sauce which resulted in one of the finer goozle burning lunches I could think of in recent memory.  It cured my cough for the day until the next day.  This is a great place to get Mediteranean food and if you happen to come on a good day, the food is very good.  I have been informed that they don't always have good days and you can get days when the chicken is a bit dry or the rice lacklustre in taste.  One thing is for sure. The spicy sauce that could be spectacular on your tongue and later a burden on your bottom hole.  Who cares when it's so good now!  They have a slogan \"We're makin what your cravin\"  The Tuesday special was just that.  Chicken Kebab with rice and salad that could only be better described than from their website at http://www.mrosmow.com.  \" Tuesday Special. Chicken Kebab; chunks of chicken breast marinated in Osmow's signature Mediterranean spices and oregano herbs grilled to perfection with green peppers and onions and topped with our Osmow's famous sauces. Comes with a garden salad and your choice of rice\"  My only contribution as to how much I liked this was the portion for me was very large and the spice, well, it was hot in a good way.  That's the way I like my........  We were all surprised at the portion size and the decent price.  The place was certainly busy with lots of deliveries being picked up too.  I am giving this place a 4 stars for todays performance.  Thanks to our work mate for showing us this place.  On another note, we had another work mate from Montreal who had to say that it doesn't quite compare to what they have there.  I can't speak for him but I can be sure that with the traffic we saw coming in and out. This place has earned it's spot for one of our lunchtime favourite spots in this area.  I think I gained a few pounds just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"The shittiest shawrma place ever!!!  Why this place even exists here i have no idea.  The worst service.  They will easily forget ur food if u don't constantly remind them. And when it actually comes its got no meat in there.  If u want to come to a restaurant to starve this would be the perfect spot for it!!! Completely incompetent staff"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Osmow's for YEARS and had the worst experience today. I ordered a chicken on the rocks and opened it when I got home to NO sauce on it and like 5 pieces of chicken. Not impressed.  I also ordered a salad (no dressing was put on it) and two falafel sandwiches (bland and no hot sauce like I asked).   I understand the restaurant is busy but there were three people there when I was there. I am very disappointed and will not be returning. When I tried to call to complain, nobody picked up the phone."}
{"text":"One of those places that is busy because lots of people live near it.   There are disadvantages that make competitors better when ordering a wrap/pita: -you have to pick your toppings when you pay up front by a list on the till rather than a menu above/display case -which leads to you not being to easily specify how much of what you want because it is prepared behind the scenes and not in front of a display with all the toppings you can look and request -didn't taste as good as other places -and the wait was longer than other places, like 10-15 minutes for 1 wrap."}
{"text":"I would give this a 4 as service is sort of slow but is reasonable due to the rush of people. But the food was very good, I wish they gave extra garlic sauce on the side... their garlic sauce is amaZing!! I had vegetarian shawarma and it was full of flavour"}
{"text":"Shawarma's are always good for a quick lunch or a meal. Osmow's does the Shawarma justice. You can order them normal , mild, spicy or burning hot and its actually pretty spicy. Typically this has the Shawarma on rice and then with salad  and all. Its a good place if you are looking for a protein packed meal because they have that special order. If you are around the area to recycle your stuff at the Recycling Center stop here for a bite. Its right next to it and fulfilling after all that hard work. Staff is friendly, place is clean and they have regular deals."}
{"text":"This location is a very busy location as it is close to Humber College and Guelph Humber. It is located In a small plaza (parking can be tight closest to the Osmow's). Overall, it has a very fast food feel. It took us about 6 minutes to pick up our order as there were quite a few people in front of us. The price is adequate and you get very big portions, not to mention that the food is quite flavourful and tastes fresh. The hot sauce is actually spicy and the staff were super busy with all the customers or cooking in the back. I would definitely order from here again as I definitely want to try the falafel plate."}
{"text":"Not busy at all, quick service. Got the special, chicken on the rocks w/ side salad (7.97). Made sure to get extra special sauce before leaving, the dude drenched it and was so nice about it. Definitely won't be the last time I go here!"}
{"text":"If anyone had been to this location im sure you were probably a bit discouraged when seeing the line.  Well in my eyes when there is a super huge line this has to mean that Osmow's is doing something right... and that they are.  I have never seen a team on employees work so fast to ensure the line moves quickly.  So although the line seems huge it actually moves very fast.  The food is super fresh and very tasty.  All around great food and great service."}
{"text":"My friend kept raving about Osmow's and piqued my curiosity so I decided to grab takeout for lunch. I ordered mild chicken on sticks for myself and hot chicken on the rocks for my bf.   There was a good amount of meat to fries ratio and the sauce on top was pretty good. I only managed to finish half before I was full. My bf eats everything and has no opinion on food whatsoever. To him, everything is \"okay\" but when I asked him how was his food, he actually replied with \"it was good\".   The service here was friendly and pretty quick, probably because I came one after opening on a Sunday. The food here is good and I will definitely come back. The only difference is I'll probably get a shawarma plate or half chicken on rocks and half salad next time... while the chicken on the sticks was good, I got bored of the starch and protein combo pretty quick."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.   I got the shawarma special. It was $7.57 +tax. It's a pita wrap filled with chicken shawarma and your choice of lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, green olives, hot peppers, and some others. Also an option of a some sauces. You have a choice of fries or rice. It also comes with a Coke (no substitutions). It's a very decent price for what you get.   The fries took a bit long to come out but it was worth the wait. I would highly recommend and I'm definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"Definitely the best tasting Shawarma I've ever had, and a great size too!  I got the regular sized chicken shawarma, and there wasn't a single thing wrong with it. No weird/chewy pieces of chicken, fresh veggies and lots of options of veggies to choose from too, a mild hot sauce that wasn't too overpowering, and the grand finale.....the garlic sauce, which has got to be one of the most amazing sauces my taste buds have ever had the pleasure of meeting!!!   It's really what differentiates this shawrma from its competitors....not too garlicy, not too runny or thick, and compliments the other ingredients of the shawarma perfectly.   Didn't have to wait long to get my order either, and the staff was very friendly, they'll cal out your name when they finish making your food. There's a good amount of seating, I went at lunch time and easily snatched a table, so nothing to worry about in the respect.  If you are a fan of shawarma's, and are prepared to taste the most amazing garlic sauce of life, then pay a visit to Osmow's!!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean food definitely was really good and I like the option that you can get half of it on rice and the other half on fries I was a little disappointed that there was such a large difference in price between the chicken and the beef I asked the lady to give me half-and-half and she still charge me for the higher price of course which was about three dollars more which is ridiculous for shredded beef. It was delicious but the red sauce was a little too strong. It's definitely good but can not compare at all to the hello guys"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst pita establishment. The service and food are TERRIBLE.  If I could give 0 or less stars I would...... do your stomach a favour....PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service there is VERY SLOW.  I decided to try this place out today (Friday November 4th 2016).  I arrived at around 1:12 PM.  The restaurant was quite busy.  By the time I stood in line and placed my order, a few minutes had passed.  My receipt is stamped 1:17 PM.  I then stood and waited for my name to be called.  I had ordered a super sized chicken shawarma sandwich.  At 1:41 PM I witnessed them put together my sandwich and put it on the grill. (24 minutes after I placed my order).  My name was finally called at 1:45 PM!  That is a full 28 minutes after I had placed my order (and over half an hour since I entered the restaurant).  I realize that it was the lunchtime rush, but I doubt anyone wants to waste that much time waiting for a sandwich.  I was not the only one frustrated by the excessive wait times.  The staff seemed to have trouble tracking what food was for what order.  There is a very obvious deficiency in their order process.    As far as I am concerned, if they cannot supply me with my food in a timely manner, then they should not just take my money and make me wait.  I will not go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Big portion of food but nothing that stands out. Pricing is in line with what you get. Warning, the hot sauce is really hot for someone like me that only eats it occasionally.   About 13$ for a special chicken meal with rice and a salad which is really basic and tasteless. No drink included"}
{"text":"Place doesn't look like much but the food is amazing! The osmow's special (chicken marinated with peppers, onions and pineapple) is my new obsession. Also their Philly sauce is good as, if not better than McDonalds Big Mac Sauce.   Very friendly service as well! Feels like I'm eating at a family restaurant rather than a chain."}
{"text":"Pre-ordered and yet still had to wait 40 min for the food. They didn't start making it until we arrived. Awful service, and the food quality has also gone down. Osmow's was once a favourite, but it really isn't worth it! This is the last time we eat here!"}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday for lunch. There are lots to choose from off the menu and all sounds pretty good. I ended up taking out the Tuesday special.   I thought everything here was pretty good. The salad, with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green peppers all tasted fresh and crisp. The rice had a light flavor to it. Chicken marinated in its Mediterranean spices and herbs had me wanting more. Yes, I wanted more chicken. The menu says \"chunks of chicken...\". I did not see or get \"chunks\" of chicken.  Overall, I loved the flavors and the meal, but was disappointed with the amount of chicken I got."}
{"text":"There shawarma is different than most places and there quantity is generous. There chicken in the rocks is really good. The larger one is really big so make sure your really hungry if you order one. There garlic sauce is good make sure you put little extra"}
{"text":"Every experience is the same. The same great attitude and enthusiasm is there, the quick service, very affordable, and the food is amazing! Absolutely love their chicken on the rocks!! If I want Mediterranean food, osmows is my first choice, second, and basically my only choice."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry and rice was hard! osmos losing their touch! Happened to me twice now and I will not be giving it a third time to mess up my lunch."}
{"text":"There have been so many raving reviews about Osmow's recently that I decided I would finally check this place out. There is limited seating here as it's meant to be a small and casual place to come for food with a lot of people probably coming in and out for take-out. I dined in and ordered the chicken on the rocks, rice topped with chicken shawarma and special sauce. The food was okay, but the portion was a bit small compared to other chicken shawarmas (also cheaper, for $8.75). I didn't really enjoy it though - I didn't like the taste of the special sauce that much and thought the dish was overall a bit plain. When I go out for chicken shawarmas, I look for a zest of flavour and delicious sauces, and I just didn't find that here. Also, the service was okay as well but nothing really stood out.  Not worth the hype in my opinion. I don't think I'd come back - I'd much rather go to the closest Pita Land instead!"}
{"text":"Tried the beef shawarma and it was good.  Sauces were layered on top of the meat and rice which was nice but unfortunately for me I asked for extra hot lol  Was still very good and I will be ordering again to try it without my eyes watering  The chicken shawarma with the fries also looked interesting but I was too full to even try a bite"}
{"text":"It's very hard for them to understand what you want in your shawarma. I've been here 3  times and 3 times they messed up my order. The 2 times they did not provide me with hot sauce (in the shawarma or on the side), and the other time they forgot to add a topping I asked for on my shawarma. I don't like how the fact you cannot see what they are adding and not adding onto your food.  Place is always busy, the shawarma was a big on the soggy side (lettuce felt too soggy) but the toppings and meat were fresh other than that. Too bad they don't understand on several occasions and for the watered lettuce, place would be great."}
{"text":"Rice was cold, so was the chicken. I've ordered chicken on the rice from a location in Milton and it was so much better compared to this."}
{"text":"I was early for an appointment I had so I decided just to pop in here to get something small as I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. I decided to go with a medium Greek salad and I have to say it was pretty good. Kind of pricey though--for a salad and water came up to almost $10. I originally wanted a tabouleh salad but the person cashing me out informed me that it wasn't prepared as yet which was a bummer.   As for the place itself, a light brighter and bigger than what it looks like on the outside. Was very clean and the person cashing me out was friendly. I'd try this place again!"}
{"text":"Beef shawarma ...  Not so good. There wasn't much flavor and their garlic sauce was horrible."}
{"text":"I'm probably their best customer! Chicken on sticks, little spice is my absolute favourite thing on their menu. I'm addicted. The service is also amazing which makes every experience even better :)"}
{"text":"Came in for my usual chicken on sticks with little spice and extra garlic sauce. The location is bigger than the Scarborough one, there is a seating area and also a washroom!  the service was friendly and the place was very clean.  It's awesome that Ajax has an Osmow's now!"}
{"text":"Osmows makes a Shawarma the way God would. Okay, maybe that goes a bit too far.... but I don't know what all these other people are saying... Osmows is amazing. Last time I went it wasn't super amazing... it was just good, but that's what happens when you've got a line up of 20 people. Places with line ups = amazing.   Very reasonably priced too. Just remember one thing when you look at the reviews below... people are more inclined to write when they want to complain... not when they're happy. Heck, I'm only writing good stuff because I signed up for yelp a few minutes ago."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and not sure I'll be going back again...   Everytime I go there, they have a massive amount of chicken rotating on the spit...  But when I order, rather than shaving chicken off the rotisserie, they reheat some old pieces on the grill. So the chicken is never fresh. Is that pile of chicken rotating there even real? Maybe it's plastic?   Oh, and I don't like how they prepare food with their bare hands. Completely lost my appetite after having my Pita prepared with hands that a moment earlier was scratching arse. PUT SOME GLOVES ON!!!   Much preferred the old Pitalicious. Better food, cheaper prices, and nicer staff..."}
{"text":"I've been to few other osmows around Mississauga/Oakville. Don't come to this location - the food is cold, dried up, and the service is terrible.   I ordered a large chicken on the rocks - here is what I got. Compare this to the same order in other locations, Streetsville, Oakville... Etc. They filled a quarter of the box and the size was a small at best. When I asked if they had reduced their portions, they looked lost and seemed to had no idea what I was talking about.   Not spending $12 here for lunch when I can elsewhere to get something more and get treated better. What a disappointment - not coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma place in Mississauga, and also the best Osmows of the franchises. It always busy, but the wait is worth it. The food is always good and satisfying. The chicken shawarma is my favorite. I like their filafil too, although I have had better in the city. But the sauce they put in their wraps is heavenly. It does drip and is messy, but oh so delicious.."}
{"text":"Amazing to discover this location so close to home ... only a 5 minute drive!   Chicken on the rox is a personal favourite that i always order.    What is most surprising is that they have options for the level of spicy from zero to suicide.    Quite respectable indeed.   This location is pretty busy from what I saw, but the food was coming out quickly nonetheless.   As compared from the other location I have grown accustomed to visiting; food is consistent and flavorful but a little stingy from the other place who fills or right to the top.    All in a a great local eatery."}
{"text":"Ordered here a number of times - chicken on the rocks is my favourite.  Spicy of course.  You can choose between hot and mild.   The spicy sauce and the white sauce are very delicious but the only thing that is left to be desired is the packaging because it doesn't manage to hold all the deliciousness in properly and when transporting a number of orders - convenience is most important."}
{"text":"Chicken on rocks.. Wow!  Spicy expectations have been met.  I got half a serving from a colleague and I was full by the end.   Decent sized portions but it was taken to go so it ended up fairly messy with all the sauces.    Regardless I would order and visit sometime for myself."}
{"text":"don't know why it's always packed. this place used to be good 3 years ago, now it's garbage...the chicken has no taste...it tastes like boiled chicken...there are little bones and nasty fat pieces in the shawarma...chicken is burnt and old...shawarma always blows up! this is the worst shawarma joint!! like I said it used to be good...not anymore"}
{"text":"Not very consistent with their food...Sometimes the chicken is cook perfectly but sometimes it seems to be very undercooked.. The level of spice is never consistent too.. You tell them to make it spicy, but instead its either very spicy or just mild"}
{"text":"This place was honestly not that great, does not live up to the hype, Tarboosh makes much better shawarma"}
{"text":"Love the suicide super falafel with all toppings.   Only downside is the wait and how crowded it can get inside."}
{"text":"A very disappointing customer service. I update my previous review since twice i have had bad experience with this location. One time chicken on rocks given to me all cold. Now when ask to put lettuce on top of chicken rocks they put it on one side. Before they used to spread it.  This has become like any other location of osmows - with bad customer service."}
{"text":"The food is good. The dish 'chicken on rocks' is simply amazing. The resturant itself is cramped up os space and the hosts are not that friendly. 3 star because the food is one of the best around."}
{"text":"Walking in, the place looks nice. Just a casual joint with plenty of seating.   Placing an order was the easy part, however the staff could do with a lesson in customer service. Having not been to Osmows in a year or so, I had forgotten how to place an order. I was impolitely directed to the board or to the signs taped to the register that show the spice levels; 0 amount of interaction with the staff, yet only to give me a number and be told to wait until the order is ready.  After my order was finished, I asked for a bag and was impolitely tossed a bag by the employee. I understand you may have a tough day, but that wasn't very nice at all.  Onto the food. I ordered chicken on the rocks. The flavour was there and it reminded me of having it a while back. It tasted absolutely delicious... But I asked for medium heat, what I got was not medium.  If asked to return to this Osmows location, my answer would be possibly not. If asked to recommend this to a friend, that would be met with another possibly not.  If the staff improve themselves, I may consider re-reviewing this place, but as of right now, I can not say for a fact that I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks had me drooling. The portions are HUGE! You could feed an entire family with just one portioned tray of food and let me tell you, this place is busy.  If youre ever in the area and swing by for lunch, make sure you know where the lines are because they're all over the place. They could however do with a little bit more organization and not have every employee behind the grill but have some floaters making sure everyone gets their orders promptly and making sure their number is called."}
{"text":"I always ordered their sandwiches so this is the first time ordering a dinner.  The dinner I got was the beef shawarma dinner and it was good.  I noticed that they give you larger portions when you dine in.    As for fast food places go, this is a descent place.  It is fast and the food tasted great.  I also got the sandwich to share and I noticed the pita bread started falling apart a bit.  Overall, not too bad, and I will come back again."}
{"text":"Great chicken  hot sauce is actually hot. 6 dollars swarm including tax love this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. The restaurant is so dirty and you can tell they try to mask the flavour of the nasty chicken with the sauces. They give you a plate with flavourless chicken that's probably days old and cover it with so much sauce hoping no one will notice. Will never come back again, do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"2 stars because the service was prompt during a super busy hour, but my oh my was the shawarma such a stretch from authenticity. I got the chicken platter and the chicken was bland, the rice was yellow with no other seasoning that I could see and bland as well, the garlic sauce was super sweet (why ) and the Fattoush filled a whole rectangle take out container and was disappointing. I've eaten quite a few shawarma plates in my time and this is definitely the worst. It's not inedible though, but it lacks the depth and flavour of a good shawarma place. I guess I expected more from a place in Scarborough, since there are much better shawarma joints not too far south. Also it was $15, which, if you look at how huge the serving is, is justifiable, but considering the taste it isn't.   The others are right, watch out for that hot sauce. If you can take heat decently but don't want to overpower your dish, I'm sure a mediumish spice level will be just fine."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the most popular shawarma joint in the city. There are a variety of locations but I feel like this one is the busiest. There will regularly be a line that crowds this narrow Streetsville unit.  I personally don't find it to be very special and prefer many other shawarma joints to it, including Pita Nutso which is just a few units down and much quieter. My favourite is the Osmow's special which is a typical chicken shawarma with pineapples. They have a super size, which I feel is overkill, as the regular sized pita is already large to begin with.  Customers frequently order the chicken on the rocks as well, which is just shawarma topped with garlic/hot sauce on rice. It's delicious in small portions, but I feel like it's just too much for me.  I've ordered the falafel side order one time and the falafels were quite dry, so I'd stick to the core offerings here."}
{"text":"Meh, it's Osmow's.  It's definitely still a shawarma powerhouse considering the long lineups, but I think their food could benefit from cooking their chicken a little more, using fresh pitas, and not overdoing the sauce as a default.   However, it's unlikely that Osmow's will make any changes as they continue to expand at an impressive pace.  Decent food, it's just not for me. I prefer Pita Nutso or Pita and Grill in the west GTA."}
{"text":"I've come to a few different locations for chicken or beef on the rox- their rice is usually undercooked and the food in general isn't great quality, more like street food.. it's decent when you have no options available but I wouldn't choose to go back here anymore.."}
{"text":"Read a few reviews, some bad some good. Some bad about customer service... Which I can understand.   Personally I just ordered through Uber eats. I have ever actually been to the physical location so I cant speak on their service.   The food was very good, cant say a bad thing. Had great arabic flavours and really enjoyed it!   I will for sure order again, and of course uber eats is effortless!"}
{"text":"This is my go to cheap shawarma place.  I come here when I have a craving for shawarma. It is the best shawarma I've had?...No...but it is still delicious and it satisfies my shawarma craving.  When I go here I usually get the chicken shawarma half/half. I ordered this the first time because I couldn't decide between rice or fries....this way I didn't have to choose because you get both. I ended up loving it so much that now it's all I order from here. The rice is flavourful, the fries is always hot and crispy, the chicken is plentiful, and the garlic sauce is delicious.  I order a large half/half and it's enough to share with 2 people without feeling hungry after. Being able to control the amount of spiciness is nice.... I tried medium spice and it was too spicy for me so I got little spice and it was just right.  The eating area is very small. It's mostly a takeout place. The service is fast and friendly.   I would recommend the half/half since it's the only thing I've tried here but honestly everything looks delicious."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean cuisine from Israeli to Turkish, Greek, and Lebanese. Went to this place last week to order a chicken shawarma sandwich at 8-8:30 pm and while placing order I was asked multiple times \"what?\" since staff wasn't listening to me.  She told me what the total was and I decided to slide in my card instead of the habit of tapping and I noticed that pin pad display shows about a buck more than what she said. When I asked why, she said \"oh, this is the transaction fee when you use credit card\" and when I said I could use my debit she said it's the same fee applied!!  Usually businesses warn you either verbally prior to the pin pad operation or a message prompts on the pin pad about extra fees. To me this was nothing but stealing from customers and I feel really sad for Sheridan students living in the area that have no choice but complying"}
{"text":"Huge shawarma chain on the rise in the gta with a brand new location in the heartlake plaza. These guys know what they're doing when it comes to making shawarma. With super flavourful rice, salad and chicken!  Weekly specials which make you say \"why not have shawarma 2 days in a row!\" I got this whole plate for $8.45 plus tax on friday, regularly $10.75. One of my favourites. Always people going, so you know it must be good."}
{"text":"I hate to agree with the other reviews...but I do.  We were very disappointed with the quality of the food. It is unfortunate  because the staff was really nice. However, the nicest staff in the in the world could not make up for the fact the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"The mild large shawarma is the best  I've ever had and for $7 its a lot of food"}
{"text":"I believe this is a newer location because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. Very fast \"grub\" food if that's what you're in the market for. I believe they are one of the first, if not the first establishments to offer \"chicken on the rocks (rice)\" and \"chicken on sticks (French fries)\" in Mississauga. Not many places have just the chicken with garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce on a bed of rice or fries. It's great for students on a budget or if you're in the mood for a fast shawarma. I haven't tried the Philly cheesesteak yet but my friends recommend it. Their baklava is sold in logs and not mini pieces which makes it harder to eat but worth the $2.15. I bought three and two were on the dry and crunchy side while only one was decadent."}
{"text":"That chicken on the rocks be addicting as heck and working my way up to their extra hot sauce lines. If you like a challenge, then definitely try the suicide (actual suicide - unlike what most bars boast about their sauces).  the shawarma is pretty great too, but I'm more of a rice person."}
{"text":"It was late morning and my girlfriend and I were on our way to Square One to do some shopping when we saw an advertisement for OsMow's.  Since we had no lunch plans and it was nearby, we decided to check out the restaurant.   Although Osmow's is more of a grab and go place than a sit down and eat place, it was not busy when we arrived and we decided to eat there.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap combo with fries and soft drink.  My girlfriend ordered a Shawarma combo with salad and a soft drink.  I liked the fact that Osmow's lets customers customize the topping in their Shawarma wrap.  Other than the wrap and the chicken, I got to choose my own veggies (lettuce, tomato, pickles and purple turnips) and sauces (tahini, garlic and mild on the hot sauce).  Its a good feature and I think a lot of competitors who sell shawarmas also do this.   It was not busy when we ordered, and we received pretty good customer service.  There was only two staff working so I imagine the restaurant can be a bit understaffed if a lot of customers visit and it gets busy.    The Shawarma combo was tasty and very filling. I left satisfied that I got a lot of food and good value for my money.  I recommend you try Osmow's if you're in the area, on a budget and looking for a quick grab and go place to eat.  3.3 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This place generally has great food, but the customer service is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"One large takeout container has enough food for 2 people.  Consider asking for the tahini, hummus, and hot sauce on the side.   Protein serving is generous if you need that fix.  Flavours aren't deep but the portion size compensates for it. Definitely a take out joint."}
{"text":"I bought regular chicken on the rocks the guy just put one spoon of rice and chicken. It seem a lot however it is so less. It was waste of money I prefer Scarborough location they at least give you more."}
{"text":"Went during the 'Happy Hour' were there is an option for either $1.00 for a combo (which includes a schizle of Fri) or a bottle of water. Whether this qualifies as a happy hour perk is a bit subjective, however I took advantage of the former. When you order, you have the option to choose both complementary toppings and pay for toppings, which is a bit different from other, similar establishment in which sauces that would naturally complete a sandwich is billable. I would recommend the folks double check that practice, but if it works for them as a revenue generator that is their choice. Just be careful when billing extra for what would complete a sandwich at most other shawarma focused establishments.   I was pleased when I forgot to add turnips and asked if I could add them last minute, and the kind server behind the counter put some in a small cup for me. Overall, good value, good tasting product with fast, good service. Would definately recommend those in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am pretty surprised by how much I looove this joint; I have visited two Osmow's locations (one in scarbs & one dt along queen st west) in the past & my expectations were set quite low. Passing by, the smell of the chicken heating up immediately caught my attention &, frankly, was a sign for redemption.  I ordered the osmow's special (as a sandwich) for $6.50 plus tax. This is basically osmow's seasoned chicken breast grilled with onions, green peppers, and pineapples (peep the menu in the photos). Their chicken was tender and flavourful. I got \"light\" spice (one pepper on the rating scale) and it wasn't spicy at all. The flavour of the chicken was muuuch more dominant. You can choose what toppings (veggies) you want on it. Although they don't niiiiice you with these free toppings, the portion of meat that they provide is defffinitely my moneys worth. They give hearty servings of meat so get on that protein.  They have daily specials (don't get this confused with the everyday special though) that change on the regggg. We went yesterday, so my dad ordered one: beef kofta. Tried some of his rice and it was v good. Like I could probably eat just a bowl of rice with garlic sauce by itself. LOL.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful. Rachel provided us with recommendations and explained a couple of the menu items for us without hesitation. One of the other workers, a younger male whose name I did not catch, was extremely courteous & controlled a couple minor issues with our payment process. Despite the time consuming issues with placing our order, he managed to make the wait much more tolerable.  The space itself isn't too big. There are 3 tables of 4 and when the line gets long, you begin to feel a bit congested... but that's because the space in general is tight to begin with.  I actually liked it so much that I went back today for lunch again with my mom! We each ordered a regular chicken shawarma wrap, upgrading one to a combo with fries & a pop. The chicken wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it to be... but that may just be a personal preference. The fries were amazing. I could devour a large... EASILY. They were perfectly cooked & came salt-free (I didn't even have to ask!). I would definitely recommend for you to check out this location because lord knows I'll be back for a threepeat & then some!"}
{"text":"Their Greek Salad uses massively large chunks of Feta and I absolutely love their chicken shawarma! Not a fancy place, but hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have a bad feeling and you know you should cancel the order but you don't want out of politeness and courtesy.  This is one of those times.  There is a reason why this place has lower reviews. The first sign was the small handwritten sign asking for $.35 charge for visa purchases under $10. They wanted one dollar for Amex.. talk about nickel and dimming.   So I go ahead. I ordered the beef shawarma covered in a tasteless sauce. Next time I will go to the Greek place next-door and I would advise the same"}
{"text":"Tried the half and half chicken shawarma which is half fries, half rice. Thought it was pretty good. Worth the price for the quantity."}
{"text":"Gotta try the chicken on the rocks or sticks - we had sticks. The fries were perfection, fresh out of the fryer and I don't think I could have imagined how perfect the fries go with the chicken shawarma and Osmow's special sauce. Stopped by right before they closed so we didn't have to deal with any rush."}
{"text":"I'll start off my saying the place was clean. Sadly that is where I don't have much else to compliment them on.  I ordered the beef shawarma plate. It looks good...the taste however was blank. I can only describe it as that...BLANK. It had zero flavour. Whatever the white sauce was it was not garlic I mean not even close. The beef was super bland.  only the fries had taste. I know I should have gotten the rice however I was looking for something different. My mistake I guess. This came with a salad. I choose Greek and sorry to say it was just bad. The Greek dressing was over oily, they used 4th rate feta...this means it's most likely the fake shit.  Was I supposed to add salt? Is that what I missed doing? Overall I wished I had spent my $17 on someplace else. Come on guys you are not even trying. This is 3rd rate food. Try harder, maybe use some real Mediterranean flavours in everything you cook there. That's what is expected no? I do not recommend..."}
{"text":"I really love this place! A lot! Some of the best felafel. The only reason I won't give this place a 5 star is because 1) the food takes a very very long time to make 2)while your waiting for your food the noise is excruciating   Tip: sound proof the area you cook the food"}
{"text":"This place made me sad . The service was very slow and the food was bland. My buddy got the falafel balls with rice. It was very plain and had no taste.  I got the chicken shawarma in a pita. It just didn't do it for me. I recommend going somewhere else for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for reasonably priced, tasty Mediterranean food. The service is always prompt, accurate and I've never been kept waiting more than ten minutes for my order.   Every time I've gone, I get either the chicken on the rocks (on rice) or chicken on the sticks (on fries). The chicken is fresh off the spit and the fries somehow manage to stay crispy even under the sauce and chicken. They also offer a scale of how spicy you want the dish to be. Note that the spice level doesn't change the sauce used, they just add more lines of the hot sauce depending on your preference.  Not much to say about the ambiance here - it's definitely designed to be a take-out establishment. The inside is very clean though and the staff are attentive to keeping the few tables inside tidy.  Overall, this is a solid take-out spot and is a nice alternative to your typical fast food offerings."}
{"text":"Food is superb but service is very disappointing. No common courtesy here, I did not feel very welcome. It is difficult to understand why a small business would treat its customers in this fashion. Next time show some basic manners, please."}
{"text":"After our TD Tree Plant Day event in Brampton, our entourage of coworkers were feeling for something Mediterranean.  Luckily for one of our buddies, they recommended that we come here.  In the busy plaza right across from the Chrysler factory, in a busy plaza is Osmow's.  Serving your classic beef/ chicken shawarmas and salads to classic plates filled with their homemade rice and frites! The ambiance is busy during peak lunch hours, and one thing's for sure, Osmow's doesn't make you wait long for your order.  The place is busy, clean, lots of seating with the friendly lady who was helping us.  TIP, when you saw chicken on the 'ROCKS' its on RICE.... not ice lol... like a whisky on the rocks type of thing lol... \"STICKS\" are fries....or FRITES...if you're French lol...  I decided to order their CHicken on the ROCKS and RICE...and upon choosing their sauces, it ranges from non spicy, mild, spicy, really spicy, or suicide spice... I opted for SPICY and go \"the look\" as if they were wishing me good luck.  The price was reasonable approx $12 but the portions were massive, that I with a big appetite had to take some of it home.   overall the place is great, the staff are friendly! if I am ever in the area, I'll be sure to stop by..... i think ill try their Mild as spicy was quite spicy.. lol.."}
{"text":"Your run of the mill North American middle eastern food. Still very good and hefty portions. But mostly ... Chicken on stix"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but failed to properly recommend this place. The food and the people are phenomenal. I like this place for lunch or dinner.  I'm a huge fan of their shawarma and their homemade hot sauce. You've got to have a high hit tolerance level if you ask for a \"hot\". I'd recommend starting with a medium and work your way up.  Beware, if you order the large one, which the $ to food ratio is well above average (great deal!!!), you better come starving. Otherwise, this will be your lunch AND dinner! Simply put...AMAZING! Every time I have been here, the food and the service was amazing. The place is a little small and it gets very busy there. Could recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I came in today to see what the rave was about. I ordered a medium chicken on the rocks. The lady that took and prepared my order was pleasant, and I got my order within 10 minutes of ordering. Portion size was decent. Taste wise...it was okay. The rice was nice and fluffy, and the chicken was tender and flavourful. But TOO MUCH SAUCE! Quarter way through my meal, I got tired of the sweetish-garlicky taste. Having said that, the hot sauce did compliment it very well - enough spice and kick to cut the richness of the white sauce. I'll probably be back to try other things on their menu, and if I ever choose to get the chicken on the rocks again, I'll specify to take it easy on their signature sauce lol"}
{"text":"I keep wanting this place to be good but it just isn't. The chicken shwarma is a weird consistency, soft, mushy, almost boiled.   Shwarma are soggy and drowned in their nasty house sauce. Will not be going back after giving it three goes."}
{"text":"Decent shawarma but marination of the meat could be a lot better. Main thing you will taste is their mayonnaise garlic sauce. Overall a good option for a late snack when you are the area. If you want the best try Pita Boss in the Meadowvale area. They are hot right now!"}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be. Only thing great about this place is that it's open late. A lot of bones found in my chicken."}
{"text":"Came to Courtney park for a movie and stopped in for some shawarma ... I looked at the Prices and was like hmmm looks a littttttle bit pricey for shawarma but heck ..try it and let's hope it's good ..... I got the chicken shawarma and it came with rice as usual and a salad . When they gave it to me they gave me 2 boxes which kinda surprised me one was the shawarma the salad in another box and it was big !!  I got a huge salad to start and my huge portion of Shawarma!!! WoW I thought !! That's a lot of food . And to top it all off ....it tasted pretty damn good .i honestly can  say it was worth it ! Good tasting food and great portions so worth the money and visit !  Try them out !  Service was friendly Service was fast  2 thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"Man I'm a fan of this place; I can't come to Canada without making a stop at Osmow's.  Their chicken shawarma or chicken on the rocks hits right on the spot."}
{"text":"Love going here for falafel. Great food. Always hot and fresh. Fast service. Great portion sizes, you leave full!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food! I usually get chicken on the rocks. I love their sauce and found that the portions were quite large. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What I love most about Osmow's is the rice and the amount that they give you. For a sunday afternoon, it got pretty busy; I ordered my regular - falafel on the rocks. The falafels that they gave me were smaller and the amount of rice and sauce was not as generous as other locations."}
{"text":"After I workout at york and I'm in need of a cheat meal, no place is better than this osmows. I'm always greeted with smiles and all the food here is just so good. There's nothing I've eaten here that hasnt satisfied me. :)"}
{"text":"Worst shawarma ever. I saw the guy eating meat off the spinner and licking his fingers. I ate   half and threw rest out. Very big but tastes below average..   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best shawarma you can get in Mississauga (granted that really isn't saying much but I guess it's still a compliment).  In fact, in my opinion this is the only shawarma in the city actually worth getting.  The only item from this place that I've tried is the super-sized chicken shawarma wrap, and realistically that's the only thing I even needed to experience to award this place five stars.  The shawarma is reasonably priced at around $8 (for some reason the location in Streetsville is about a dollar cheaper) and they certainly were not kidding when they named it \"super\" sized.  This shawarma wrap is about as big as my forearm, and that's a huge plus with me considering most shawarma wraps I get aren't enough to fill me up.  But what really impresses me is the overall quality of the wrap itself.  Not only do all the ingredients taste super fresh - a big surprise for shawarma places it seems - but the meat and the sauces taste absolutely fantastic.  I've tried too many shawarma places that simply had a bland, uninspired taste that just left me saying \"meh\" afterwards, but that couldnt' be farther from the truth with Osmow's.  Everything about this shawarma, including the wrap, vegetables, chicken, sauces and spices just screamed with a great amount of quality and perfection.  As for the other aspects of the restaurant, they're all about average but it doesn't even matter much when the food tastes as good as it does.  The service is decently quick and the interior is adequate although nothing spectacular.  From what I recall I believe this location has USB chargers on the tables so you can actually recharge your phone while you're eating your lunch, a really cool touch.  All in all, Osmow's is a great place.  The owner of this place clearly knows what he's doing, as I've heard this chain has been expanding a good amount in recent years, and with good reason.  If you're in Mississauga and looking for a quality shawarma, definitely pay a visit to Osmow's."}
{"text":"Decent enough food for a decent enough price but the place is dirty. There was no one in there and we could only find one out of about a dozen tables that had some degree of cleanliness. Even then we needed to wipe it down ourselves."}
{"text":"Osmos is a story of a restaurant that has its downfall brought on by its success.   Let me start of by saying, they have great food AND it's open late night. It used to be that you could go to Osmos at whatever time and get a damn good shwarma (and fries if you're really hungry) at whatever time.   As with most good finds, people tell their friends, and they tell their friends. Osmos became so popular that they gathered a mass following through just word of mouth. A true testament to their good food.   Given that everyone and their uncle was coming to Osmos, you can no longer get a quick bite to eat here. You will be waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes ....for a simple shwarma. That's ridiculous.   Yes, their quality is still pretty darn good (it's gone down recently, but it's still a solid 7.5/10) and they ARE open late, but what's the point?    When it's late and I want a good shwarma, I want it now, not after waiting an hour in line.   TL;DR: good food, open late, wait times are wayyy too high"}
{"text":"They're improving. Now noticeably better than Mavis and Steeles. Daily special needs bit more chicken"}
{"text":"Well, at least they mixed the salad in a bowl before slopping it together into a styrofoam box ?  BTW what is the logic here using bagged and heavily preserved salad mix?  It tastes like shit"}
{"text":"I totally agree with the reviewer below, it boggles my mind how this place can be so popular and rated so highly...  It's a cheaters shawarma, it's just griddled hunks of gristly chicken meat that don't even slow cook on the vertical broiler at all, it's always bleeding red raw when they shave it off and just move it the flat top.  It's unhygenic, unappealing, and incorrect..  I also dislike the weirdo toppings they put in the sandwich like olives, I'm always having to tell them specifically what to put and what not to put.  And don't even get me started on how SLOW they are.  I've had the misfortune of almost waiting 30 minutes for a mediocre sandwich at best.  There is much better to be had elsewhere..  Service sucks."}
{"text":"Some days it really hits the spot and some days it's an incredibly disappointing and frustrating meal.    When the long haired older woman (the wife?) is making the meal, she actually pays attention to detail.  The salad is properly dressed, has all of the ingredients, and the shawarma & rice will be properly sauced and spiced.  On the complete opposite, when the older bald guy (the husband?) is making the food, he's completely lost and has no idea what he's doing.  He will dump the ingredients into the salad bowl without paying attention to what is in there.  Will add a tiny squirt of dressing without actually mixing the salad, and seems permanently confused about every single order that comes through.  He has absolutely no passion or attention to detail.  For these reasons, I usually hope to God the lady is taking my order and making the food instead of the husband..  I had to take several stars away because the guy screws up so often"}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant. Came here today with my friend to check the place out and servicewise was ok.  We were going to order since we made up our mind and what we wanted, but before that i bumped into the employees... i didnt even notice that she was there. I said sorry and she just kept looking at me.   We ordered shawarma and while the lady ask what i wanted she just gave me an attitude. I mean, it's not hard to ask customers what they want really. But the lady seemed like she really hated her job. LOL, c'mon, i dont care if youre an owner of the restaurant or you work there to make a living for yourself but dont give attitude to customers. It makes your business look bad. It even makes you not to come back to the place.   We got the food as soon as possible and its okay. I mean, there are much more better shawarma that i had tasted. Maybe i shouldve ordered a plate but mustve been because it was my first time.   It is a little pricey but then again you get what you paid for.   Im looking forward to try other location but as far as for this location....eh, its  a 50/50 for me to even go back."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place, I finally went. I have gone back about three times since.  It's a small, think perhaps 3 seats inside. It really is a grab and go place. The place is clean and very friendly .  All those are consistent including the food. So why only 2 stars? It's the flavour. The portions are huge but just not so great for their main proteins - chicken, lamb or beef. They all fall flat of flavour from my typical experience. Like I said , I tried 3 times.  However, if you are vegetarian, I will say their salads are lovely especially the fattouch. Made with crispy pita. Yummy! I would go back just for that.  But I know, all you meat lovers out there like me, can't just live on salad."}
{"text":"We used to go here almost every Saturday for lunch. It would always be a group of us, taking over most of the seats. One time, they messed up one of the girl's order. Fine, it happens, so she had to wait from the beginning. To make matters even worse, when she asked for extra sauce... I can't remember what it was to be honest, they charged her an extra $1.25 for the small sauce container. They didn't even tell her the cost, they just charged her for it.   We were in disbelief. They should have just offered it free since they had to make her wait longer and not only that, we ALWAYS went there.   They squeezed us for extra $1.25? Really? Your regular customer? We were probably there 3 Saturdays every month.... It was that often. After that incident, we were so disappointed so we stopped going.   It was obviously good and of reasonable price, that's why we always went there. But when they don't treat their customer right, there's no point giving them our business.   I wouldn't recommend this place due to our personal experience, but it's actually not that bad... At least when we used to go years ago."}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma place in Scarborough. Try the chicken on the rock... Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food! Chicken on the rocks is perfect! Love the sauces and the fact that when you ask for spicy, it really is spicy!!!   Only downside is the service, I found the service at this location specifically hit or miss with the staff... Although more misses."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  This is their version if a falafel plate.  I was charged over 10 dollars for 3 small falafel balls, a very small scoop of salad, along with a scoop og hummus and garlic sauce. I was no option for pita to even add any substance to this overpriced meal.   I am extremely dissapointed as I had high hopes for their food quality and level of service."}
{"text":"I'm used to hearing great things about Osmow's, starting from their super shawerma to their student specials. This location is conveniently located in the plaza right across from York University-Keele Campus. The extreme cleanliness and surprising size of the restaurant was noticeable as soon as you walk through the door. My boyfriend ordered a super chicken shawarma, and it was absolutely huge. I had a couple of bites of his sandwich and I can vouch to this being one of the better shawarmas I've had in Canada. For the size, taste, and juiciness, I can't complain one bit. The shawarma was packed with meat, to the point where it was over spilling, and not one bite was dry or flavourless. The service was quick, and everyone in the shop was nice. One thing I have to note though: they don't wear gloves while making your sandwich. They have a couple of signs posted everywhere explaining as to why they don't, which I appreciate.   TLDR; get the super chicken shawarma. Amazing. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Incredible service! Boyfriend & I came in at 10:30 (they close at 11), and ordered their chicken on the rocks with extra sauce. Not only was it hot & ready in 5 minutes, but it was swimming in extra sauce. My clumsy self spilled Half of my diet Coke can all over their table and floor, to which three of their employees ran to me to assure me not to worry about it and they immediately began the cleanup process. They handed me napkins to dry off my jeans, and even replaced my Diet Coke in with a new one. Despite my clumsy accident I still felt welcome and was greeted with so much kindness and understanding from all of their staff.   TLDR; amazing food and great service, get their chicken on the rocks with extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Although my shawarma was good and made-to-order I should have take my order and run. The venue isn't clean and they use the \"dining\" area for storage space. This hole in the wall restaurant is noisy during lunch hours and if you are lucky (or brave) enough to find a table you may regret vultures staring over your shoulder.  Cheesesteak should shamefully be left out of the authentic menu."}
{"text":"Walked in and the girl was doing something with her iPad at the cash and  seemingly didn't notice me.. She was pretty much just blocking the cash from the other guys in there wondering when she'd finish whatever she was doing so someone else could take my order.. There was also another cash beside her so not sure what the deal was but that dropped a star for me..  Ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate (SUICIDE) with greek salad and rice. Chicken was good, rice was good, hot sauce slathered all over (I think I used the term 'bring it') was stellar.  Although, the greek salad was REALLY bland.. I'm not sure what it needed (perhaps more vinegar in the dressing?) but it was just not good.. dropped one more star.  Looks like a small place so I get why people review that it's a PITA to find a spot to sit, especially when school's in, but I took it to-go anyway so I could really care less.  This would've been a 4* probably if that girl had even acknowledged me.. I'll be back for more though.. Maybe she'll get some customer service experience under her belt before I pop in next.."}
{"text":"One of the best local spots in Mississauga.  Always comes clutch when you looking for some dank munchies.      Instagram @EverythingMops"}
{"text":"I live nearby and never have I looked at this place twice- it's pretty small store in a plaza. Anyway I decided to get some lunch that's not-so-unhealthy. So I decided to give this place a try. And honestly I was amazed by the quality and quantity of the meal I received.   It's pretty delicious- the chicken wasn't dry, the sauce was good, and the salad was fresh with good dressing. The hot sauce was actually spicy, but not sour. I would say it's the best option of food that you can get in that specific plaza by Pan Am.   Besides the price was reasonable. Tax included my meal was only $10.75.   I would go back again and definitely tell people about this place."}
{"text":"Osmow's is always consistent! Welcome to flavor town, highly recommended if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Sad to see such a good place go down hill over the years. I used to be a huge fan of Osmows until my past many experiences of many in which I was \"giving them one last chance\". Other than the horrible service, they want you in and out of there so fast that your shawarma ends up being either with wrong toppings, wrong spice or pieces of fat and cartilage.   The cashiers look like they should film a segment titled \"FML\". Diana used to work there (kind Spanish lady) and I would only enjoy on going when she was working.  This is what happens to a small restaurant gets busy and candle handle traffic in a professional and timely matter.  Take advice from an Arabic person himself, save your time and money and go to either Lazeez or Pita & Grill."}
{"text":"Chicken on the Rocks is a must-try! The sauce is flavourful and the chicken shawarma is tender and super tasty. If you mix Tabouleh salad with it, the salad adds balance to the dish. Request \"mild spice\" or \"no spice\" if you are not into spicy goodness that much."}
{"text":"Good service ,friendly staff,clean and hygenic place . Love this location near my house ."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite before watching a movie. Low review rating a little bit my fault haha. So my friend and I got the chicken shawarma combo which was the deal of the day for under $10. Comes with the choice of a canned drink or water bottle and fries or rice so we got fries and a canned drink.  The reason why my experience was sort of ruined was because since I haven't been here for a while I forgot how spicy the sauce was so I decided to get \"hot\" (which is just four lines of sauce) and my friend got \"little hot\". Usually I think I would be able to take hot but I guess not last night haha. It was so hot that I couldn't enjoy my food and my friend felt the same way but she doesn't like to have too much hot. But generally, the sauce exploded from the bottom of my wrap which wasn't cool, thank goodness for the top of my fries box. Also when I couldn't eat it anymore I had to deconstruct my wrap and figure that I should at least eat the chicken and to my surprise there wasn't really that much in it. So I could only manage to eat about 2/3 of it and I had to stop altogether because my lips were my red and swollen than as if I used that Fullips Lip Enhancer.  So I guess, be warned with the spice level and expect smaller portions of chicken!"}
{"text":"This location is very nice. It is big and has lots of seating. Plus the give you a lot of fries and the service is fast. I always order \"chicken on sticks\" it's so  yummy. I use to get medium spice, but now I get hot."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was last year with my friend. I had \"chicken on sticks\" it was really good. Sticks means  fries. We ordered \"chicken on sticks with extra garlic sauce\" you'd think that with all the sauce they put in top it would make the fries soggy but it didn't! This location is small, but I normally get my food to go, I live about 20mins away from this location so by the time I get home it's still nice and warm."}
{"text":"I only give this 3 stars because once you have the food from the original Osmow's in Brampton, you will never want to go back here. The quality and service in Brampton is 10x better! Much more of an authentic experience. But when I can't make the trek, this joint still hits the spot. I recommend the chicken on the rocks - start easy on the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Heavens to Murgatroyd, my chicken shawarma was delicious!  Service was expeditious while not overly friendly (not to suggest that it was unfriendly either). Food was spicy and hit the spot in such a perfect way that I find myself unable to explain the satisfaction felt during the meal. We also came right before the lunch rush so good on us for avoiding the chaos of a busy Osmow's.   Prices are reasonable considering quality and taste.  Having now tried Osmow's and Lazeez, I'm not sure I could pick one over the other. If only all of my life decisions were limited to things like \"Do you prefer Delicious Food A or Delicious Food B more?\" Maybe a slight edge to Lazeez? I don't know. Must conduct more research.   Go now. Or go later. Just make sure to go and try."}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place to me. With all the build up, my expectation was high, and what I ate was no where close to the best. Quite the opposite actually. I normally love shawarmas, but couldn't finish this one. Plus the staff could be more polite, and the place could be MUCH cleaner.  My 1 star review is pretty reflective of my overall conclusion. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Ugh, there are so many better shawarma places, why would you come here?  Chicken and rice were bland without the sauce,  and salad was old and stale. I spent the next two hours in the bathroom after eating here."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Osmow's but for some odd reason, the food at this location isn't great. I ordered take out last Sunday and they got my order wrong, the meats were dried out they re-fried fries that were sitting out and put them in my order. I asked her if I could wait for the next batch but she ignored me. I can see that they are focused on efficiency and getting orders out the door in the quickest time possible but I hope that it doesn't compromise quality."}
{"text":"It was soo bad. The meat was greasy and bland. There is way too much sauce all you taste is the soggy sauce. The salad was disgusting and soggy aswell. I would have tried the baklava but I was scared of it because it could have made me hate baklava and it's probably a disgrace to real Turkish baklava."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place and final it open near my home and  I can smell the amazing food so I went in the atmosphere is great and the place is clean and so busy but ordered and waited and the have a combo special every day and student discount combo too and the stuff are so nice and explain every dish to me and it's good for gathering and pick up and I high recommend this place!   If you never tried shawarma , you need to try this place ! 10/10  So try the salads and they have hot sauce and they are famous with it and you can order spicy shawarma!"}
{"text":"I love shawarma. But I'm sorry, the meat served at this location is disgusting. Not only aesthetically so, but it didn't taste good.   And the texture. Sheesh. Terrible. I can honestly say that I will never go to an Osmow location again.   The only reason for the two star was because the person serving me was really nice.   The chicken shawarma on top of being bland, was barely cooked. There are lots of better places around. Avoid!"}
{"text":"This location (haven't been to any other one) is almost always packed. It's near a college, so students are always looking for a quick bite to grab from this fast food style Mediterranean restaurant. They do take upwards of 10 minutes to prepare your food when they're busy.   The place is kind of cramped, but they're in a busy area, so to expect spacious seating is asking for too much.  The food is fresh, well seasoned (except the rice, that's bland) and always hot.   The best thing I've had here is the chicken shawarma with fries. They do let you adjust your spice level, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and this place isn't what it used to be. Came here on a Tuesday night right before closing time. We waited in line for 20 minutes, we finally get to the front and was denied service due to closing. First of all, if you want to close down your place then lock the doors, there was a lot of customers still coming in.   Second to avoid disapointing your customers you need to let them know that you're closing when they first come in. Making them wait 20 mins then saying its the last order when the store isn't even close yet isnt fair. There was still a long line-up behind us. They close at 11pm. When we got to the resto it was about 10:40. When we got to the front of the line it was 10:59 exactly. During that time they should take a second to lock the doors and serve the remaining people who got there before closing. It's common courtesy  The boyfriend spoke up and they served us and the people behind us. Another problem is the people behind us got their  order first...what the... Second, we ordered the chicken on the rocks x2 half fries half rice. And they only put fries on the first order but it wasn't enough fries and they couldve easily moved the fries and gave us rice in there. Third,  their fries was super soggy... yup won't be coming back here.  Lazeez is the clear winner here in terms of chicken on the rocks. Even their white sauce wasnt as good as lazeez."}
{"text":"The worst Osmows I've ever visited. We've been a regular customer for over 4 years, and we've recommended the Military Trail location to dozens of people.  We had high expectations for this new location and was incredibly let down. The portion of our meat wouldn't even fill a small container and this costed us $15! They skimp out on your meat and drench the container in sauce so you don't see the gaps in between.  The service wasn't great either. They're extremely rude and give preference to people they know. Don't waste your time and money here!"}
{"text":"We're makin' what you're cravin' - even with one too many apostrophes, that slogan totally hollered at me. I was at osmow's because of my late night shawarma craving. Now, this place is known for its shawarmas but it's never quite appealed to me. However, I decided to give it another shot because I had no other choice at 11pm on a weekend night in 'Sauga. And well, verdict? Didn't like it this time either. My sandwich was neatly wrapped and grilled, decent in size, but the taste was far from the usual yummy shawarmas I am used to (for example, Ali baba's). And the whole osmow's experience wasn't any good either. Here's why:  1. No beef shawarma! Whaaaat :( 2. Long line ups, even close to midnight!  3. Bright orange walls 4. Dingy seating 5. You have to customize your shawarma at the cashier... So you can't look at ingredients later and go like \"this please...\" Or \"not this\" or \"a lot of these\" or \"stop stop, that's enough\"   Now you may not understand the value of #5 now... But when you get a shawarma that is doused in the ill-tasting garlic sauce, so much so, it breaks and gets messy, you'll really regret not having that fifth option. I asked for \"extra garlic sauce\" and all I got was the previously described white mess. Also less chicken, more other stuff. I get that I asked for olives... But they really filled it up with olives for ever bite... Which made it salty and nasty.  Never again. This was the last shot Osmow's, and a total waste of 5 bucks. Could've used those Wendy's coupons for a late night burger instead."}
{"text":"For a Shawarma, the best value for your money !!  I had heard a lot about this place, being rated the best Shawarma in town, but had never tried it. I'm glad I did today!   In the heart of Streetsville, a great place to grab something Mediterranean. Parking is available at the back, there is a separate entrance as well. Now don't go by the looks, it may look like a dull place outside, but the food covers it all.   The ambience is a little cramped up, hence not suggested for groups. The look is more Egyptian with paintings of Pharaoh. The place is even crowded for the staff area as well.   They had a Wednesday special, Chicken Shawarma Combo for $7.49. The pic showed Chicken Shawarma Wrap, Fries and Salad. We ordered 2 of those. The service time was good especially considering the line up ahead of us. One smart thing I liked here was that they make you choose your toppings when you place the order itself. Never seen that at a Shawarma place.   The order came, and the Shawarma was delicious, no doubt why they have got that rating. The quantity of Salad and fries was also good. I was surprised to see they even added chunks of Feta Cheese in the salad. All of this for $7.49, Indeed Best Value for Money Paid. The sauces added made the Wrap more juicy, even the quantity of Chicken was great.   Great Tasting Food and Best Value for the Money Paid !!"}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks or a Super Chicken Shawarma (medium heat).  The quality is hit or miss (depending on how the cooks are feeling), but I've had more good experiences here than bad food-wise, so no major complaints there.  I do think there is a much more efficient way of assembling multiple shawarma sandwiches (i.e. not waiting for 20 orders to come through before expediting), but the fact that there is a consistent 15-person line at peak hours speaks volumes about the quality of the food. Your patience is appreciated."}
{"text":"I use to go here when Osmow himself use to makes Schwarmas himself. The place use to be dead and use to be literally my favorite place to go. He took the time and effort making the perfect Schwarma. Now its just garbage! It's just full of sauces and really cheap meat. Also the customer service sucks as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I always get the half and half! Can't ever go wrong. Only bad thing about this location is the stench from the bathroom in the back. I always make sure to do take out because of this."}
{"text":"When I'm craving really spicy food, like insanely spicy, I come here and get my plate coated with just red pepper sauce and sprinkled cayenne pepper powder on top.  I can't go out for the rest of the night and I have to eat at home due to all the sweating, but it is totally worth it.  If you like spicy, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I come here when my usual place - Shwarma Queen is closed. Food is definitely better than what you would find at most Villa Madina locations. Some Villa Madina locations are actually decent.  Taste is pretty good and portions are good too. Careful if you ask for spicy though, it is legit spicy.  Always friendly service when I come to this location."}
{"text":"Hands down better then lazeez and alot of other shawarma places due to the customer service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Just had a beef salad... and I have to say this was the worst shawerma I ever had in my life so far. Barely any shawerma in it, barely any salad in it, the shawerma its self is all unchewable connective tissue and fat all of which is ... FOR 16 DOLLARS."}
{"text":"Came here about 30 min before closing because we were starving after a long day of traveling. The lone guy working was extremely gracious and friendly. I would've completely understood if he had refused us service but he made our delicious food quickly. As he was making our orders, a large group came in, making me feel further guilty for making the guy stay longer.  Awesome customer service all around. Would highly recommend to everyone 7/30/16"}
{"text":"These guys are the BEST. Super nice staff and accomidating, will usually modify rice for salad. HUGE delicious portions with as much sauce as you could possibly desire. My go-to for lunch-- and I'll often have enough leftovers for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the place for fast food on the go or eat in while watching the game! Portions are ginormous, they don't stinge out on the veggies, seasoning, or sauce! \"Healthier\" than near by options for a great price!! I hope they can keep up the standard and stay indefinitely."}
{"text":"My experience here was great. It was a Friday night and we opted for Osmow's as opposed to standing in line to get into the Warehouse bar.   My friend ordered the chicken on the rocks (spicy) and I ordered chicken on stix (spicy). Maybe we were just hungry but honestly, I really enjoyed my meal!   It's probably not the healthiest thing in the world but then again, you know that going in. The cashier was super friendly and informative. He walked us through the menu and entertained our questions about the Osmow's chain (my friend frequents the Scarborough location -- this was my first time in general).   I would definitely go again. The reason why I'm giving them a 4/5 and not a 5 is because of the lack of seating inside. It's a small space so I get that. They do however have seating outside. Not that practical during the colder, winter months."}
{"text":"Osmows has always been a favourite for some comfort food. They're a basic shawarma with rice or fries mostly except when you taste their white sauce,  because that's where their big secret is. I tried the other locations which I dined in with some friends. However, I was a bit sceptical to order through uber eats. When I received my order it was fresh and hot. Nothing to complain about. Returning customer."}
{"text":"First of all, they couldn't get the order right!  We were ordering to go and typical my husband, he wasn't paying attention so we didn't realize the error until we got home.  My husband ordered and paid for chicken kabob and they gave him shawarma. The worst part is their was no taste.  There was no sauce!  Barely any toppings.  Probably the tiniest shawarma I've ever had.  And the chicken was mushy.  There were no pieces of chicken for that matter.  It was one mushy mess.  The texture was so off that I even questioned if it was really chicken!    The falafels were sour.  Maybe I'm used to ones with cilantro and parsley and there are other recipes as this one had more of a potato texture. They were perfectly crispy on the outside but the inside were sour and oily.    Definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"When I noticed a new Osmow's location was opening up right in my hood, I got pretty excited. There's an obvious dearth of quality shawarma joints in the Yonge and Eglinton area, especially now that the nearby Grill Brothers closed. (Don't even get me started on the substandard offerings at Paramount.)  I decided to go with the medium chicken shawarma with no pickles and extra hot sauce. I waited for a couple of minutes and a surprisingly large concoction was presented to me. (If this is the medium, what does the *large* look like?)  Anyway, it's definitely an above average chicken shawarma. The ingredients are given equal consideration throughout and it's obvious this wasn't just slapped together. The white sauce and hot sauce work perfectly, while the decision to finish the whole thing off on the grill gives it a bit of bite.  I guess my one complaint would be a total absence of those crispy bits you get in good shawarma. Had the wrap had a few of those, I'd be giving this five stars."}
{"text":"Food is okay, I wouldn't consider it authentic shawarma. Service is extremely slow and they seem to run out of things. As a vegetarian my options were limited as they apparently had no tabule and no baba ganoush, I had to stick with a salad and hummus with falafel, not my first choice."}
{"text":"I stopped going to this location a while ago. I would make it my last resort but I rather not eat than eat here. Their rice is crunchy, their chicken is overcooked and the staff think that they work for the president. Poor food, poor customer service, im never going back here agian."}
{"text":"Long waits, poor service, very average shawarma's. NOT the best shawarma's in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The employees at this location must have all taken the short bus to school. They are incompetent and work at the slowest pace . How hard is it to put chicken on top of rice and open on time? Try and hire people capable of doing their jobs! Officially on my toilet list"}
{"text":"My order: Chicken on the rocks (yes!!), beef on stix  Pros:  + Food: I've been looking for a Halal guys alternative for a while. Finally! I won't have to go back to NYC for this fix.  + Service: refills on the sauce. Amazing.   Cons  - Not open on Sundays? What's up with that? I hit up the location close to Humber (which advertised that it WAS open on Sundays...BUT IT WASN'T).   The red sauce is a bit lackluster compared to Halal guys but the white sauce is def comparable. I'LL BE BACK (not on a Sunday tho, for surez)"}
{"text":"The only reason I visited Osmow's is because I had to meet a friend over at Lakeshore and Cawthra, it was close to dinner and I was starving.  They have a decent size parking lot at the side of the building, which was very convenient.  As soon I walked in, it gave off this Middle Eastern \"fast food\" vibe so I knew right away not to expect too much.  I ordered a regular size beef shawarma (wrap) at the counter.  Unlike most shawarma restaurants, I was asked ahead of time (similar to a fast food chain) to choose the toppings.  I also had to pay a surcharge because I used debit; I think it was around $7.50 so not that cheap.     Shawarma was ready pretty fast but, since I'm in Long Branch, I just chose to wait and eat it once I got home.  As Dave S. (reviewer below) indicated, it was soggy due to an overly excessive amount of salty sauce.  The meat to topping ratio was 50/50; meat had no flavour; toppings were low quality; and, without asking, they put some kind of mushy and nasty cabbage in it.  Plus, near the end, I got a really fatty piece of meat that I had to spit out.  Although the shawarma was bad, it wasn't what I would call uneatable so that's why I'll give it a rating of 1.5 stars.  This is obviously my first and last visit to Osmow's."}
{"text":"Have been going in for their student specials for years now! They do make their shawerma's in a unique way and tend to keep them really moist and juicy!  Other than the small place and the crowded tables, its a great pick for some on-the-go dinner for under $10!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and loved it!!!!  Heard so much about their Shawarma and it didn't disappoint. Service was awesome and very friendly.  I will definitely be going back and I will tell others about it too."}
{"text":"I use Yelp rarely, but I thought it had to be known that the service here is atrocious. Not once but many times. Every single time I have come here it is a 20min+ wait, which most times I don't mind because the food is good. But this particular visit was beyond terrible, in fact I waited 30 min and still had not received my food, so I left without my food even though I had paid about $8.00. There was only 1 cook and 1 cashier on a Saturday afternoon, which is understandable maybe someone called in sick or something, but the way the cook was acting was very very unprofessional, turning up the music loud enough that the cashier could not hear the customer orders, yelling at customers that we're getting frustrated with their long wait times, singing along to the music and walking to the back multiple times to drink an orange juice. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a tiny space so probably best for takeout. However we did eat our food here and the staff are really friendly! Chicken on the rocks is where it's at at this place. That said I feel like they overhype their spice levels even if you explain that you can handle it -- I got a lot of \"Are you sure?!\" for ordering extra spicy. Anyway, solid food, really big portions -- I made two meals of the large-- so good value!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken on sticks on a Sunday evening. It wasn't that busy when we came but I was surprised to see that they filled a massive order of a woman that order after us. We ordered the same thing, except she ordered, I think, like 10 of them.   I went with my boyfriend because I told him my first experience here and raved about it being the best shawarma I had back then. Disappointed with this experience though. They give less fries for their chicken on sticks compared to the Milton location. They looked fully staffed but was displeased with how they managed the large order over the smaller orders that came before.   I guess I'll come back if I am in Streetsville town area and craving a shawarma, but I think I'd rather try something new next time."}
{"text":"Went over on a reference.   Pro: an 8\" shawarma is a fantastic size. Great taste. Meat was well done. Fresh veggies. Quite tasty. The staff is friendly. Clean, quiet ambience.  Not so pros: I'd asked for it to be made spicy hot. The sauce that was in the shawarma had too much turmeric base flavouring in it or so it seems. My companion was coughing after a few bites. Wasn't spicy in the least. Not a nice feel. I didn't get any option to get white meat only as was referred by another reviewer. Lastly the bathroom while appearing clean, was stinking. Needs a good bloody through clean."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place; I mean I wouldn't exactly some here with high expectations. I usually get the \"Chicken on the Rocks\" which for the most part is pretty consistent. While the portions to vary from server to server (and I mean it varies by A LOT), if you can look past that it isn't bad for what you pay."}
{"text":"It was a sad day for me visiting Osmows.  After not going for close to a year; I was very excited to have some delicious Mediterranean Cuisine (Chicken on the rocks to be exact).   Upon entering I noticed that most of the old staff has been replaced with newer unfamiliar faces which is okay.  Ordering went very smooth and I got my food relatively fast which was a surprise as I had a huge queue before me.    When I received my food I noticed a very bad smell coming from the rice and I also think one of the sauces had gone bad as well because rice alone cannot smell that bad. Trying to ignore the stench, I took my first bite and boy was it bad. Without trying to sound \"typical\" it was probably the worst Chicken on the rocks I've ever had. I wouldn't even feed what I had to my worst enemy!  Needless to say I threw out a majority of the dish and went to the other Shawarma place down the road and had a much better meal."}
{"text":"When it comes to shawarma...i think that Osmow's has it down.  One of the things that I base a lot of middle eastern or Mediterranean cuisine is on a few choice dishes that are common to each.  In my case, its \"Chicken on Rocks\" or chicken shawarma on a bed of rice or fries with garlic sauce and hot sauce.   When it comes to this particular dish...Osmow's is my baseline.  You can't beat the price of $7.99 for such a filling and tasty dish.   This location is my go to for when I get a shawarma hankering.  Located near the Chrysler Plant in Brampton in an industrial strip mall, this place is always busy from lunch to late night.  I have been to a couple of Osmow's locations (8 in total) and the majority of them look all the same.  There is limited seating and the order counter takes up most of the restaurant, but they can move a line of people pretty fast here.  The smell of the shawarma cooking on the flat top, after being carved from the rotisserie permeates the restaurant.  Everything here is homemade.  I would warn you, if you like hot sauce...this place makes their own..and its eye bleeding hot.   If you like a little spice..make sure you get..a little spice level..not mild.   The portion size of the \"Chicken on Rocks\" is huge and the garlic sauce that smothers it is creamy and oh so tasty.  They also add a bit of paprika to the top for flavor and then your level of hot sauce.  I have yet to try some of the other dishes but if my usual order is indicative of the other dishes..then I am sure it is all really good.    Looking for a filling and flavorful lunch, dinner or late night munchies...grab Osmow's...you will be full and your hunger fufilled...5 stars"}
{"text":"This is definitely a go to place when craving heavy dense food. They have a variety of different dishes here, all with pretty similar tastes. The typical dish here has their style of chicken with rice or fries, or both, or even inside of a shawarma. I really enjoy the food and think it's worth the price, as you can definitely share the meals.   I've tried the half and half chicken (rice & fries with chicken), as well as their super shawarma! They are both very good and filling to the max. Even when sharing with two people it can be a little much due to the richness of the sauce and the density of the carbs. The dishes are flavourful, but safe enough for anyone to try and most likely enjoy.   There is no seating and usually a long line, so be prepared for that!"}
{"text":"They put more effort into their service/food quality when it's NOT busy...which is never. The lady who works cash needs to watch her attitude when people ask legitimate questions about the menu, too. As far as food, the chicken on the rox is proper with a reasonable amount of sauce and well-seasoned. Only been here once and that was it for me. Mississauga location is 10x better."}
{"text":"I picked up one of the paper menus that are in front when you walk in and ordered a large Greek salad. It said $9 on the menu and rang up for $12. I asked about this and was told to use the menu screens above me. (This wasn't the first time this happened, but the other times the price was off by maybe $0.75.)   Why do you have the paper menus out when they are incorrect by 33%? I would have made a different choice of salad if I had known the real price. Yes, I know I could have changed my order, but I wasn't thinking clearly at the register...  Then when I got my salad, I was really disappointed in it -- not fresh lettuce, almost no tomatoes or cucumbers or feta. It was worth maybe $6, so paying $12 + HST was a let down. I won't be returning. At least take the incorrect paper menus away, or put on a sticker saying that the prices are all wrong!"}
{"text":"First and LAST time i order from here. Order was COMPLETELY wrong. And what's worse, the food is terrible! Subpar. Utterly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been at other Osmow's locations and they were amazing. I expected this location to hold up to the standard but the meat portions and sauce were very selfish... It could be due to It being busy so I'm hoping in future weeks that it holds up to the expectations other locations set."}
{"text":"This place sucks, it sucks so bad. I have nothing else to say. Negative 5 stars if I could. It's almost impossible to find good shawarma anywhere north or Steeles."}
{"text":"Ordered just the salad with chicken & sauce. Each salad was $16 and some change. To be completely honest.... it was not worth it.   The amount was decent for me but not for $17, I could get that same amount ( or even more ) at a different shawarma type of place for probably $12.  Chicken tasted bland & sauce wasn't anything special. The sauce at villa madina taste way better. I was excited because I always hear people talking about how good osmows is.   Tried the fries and rice from my friends plate and it wasn't anything special either.  Service was quick and friendly though.  Too much hype for this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuff, love it here. Price is alright for the portion. Just the wait is a bit long, but worth it considering it is prepared after your order. Coming here definitely satisfies my cravings! Be warned, the spicy level is extremely intense, start with the lightest then work your way up."}
{"text":"Here for lunch. I've eaten at a few Osmow's locations including this one. Mainly take out. I enjoy their lamb kofta and fries. LOVE ME MY FRIES LOL.   Overall a pleasant experience. Be patient if you order the lamb and beef kofta; made when ordered unlike the chicken where they slice and pile it it up on the stove top.   This location is always busy as it's located in an industrial-ish area. Even though it's a steady flow of traffic for some reason you can always find a seat. Which is hella awesome in my books.   Well my order is up, and I don't want to 'hangry' at the dealership.   Happy lunching yelpers! It's been a stressful day and I just want to enjoy my lamb kofta and fries!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for Mediterranean food.service is good . Recommend to others to try different food"}
{"text":"If you want good Shawarma, you MUST try this and this particular branch. Osmow's started on Queen Street, but their staff doesn't seem to care too much about quality anymore. Luckily, they've created franchises across GTA. I have tried maybe three or four of their franchises, and this one is hands-down the best.  TO THE OWNER: PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE! YOU ARE DOING GREAT!   God Bless."}
{"text":"The food is actually inedible. The dressing they use on the shawarma is the same as on the salad, tastes like watered down mayo. The rice is undercooked and has no flavour. The chicken is undercooked and has no taste. Their croutons are old deep fried pita chips. They put sumac on everything but even this bold spice can't mask the gross tasting food. Osmow's if you're reading this and care about your business, just give up or get a chef with some credibility."}
{"text":"Shawarma is not the greatest but chicken on rocks is amazing. Be careful about there sauce. It's way more spicer than other typical restaurants. Overall customer service was average."}
{"text":"Great food. Bad service. Used to be my go to shawarma place and I used to rave about it but last few experiences have left a sour taste in my mouth. The meat is a hit or miss. Sometimes you get raw bits in your meal. Forget calling to order takeout. ITS USELESS. They don't actually prepare your order until you pay and then it gets in the queue. Prepare to waste a lot of time waiting for your food. Also cleaning their tables is not a priority for them so most of time prepare to clean it yourself if you sitting down. Another great example of a successful business that couldn't keep up with demand. Truly sad"}
{"text":"Very unfreindly cashier , the quantity is so low as compare to other locations . only go there bcz its closer otherwise the sandalwood and bramlea road locations are the best."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst restaurant I've been to in Oakville. The sauce is terrible. The beef tasted sour and the wait was horrific for what was made. I ended up throwing almost all of it out."}
{"text":"Have you ever wished you had the ability to turn back time.  I wish I did, I wouldn't have waited my money on an extremely poor decision.  I ordered a \"large salad with beef\" which is really the same as a medium but inside a half full large container.  This salad amounted to nothing more than iceburg lettuce, some slices of cucumbers and tomato and a thin layer of meat.  The majority of this monstrosity was slathered with garlic and hot sauce.  Everything about this was mediocre at best.    The biggest kicker of all? This was a $16 salad."}
{"text":"After several recommendations I finally tried the chicken on the rocks......well deserving of the great reviews.  Beware the hot sauce is hot so if you can't take it....dont even get the mild.  This place will definitely become a regular stop for me for take out.  Great taste and great value."}
{"text":"Best bang for the buck. They don't skimp on meat. Good ol' cheap tasty grub. If you're ultra-sanitary person, you might be turned off. Avoid the fries; most likely freezer burned."}
{"text":"I really enjoy swarma. I've been to about 10 different middle eastern places serving shwarma in the gta.  Imo osmows does the best job out of them allon a consistent basis and I'm a loyal customer. Bit disappointed to see them rated a 2 star on yelp....   The swarma has generous servings of well cooked chicken and the veg is always fresh!! I normally call in about 15 minutes before I pick up the food so waiting is never an issue for me."}
{"text":"Dont come here anymore. When I first tried this place 6-7 years ago the chicken on the rocks was AMAZING And I always craved it. Fast forward to the recent year, i gave it 3 chances (cause maybe they just had an off day). Nope, the portions are now smaller, the quality of chicken has drastically fallen. I even gave the downtown Osmows a chance.  Nice staff though.  Heres a direct quote from my gf speaking on chicken on the rocks. \"this is literally what they serve to people in prisons\""}
{"text":"Note: twice, I've been given the wrong order, so check your order before leaving! I've gone here a few times and the first 2 times were alright. As people mentioned, some of the staff have changed though and it's gotten much worse. I don't think I'll go back again. I went yesterday for a quick meal after a workout and requested whatever the healthiest pita was. The woman taking the order then \"accidentally\" charged me $40 for my shawarma, claiming I shouldn't have used one machine when she didn't indicate which one to use and it already had the pre-paid amount on it. I noticed this on the receipt and asked her to reimburse me, which she did after calling the owner about it.   Then after that, I was handed the WRONG shawama. This is the SECOND time this happened -- last time I asked for veggie and got chicken. This time I asked for chicken and got beef, and nothing on it that I requested. I think they got it mixed up, probably an accident but unfortunately I realized both times when I already got home. After so much bad service I don't think I'll go back. I'd recommend for anyone who orders from here to check their pita before they get home so you can at least get another one if you're given the wrong order."}
{"text":"First time trying osmow's, staff are very friendly, service Is quite quick. I went around 10 pm there were 5 people or so in front of me, yet they still remained quick, I was in and out less than 10 minutes.  As for the food I ordered chicken, half rice half fries. The food was hot and aromatic, the taste was really good just the sauce was a bit to sweet tasting to me. I also wasn't a big fan of the fact they just douse your food in sauce other than that the portion and pricing were excellent and I would definitely go again and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Food is decent I just cannot get over how slow it is... ordered chicken shawarma this week and chicken is already cooked... I waited 20 mins for my wrap... second time that happened too... I just don't get it.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Third location I have been to, and this is the best yet. Service was very friendly and quality of food is spectacular.   I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with a greek salad. Ingredients seemed fresh and very tasty.   I will definitely be heading back here."}
{"text":"Great food here. Their white sauce is almost comparable to the halal guys food carts in NYC. but consistency is what they lack. Not always great."}
{"text":"The food was really good but a little spices for me. I got the 2nd least spiciest sauce and it was really spicey. I just ate around it. I'd suggest getting the hot sauce on the side! There's not much room there to eat, so I suggest take out."}
{"text":"This location is trash. The food is decent but the service is horrible. The staff are rude and does not know anything about customer service. They got my order wrong and tried to blame me for it and had the audacity to argue about it in front of other customers saying I was wrong. All they had to do was remake the order but apparently that was an issue due to their ego issues. In end, they remade the order but the back and forth was really unnecessary. Would not recommend this location to anyone. I will not come here again. T R A S H."}
{"text":"Quit simple the best Shawarma I've ever eaten. The place was jammed to capacity. The food was fresh & fast. There were no pleasantries or niceties with the staff. It's all about getting the food out fast. I had the super size Chicken. It was fresh & the ingredients worked. End of story."}
{"text":"Tried the Chicken on the Rocks & Stix (half & half) - with two lines of hot sauce, it was super filling - enough for almost two people!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this location another chance, but this time I stuck with the classic Chicken on Rocks and chicken on sticks.   The service was amazing, the staff were so patient and friendly. The service was a tad bit slow, but that was most likely because they made fresh fries on the spot for us.   Chicken on Rocks was tasty, but I just wish the rice had a bit more flavour  Chicken on Sticks was great! overall."}
{"text":"I may be spoiled by Mozy's Shawarma in Waterloo, but this place just doesn't hold up. I ordered a chicken shawarma. The chicken used was not shaved from the spit but was pre-cooked, sitting in a warming tray, and flavourless. The garlic sauce was weak and the toppings were sparse. It was wrapped so narrowly that the pita bread folded over into a dense floury mass on one side which was not enjoyable. Service was slow, with little communication to customers. There was visible confusion amongst the staff members behind the counter on what's coming up and which order is next, causing undue stress on the folks waiting for their food. Second star given for store cleanliness, carrying Fanta, and the fries weren't bad, I guess?"}
{"text":"Adequate food but terrible portions. I got a large and was disappointed by how much there was. If you look at the pictures people have posted, you can see Osmow's does not even have the decency to fill it to the top. I expect more from paying $12. They fluff up the rice to make it seem bigger. They used to give more, but with the limited food places in the area, I guess they feel they can get away with giving less."}
{"text":"Two words: shawarma wrap. Fantastic. But seriously, order it mild. MILD. Don't even THINK about medium let alone more. I love spicy food, but this is just something else!"}
{"text":"Delicious, good location, clean tables.   They've been incredibly busy so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I came to Osmow in Ajax today to eat something with my daughter. As my daughter doesn't know what was in the menu I asked if there was a kids meal. they told me that they had a kid meal and ask if I want chicken or beef and I said chicken and asked if I wanted fries or rice and I replied by of course French fries. I could not understand what the gentleman was talking about cause his English was horrible. after getting the meal I just got a small thing of fries and with a few pieces of chicken on it. I ask him where the rest of the meal was.. and he replied that's it!!! I asked him what am I paying $9.75 for?? he said for the meal.. I ask him you are selling this for $9.75 for kids meal that did not come with drinks or anything else. service is slow and they expect you to know ahead of time before you order. I'll never come back again or tell my friends about this place."}
{"text":"This Osmow's location has amazing customer service. We catered from them for an office event and the service was exceptional. They went the extra mile to make sure everything went smoothly and we had our food fresh and on time. Definitely a five stars!"}
{"text":"I initially tried osmows because my doctors office was just next doctors office was just next door.  My husband and I noticed how busy it always was and decided to try it out...the chicken on the rocks and shawarma sandwiches are amazing...kind of a couple times a month craving.  I'm not one for spice so I don't usually get any spice (I have young kids too) but the one time I got \"mild\", my eyes watered tremendously.  Love the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma sandwich supersize for just under $10.  Very good - I would rank it in the top 3 for Toronto.  Great portion size, not too saucy, nicely crisped pita on the outside."}
{"text":"Chicken on The Rocks. That's all folks. It's all you need. Ever. If you're getting anything else, it better be Chicken on The Styx or Chicken Salad (which is basically chicken on the rocks but on fries or fatoulie salad)"}
{"text":"Their shawarma's are top notch, but my recommendation. Get the \"Chicken on The Rocks\" and ONLY the \"Chicken on The Rocks\". By far one of the most addictive dishes I have ever eaten. It came to a point where I had to have it once a week or I would go through withdrawal."}
{"text":"So I decided to give my local osmows another shot, and what do ya' know, I was pleasantly surprised! As always extremely friendly service and massive portions sure to cure your hunger, but this time around the food was perfectly cooked and reminded me of the streetsville location in terms of quality.  I ordered my go to favourite, large chicken on the rocks medium spicy.  Rice was perfectly done throughout without any hard or stale grains and the chicken was perfectly seasoned.  Medium spicy was exactly medium spicy with the perfect amount of garlic sauce and was ready to go just a few moments after ordering! Will come back and delighted to have this osmows just a few steps away from home! Won't be my last time at this spot"}
{"text":"Update on my original review. Food and Service is still the same. However the reason i lowered my rating is they raised their prices without notice. A shawarma wrap used to  be around $4.5 now it's over $6... This isn't going to stop me from coming here, but this was the push i needed to try out the other places in this food plaza."}
{"text":"The food had a lot of oil, and wasn't that impressive. Maybe next time I'll try again, and see. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Very bad food, at one point I felt like I was eating rocks of salt. The food has the worst taste consistency. This is my second time at an Osmow's, both times the food was shit. Should of gone to burrito boyz."}
{"text":"Ok, fine, I did not experience slow service as the majority of these Yelpers did!  This is a new location, near Dixie/Eglinton (just north), in a cluster of stripmalls with a bunch of chain eateries like Nando's, Chipotle, Tim Horton's, Boston Pizza, Popeye's, Wendy's, Booster Juice, basically an office person's wetdream!  Luckily my colleagues and I arrived just before the lunch rush as it was quite empty when we ordered, but filled up quickly after noon!  This location seems to be a lunch spot with limited number of tables.  My chicken schwarma sandwich was a-okay, ~$6, and ready within 5mins.  For some reason, my coworker who ordered a falafel + fries had to wait longer.  Ordering was a breeze with the various options appearing on a screen, facing the customer, so you were able to see available toppings, spice level, etc.  I really liked this option 'cause sometimes I feel a bit pressured screaming over the glass barrier, pointing at toppings!  Server was friendly and they take your name as the same time as your order, sorta like Starbucks."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I love their chicken on the rocks I swear I'm addicted, I eat here all the time highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Osmow's probably has one of the best shawarmas around.  Their sauces combined with hot sauce makes for a very tasteful shawarma that is only $5.75 with tax included. I usually go for medium spicyness but if you're new to the game, definitely start with mild.   TIMELINESS: As the other yelpers have noted, if there is a line, don't even bother going in. Grab lunch elsewhere in the plaza. I've gone before and waited 15-20minutes just because they were so busy. At other times, I've gone just before the lunch rush (11:50AM) and waited no more than 5mins.  ATMOSPHERE: Don't expect much, after all, you're only paying $6 for a wrap. This doesn't compare to a Paramount Fine Foods but its great for quick \"fast food\" meal."}
{"text":"I dont really know how to rate this place. I usually get the 'chicken on the rocks', which by itself is good. The portion size is satisfying for the price you pay. I would rate it higher if it weren't for the customer service. I go to the location at Chrysler Drive in Brampton and they're very inconsistent. I usually get a younger lady (early 20's) and someone who I'm guessing is her mum. I usually get the spice on the side and I would sometimes get charged for it and sometimes I get it for free. It seems like they would randomly charge you stuff without you knowing unless you purposely check your receipt, which I've now started doing. Other than that, food's okay, not sure about all the hype though."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken salad. I loved it!!!! Their dressing/sauce is good and with mayo... Ummm yummy. The pricing is very reasonable considering the size of their food. This place isn't a restaurant so don't expect the fine services, they don't charge you as much either. But the workers are friendly and communicative. Overall, I think they are doing pretty good job. Don't judge from outside, try it first. You may have a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Probably the worst shawarma I ever had. Not only  its bad food, it's expensive for food you are getting."}
{"text":"Went here today during lunch and this place had no line up. Wasnt expecting much (since most popular restaurants in this area are packed during lunch). Ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and it came down to a bit over 6 bucks, probably the cheapest shawarma wrap Ive ever had.  The food itself is decent. They can definitely give more meat...compared to an average shawarma place. The sauce is interesting though, not as creamy or cream-like compared to others ive tried, it's spiced differently (I got it in medium spiciness).  Overall, no complains for a $6 shawarma."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very friendly staff. Even after being very busy they gave the food hot and on time. The manager made sure to ask how the food was which showed great customer service, no one does that anymore I guess. Cheap prices for the food for students. It's a my everyday go to place after work."}
{"text":"Dosent live up to streets ville osmows. On the rocks had double the sauce and half the chicken as usual."}
{"text":"Not really my go to place for shawarmas. They messed up (singed) my chicken so badly it was like eating ash. Didn't even ask if I wanted the special sauce so all I got were maybe two tiddlywinks of it to mask the gross chicken taste. Not to mention they premade the chicken hours prior so it was lukewarm at best.   Two stars for the beef shawarma, it tasted really nice, how a shawarma should be :) not premade as its pricier and not what people normally order"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken on sticks with extra sauce as part of a big ass order.  Got chicken with no sauce.  Sorry-  the chicken is not even close to good enough to stand alone.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the shish tawook sandwich and the fries that was served along. Shawarma with rice was my second order, huge portion of meal for one, but wasn't the authentic taste. Never, I loved their sandwich and would go back for it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and ordered a chicken shawarma. Got potential food poisoning afterwards. I believe it must be the fact that they don't wear gloves and say they wash their hands. Though how throughly they must have washed their hands is debatable.  If you really want to go to osmow's, go to another location."}
{"text":"chicken on the rox is amazing!!  and reasonable price...the $9 size is a lot of food and can easily feed 2 people"}
{"text":"This place is your typical fast food shawarma joint with some tables and seating available. Service was subpar with regards to ordering our meal. When we asked the lady at the cash questions about the chicken shawarma she didn't explain to us and plainly pointed to the sign in front of the cash for the toppings and stuff. Either she doesn't know what these are or she doesn't care to explain.  So we got the \"Today's Special\" which was chicken shawarma that comes with fries and a salad for 7.97+tax. We also asked the cashier what the special was today and all she did was point up to the menu board,lol. Is it so hard to communicate in words with your customer?   So onto the food prepping. There was a large chicken on the spit, but I didn't see them shave any of the chicken from there. Instead they heated up some shawarma meat from somewhere else on grill. Everything they do here, they do with their bare hands, but they also mention that they wash their hands too... so I really don't know how frequent this is and who is actually monitoring their hygiene practices. I did notice the food preppers who were male and had beards were not wearing beard nets...it was slightly disturbing to see this as it is pretty standard for all fast food establishments to have a policy to cover beards with nets.  So anyway, we got our order, and when we got home we noticed our salad was all wilted and warm when we got home....The food preppers put the hot fries in the same box with the salad. Who does something like that?  For some odd reason, after having a chicken shawarma special with fries and salad for dinner my father and I had bad indigestion. The chicken in the wrap was not moist, and seemed quite dry.  Anyway, this place is certainly cheap (daily special), but you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"The food is good and freshly prepared. I think it is a little on the $$$ side compared to some other places. I usually order chicken on the rocks or chicken on sticks. I would prefer if you could get a little more sauce on the food rather than paying extra.   The place is clean. However, try to avoid the rush at 12:00 pm and the evening around 6:00 pm."}
{"text":"Was really excited that osmow opened near square one. It is way closer than its other locations. I love the chicken on rocks.   However, after visiting this one. I was extremely disappointed.  The quality of food and service is extremely poor. The lady was not friendly at all.   I ordered a chicken on rocks here and the food was cold. It was not fresh at all. The chicken was extremely dry and flavourless. The rice was drenched in too much sauce. The bottle of sauce exploded in my rice and the lady just took a knife and spread the sauce. She should have removed some sauce.   There is  free parking for 15 minutes outside the shop for you to come in a grab a meal. But if you are planning to dine in then you'd have to pay for parking. Parking is $1 an hour. There are a couple of tables available for dine in.   Overall, i would probably not come back. I'd rather drive a further distance to the other locations than dine here as the food isn't fresh or good."}
{"text":"Small place, limited seating. There's parking in the back  Been coming here over the years and getting the chicken on rocks. The chicken on rocks is delicious. It's just rice and chicken topped with sauce. Not much to complain about besides the amount of sauce they give you. Feels like they have reduced the amount of sauce they put on top now. That's why I ordered extra sauce on the side. Extra sauce is an additional charge of $0.50.   Overall, good place for something quick to eat!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma. My favorite in the peel region. Hot, fresh and cheap. What more can you ask for?  Ok maybe better service, they have definitely out grown their streetsville location but luckily for me they have a Brampton and lakeshore location that is equally tasty."}
{"text":"I love all Osmows location, but the streetsville still tastes better. This place seems to have better deals and way WAY less wait times.  I always get the \"today\" deal with chicken shawarma on rice with side salad for $7.99.  They stuff the plate literally. Rice is always falling off. I wish I was eating some right now."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town. They actually have a real hot sauce. I don't care if it's not an authentic. It tastes authentically good. Very busy at times but the people working are pretty good. They remember my order when I walk in. I've tried many other shawarmas in town and this tops them all (paramount, pita&grill, nutso, montfords) recommend the regular chicken shawarma ordered hot. Garlic sauce has a unique taste to it."}
{"text":"This is by far the slowest service at any osmow's... and it already has it chicken cut up and chop ready to go. Which makes the chicken dry but yet somehow they still manage to have slow service. I have been here numerous times due it being close to work. Regardless if there are 5 or more customers or just me... it will take them 20 mins + to get the order ready"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is soo bad...just go to lazeez down the food...same food but a lot better service...I use to be a regular at osmow when Sam (owner) use to be there..now the service has gone down hill"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's probably the restaurant I have gone to the most in Mississauga.  There is just something about the way they make the shwarmas and chicken on the rocks that every 1-2 weeks, I get this incredible urge and just can't get out of my head till the next trip here.  I have never tried anything other than chicken shwarma and chicken on the rocks so can't comment on anything.  Service is slow,  Pricing is fantastic.  But who cares...it makes my taste buds happy and keeps them that way for 1-2 weeks and then rinse, repeat."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  Very small space for dine-in.  Place is busy and always a line-up...mostly for take out. Tried the chicken on the rocks and the chicken dinner...both okay."}
{"text":"You want a shawarma? Go to: PITA GOLDEN POCKET.  You want \"Chicken on the Sticks\"? Go to PITA LAND.  1. Why am I paying more for chicken over fries (chicken on the sticks), then I am for chicken over rice (chicken on the rocks)?  2. They use a knock off Sriracha sauce as their hot sauce, smells terrible and has a dry spice flavour that ruins food however it DOES HIDE THE UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN!  3. Save your money, don't come here."}
{"text":"Four words; That hot sauce though.  Chicken on the rocks or Half Rocks, Half sticks. Spice level: HOT!  Chicken and rice is well seasoned. The garlic sauce, and hot sauce is a must. My husband likes to add onions on top. It's pretty addictive, and you're probably agree one of the best fast foods out there."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've eaten at osmows it gives me the runs. I think it's because they leave their sauces out and there is dairy in the sauces."}
{"text":"Went once but will never return. My boyfriend and I ordered falafel wraps one late night as it was close and there was a snow storm outside. Unfortunately, it was not worth the trek and risking our lives. They got our order wrong and failed to mention they had run out of hummus (which was the part of the order they got wrong). We both can't have dairy and that's what sauce they gave instead of the hummus. We had only realized once we got home. When we called and told them they were argumentative and didn't quite apologize. Needless to say we had to go back out and try to get the order changed. That was when they told us they had no more hummus. Not when we first ordered or when on the phone the second time. They were also reluctant to give a refund."}
{"text":"They didn't sauce my chicken on the rocks for some reason   Can't even get lost in the sauce cause they didn't sauce me for some reason  Who cursed me?"}
{"text":"Gave Osmow's a try today for lunch and enjoyed it! I had the half/half beef, which is beef shawarma on rice and fries. They re-cook the beef on the flattop with tomatoes and onions when you order, so the final product has a texture more similar to cooked ground beef. They topped the beef with an extremely generous amount of creamy Osmow sauce.  It's pricey for the portions you get, but I enjoyed my food and it's nice to get more diverse food options out in this part of Markham. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks, chicken in sticks and the shawarma all great options! Good service and great food"}
{"text":"People seem to like the chicken on the rocks but the service is woefully understaffed.  Today 3 staff were there but often no one taking orders or filling the orders as they went off getting supplies etc. Phone rang constantly and no one answered.  Unless they do something different people will get tired of waiting (30 minutes for me on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"Giant portions, so you get a good value. Taste is fine. Gets the job done. It's certainly a place to get your fix of satisfying your hunger but not a place to \"discover\" Mediterranean food like shawarma and falafel"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Quick service, no frills dining and delicious food. The portions are hefty and you can certainly get two meals out of a regular sized rice and chicken plate. I had the chicken on the rocks and my boyfriend had the same except he had half fries and half rice...carb overload? Maybe..Absolute heaven? Yes!!!  If you are in the mood for quick fresh Mediterranean then this is your spot. Tasty sauces cover your chicken and the rock is cooked fresh daily in a hearty broth.  Keep expanding Osmos!"}
{"text":"First time at Osmow's and it did not disappoint. We shared a large half and half chicken which is basically shawarma chicken and osmow sauce piled over rice and fries. Food tasted great and they were very generous with the servings. Good service, manager came to our table to ask how everything tasted. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Osmows has been on the decline over the past year. My husband and I use to always go there at least twice a week and enjoy our food. But these days when we go our salad is dry, lots of large piece of slimy  chicken and not a lot of sauce."}
{"text":"Beh. Meh. Feh.  It gives me no joy to write it since I think the people here seem really nice, but the food here is so substandard. One thing that always rings huge alarm bells for me is when the food is not delivered as promised on the menu. I was here the other day and specifically asked for tabouleh on my sandwich. The cashier assured me it would come with. I got my sandwich home and dug in. Not only was there no tabouleh, there was no hint of several other items that were apparently supposed to be on there. There was a ton of lettuce, two pieces of anaemic tomato, some nasty big chunks of raw onion (why do take away joints always do this? how hard is it slice an onion finely so it's a delicious crunchy addition rather than a meal-spoiler??), lots of banana peppers and some olives. Kind of like a shoddily made Subway sandwich, Middle eastern style.   No tabouleh; no delicious creamy hummus or yogurt-garlic sauce, that would have mellowed out the chill sauce they slathered all over. Just a very, very unbalanced sandwich.   I understand that sometimes a kitchen runs out of things it needs, but in that case, don't tell me that it's going to be on my sandwich. Just tell the cashier to say \"We don't have that today, is that ok?\" No big deal. I hate paying for something and then not receiving it as described. It's the easiest way to alienate a customer.   Finally, the pita they used was the very thin Lebanese style and just didn't hold up to all the juices - the whole thing was a soggy mess five minutes after I left the store. The chicken was juicy and tasty, but that's about the only redeeming feature.   I've been back three times because I so badly want this place to be good, but the food is just so underwhelming, and they need to get serious about customer service, instead of hoping that customers won't notice that they didn't deliver on what they promised!"}
{"text":"I love going to Osmow's, but I was disappointed when the one on John Street was closed. I came to this location because it was the closest one in the area, but I was left even more disappointed. The food was very plain, as if I had no taste buds. I hope they do add more flavour into their food because it's hard finding Osmow's bear by."}
{"text":"came here since it has been pretty popular lately, and i ordered the chicken on the rocks as a friends recommendation. got a large size half rice half fries for 2 and it was huge we couldn't even finish it. rice and chicken and sauces were good, originally asked for mild but it was too little so i got the little spicy and it was good. the sauce is pretty intense spicy tho. the fries were ok, kinda cold when i got it. i had a glance of their takeout menu and i think their everyday special is the medium chicken on rocks? not 100% sure tho. it was good but just not as good as i thought since it has been so hyped up lately. i'd come back tho"}
{"text":"Went on the Sunday afternoon of their opening weekend. It was quite busy, but our orders were taken quickly and the staff was very friendly and welcoming.   I got the large chicken on rocks (rice) with the suicide level of spice (I hate my stomach lining) and the flavour and taste was consistent with all other Osmow's locations I've been to. If anything, the rice was fresher and more flavourful than other locations, but I just wish there was more of it. This Osmow's has just opened and it's already serving the small/stingy portion sizes of rice which caused me to stop going to other Osmow's locations.   When I pay $12 for a Large I really do expect a larger portion, but the amount of rice barely filled the lower half of the container and that was disappointing. I will give them the benefit of doubt that perhaps they were busier than they expected for their opening weekend and this caused them to have to \"ration\" the rice to make sure they filled alll orders quickly. I'll be back to give it another try eventually, and hopefully will report back happily!"}
{"text":"Hand downs one of the best shawarma places in the whole of Toronto been to multiple locations and always satisfied. Can be busy but the food is great and the portion is large too. Highly recommend the Chicken on the Rocks, be careful thou there Hot Sauce is legitimately hot, exercise caution with the heat"}
{"text":"These guys have moved to Queen and Bathurst, and I'm so glad. Super close to my work and live up to the reputation with ease. Went on the grand opening day by complete accident and was served fast and easy. Spice level seems to vary from other Osmow's I've been to, but not even a remote complaint, if you like spicy you may have to get hotter than usual."}
{"text":"Keeping my review short coz iv eaten at the same place in Brampton. I love Osmows in Brampton,  it is delicious but the same thing can be said here. Now I can watch my movies while eating on a shawarma than a subway sandwich haha. Oh did I say it was delicious? =)"}
{"text":"First time I ordered from osmows and was very disappointed. I usually love Osmows and last time I was here it was decent. This time however it was the first time I actually saw how lazy the person was. I Ordered 2 shawarmas.  I forgot to add fries and although he didn't finish making the wraps he looked at the deep fryer and told me he'll give it to me on the side... and I was the only customer there. Next their shawarmas are usually full but this one was like it was on a diet. Also they normally toast the bread, he just put the wraps on for a few seconds...the bread was cold and soggy. Lazy work=poor tasting food. Felt so very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma place! I came from Dubai and eating here brings back memories!"}
{"text":"This is of the worst Shawarma places in the 10 mile radius. Shawarma was tasteless, the cashier was very rude, I didn't feel like my presence in the place was really appreciated."}
{"text":"I visited the place recently, can't say i was impressed, the food by comparison to many other mid eastern joints around is very average. The staff seemed completely disinterested and poorly trained."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches, although I know what some of the reviewers mean about it not being authentic per se. Still it tastes really good, so it's definitely worth a trip every now and then :)"}
{"text":"This place has subpar shawarmas, takes a long time to get your order. My average wait time here has been roughly 10minutes at this place. Could use a bigger set up maybe with more efficiency. Hummus costs an extra .25 cents, be aware, unusually additional cost for these styles of places. Cost of a shawarma is about $5/6, and they don't pack it, very skinny wrap. The meat is fresh and tastes great tho. I wouldn't recommend siting down and eating it's too cramped, but defiantly grab and go style of place, but you will need to wait patiently. Multiple orders and plate orders beware as your order may not be done at the same time. I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, clean and spacious interior, and most of all a great menu. It's only my second time here but I've heard great things about Osmows in general. I ordered chicken on the rocks, both times - and this dish does live up to its hype! Beware though, their hot sauce is very hot.  Looking forward to many visits in the future!"}
{"text":"Asked for medium hot sauce and what they put on my wraps made them inedible and I am well used to all kinds of hot spicy food. I threw it out after 2 bites and my lips were still tingling 10 minutes later. Either the staff is incompetent or trying to piss people off. Better Sharwarma elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brand new spank'n restaurant beside Starbucks.  Almost three weeks old and the service and food is great.  The chicken schwarma is delicious and comes with choice of salad and fries or rice. The falafel is disc shaped and not the usual ball shaped that I'm familiar with but it tasted great along with the three varieties of hummus that it came with.    The service was good and they have sauces on the side for you to grab if you wanted more than what they put in your meal.   I'd come again for dinner anytime."}
{"text":"Food was okay. It's a small little fast-food restaurant with LOUD music. It's hard to have a conversation when there is loud music. As far as the food, the beef salad I had was okay but not worth $12 and the meat was dry. I can say that I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here before, tried the chicken on the rocks and it was pretty good. I went again today and was pretty disappointed. If this was my first time, I would give 1 or 2 stars, but I know they can do better.  It started off woth the cashiers, they aren't too friendly. Furthermore, roght after dealing with the money, I watched him go on to the back to work on the food without washing his hands. No gloves are used either when preparing food.   This time, the chicken on rocks seemed smaller. Despite getting a large, it was not that filling which is SO unusual. It was finished so quickly :(  The Kofta special had a tiny portion of (flavourless) meat and a little bit of rice to go with it. Would i pay $10.00 for that. Never again. Considering what I can get for that price elsewhere, I was pretty disappointed with that purchase."}
{"text":"Really great sized shawarmas at pretty great prices too! The super shawarma is perfect if you are sharing with someone and neither of you can really eat your own. The chicken is my favourite thing to get. Only thing I would say is that I hate having to pay extra for  tsatziki(sp?) and hummus."}
{"text":"Overall, it wasn't the quality of the food that lead to the average rating. One issue was the cramped space which did not bode well if lines were long. As a guest, it became apparent that this establishment was a hot spot and for good reason. The other issue was the difficulty in translating our order to the employee. Furthermore, some of the menu items such as the garlic bread aren't available even though they are listed so clarification of the menu and communication could have been better. Remember your drinks (pop) if you order them cause they might not place it with your order. Other than that, the food itself was really good."}
{"text":"I really love Chicken on the Rocks!! The chicken isn't dry, the rice isn't stale or tasteless, and the secret sauce taste really good with everything combined. Sometimes the secret sauce is overwhelming, nevertheless, it's still good. There is a surcharge if you use debit or credit which is pretty lame. Service is pretty fast and friendly. Chicken is grilled in front of you. Overall, I really enjoy Chicken on the Rocks."}
{"text":"got their daily special: chicken on the rocks for ~10$ and it was a large portion. It came with salad, rice , and chicken. the chicken pieces were tender. the flavouring was good. I've definitely had better but it's pretty good for a fast food joint"}
{"text":"A great place for Shawarma. This place is always busy and they are generous with the meat they use in all their dishes. They will 'spice' your orders to your specifications and the food here is always fresh. If you feel like Mediterranean cuisine and live in the Streetsville area, this is your best bet. Its great for take out, seating is limited here."}
{"text":"Lots of options. They even have philly cheese steak sandwich.  I had the shawarma. About $12 with tax including hummus which was extra.  It could have been tasty if they seasoned the meat better.    They nickle and dime you for things like pita wrap or hummus. Things that usually come included at other places.   They  said the sauce is spicy. When I asked if it was \"spicy for white people\", or \"spicy even for brown people\"? They said even for brown people. And the staff would know because they're brown too!!  They put a few drips on it and I have to admit it really hurt my tongue. And I'm west indian!!!!  Give it a try. You might like it."}
{"text":"What I like is the size of the portion, I have ordered Super chicken shawarma and was full half way.  What I do. It like is that the meat first roasted on vertical roster then on regular hot plate and then on another oven , eventually the meat is too dry to my liking. The only way to save it is to add more sauce.   Good to fill the belly. To enjoy the taste, need to check other places.    There is a note that say if you pay by card less then 10$ there is 35c charge."}
{"text":"My rating is not based solely on the food. The shawarmas at Osmows are just plain delicious, and solid 4 stars for food! Nice and saucy, flavorful meat and solid amount of toppings. I've been to many locations and the food is consistent across the board. In fact, this is my 2nd Osmows trip in 3 days. Sad, delicious, and true.  What concerns me is the overall lack of proper food handling and some standard restaurant basics. We went to this location today to pick up some wraps and I was not impressed. The guy making the sandwiches was not wearing gloves or hair net.  I understand the use of a baseball cap is supposed to act in place of the need for a hair net, but most people need more hair coverage than a hat can provide. He was also not wearing an apron which normally wouldn't bother me necessarily, but this guy was wearing shirt tucked into belt with his car keys dangling jauntily out of his pocket. So many issues there.  The guy running from grill to sandwich station was not dressed appropriately either. As he went from prepping salads to cooking meats then back again. There was also a bottle of windex and a rag sitting out on the service counter. I know that means they were probably making an attempt to clean something,  but you would never know it from the state the surfaces were in.   I know you're wondering why I would even eat there after feeling so bothered by the food handling, and I wonder that too sometimes. Honestly, I wanted my shawarma. Badly. Also, I remind myself that these things are happening in restaurant kitchens everywhere. The only difference being, we can't see them happening. Does that make it okay?  Certainly not. #rantover"}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Osmows locations and I would say this is one of the better locations. It certainly looked cleaner than most.   On a busy Friday at lunch, the line was a solid 8 people deep. But service was quick, food was delicious and fresh. The cashier was curt but efficient and realized quickly when my order was taking a while.  She reminded the cooks I was still waiting, which was great multitasking on her part.   Like the other Osmows locations, I found the food handlers could be better equipped to service the general public. I suggest hair nets and gloves would be a welcome addition to the uniform. If they're wearing the uniform at all.   Bottom line is, I'm very happy to see that Osmows has quickly become a GTA staple, but I urge the franchise owners to not lose sight of some basic standards."}
{"text":"Been letting a bit slip past these few times, but the last time I went here, I ordered a chicken shwarma. The gentlemen in front of me had changed his order and didn't want his chicken shwarma anymore... he made it specifically to what the gentlemen wanted...and I looked up at the workers...and in my head I was like oh helllll nawwww he's not gonna just pass over his chicken shwarma over to me....but guess what, he did! His coworker took over and started adding my \"selected\" toppings and added it in the same shwarma the other man didn't want. So while he continued to give the other man \"excellent\" service (because his fellow company was raving how good Osmow's was sooooo good), he continued to give me ruddy service. I really like the food here, and whatever, I accept the shwarma, because I didn't want it going to waste. But they also really need to start using gloves. As a nurse myself, I think that's super unhygienic esp. when they keep touching the tongs in the kitchen, and then dip their hands back into the lettuce and continue to stuff my shwarma.   I'm a fan of Osmow's, but honestly, this location needs to be more keen on cleanliness and service.   Really hoping for you guys to improve."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a quick bite, and ordered chicken shawarma meal. Was surprised by the poor wrapping technique, as soon as i opened it sauce spilled all over my sweater, wrap itself was not even close to being hot and fresh, while chicken was so dry that it was impossible to finish. Fries were pretty good though"}
{"text":"2.5 stars - massive portions still, but the flavouring for their chicken on the rocks is definitely off. The chicken wasn't seasoned at all, the rice wasn't the delicious garlic-y fluffiness I'm used to, and it was swimming in a sea of sauce. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely the type who drenches my food with sauce, but it felt like the whole thing was unseasoned.  It's the first time in a while I had to actually use the salt shaker so I wouldn't be eating bland spoonfuls one after the other. It was especially disappointing because I brought my boyfriend here who's a huge fan of shawarma and the food just wasn't up to standard. You're better off ordering from Taza, which definitely tastes better than this Osmow's.  If you don't enjoy bland chicken and rice, avoid this place. But if you're just looking for massive portions of food with no regard for taste, you're at the right spot."}
{"text":"I've never tried chicken on the rocks from Osmow's until today. Ordered it through UberEats actually - food arrived and looked amazing. But no cutlery or napkins? Luckily I was at home anyway so I managed to fix that problem, not sure what I'd do at work. Kinda defeats half the purpose of delivery - nonetheless it was still really good.   I ordered a large and it is super filling! I can never finish a large in one sit down, so I always end up saving the second half for later. The portion is totally worth your money!   This may be my new go to place for delivery whenever I am craving chicken on the rocks. If I'm up for a drive, I'd probably still head over to Lazeez!"}
{"text":"What kind of osmows does not offer pickles? Just because it's in a brampton locations where it's mostly brown people who don't fancy pickles doesn't mean that the entire rest of the population that lives here doesn't want that. Every osmows location has pickles, i demand pickles! Osmows should be consistent everywhere i don't want to look for their menu online before stepping out of my car, it's a hassle and inconvenient and they need to change that. I have 10 middle eastern friends who are all osmows fans and this location has definitely lost our business due to their no pickle policy."}
{"text":"They don't have pickles for their shawarma. Blasphemy. Who does that? Garlic and pickles go hand in hand."}
{"text":"\"Shawarma on the rocks\" with extra HOT sauce is sooo good! That made me want to come back again. The price is reasonable. The service is okay. The atmosphere is tight as the seating area is small."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner. It has limited seating but we managed to get a place . The wait for the food was long . If the wait wasn't so long I would have given it 4 stars. I really liked the food . It was fresh and flavourful. Will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"The customer service was really good! We were informed of the most popular dish across all their 55 locations in the GTA so I ended up getting that dish, the Chicken on The Rocks. First off, the position size is a lot! The flavour is good but it's just not as amazing as I expected after hearing so many good reviews on Osmow's. Also I taste too much bean in my chicken."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place much more than Pita Land. The chicken is always moist and the rice is fluffy. I didn't know at first that they have an \"extra meat\" option...but they do! Next time I'm trying chicken on the rocks with extra chicken, or in other words, heaven!"}
{"text":"Good food, descent price, generous portions. A definite must go to place. I ordered the chicken on stixx and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! If you like shawarma, chicken/beef, and garlic sauce this is definitely the spot! My brother introduced me to this shop and suggested to get the Chicken on the Rocks, which Is rice, chicken, and garlic sauce with hot sauce.  PERSONALLY... I avoid hot sauce because I am not a fan of sweating while I eat, but DAMN this hot sauce killed it!! It's no joke. I still enjoyed my food should of gotten less hot sauce but I made the choice to put more than usual.   The staff is friendly, one of them suggested I should try the chicken shawarma Sandwich and if I get it next time he'll make it SOOOO GOOD. The large is filling... it's a lot of food. I would of been perfect with a regular.   Overall first experience was great, will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Let's start from the beginning, shall we? I entered the restaurant and see two kinds of meats rotating on the spit/stand. It looked amazing, fresh and mouth watering.  I expressed to the young man taking my order that it is my first time at Osmow's and asked for his opinion and he basically told me to get the half and half (half rice and half fries) and when I asked about either chicken or beef, he said I could get both. (Cool, I thought, what a win...) He went through the sauces and I nodded at everything. He also asked if I wanted toppings for an extra charge. At this point I already see the 'credit card fee' and my pocket with plastic was already feeling sad. So I opted for no toppings because I'm already broke. And each topping was I think an additional 50 cents. When it came down to them actually preparing my food... Well... the meats they used for my meal came from a container (I assume of left overs - my taste buds would soon verify this) Both the chicken and beef wasn't carved from the stand they had rotating and glowing in front of my naive face. But still, l had high hopes... Then I sat down, opened the styrofoam container and seen a pool of sauces. Literally a pool.. I didn't even see the food drowning underneath. *OKAY THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAULT - For saying yes to the sauce, I just didnt think it would be that.. plentiful So I'm at my desk scooping as much sauce OFF as I possibly could with a fork, and start maneuvering through the chicken, beef, fries and rice. Here's my review on those: 1) Chicken - Tasted pretty dry and awful - had some bitter undertones that I couldn't understand where it came from 2) Beef - Tasted old and dry, but not as awful as the chicken 3) Rice - YUM! - When its not soaked in sauce 4) Fries - OK, HOW does one mess up on fries? Pretty basic item, but it was actually bad. Maybe it's the oil, maybe it's because it was cold and soggy from being smothered in sauce. Maybe... it was just BAD FRIES. (sigh - cant believe I'm putting those 2 words together) 5) Sauce - There was 2 different sauces plus a huge sprinkle of some type of red powder. No idea what it is (Osmow's rookie here). But I def suggest the garlic sauce ONLY and maybe go super light on the sauce Wow. This is probably the longest review I wrote. Order carefully and enjoy! I spent $14 on a medium disaster.  P.S. I feel dizzy after eating my meal. Probably should have stopped sooner... ughhh"}
{"text":"Best place to have Shawarma / Mediterranean quick food. Always takeout, small place to sit. Great taste. Love their Philly chicken steak sandwich.."}
{"text":"It's lit. Chicken on stix you can't go wrong. And THAT SPICY SAUCE IS SPICY, even just one drop is hella spicy."}
{"text":"Utterly and completely ridiculous. It took them 25 minutes to make 3 super shawarmas with NO crowd. I love Osmows but this experience has turned me off the entire chain for life. They legit STARTED making my shawarmas 20 minutes after my order was placed, and I can't stress this enough, there is NOBODY here. I'm seriously looking around to see if this is a prank or something."}
{"text":"Not impressed and will not return.  This was our first time at the Streeetsville location. We have been to the Milton location plenty of times and love it. It's a totally different atmosphere in Mississauga. The cashier was rude and not helpful. The restaurant is dirty and narrow. The walls were actually crusty.   We had the On The Rocks plate and the rice was under cooked. It was so crunchy that my husband cracked a tooth on an undercooked rice grain.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"So mad at this place. We drop in here often before a movie often. Except the first couple of times when we had great food (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), it's just been a struggle to get anything decent to eat here, or eat anything at all.  One time I went, and I asked for a hot shawarma (that's what I usually get). The new cook behind the counter kept puring hot sauce for many seconds till I asked him to stop and looked amazed at how much hot sauce he was putting. A couple of difficult bites later it went down the dustbin. I eat hot food, but have never had anything so hot that it was just bitter. Mouth on fire, I ran to get something cooling and sweet. That day I felt sick with just those few bites.  Setting that one experience aside thinking it was a one off, I went again. Asked for a veggie option for my mom, and they said they have nothing veggie. I saw some veggie stuff on the menu and asked them. The cook said he is new and doesn't know how to make most of the stuff on the menu!!!!! After that I was like whatever, let me just get 2 chicken shawarmas. And then, the lady behind the counter doesn't know how to operate the billing system so she's insisting I give her some random amount of cash! When I refused (since I had no cash), she kept beating the computer hard for a few minutes as though that would get it to work miraculously. After 5 minutes of her banging the computer, I had to leave with no food.  So all in all, untrained cooks, untrained staff, no quality control. What started out as a promising option for tasty fast food has soon become a nightmare. Not to mention that open garbage bags with unpleasant smells were lying in the small take out restaurant during two of my visits."}
{"text":"Worst sauce I've ever had in my life. Who likes sweet mayo on their shawarma??? This isn't even close to anything authentic. I have had shawarma in the Middle East and this is not shawarma. I suggest Ghadir in Scarborough if you're looking for autheticism. If you just want some gruel, knock yourself out!"}
{"text":"Out of this world!!! I'll definitely be back for a 3rd visit!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is my go to when i want something satisfying to eat at a good price.  I would say my favourite is the chicken on the rocks.  Their portion sizes are very good and fills you up.  If you are looking for fine dining with fancy drink, decor and servers. This is not it.  It is a local fast food franchise that caters to people who just want good food in a hurry without having to go Mcdonalds or Popeyes."}
{"text":"This is my spot. I drive 15km each way just to come here and I will continue to do so until the day I die. As a matter of fact, serve Chicken on the Stix at my funeral please.  My only complaint is that there are minor inconsistencies with the meat portion. Not a big enough deal to keep me away though.  Thank you Vick, Hanifa, and the rest of the staff!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the taste of osmos chicken shawarma. Make sure you have time because this place is always packed. Also the dine in section isn't too clean but whatever. Take it to go and eat your amazing shawarma"}
{"text":"HALAL  Food is good but I find it's not traditional and the service is just O.K. The only dish I really enjoy is the chicken on the rocks. They give a bed of rice in huge portions with chicken on top and then their special sauce which is the best part. This dish, is the only thing I get from them. The shawarma and other dishes aren't that great. Portions are good and the food is cooked well."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service. The owner \"John\" called me a liar for complaining about an order Foodora delivered.   The food looked worse than leftovers liked someone picked over this container. I asked for extra sauce and onions and this looked horrible.   \"John\" said he was too busy to speak with me about this and continuously spoke over me.   This is the worst service and food I have received from Osmow's and will continue to refuse people from coming here for just the reason."}
{"text":"My co worker brought one of these dishes served at osmows for me for lunch.  I asked him what is this called and he said chicken on the rocks.  From that day I'm hooked on this delicious dish.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Food is good same as all franchise locations the low rating is due to the rude and unprofessional cashiers at this location worst ordering experience"}
{"text":"First off let me say I've had Osmow's before.  I actually really like there Philly cheese steak... When it's done the way I like it to be.  The cashier took our order and punched it in, herself. She ends up being the person that made our food. Yes, the Philly cheese steak was fresh, so they get the 1 star there, but everything else goes down hill from there. The Philly cheese steak had condiments my boyfriend and I both did not order. She literally shoved in whatever she wanted into both our wraps... Also, they didn't give us an option with the usual sauces like other Osmow's when they're about to wrap up the pita or whatever. What's the point in asking me what I wanted in my pita if you're going to disregard everything .. in order to get the sauces, they charge an extra 50¢ per sauce... which other Osmow's clearly do not do. How can the service be so poor, epecially when it's not busy, and she had a computer screen infront of her face, orders that she punched in, and still make it wrong. She was also very stingy with the condiments she put in. And one thing that really disgusted me is how she was on cash and made our food right after without any gloves or washed her hands after she coughed in it and made our food.."}
{"text":"So one late afternoon, the hubby and I went to the Osmow's location in Richmond Hill to give it a try.  I was actually craving Greek food that day, but they were closed, so we decided to check out Osmow's.  It was pretty quiet when we arrived, but thats most likely because it was after the normal lunch hour.  We ordered one of their infamous chicken on the rocks, and a chicken shawarma sandwich (regular sized).  As we were waiting for our food, I noticed that they were not cutting the chicken off of the spit, but they were reheating chicken from one of those metal rectangular containers on their flat top.  I shrugged it off, thinking that it was because they wanted to make sure that the meat was hot for us.  We got our food shortly after, and I dug into my shawarma.  I noticed that the chicken did not have those crispy bits that usually you get from roasting on the spit.  I then took a look and noticed that the meat was this greyish colour.  All dark meat or just sitting meat?  Meat was also gristly.  I had to pick out pieces of fat and such.  To make it worse, as I was eating, I found a tomato stem in my sandwich.  No attention to prepping the food?  Also, as I was eating, I kept seeing the staff there shave meat off the spit to collect in those metal containers.  I thought maybe they had an order to fill?  Nope.  I don't get why they would take meat off the spit earlier than need be.  I tried their infamous chicken on the rocks.  I assumed it would be similar to New York's Chicken on Rice from the Halal Guys.  Boy was I wrong.  Again, topped with the same gristly chicken that I got in my shawarma, and the sauce tasted mostly of mayonnaise.  The rice was also super greasy.       Take a pass at Osmow's Grill.  I don't know if it's because they are franchised and thats why there is no quality control there.  Maybe other locations taste better?  I don't know, but I'd honestly rather eat anywhere but here....."}
{"text":"Came here just for takeout and the service was rude and unprofessional. We ordered the chicken on the rocks which we usually do however it ended up giving everyone a bad stomach ache the following morning. Used to enjoy coming here but quality has diminished."}
{"text":"Chicken on Sticks was the thing I never thought I needed. Fresh and hot fries, covered with seasoned chicken and garlic sauce is a mediterranean twist on a poutine lover's dream. It can considered pricey though and will set you back about $15 for a large, but it's so worth it.  Service is quick and fast, so don't expect much in terms of that as it's basically a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Small and busy location with two tables and some counter seating - just something to keep in mind cause you might not find a seat to dine in. They workers are really fast and friendly here and the food is delicious as always. I'm not a fan of traditional shwarma, but I do love me some chicken on stix."}
{"text":"I consider Osmow's as my second best shawarma restaurant in the GTA based on my last experience (#1 best is Lazeez, obviously). The reason for my rating of 3 stars is because of the inconsistency i've experienced. I have probably been to Osmow's Courtney park at least 5 to 6 times. The last time I went, the shawarma was warm and tasty and the service was friendly and not too slow.  But my previous visits have involved an extremely long wait, rude employees, and cold wraps despite them warming it up in the toaster. Also, their hot sauce spice level varies, as once I got the medium heat and it was extremely hot, while the other time I could barely taste any spice at all. During my most recent experience there, i'm assuming the service was faster and friendlier since it wasn't too busy, and thereby they also made the food with more care. So, in conclusion, I would recommend Osmow's when it isn't too crowded, during which the shawarma is more likely to be up to their potential. An advice: keep in mind that their wraps tend to fall apart due to their heavy-hand with the sauces, especially the garlic sauce and they do not have plates. So ask for less sauce if you want to spare your clothes."}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks really rocks! Very cheap, yet delicious. Never will stop coming here."}
{"text":"Very limited seating. Parking can be troublesome as it's on a narrow busy street. I've heard great things about their Chicken on the Rocks and I was certainly not disappointed when I tried it myself. My first order was without any hot sauce and it was delicious.   Came by a second time and tried it again with their highest hotness level which included hot sauce and powder. I can usually hold my spice but man one spoonful made my mouth burn. It took me a few days to finish it since the hotness made me lose my appetite after a few bites. I wouldn't recommend anyone eat it with the highest level of spiciness. You really can't taste any chicken, garlic sauce, or rice at this level as you're basically eating spoonfuls of hot pepper."}
{"text":"Good food here usually get the chicken on the rocks or chicken salad. Really good stuff here. Large portions and reasonable prices.  When we're feeding more than two well add a falafel platter.  Also, when they ask for how spicy be careful the hot is actually hot.  So if you're not into spice get mild. We like our food spicy and mild is just right."}
{"text":"This is easily the best osmows location. The staff knows what they're doing and their food is delicious. Very good garlic sauce (ask for extra if you get a shawarma) Overall: Food= 4.5/5 Atmosphere= 3/5 Service= 4/5"}
{"text":"Really slow wait times for the chicken shawarma meat (10-15 mins). Fries and rice have to sit there as you wait.  Best to call ahead and ask for pickup.  Very friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Great service and the taste is amazing!  I'm impressed how the service is still outstanding despite being busy all the time (and I never get a chance to sit down because it is busy).  I am not a huge fan of a lot of sauce on my chicken on the rocks (even though it's delicious)  so I always take it home right after and add more rice to it or transfer the sauce on the salads at home."}
{"text":"Been looking for this place and FINALLY FOUND IT! Friends would bring chicken on the rocks from sauga but never new from where exactly (probably Osmow's Sauga location...). Place is a bit small...two tables for 2 people per table plus 5 to 6 bar stools table againts the window. Food is great!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of this chain for the longest time from the original location located in Streetsville I went by today in order to chicken shawarma sandwich and I tell you it was just bad improperly packed where all the meat was in the middle and the condiments were on the ends I tell you that this place is actually going downhill in a steady stream"}
{"text":"Second time I made visit at this same location. It's hard to find anywhere close in my area. All I have to say is they haven't progress from the first time I came here. Being the first time, when they just opened. I always order the \"Everyday Special\" $9.50 Plus tax which comes to $10.75. The picture doesn't show justice to how much of a rip off you get with the money you pay for. The special state medium on the rocks with side salad. The container is barely a scoop of rice and spread around salad. Horrible I would suggest this location to anyone. Clarkson Osmows is bad experience. Please don't waste your money and time. The man serving has a bad attitude. I give this location negative 5 star. Very sloppy and bad customer service. Too bad I really like Osmows. But not this location at Clarkson"}
{"text":"The best Shawarma in town. Daily special with salad and on the rocks deal. Amazing! Need to update their time on Saturdays. They open at 11am Saturday morning not 10:30am as advertise on Yelp."}
{"text":"The food here reminds me of what you'll find in stands littered across New York. Think the Halal Guys in NY but arguably better. Chicken is less dry and not overly diced up compared to Halal Guys. It's also halal for whom it matters to.   A solid 3.5 stars but deserves a little bump to balance the reviews I see so far. It's yummy but not what I usually crave for. Something about the sauciness makes it junk food and if I'm gonna indulge I might as well go all out with something I love. It's a cheap grab and go joint so I wouldn't expect too much.   It's conveniently located for students at UTSC. You can feed two people on a large box for as little as $10. The workers here are little sloppy though with their shirts all stained but I'm not complaining.   Ordered $10 for Large Chicken on the Rocks (diced chicken on a bed of buttery rice with special white sauce with little spice) - Can feed 2 people - I usually take medium spice in Asian/thai restaurants but a \"little bit\" of spice here is quite spicy. They place the hot sauce on top for you but it's not spread into the plate so you can use with caution.  Sauce on the side will cost extra"}
{"text":"I've had chicken on the rocks (chicken on rice, with the sauce on top) and chicken on the sticks (same thing, but french fries), and i've had their shawarma. Everything that I have had there has been delicious and very tasty. Their prices are really good too! The people there are awesome and usually really friendly. It's a really good quick eats place but just a warning, you will feel super fill after so might consider getting the smaller sized container over the big one the first time."}
{"text":"Step 1: Go to Osmow's  Step 2: Order the Chicken on the Rocks  Step 3: Fall in love  Step 4:  Come back and order it again & again & gain lots of weight.  Step 5: Spend your family's life savings on this addiction  Step 6: Seek help."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken on the Rocks/Stix, same good quality as the other Osmow's locations. The only tip I would give is to be easy with the hot sauce. I asked for two lines, took it home and realized they gave me 5! I could hardly eat it!"}
{"text":"Worst Osmow's location! Do not go here whatever you do. Horrible customer service and the wraps here barely have any sauce in them even if you ask for extra.  The best location is in Brampton at Chrystler Drive and Williams Pkwy."}
{"text":"Their food ok but not that great. So overrated.  I had way better shawarma at different restaurants than here."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place but had not come by in a good year or so. I went by yesterday to grab a meal and was not happy at all. I got the chicken on the rocks with half fries and half rice. The rice was so bland and over cooked. The chicken was okay - seasoning was not good. The only thing I liked about this meal was the sauce and the fries. I was quite disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Delicious, better than Halal Guys! Ordered on Ritual and the food was bagged and ready when I arrived :D Amazing portions for the price, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but I cannot handle the VERY SLOW service. I have been to this location 3 times (it's close to my work) and I have gone at different times and it does not fail that every time I go, I wait close to 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! That is insane.   It's NOT a good option for lunch because not only are you hungry you are waiting forever. Porta Via on Eglinton is always packed and I do not spend more than 10 minutes in that restaurant.  They really need to figure out an assembly line or some time management skills. I love osmow's but I will not be back"}
{"text":"I love Osmow's. Probably one of the only shawarma places that I go to. I usually visit the Lakeshore location but either or is great.  I am a fan of how large the shawarmas are and the delicious fresh rice or french fries that you can get. All the ingredients are fresh, tasteful and made to order.  I love their garlic sauce too- I can even get it on the side.   The chicken is also perfectly seasoned and is not overpowering yet still noticeable.  Always coming back here, :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were both craving chicken on the rox (our favourite), and our craving was def. satisfied. Only reason I had to update my review was that the quality is not the same as how it was before. Being a frequent customer, it has really changed, also, service needs to improve."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love Osmow's, especially chicken on the rox. However, this location was okay, I prefer the Scarborough location.  First of all, the location is the biggest one I have been to, there are many tables where you can actually sit down and enjoy. It looked clean the day I went. Service was okay, not the best. Kind of slow, however they were being nice.   The food was good, just the way I like it, HOWEVER, the portions are ridiculous!! The prices are the same, however if I were to get the same thing at the Scarborough location, they pack it up. They give the smallest portion in such a big box.. disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 5-6 years and the new owner is rude as f*ck she doesn't know how to speak to her customers. we ordered a super philly cheese steak sandwich and requested it to be cut in half and she denied doing so. After requesting a few times she finally did it. Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly underwhelming in the flavour department and overwhelming in the bad hygiene department .............I ordered the chicken shawarma on sticks (French fries) and two shawarmas which had little to no flavour and I ordered the hot expecting to have some type of kick also I found a BEARD HAIR in the sauce to add to my not so wonderful experience ......When I got there three men were working on the food no beard nets no hair nets and no gloves the one kept coming back and forth dealing with customers and money and then touching and serving food with no washing of the hands . If your into flavourless food seasoned with human hair this place is the spot for you unfortunately I won't be returning R.I.P to the $27.95 I won't see again thanks Osmow's maybe take that money and buy some hairnets and gloves so others won't have the same experience"}
{"text":"Was  in the area last year  waiting for a friend before a movie and decided to try a chicken shawerma.   It was decent but not exactly mindblowing . I have had shawermas where the chicken is soft and pita bread warm and fresh. Everything felt rushed and I felt the focus was more on clearing the line than pleasing the customer"}
{"text":"The food was good but I'm taking points away due to the long wait times . Came in  for a shawerma  sandwich had to wait nearly  10 minutes  to  get served  and another 6 to recieve my food because they r limited to one till and a cashier with  just two  staff manning the table .  At other shawerma places I only have to  wait five minutes  at the maximum for my food .If such long lineups are a  regular occurrence then I highly recommend  using a larger space and adding an extra cash register.    If people have to wait so long for their food they night as well head somewhere else  and get the same food much quicker.   Even the CNE  has more staff on hand to handle long lineups fast .  I doubt I will be back unless I am in the area and look to see if the  lineup is ( 1 or two people instead of 5 to 10)  short or my friends want  to dine in and disregard the long waits .  Long waits are not acceptble especially for students  coming here between classes or heading home as it takes away from their study time . Now for the  food.  I got a chicken shawerma sandwich  . The sandwich was quite filling with a decent amount of meat and vegetables . The pita was  soft but firm  enough to.hold the contents ."}
{"text":"There are a couple of negatives to this place - the service is pretty slow, the restaurant itself is small, and placing a pick up order does nothing because they never start making it until you get there anyways, but all in all, it is THE BEST falafel wrap I have ever had. I would really recommend going here if you're in the mood for good Middle Eastern cuisine, because this place absolutely nails it."}
{"text":"Im going to start off and say im not usually one to complain about restaurants, I'm a server and have worked in food for 4 years and I know how difficult customers can be. Also I do love the food at Osmows, but my experience at this establishment was terrible. First off, I tried calling the restaurant beforehand to place an order, their phones don't work. Second, the guy at the counter told me that they ran out of beef, no problem I'll just order the chicken then... And then he gets my order wrong. When I finally get my meal, I check to see if it's okay before I leave and they literally gave me no meat. I complain to the girl at the counter saying that there isn't enough chicken and all she says is \"we give one scoop\". Seriously? The meat doesn't even cover the top. I've eaten at at least 4 other Osmows location and they were never as skimpy as this place. Not only that, their sauce portioning is horrid. You'd think that if they were going to be cheap on the meat they would at least try to cover it up with more sauce, but no. And if I really wanted to be petty, I would bring up the fact that their menus on the TV's are covered by a notice from their provider saying they haven't paid for their IP address :-) anyways, don't waste your money here, I definitely won't be coming back. Do yourself a favour and drive an extra 10 minutes to the next location."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I like the food here.  I had the falafel special and the rice is tasty along with the falafel.  I like how you can do half and half which means half rice half fries on your meal but the portion is more like 1/4 fries and the rest is rice.  Still a great place for some good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this Osmow's if you've been to any other Osmow's or Lazeez in the city. I've been to other Osmow's and Lazeez over 50+ times in the last few years and have never had food quality or service like this one.  I complained that my Large Chicken on the Rocks with pop ($15) was cold, and here's what happened:  1. Manager put his fork in my food and pulled some fries out, then touched them and asked me to touch them to show me that it wasn't \"cold\" like I had mentioned. I asked for him to warm it up and he gave me some excuse about fries vs. rice that I didn't understand.  2. I just came from a 12-hour shift and said screw it, I'm hungry and am not going to argue with this guy.   3. ME: After a few minutes, I had lost my appetite and was eating by force. That's when I had enough and told him that it was rude to pull the fries out and ask me to touch them like I'm a kid and don't know what cold food feels like or that I was lying or had bad intentions.  4. MANAGER: I can't give you another meal since it costs me $11 to make each one. It must also be the garlic sauce you're tasting that's cold because we just pulled it out of the fridge. Shawarma maker next to him puts the bottle in my face, I touch it and he's right - it was ice cold.   5. ME: So you can't warm it up for me, you can't make me another one and that's it? I don't want you to throw it away, I wanted a fresh and hot one and you gave me no options. You could have asked me to pay full price for another one and made sure it was hot. I'm the customer and the one who's paying for this meal, why are you telling me that the food is cold if I'm the one eating it and unhappy?  6. MANAGER: He shrugged his shoulders.  7. ME: I then mentioned that I saw a review from a few months ago on Yelp who said their meal was also cold, that's when he lost it and just didn't want to talk to me.  I said thank you and walked out."}
{"text":"Do the owners care to know how the store is operating? We ordered 2 large chicken on the sticks on a Wednesday evening and the last to get it after complaining that we had been waiting for over 15 minutes.   If you're not going to put at least 1 guy or girl who knows how to run the store, your employees will screw up and not know why.   3 stars because I've never had a problem with the food. It'll change to 5 if they train their staff ways to be efficient and learn to track orders."}
{"text":"Would give less than 1 star if it was possible.  Every time I go to Osmows, its the same thing. Order, wait for 30+ minutes for a sharwma, regardless of how busy it was. Me and my friend were literally the only customers, more and more people started coming after. Waited 35 minutes for one single sharwma. Ridiculous. Its' not like the food is amazing either... They cheap out on the chicken when it comes to sharwmas. Literally looks like a churro compared to other sharwma joints.  I would've recommended Lazeez a few months ago, but they're pretty garbage now themselves.  Never going to Osmows again. \"Mississauga's best sharwama\", what a joke."}
{"text":"I crave Osmow's constantly! I go for their Chicken on the Rocks, very heavy, tons of sauce and oh so good. Chicken on sticks (fries instead of rice) is also very good. I recommend getting the combo of both if you have someone to split it with."}
{"text":"Decent shawarmas, well priced but the facility is quite run down there is never any parking and the location is too small and always very crowded. Cleanliness isnt their highest priority."}
{"text":"First time to this location and here's the rundown:  QUALITY I ordered the lamb kofta and beer kofta dinner with rice and a garden salad.  The garden salad was dry and slightly bland.  The rice was good.  The kofta itself was a little overdone and dry.  The portion was standard with a bed of rice and two skewers on top.   The flavour was good.    PRICE Expensive.  Average cost for such dinners are at most $13 max.  I don't mind paying the $16-17 but the quality made it disappointing.  SERVICE Excellent!  Lady at the cash was friendly, acknowledged me and took care of me from when I entered till I left the door.  Overall, I wouldn't return back merely the value of the meals are quite pricey."}
{"text":"Worst location out of all the osmows I have been to. I went three times and the sauce is between the pita instead of being put on the ingredients. They are very stingy with ingredients compared to any other location. I am very disappointed bc usually i love Osmow's restaurant"}
{"text":"They used to cook their chicken well until their business started booming and during rush hour where they will undercooked the chicken. This is still my favorite osmow but today on March 22nd I got explosive diarrhea after eating here and I know this because I didn't eat anything else all day"}
{"text":"Terrible Customer service and they have an extra charge for just about everything you want. Its sad to see one Osmows location doing so badly and ruining the reputation of other locations."}
{"text":"It is good taste Shawerma, NO family meal Bad customer service from the owner her myself as I asked her the the potato container were not full but she did not care in addition they refused to cut the 12\" in half but they refused. BAD hospitality and it is not suitable for more than 4 persons as the tables only for 4 and no roam to combined them I gave 2stars for food only, other than this is bad I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever had in my entire life.. disgusting. No flavour, barely any meat, mixed up orders, and very COLD.. horrible service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Osmow's and was super excited to find out there was one close to home. I typically have gone to the Courtney Park and Queen st. location. I picked up dinner for my family and was extremely disappointed. I have always eaten chicken on the rocks, one of their most popular dishes. The rice was overcooked and mushy, the chicken was crumbled bits vs. slices of shawarma, and they didn't spice it as I had requested, although mentioning I had eaten it many times before. It was a gloppy mess. Will not be eating at this location again."}
{"text":"The food is awful. Chicken on the rocks is basically some very poorly seasoned chicken drenched in a blanket of mayo it's really horrible. The menu isn't even appealing there are other better places to go for middle eastern or Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Decent Mediterranean fast food. The fries and shwarma were a large portion. The wrap was also a good size. The greek salad was a bit wilted and not so fresh. The most disappointing was the taboule salad. It looked like it came out of some prepackaged container. Mostly onions and it was leaking through the takeout box it came in. I also didn't notice the guy prepping the food  wearing any gloves. Overall flavor was average."}
{"text":"I walked by outside once with Superwoman, and she was attracted by the sight of the meat roasting near the window.  Upon walking in though, there was no delicious aroma of roasting meat in there (and it's a teeny, tiny space!), so I pulled her out of there.  I mean, how good could it taste if all it smelled like when we walked in was frying oil?  Then a few weeks later, I was badly craving Halal Guys chicken & rice from Manhattan.  But I wasn't in Manhattan, so what was I to do?  I took to Yelp to find something similar.  That was when I learned about their chicken on the rocks.  Since it was close by, I decided to go there and give it a try.  It was just alright.  The rice kind of tasted like Uncle Ben's - it was really hard and had that instant rice flavour.  I was hoping for basmati.   The chicken was alright but the spices didn't taste like anything - they weren't very distinct, and they were only so-so in terms of tastiness.  The sauces were okay - but could be more flavourful.  Perhaps they toned down the flavours to suit local palates.  This was just as unremarkable as the place on Yonge, except the owner at the Yonge & Gerrard joint is more fun."}
{"text":"Place just opened up recently in Markham.must say, lives up to the quality of other Osmows. The place was extremely busy on a Friday, but got the food in a good amount of time. Chicken on the Stix is where it's at."}
{"text":"Finally found a good place near home to grab a quick bite. I usually get the falafel, but the hubby and son says the beef shawarma is fantastic!  Careful, cause hot sauce is very hot"}
{"text":"Not a lot to cover here as I'm sure most of us has now had a Shawarma or two in our lives.  Osmow's, I believe is a new chain and purveyor of mid-east food.  This franchise is located the large Loblaws mall located on Bayview, north of Hwy7.  Parking is not too difficult in this large mall that has many quick-serves such as Pizza Pizza, Tim Hortons, Baskin Robbins and Stabucks.    I wanted something fast and not the usual burgs/za stuff.  Found myself here and after seeing a few locations about town and ignoring all the negative reviews, I went in.  The place has a small seating location as you walk in.  The counter was cluttered with pre-opened paper bags and three young staffs.  I ordered their small chicken shawarma wrap.  I was recommended the large - is it better margins or are you implying that I have a \"large\" appetite...hmmm...?  I didn't want to go all in with the meal.  Especially since the food prep area was not clean and the clothing that the guy and two gals were wearing was covered in residue of some sort.  It's an open kitchen, you really need to up the cleanliness game - or do what Tasty's does and close off the kitchen.  What I don't know might still kill me but I won't Yelp about it!  Lots of toppings were offered, I chose what I liked, paid my less than $10 bucks and off I went back to the condo to try the fare.  Nothing spectacular.  The spices on the chicken were pretty good, the veggies and dressing was adequate and the meal was done in short order.  The small wrap was more than sufficient for a simple meal.  At 2.5 stars, it's a take it or leave it affair.  I would probably go back to Tasty's or an overpriced Me-Va-Me.  Cheers."}
{"text":"i was super excited to come to this location to try it out, as i will try any shawarma place possible, this location didn't hit the mark at all. being brand new meant that this place was extremely clean and bright, i was a little bit intrigued by how the pricing was so average in comparison to other places but the portion sizing was massive. when my order was being placed I understood how this was the case. some toppings were free of charge and almost every sauce was additional money at the price of 75cents per sauce, needless to say I was completely turned off by this place at this point. the portions are great in size, the service is good, but I will not support a location that nickel and dimes you for every possible option available.  the quality of the food was ok, I'd be willing to come back and see how the \"on the rocks\" option would be, but probably not this location.  also if you sit by the front of the restaurant it is extremely drafty which i know could be a problem for a lot of potential future customers.  street parking is available if you can find it, with some underground locations present. and transit options are the 501 queen directly, the 511 Bathurst with a bit of a walk, and the 510 spadina with an even longer walk.  not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"This place needs a thorough cleaning! The drawer where napkins are kept right behind the cash register is filthy."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5 outta 5. Though I love the food here the atmosphere is so cramped at this tiny Streetsville location. Apparently they have 7 locations, including a new one being renovated in the Cineplex Courtney Park Plaza. I'm super excited about this.  I almost always get \"chicken on the rocks\" which is a bunch of rice with the chicken on top drenched in all of the sauces. Sounds weird but it's SO delicious. I always go late at night so it is always packed but very worth the wait.  This place is more a take out than a dine in place. There is a back door that patrons can go through and when I dined in the one time with my friend the cold air kept rushing in :(  Will always come back here."}
{"text":"I normally go to the location on lake shore but I was in the area of Streetsville and decided to grab a quick lunch from a familiar spot. BAD DECISION! This location is disgusting and smelt like wet dog. There were boxes flattened on the floor to soak up water... obviously the staff were too lazy to mop or dry up the place.  Worst of all had to be the service. The woman who took my order was obnoxious and rude. When I asked a question about the menu she rudely responded \"can you just follow my instructions\". Management if you read these reviews FIRE HER IMMEDIATELY!!! That woman must have gotten the job through a friend because no sane person would have that lady as the greeter in any business.  I'm honestly not one to complain about service but this woman was sincerely that brutal. Walk in with caution... try to avoid this location. It's unfortunate that the people here were able to ruin such a yummy meal."}
{"text":"My go-to spot whenever I'm craving chicken and rice (since Halal Guys is too far) and it always hits the spot! The chicken on the rocks is my all time favourite, with little spice (their hot sauce is super spicy!!) and extra garlic sauce. Wish this place was around when I went to school right by this plaza!"}
{"text":"First time trying Osmow's and I actually like it! There's a location near my area so I decided to give it a try. You can eat there as well but it's more of a take-out place since they serve it in the styrofoam box. I went here on a weekend night and it wasn't busy at all. Ordered the regular chicken on the stix and the portion was pretty big. I thought the sauce was gonna be too much but it was good for the fries. I got medium spicy (which is about 2-3 lines) and it was a bit too spicy for me but still manageable. The person in front of me ordered extra spicy which is crazy! The chicken was a LITTLE BIT dry but the flavour made up for it. Prices are okay, my order, which is one of the cheaper options on the menu, came up to around $12. Would definitely keep coming here when I'm craving some good Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"So I was visiting Scarborough today and saw Osmows. Went in to grab some lunch. As I was ordering, I asked if I can use the restroom. The cashier said they don't have one and suggested I go next door to Popeyes, which was odd, but I went. I came back and ordered my food, \"Chicken on the Rocks\". The charge seemed a little higher than competitors, but whatever. When I pulled out my credit card to pay, she said there will be a surcharge for me to use a card. Really??? Ridiculous ! Anyway, I let it go. When I opened up the container of food, I was disappointed with the quantity. I have had Osmows before at Mississauga. The quantity of food is no where close to being the same. They are spoiling the franchise name here in Scarborough. So, with no restrooms, surcharge on credit cards, and shorting the customer on food quantity; I suggest that corporate Osmows should look into this franchise and get them to fix them selves ."}
{"text":"So I went there last night for the first time after hearing about it from a friend. At first I got really excited to see such a huge line. I knew if it were so many people there, it must be out of the world. Believe me, it took me 55 minutes to get my order from the minute I placed the order. I did not see any sense of urgency amongst the staff. They were nice but there was literally one girl dispatching orders. I mean with so many orders, how can you have one person pushing out the orders.  I suggest you all go to lazeez on credit view road. They are much quicker and equally good. No difference at all. They are super fast in pushing out the orders."}
{"text":"I regularly eat my chicken shawarma' sat Pita & Grill in Mississauga on Dixie and Eglington, but was to far, and reading the reviews on Yelp, decided to find something closer to home.  This restaurant got great reviews, so I made the trek. I was not disappointed as the line was heading out the door; and there were 2 sizes the regular it the super. I ordered the super chicken shawarma and it was beautiful, but was little light on the chicken, but Taste was still there.  I will definitely go again, but will try the Philly cheese steak shawarma as this was well ordered item in the line up. I would have gave it the full 5 stars, but the 5 or 6 tables were all dirty. Not one was clean; even though there were literally 7 people working the grill."}
{"text":"Hubby and I checked this place out for lunch today. It was my first time trying out this mediterranean chain of restaurants.  We both decided to get the ever so popular chicken shawarma. I got the chicken on the rocks with half greek salad which is chicken shawarma on top of rice topped with Osmow's famous sauce. I got the medium size and it was an ample amount of food. The greek salad was dressed in a tangy lemony vinaigrette which I really enjoyed. The rice was soft, fluffy, and buttery and the perfect base for the well seasoned chicken shawarma. The meat was a good mix of crispy pieces and juicy meat and coated in the Osmow sauce. I felt the sauce was a little heavy on the mayo side and it could of been more garlicky. Also they have a heat level which you can pick from for the amount of hot sauce you want on your food. The cashier warned us it was very spicy so I got \"a little bit spicy\" but I felt I could of gone up 1 or 2 more levels as it wasn't spicy enough for me but I can handle heat well.  Hubby got the half / half chicken which is chicken shawarma on top of half rice and half fries and topped with Osmow's famous sauce. Hubby also got the medium size which was also very filling for him. He thought the heat level of a little bit spicy was spot on for him and he loved the osmow sauce. His fries were made to order and he ate them all first and I was too caught up in my own meal to get to steal one but he said they were pretty tasty. His food was also a perfect split of fries and rice.  There are a few tables if you want to dine in but most people were coming for take out. All the staff here were pretty new and some were still being trained. The cashier took a while to punch in our order as he is still getting the hang of using the register system and our food took about 10 minutes to prepare but it was flavourful and hot. It seems they still have some kinks to work out as they are new but for sure we would come back for the chicken shawarma!"}
